<center>CHILOE AND CHONOS ISLANDS</center>

<p><i>November 10th.</i>&mdash;The <i>Beagle</i> sailed from
Valparaiso to the south, for the purpose of surveying the southern
part of Chile, the island of Chiloe, and the broken land called the
Chonos Archipelago, as far south as the Peninsula of Tres Montes.
On the 21st we anchored in the bay of S. Carlos, the capital of
Chiloe.</p>

<p>This island is about ninety miles long, with a breadth of rather
less than thirty. The land is hilly, but not mountainous, and is
covered by one great forest, except where a few green patches have
been cleared round the thatched cottages. From</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 291">page 291</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>a distance the view somewhat resembles that of Tierra del Fuego;
but the woods, when seen nearer, are incomparably more beautiful.
Many kinds of fine evergreen trees, and plants with a tropical
character, here take the place of the gloomy beech of the southern
shores. In winter the climate is detestable, and in summer it is
only a little better. I should think there are few parts of the
world, within the temperate regions, where so much rain falls. The
winds are very boisterous, and the sky almost always clouded: to
have a week of fine weather is something wonderful. It is even
difficult to get a single glimpse of the Cordillera: during our
first visit, once only the volcano of Osorno stood out in bold
relief, and that was before sunrise; it was curious to watch, as
the sun rose, the outline gradually fading away in the glare of the
eastern sky.</p>

<p>The inhabitants, from their complexion and low stature, appear
to have three-fourths of Indian blood in their veins. They are an
humble, quiet, industrious set of men. Although the fertile soil,
resulting from the decomposition of the volcanic rocks, supports a
rank vegetation, yet the climate is not favourable to any
production which requires much sunshine to ripen it. There is very
little pasture for the larger quadrupeds; and in consequence, the
staple articles of food are pigs, potatoes, and fish. The people
all dress in strong woollen garments, which each family makes for
itself, and dyes with indigo of a dark blue colour. The arts,
however, are in the rudest state;&mdash;as may be seen in their
strange fashion of ploughing, their method of spinning, grinding
corn, and in the construction of their boats. The forests are so
impenetrable that the land is nowhere cultivated except near the
coast and on the adjoining islets. Even where paths exist, they are
scarcely passable from the soft and swampy state of the soil. The
inhabitants, like those of Tierra del Fuego, move about chiefly on
the beach or in boats. Although with plenty to eat, the people are
very poor: there is no demand for labour, and consequently the
lower orders cannot scrape together money sufficient to purchase
even the smallest luxuries. There is also a great deficiency of a
circulating medium. I have seen a man bringing on his back a bag of
charcoal, with which to buy some trifle, and another carrying a
plank to exchange for a bottle of wine. Hence every tradesman must
also be</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 292">page 292</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>a merchant, and again sell the goods which he takes in
exchange.</p>

<p><i>November 24th.</i>&mdash;The yawl and whale-boat were sent
under the command of Mr. (now Captain) Sulivan to survey the
eastern or inland coast of Chiloe; and with orders to meet the <i>
Beagle</i> at the southern extremity of the island; to which point
she would proceed by the outside, so as thus to circumnavigate the
whole. I accompanied this expedition, but instead of going in the
boats the first day, I hired horses to take me to Chacao, at the
northern extremity of the island. The road followed the coast;
every now and then crossing promontories covered by fine forests.
In these shaded paths it is absolutely necessary that the whole
road should be made of logs of wood, which are squared and placed
by the side of each other. From the rays of the sun never
penetrating the evergreen foliage, the ground is so damp and soft,
that except by this means neither man nor horse would be able to
pass along. I arrived at the village of Chacao shortly after the
tents belonging to the boats were pitched for the night.</p>

<p>The land in this neighbourhood has been extensively cleared, and
there were many quiet and most picturesque nooks in the forest.
Chacao was formerly the principal port in the island; but many
vessels having been lost, owing to the dangerous currents and rocks
in the straits, the Spanish government burnt the church, and thus
arbitrarily compelled the greater number of inhabitants to migrate
to S. Carlos. We had not long bivouacked, before the barefooted son
of the governor came down to reconnoitre us. Seeing the English
flag hoisted at the yawl's masthead, he asked with the utmost
indifference, whether it was always to fly at Chacao. In several
places the inhabitants were much astonished at the appearance of
men-of-war's boats, and hoped and believed it was the forerunner of
a Spanish fleet, coming to recover the island from the patriot
government of Chile. All the men in power, however, had been
informed of our intended visit, and were exceedingly civil. While
we were eating our supper, the governor paid us a visit. He had
been a lieutenant-colonel in the Spanish service, but now was
miserably poor. He gave us two sheep, and accepted in return two
cotton handkerchiefs, some brass trinkets, and a little
tobacco.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 293">page 293</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>25th.</i>&mdash;Torrents of rain: we managed, however, to run
down the coast as far as Huapi-lenou. The whole of this eastern
side of Chiloe has one aspect; it is a plain, broken by valleys and
divided into little islands, and the whole thickly covered with one
impervious blackish-green forest. On the margins there are some
cleared spaces, surrounding the high-roofed cottages.</p>

<p><i>26th.</i>&mdash;The day rose splendidly clear. The volcano of
Orsono was spouting out volumes of smoke. This most beautiful
mountain, formed like a perfect cone, and white with snow, stands
out in front of the Cordillera. Another great volcano, with a
saddle-shaped summit, also emitted from its immense crater little
jets of steam. Subsequently we saw the lofty-peaked
Corcovado&mdash;well deserving the name of "el famoso Corcovado."
Thus we beheld, from one point of view, three great active
volcanoes, each about seven thousand feet high. In addition to
this, far to the south there were other lofty cones covered with
snow, which, although not known to be active, must be in their
origin volcanic. The line of the Andes is not, in this
neighbourhood, nearly so elevated as in Chile; neither does it
appear to form so perfect a barrier between the regions of the
earth. This great range, although running in a straight north and
south line, owing to an optical deception always appeared more or
less curved; for the lines drawn from each peak to the beholder's
eye necessarily converged like the radii of a semicircle, and as it
was not possible (owing to the clearness of the atmosphere and the
absence of all intermediate objects) to judge how far distant the
farthest peaks were off, they appeared to stand in a flattish
semicircle.</p>

<p>Landing at midday, we saw a family of pure Indian extraction.
The father was singularly like York Minster; and some of the
younger boys, with their ruddy complexions, might have been
mistaken for Pampas Indians. Everything I have seen convinces me of
the close connexion of the different American tribes, who
nevertheless speak distinct languages. This party could muster but
little Spanish, and talked to each other in their own tongue. It is
a pleasant thing to see the aborigines advanced to the same degree
of civilisation, however low that may be, which their white
conquerors have attained.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 294">page 294</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>More to the south we saw many pure Indians: indeed, all the
inhabitants of some of the islets retain their Indian surnames. In
the census of 1832 there were in Chiloe and its dependencies
forty-two thousand souls: the greater number of these appear to be
of mixed blood. Eleven thousand retain their Indian surnames, but
it is probable that not nearly all of these are of a pure breed.
Their manner of life is the same with that of the other poor
inhabitants, and they are all Christians; but it is said that they
yet retain some strange superstitious ceremonies, and that they
pretend to hold communication with the devil in certain caves.
Formerly, every one convicted of this offence was sent to the
Inquisition at Lima. Many of the inhabitants who are not included
in the eleven thousand with Indian surnames, cannot be
distinguished by their appearance from Indians. Gomez, the governor
of Lemuy, is descended from noblemen of Spain on both sides; but by
constant intermarriages with the natives the present man is an
Indian. On the other hand, the governor of Quinchao boasts much of
his purely kept Spanish blood.</p>

<p>We reached at night a beautiful little cove, north of the island
of Caucahue. The people here complained of want of land. This is
partly owing to their own negligence in not clearing the woods, and
partly to restrictions by the government, which makes it necessary,
before buying ever so small a piece, to pay two shillings to the
surveyor for measuring each quadra (150 yards square), together
with whatever price he fixes for the value of the land. After his
valuation the land must be put up three times to auction, and if no
one bids more, the purchaser can have it at that rate. All these
exactions must be a serious check to clearing the ground, where the
inhabitants are so extremely poor. In most countries, forests are
removed without much difficulty by the aid of fire; but in Chiloe,
from the damp nature of the climate, and the sort of trees, it is
necessary first to cut them down. This is a heavy drawback to the
prosperity of Chiloe. In the time of the Spaniards the Indians
could not hold land; and a family, after having cleared a piece of
ground, might be driven away, and the property seized by the
government. The Chilian authorities are now performing an act of
justice by making retribution to these poor Indians, giving to
each</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 295">page 295</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>man, according to his grade of life, a certain portion of land.
The value of uncleared ground is very little. The government gave
Mr. Douglas (the present surveyor, who informed me of these
circumstances) eight and a half square miles of forest near S.
Carlos, in lieu of a debt; and this he sold for 350 dollars, or
about &pound;70 sterling.</p>

<p>The two succeeding days were fine, and at night we reached the
island of Quinchao. This neighbourhood is the most cultivated part
of the Archipelago; for a broad strip of land on the coast of the
main island, as well as on many of the smaller adjoining ones, is
almost completely cleared. Some of the farmhouses seemed very
comfortable. I was curious to ascertain how rich any of these
people might be, but Mr. Douglas says that no one can be considered
as possessing a regular income. One of the richest landowners might
possibly accumulate, in a long industrious life, as much as
&pound;1000 sterling; but should this happen, it would all be
stowed away in some secret corner, for it is the custom of almost
every family to have a jar or treasure-chest buried in the
ground.</p>

<p><i>November 30th.</i>&mdash;Early on Sunday morning we reached
Castro, the ancient capital of Chiloe, but now a most forlorn and
deserted place. The usual quadrangular arrangement of Spanish towns
could be traced, but the streets and plaza were coated with fine
green turf, on which sheep were browsing. The church, which stands
in the middle, is entirely built of plank, and has a picturesque
and venerable appearance. The poverty of the place may be conceived
from the fact, that although containing some hundreds of
inhabitants, one of our party was unable anywhere to purchase
either a pound of sugar or an ordinary knife. No individual
possessed either a watch or a clock; and an old man who was
supposed to have a good idea of time, was employed to strike the
church bell by guess. The arrival of our boats was a rare event in
this quiet retired corner of the world; and nearly all the
inhabitants came down to the beach to see us pitch our tents. They
were very civil, and offered us a house; and one man even sent us a
cask of cider as a present. In the afternoon we paid our respects
to the governor&mdash;a quiet old man, who, in his appearance and
manner of life, was scarcely superior to an English cottager. At
night heavy rain set in, which was</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 296">page 296</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>hardly sufficient to drive away from our tents the large circle
of lookers on. An Indian family, who had come to trade in a canoe
from Caylen, bivouacked near us. They had no shelter during the
rain. In the morning I asked a young Indian, who was wet to the
skin, how he had passed the night. He seemed perfectly content, and
answered, "Muy bien, se&ntilde;or."</p>

<p><i>December 1st.</i>&mdash;We steered for the island of Lemuy. I
was anxious to examine a reported coal-mine which turned out to be
lignite of little value, in the sandstone (probably of an ancient
tertiary epoch) of which these islands are composed. When we
reached Lemuy we had much difficulty in finding any place to pitch
our tents, for it was spring-tide, and the land was wooded down to
the water's edge. In a short time we were surrounded by a large
group of the nearly pure Indian inhabitants. They were much
surprised at our arrival, and said one to the other, "This is the
reason we have seen so many parrots lately; the cheucau (an odd
red-breasted little bird, which inhabits the thick forest, and
utters very peculiar noises) has not cried 'beware' for nothing."
They were soon anxious for barter. Money was scarcely worth
anything, but their eagerness for tobacco was something quite
extraordinary. After tobacco, indigo came next in value; then
capsicum, old clothes, and gunpowder. The latter article was
required for a very innocent purpose: each parish has a public
musket, and the gunpowder was wanted for making a noise on their
saint or feast days.</p>

<p>The people here live chiefly on shell-fish and potatoes. At
certain seasons they catch also, in "corrales," or hedges under
water, many fish which are left on the mud-banks as the tide falls.
They occasionally possess fowls, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and
cattle; the order in which they are here mentioned, expressing
their respective numbers. I never saw anything more obliging and
humble than the manners of these people. They generally began with
stating that they were poor natives of the place, and not Spaniards
and that they were in sad want of tobacco and other comforts. At
Caylen, the most southern island, the sailors bought with a stick
of tobacco, of the value of three-halfpence, two fowls, one of
which, the Indian stated, had skin between its toes, and turned out
to</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 297">page 297</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>be a fine duck; and with some cotton handkerchiefs, worth three
shillings, three sheep and a large bunch of onions were procured.
The yawl at this place was anchored some way from the shore, and we
had fears for her safety from robbers during the night. Our pilot,
Mr. Douglas, accordingly told the constable of the district that we
always placed sentinels with loaded arms, and not understanding
Spanish, if we saw any person in the dark, we should assuredly
shoot him. The constable, with much humility, agreed to the perfect
propriety of this arrangement, and promised us that no one should
stir out of his house during that night.</p>

<p>During the four succeeding days we continued sailing southward.
The general features of the country remained the same, but it was
much less thickly inhabited. On the large island of Tanqui there
was scarcely one cleared spot, the trees on every side extending
their branches over the sea-beach. I one day noticed, growing on
the sandstone cliffs, some very fine plants of the panke (Gunnera
scabra), which somewhat resembles the rhubarb on a gigantic scale.
The inhabitants eat the stalks, which are subacid, and tan leather
with the roots, and prepare a black dye from them. The leaf is
nearly circular, but deeply indented on its margin. I measured one
which was nearly eight feet in diameter, and therefore no less than
twenty-four in circumference! The stalk is rather more than a yard
high, and each plant sends out four or five of these enormous
leaves, presenting together a very noble appearance.</p>

<p><i>December 6th.</i>&mdash;We reached Caylen, called "el fin del
Cristiandad." In the morning we stopped for a few minutes at a
house on the northern end of Laylec, which was the extreme point of
South American Christendom, and a miserable hovel it was. The
latitude is 43&deg; 10', which is two degrees farther south than
the Rio Negro on the Atlantic coast. These extreme Christians were
very poor, and, under the plea of their situation, begged for some
tobacco. As a proof of the poverty of these Indians, I may mention
that shortly before this we had met a man, who had travelled three
days and a half on foot, and had as many to return, for the sake of
recovering the value of a small axe and a few fish. How very
difficult it must be to buy the smallest article, when such trouble
is taken to recover so small a debt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 298">page 298</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the evening we reached the island of San Pedro, where we
found the <i>Beagle</i> at anchor. In doubling the point, two of
the officers landed to take a round of angles with the theodolite.
A fox (Canis fulvipes), of a kind said to be peculiar to the
island, and very rare in it, and which is a new species, was
sitting on the rocks. He was so intently absorbed in watching the
work of the officers, that I was able, by quietly walking up
behind, to knock him on the head with my geological hammer. This
fox, more curious or more scientific, but less wise, than the
generality of his brethren, is now mounted in the museum of the
Zoological Society.</p>

<p>We stayed three days in this harbour, on one of which Captain
Fitz Roy, with a party, attempted to ascend to the summit of San
Pedro. The woods here had rather a different appearance from those
on the northern part of the island. The rock, also, being micaceous
slate, there was no beach, but the steep sides dipped directly
beneath the water. The general aspect in consequence was more like
that of Tierra del Fuego than of Chiloe. In vain we tried to gain
the summit: the forest was so impenetrable, that no one who has not
beheld it can imagine so entangled a mass of dying and dead trunks.
I am sure that often, for more than ten minutes together, our feet
never touched the ground, and we were frequently ten or fifteen
feet above it, so that the seamen as a joke called out the
soundings. At other times we crept one after another, on our hands
and knees, under the rotten trunks. In the lower part of the
mountain, noble trees of the Winter's Bark, and a laurel like the
sassafras with fragrant leaves, and others, the names of which I do
not know, were matted together by a trailing bamboo or cane. Here
we were more like fishes struggling in a net than any other animal.
On the higher parts, brushwood takes the place of larger trees,
with here and there a red cedar or an alerce pine. I was also
pleased to see, at an elevation of a little less than 1000 feet,
our old friend the southern beech. They were, however, poor stunted
trees, and I should think that this must be nearly their northern
limit. We ultimately gave up the attempt in despair.</p>

<p><i>December 10th.</i>&mdash;The yawl and whale-boat, with Mr.
Sulivan, proceeded on their survey, but I remained on board the <i>
Beagle</i>, which the next day left San Pedro for the southward. On
the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 299">page 299</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>13th we ran into an opening in the southern part of Guayatecas,
or the Chonos Archipelago; and it was fortunate we did so, for on
the following day a storm, worthy of Tierra del Fuego, raged with
great fury. White massive clouds were piled up against a dark blue
sky, and across them black ragged sheets of vapour were rapidly
driven. The successive mountain ranges appeared like dim shadows,
and the setting sun cast on the woodland a yellow gleam, much like
that produced by the flame of spirits of wine. The water was white
with the flying spray, and the wind lulled and roared again through
the rigging: it was an ominous, sublime scene. During a few minutes
there was a bright rainbow, and it was curious to observe the
effect of the spray, which, being carried along the surface of the
water, changed the ordinary semicircle into a circle&mdash;a band
of prismatic colours being continued, from both feet of the common
arch across the bay, close to the vessel's side: thus forming a
distorted, but very nearly entire ring.</p>

<center><img src="images/pl63.jpg" width="294" height="221" alt=
"Inside Chonos Archipelago"></center>

<p>We stayed here three days. The weather continued bad: but this
did not much signify, for the surface of the land in all these
islands is all but impassable. The coast is so very rugged that to
attempt to walk in that direction requires</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 300">page 300</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>continued scrambling up and down over the sharp rocks of
mica-slate; and as for the woods, our faces, hands, and shin-bones
all bore witness to the maltreatment we received, in merely
attempting to penetrate their forbidden recesses.</p>

<p><i>December 18th.</i>&mdash;We stood out to sea. On the 20th we
bade farewell to the south, and with a fair wind turned the ship's
head northward. From Cape Tres Montes we sailed pleasantly along
the lofty weather-beaten coast, which is remarkable for the bold
outline of its hills, and the thick covering of forest even on the
almost precipitous flanks. The next day a harbour was discovered,
which on this dangerous coast might be of great service to a
distressed vessel. It can easily be recognised by a hill 1600 feet
high, which is even more perfectly conical than the famous
sugar-loaf at Rio de Janeiro. The next day, after anchoring, I
succeeded in reaching the summit of this hill. It was a laborious
undertaking, for the sides were so steep that in some parts it was
necessary to use the trees as ladders. There were also several
extensive brakes of the Fuchsia, covered with its beautiful
drooping flowers, but very difficult to crawl through. In these
wild countries it gives much delight to gain the summit of any
mountain. There is an indefinite expectation of seeing something
very strange, which, however often it may be balked, never failed
with me to recur on each successive attempt. Every one must know
the feeling of triumph and pride which a grand view from a height
communicates to the mind. In these little frequented countries
there is also joined to it some vanity, that you perhaps are the
first man who ever stood on this pinnacle or admired this view.</p>

<p>A strong desire is always felt to ascertain whether any human
being has previously visited an unfrequented spot. A bit of wood
with a nail in it is picked up and studied as if it were covered
with hieroglyphics. Possessed with this feeling, I was much
interested by finding, on a wild part of the coast, a bed made of
grass beneath a ledge of rock. Close by it there had been a fire,
and the man had used an axe. The fire, bed, and situation showed
the dexterity of an Indian; but he could scarcely have been an
Indian, for the race is in this part extinct, owing to the Catholic
desire of making at one blow Christians and Slaves. I had at the
time some misgivings</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 301">page 301</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>that the solitary man who had made his bed on this wild spot,
must have been some poor shipwrecked sailor, who, in trying to
travel up the coast, had here laid himself down for his dreary
night.</p>

<p><i>December 28th.</i>&mdash;The weather continued very bad, but
it at last permitted us to proceed with the survey. The time hung
heavy on our hands, as it always did when we were delayed from day
to day by successive gales of wind. In the evening another harbour
was discovered, where we anchored. Directly afterwards a man was
seen waving his shirt, and a boat was sent which brought back two
seamen. A party of six had run away from an American whaling
vessel, and had landed a little to the southward in a boat, which
was shortly afterwards knocked to pieces by the surf. They had now
been wandering up and down the coast for fifteen months, without
knowing which way to go, or where they were. What a singular piece
of good fortune it was that this harbour was now discovered! Had it
not been for this one chance, they might have wandered till they
had grown old men, and at last have perished on this wild coast.
Their sufferings had been very great, and one of their party had
lost his life by falling from the cliffs. They were sometimes
obliged to separate in search of food, and this explained the bed
of the solitary man. Considering what they had undergone, I think
they had kept a very good reckoning of time, for they had lost only
four days.</p>

<p><i>December 30th.</i>&mdash;We anchored in a snug little cove at
the foot of some high hills, near the northern extremity of Tres
Montes. After breakfast the next morning a party ascended one of
these mountains, which was 2400 feet high. The scenery was
remarkable. The chief part of the range was composed of grand,
solid, abrupt masses of granite, which appeared as if they had been
coeval with the beginning of the world. The granite was capped with
mica-slate, and this in the lapse of ages had been worn into
strange finger-shaped points. These two formations, thus differing
in their outlines, agree in being almost destitute of vegetation.
This barrenness had to our eyes a strange appearance, from having
been so long accustomed to the sight of an almost universal forest
of dark-green trees. I took much delight in examining the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 302">page 302</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>structure of these mountains. The complicated and lofty ranges
bore a noble aspect of durability&mdash;equally profitless,
however, to man and to all other animals. Granite to the geologist
is classic ground: from its widespread limits, and its beautiful
and compact texture, few rocks have been more anciently recognised.
Granite has given rise, perhaps, to more discussion concerning its
origin than any other formation. We generally see it constituting
the fundamental rock, and, however formed, we know it is the
deepest layer in the crust of this globe to which man has
penetrated. The limit of man's knowledge in any subject possesses a
high interest, which is perhaps increased by its close
neighbourhood to the realms of imagination.</p>

<p><i>January 1st, 1835.</i>&mdash;The new year is ushered in with
the ceremonies proper to it in these regions. She lays out no false
hopes: a heavy north-western gale, with steady rain, bespeaks the
rising year. Thank God, we are not destined here to see the end of
it, but hope then to be in the Pacific Ocean, where a blue sky
tells one there is a heaven,&mdash;a something beyond the clouds
above our heads.</p>

<p>The north-west winds prevailing for the next four days, we only
managed to cross a great bay, and then anchored in another secure
harbour. I accompanied the Captain in a boat to the head of a deep
creek. On the way the number of seals which we saw was quite
astonishing: every bit of flat rock and parts of the beach were
covered with them. They appeared to be of a loving disposition, and
lay huddled together, fast asleep, like so many pigs; but even pigs
would have been ashamed of their dirt, and of the foul smell which
came from them. Each herd was watched by the patient but
inauspicious eyes of the turkey-buzzard. This disgusting bird, with
its bald scarlet head, formed to wallow in putridity, is very
common on the west coast, and their attendance on the seals shows
on what they rely for their food. We found the water (probably only
that of the surface) nearly fresh: this was caused by the number of
torrents which, in the form of cascades, came tumbling over the
bold granite mountains into the sea. The fresh water attracts the
fish, and these bring many terns, gulls, and two kinds of
cormorant. We saw also a pair of the beautiful black-necked swans,
and several small sea-otters, the fur of which is held in such high
estimation. In returning, we</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 303">page 303</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>were again amused by the impetuous manner in which the heap of
seals, old and young, tumbled into the water as the boat passed.
They did not remain long under water, but rising, followed us with
outstretched necks, expressing great wonder and curiosity.</p>

<p><i>7th.</i>&mdash;Having run up the coast, we anchored near the
northern end of the Chonos Archipelago, in Low's Harbour, where we
remained a week. The islands were here, as in Chiloe, composed of a
stratified, soft, littoral deposit; and the vegetation in
consequence was beautifully luxuriant. The woods came down to the
sea-beach, just in the manner of an evergreen shrubbery over a
gravel walk. We also enjoyed from the anchorage a splendid view of
four great snowy cones of the Cordillera, including "el famoso
Corcovado;" the range itself had in this latitude so little height,
that few parts of it appeared above the tops of the neighbouring
islets. We found here a party of five men from Caylen, "el fin del
Cristiandad," who had most adventurously crossed in their miserable
boat-canoe, for the purpose of fishing, the open space of sea which
separates Chonos from Chiloe. These islands will, in all
probability, in a short time become peopled like those adjoining
the coast of Chiloe.</p>

<br>
<p>The wild potato grows on these islands in great abundance, on
the sandy, shelly soil near the sea-beach. The tallest plant was
four feet in height. The tubers were generally small, but I found
one, of an oval shape, two inches in diameter: they resembled in
every respect, and had the same smell as English potatoes; but when
boiled they shrunk much, and were watery and insipid, without any
bitter taste. They are undoubtedly here indigenous: they grow as
far south, according to Mr. Low, as lat. 50&deg;, and are called
Aquinas by the wild Indians of that part: the Chilotan Indians have
a different name for them. Professor Henslow, who has examined the
dried specimens which I brought home, says that they are the same
with those described by Mr. Sabine<sup>1</sup> from Valparaiso, but
that they form a</p>

<p class="fnote">1. <i>Horticultural Transact.</i> vol. v, p. 249.
Mr. Caldeleugh sent home two tubers, which, being well manured,
even the first season produced numerous potatoes and an abundance
of leaves. See Humboldt's interesting discussion on this plant,
which it appears was unknown in Mexico,&mdash;in <i>Polit. Essay on
New Spain</i>, book iv, chap. ix.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 304">page 304</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>variety which by some botanists has been considered as
specifically distinct. It is remarkable that the same plant should
be found on the sterile mountains of central Chile, where a drop of
rain does not fall for more than six months, and within the damp
forests of these southern islands.</p>

<p>In the central parts of the Chonos Archipelago (lat. 45&deg;),
the forest has very much the same character with that along the
whole west coast, for 600 miles southward to Cape Horn. The
arborescent grass of Chiloe is not found here; while the beech of
Tierra del Fuego grows to a good size, and forms a considerable
proportion of the wood; not, however, in the same exclusive manner
as it does farther southward. Cryptogamic plants here find a most
congenial climate. In the Strait of Magellan, as I have before
remarked, the country appears too cold and wet to allow of their
arriving at perfection; but in these islands, within the forest,
the number of species and great abundance of mosses, lichens, and
small ferns, is quite extraordinary.<sup>1</sup> In Tierra del
Fuego trees grow only on the hillsides; every level piece of land
being invariably covered by a thick bed of peat; but in Chiloe flat
land supports the most luxuriant forests. Here, within the Chonos
Archipelago, the nature of the climate more closely approaches that
of Tierra del Fuego than that of northern Chiloe; for every patch
of level ground is covered by two species of plants (Astelia pumila
and Donatia magellanica), which by their joint decay compose a
thick bed of elastic peat.</p>

<p>In Tierra del Fuego, above the region of woodland, the former of
these eminently sociable plants is the chief agent in the
production of peat. Fresh leaves are always succeeding one to the
other round the central tap-root, the lower ones soon decay, and in
tracing a root downwards in the peat, the leaves, yet holding their
place, can be observed passing through every stage of
decomposition, till the whole becomes blended in one confused mass.
The Astelia is assisted by a few other plants,&mdash;here and there
a small creeping Myrtus (M. nummularia), with a woody stem like our
cranberry and with a sweet berry,</p>

<p class="fnote">1. By sweeping with my insect-net, I procured from
these situations a considerable number of minute insects, of the
family of Staphylinid&aelig;, and others allied to Pselaphus, and
minute Hymenoptera. But the most characteristic family in number,
both of individuals and species, throughout the more open parts of
Chiloe and Chonos is that of Telephorid&aelig;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 305">page 305</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&mdash;an Empetrum (E. rubrum), like our heath,&mdash;a rush
(Juncus grandiflorus), are nearly the only ones that grow on the
swampy surface. These plants, though possessing a very close
general resemblance to the English species of the same genera, are
different. In the more level parts of the country, the surface of
the peat is broken up into little pools of water, which stand at
different heights, and appear as if artificially excavated. Small
streams of water, flowing underground, complete the disorganisation
of the vegetable matter, and consolidate the whole.</p>

<p>The climate of the southern part of America appears particularly
favourable to the production of peat. In the Falkland Islands
almost every kind of plant, even the coarse grass which covers the
whole surface of the land, becomes converted into this substance:
scarcely any situation checks its growth; some of the beds are as
much as twelve feet thick, and the lower part becomes so solid when
dry, that it will hardly burn. Although every plant lends its aid,
yet in most parts the Astelia is the most efficient. It is rather a
singular circumstance, as being so very different from what occurs
in Europe, that I nowhere saw moss forming by its decay any portion
of the peat in South America. With respect to the northern limit at
which the climate allows of that peculiar kind of slow
decomposition which is necessary for its production, I believe that
in Chiloe (lat. 41&deg; to 42&deg;), although there is much swampy
ground, no well-characterised peat occurs: but in the Chonos
Islands, three degrees farther southward, we have seen that it is
abundant. On the eastern coast in La Plata (lat. 35&deg;) I was
told by a Spanish resident who had visited Ireland, that he had
often sought for this substance, but had never been able to find
any. He showed me, as the nearest approach to it which he had
discovered, a black peaty soil, so penetrated with roots as to
allow of an extremely slow and imperfect combustion.</p>

<br>
<p>The zoology of these broken islets of the Chonos Archipelago is,
as might have been expected, very poor. Of quadrupeds two aquatic
kinds are common. The Myopotamus Coypus (like a beaver, but with a
round tail) is well known from its fine fur, which is an object of
trade throughout the tributaries of La</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 306">page 306</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plata. It here, however, exclusively frequents salt water; which
same circumstance has been mentioned as sometimes occurring with
the great rodent, the Capybara. A small sea-otter is very numerous;
this animal does not feed exclusively on fish, but, like the seals,
draws a large supply from a small red crab, which swims in shoals
near the surface of the water. Mr. Bynoe saw one in Tierra del
Fuego eating a cuttle-fish; and at Low's Harbour, another was
killed in the act of carrying to its hole a large volute shell. At
one place I caught in a trap a singular little mouse (M.
brachiotis); it appeared common on several of the islets, but the
Chilotans at Low's Harbour said that it was not found in all. What
a succession of chances,<sup>1</sup> or what changes of level must
have been brought into play, thus to spread these small animals
throughout this broken archipelago!</p>

<p>In all parts of Chiloe and Chonos, two very strange birds occur,
which are allied to, and replace, the Turco and Tapacolo of central
Chile. One is called by the inhabitants "Cheucau" (Pteroptochos
rubecula): it frequents the most gloomy and retired spots within
the damp forests. Sometimes, although its cry may be heard close at
hand, let a person watch ever so attentively he will not see the
cheucau; at other times let him stand motionless and the
red-breasted little bird will approach within a few feet in the
most familiar manner. It then busily hops about the entangled mass
of rotting canes and branches, with its little tail cocked upwards.
The cheucau is held in superstitious fear by the Chilotans, on
account of its strange and varied cries. There are three very
distinct cries: One is called "chiduco," and is an omen of good;
another, "huitreu," which is extremely unfavourable; and a third,
which I have forgotten. These words are given in imitation of the
noises; and the natives are in some things absolutely governed by
them. The Chilotans assuredly have chosen a most comical little
creature for their prophet. An allied species, but rather larger,
is called by the natives "Guid-guid" (Pteroptochos Tarnii), and by
the English the barking-bird. This latter name is well given;
for</p>

<p class="fnote">1. It is said that some rapacious birds bring
their prey alive to their nests. If so, in the course of centuries,
every now and then, one might escape from the young birds. Some
such agency is necessary, to account for the distribution of the
smaller gnawing animals on islands not very near each other.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 307">page 307</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I defy any one at first to feel certain that a small dog is not
yelping somewhere in the forest. Just as with the cheucau, a person
will sometimes hear the bark close by, but in vain may endeavour by
watching, and with still less chance by beating the bushes, to see
the bird; yet at other times the guid-guid fearlessly comes near.
Its manner of feeding and its general habits are very similar to
those of the cheucau.</p>

<p>On the coast,<sup>1</sup> a small dusky-coloured bird
(Opetiorhynchus Patagonicus) is very common. It is remarkable from
its quiet habits; it lives entirely on the sea-beach, like a
sandpiper. Besides these birds only few others inhabit this broken
land. In my rough notes I describe the strange noises, which,
although frequently heard within these gloomy forests, yet scarcely
disturb the general silence. The yelping of the guid-guid, and the
sudden whew-whew of the cheucau, sometimes come from afar off, and
sometimes from close at hand; the little black wren of Tierra del
Fuego occasionally adds its cry; the creeper (Oxyurus) follows the
intruder screaming and twittering; the humming-bird may be seen
every now and then darting from side to side, and emitting, like an
insect, its shrill chirp; lastly, from the top of some lofty tree
the indistinct but plaintive note of the white-tufted
tyrant-flycatcher (Myiobius) may be noticed. From the great
preponderance in most countries of certain common genera of birds,
such as the finches, one feels at first surprised at meeting with
the peculiar forms above enumerated, as the commonest birds in any
district. In central Chile two of them, namely, the Oxyurus and
Scytalopus, occur, although most rarely. When finding, as in this
case, animals which seem to play so insignificant a part in the
great scheme of nature, one is apt to wonder why they were created.
But it should always be recollected, that in some other country
perhaps they are essential members of society, or at some former
period may have been so. If America south of 37&deg; were sunk
beneath the waters of the ocean, these two birds might continue to
exist in central Chile for a long period, but it is very improbable
that their numbers would increase. We</p>

<p class="fnote">1. I may mention, as a proof of how great a
difference there is between the seasons of the wooded and the open
parts of this coast, that on September 20th, in lat. 34&deg;, these
birds had young ones in the nest, while among the Chonos Islands,
three months later in the summer, they were only laying, the
difference in latitude between these two places being about 700
miles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 308">page 308</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>should then see a case which must inevitably have happened with
very many animals.</p>

<p>These southern seas are frequented by several species of
Petrels: the largest kind, Procellaria gigantea, or nelly
(quebrantahuesos, or break-bones, of the Spaniards), is a common
bird, both in the inland channels and on the open sea. In its
habits and manner of flight there is a very close resemblance with
the albatross; and as with the albatross, a person may watch it for
hours together without seeing on what it feeds. The "break-bones"
is, however, a rapacious bird, for it was observed by some of the
officers at Port St. Antonio chasing a diver, which tried to escape
by diving and flying, but was continually struck down, and at last
killed by a blow on its head. At Port St. Julian these great
petrels were seen killing and devouring young gulls. A second
species (Puffinus cinereus), which is common to Europe, Cape Horn,
and the coast of Peru, is of a much smaller size than the P.
gigantea, but, like it, of a dirty black colour. It generally
frequents the inland sounds in very large flocks: I do not think I
ever saw so many birds of any other sort together, as I once saw of
these behind the island of Chiloe. Hundreds of thousands flew in an
irregular line for several hours in one direction. When part of the
flock settled on the water the surface was blackened, and a noise
proceeded from them as of human beings talking in the distance.</p>

<p>There are several other species of petrels, but I will only
mention one other kind, the Pelacanoides Berardi, which offers an
example of those extraordinary cases, of a bird evidently belonging
to one well-marked family, yet both in its habits and structure
allied to a very distinct tribe. This bird never leaves the quiet
inland sounds. When disturbed it dives to a distance, and on coming
to the surface, with the same movement takes flight. After flying
by the rapid movement of its short wings for a space in a straight
line, it drops, as if struck dead, and dives again. The form of its
beak and nostrils, length of foot, and even the colouring of its
plumage, show that this bird is a petrel: on the other hand, its
short wings and consequent little power of flight, its form of body
and shape of tail, the absence of a hind toe to its foot, its habit
of living, and its choice of situation, make it at first
doubtful</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 309">page 309</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>whether its relationship is not equally close with the auks. It
would undoubtedly be mistaken for an auk, when seen from a
distance, either on the wing, or when diving and quietly swimming
about the retired channels of Tierra del Fuego.<br>
