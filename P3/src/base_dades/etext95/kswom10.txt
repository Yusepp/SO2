*****This file should be named kswom10.txt or kswom10.zip******

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, kswom11.txt.
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, kswom10a.txt.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $4
million dollars per hour this year as we release some eight text
files per month:  thus upping our productivity from $2 million.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is 10% of the expected number of computer users by the end
of the year 2001.

tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Illinois Benedictine College (the "Project").  Among other

KANSAS WOMEN

IN

LITERATURE

BY

NETTIE GARMER BARKER



TO MY NEAREST AND DEAREST--
MY SILENT PARTNERS--
MY HUSBAND AND MY MOTHER.





KANSAS WOMEN
IN LITERATURE.

``We are proud of Kansas, the beautiful queen,
     And proud are we of her fields of corn;
But a nobler pride than these I ween,
     Is our pride in her children, Kansas born!''

--Ellen P. Allerton--


--Or adopted. In this galaxy of bright
women, the State has a noble pride for every
name, be its owner Kansas born or adopted,
is a mightier force for good than its ``walls of corn.''



EFFIE GRAHAM.


The last place one would expect to find
romance is in arithmetic and yet--Miss Effie
Graham, the head of the Department of
Mathematics in the Topeka High School, has found
it there and better still, in her lecture ``Living
Arithmetic'' she has shown others the way to
find it there.  Miss Graham is one of the most
talented women of the state.  Ex-Gov. Hoch
has called her ``one of the most gifted women
in the state noted for its brilliant women.  Her
heart and life are as pure as her mind is
bright.''

She was born and reared in Ohio, the
daughter of a family of Ohio pioneers, a
descendant of a Revolutionary soldier and also,
of a warrior of 1812.  As a student of the Ohio
Northern University and later as a post-graduate
worker at the University of California,
Chicago University, and Harvard Summer
School, she has as she says, ``graduated
sometimes and has a degree but never `finished' her
education.''

Desiring to get the school out into the
world as well as the world back to the school,
she has spoken and written on ``Moving Into
The King Row,'' ``Other Peoples' Children,''
``Spirit of the Younger Generation,'' ``Vine
Versus Oak,'' and ``The Larger Service.''

``Pictures Eight Hundred Children Selected,''
``Speaking of Automobiles,'' ``The Unusual
Thing,'' ``The High Cost of Learning,'' and
``Wanted--A Funeral of Algebraic Phraseology;''
also, some verse, ``The Twentieth
Regiment Knight'' and ``Back to God's Country''
are magazine work that never came back.
School Science & Mathematics, a magazine to
which she contributes and of which she is an
associate editor, gives hers as the only woman's
name on its staff of fifty editors.

Her book, ``The Passin' On Party,'' raises
the author to the rank of a classic.  To quote
a critic: it is ``a little like `Mrs. Wiggs of the
Cabbage Patch,' a little like `Uncle Tom's
Cabin,' but not just like either of them.  She
reaches right down into human breasts and
grips the heart strings.''

It is the busy people who find time to do
things and the mother-heart of Miss Graham
finds expression in her household in West
Lawn, a suburb of Topeka.  Among the members
of her family are a niece and nephew
whose High School and College education she
directs.



ESTHER M. CLARK.


Every Kansan, homesick in a foreign land,
knows the call of Kansas and every Kansan
book lover knows Esther Clark's ``Call of Kansas.''

``Sweeter to me than the salt sea spray,
   the fragrance of summer rains:
Nearer my heart than these mighty hills
   are the wind-swept Kansas plains:
Dearer the sight of a shy, wild rose by the
   roadside's dusty way
Than all the splendor of poppy-fields
   ablaze in the sun of May.

Gay as the bold poinsetta is,
   and the burden of pepper trees,
The sunflower, tawny and gold and brown,
   is richer, to me, than these.
And rising ever above the song
   of the hoarse, insistent sea,
The voice of the prairie,
   calling, calling me.


Miss Clark was born in Neosho Co., Kansas,
about twelve miles southeast of Chanute,
on a farm.  At seven years of age, the family
moved to Chanute and her school days were
spent at the old Pioneer Building, where her
mother went to school before her.  In 1894,
she graduated here, later entering the University
of Kansas for work in English.

In 1906, ``Verses by a Commonplace Person''
was published.  ``The Call of Kansas and
Other Verse'' came out in 1909.  This volume
contained ``My Dear'' and ``Good Night'' which
were set to music, and ``Rose O' My Heart.''

``Rose o' my heart, to-day I send
   A rose or two,
You love roses, Rose o' my heart,
   I love you.

Rose o' my heart, a rose is sweet
   And fresh as dew.
Some have thorns, but, Rose o' my heart,
   None have you.

Rose o' my heart, this day wear
   My roses, do!
For next to my heart, Rose o' my heart,
   I wear you.''


``My Dear'' was written for her baby brother,
during an absence from home, and is
Miss Clark's favorite.

She is in the office of the Extension
Department at the University of Kansas, and has
exclusive charge of club programs and does
some work in package libraries.

Just now she is contributing prose to some
of the newspapers and doing some splendid
feature work.



MARY VANCE HUMPHREY.


Mary Vance Humphrey of Junction City,
Kansas, has written a series of short stories
on the property rights of women in Kansas, a
subject that was and is, still, of vital
importance to the women of the state.  ``The Legal
Status of Mrs. O'Rourke'' and ``King Lear in
Kansas'' are two of the series.

When young in heart and experience, Mrs.
Humphrey wrote a number of poems.  Her
work in later years has been only prose.  Her
novel, ``The Squatter Sovereign'' is an historical
romance of pioneer days, the settlement of
Kansas in the fifties.

Mrs. Humphrey is one of the founders of
the Kansas State Social Science Club and the
Woman's Kansas Day Club and the founder of
the Reading Club of Junction City.  She has
served as President of the State Federation and
as Director of the General Federation of Women's
Clubs and President of the Woman's Kansas
Day Club.  Her work as member of the
Board of Education has done much for Junction
City and her interest in libraries has done
equally as much for the State of Kansas.

Of her record as an official, Margaret Hill
McCarter has written:  ``Her whole soul is in
her work.  She is the genuine metal, shirking
nothing, cheapening nothing, and withal happy
in the enjoyment of her obligation.  She stands
for patriotism, progress and peace.  Something
of the message of the shepherds heard out beyond
Bethlehem that Christmas morning long
ago sounds in the chords she strikes.''

As the wife of the late Judge James
Humphrey, she proved herself the able companion
of such a worthy man.



KATE A. APLINGTON.


The Kansas State Traveling Art Gallery
owes its birth and much of its success to Kate
A. Aplington, the author of that typical western
story, ``Pilgrims of the Plains.''  Since
Feb., 1907, the Art Gallery has been a recognized
state institution, and as its Vice-President
and Superintendent and as the writer of
the art lectures that accompany the work, Mrs.
Aplington's broad-minded, artistic temperament
and student's persistency have made the
gallery truly a work of art.

At present, the Aplingtons are living at
Miami, Florida, but for a quarter of a century,
Council Grove, the most famous spot on the
Santa Fe Trail, was their home.  Special
investigations and researches on the subject of
the old Santa Fe Trail days and lecturers on
educational and literary topics resulted from
years spent in that historic place.

``Pilgrims of the Plains,'' which came out
in Feb., 1913, is worthy of a place in the front
rank of western stories.  In July of this year,
Grossett and Dunlap will bring it out in their
``Popular Edition'' of novels.

Mrs. Aplington is now working on a book
on ``Art-Museums of America'' and judging
from the comments of prominent Museum
Directors, this will be as great a success as her
novel.  ``Florida of the Reclamation,'' a character
story with scenes laid in and around Miami,
Florida, is also in preparation.



EMMA UPTON VAUGHN.


The author of that versatile little book of
short stories, ``The Lower Bureau Drawer'' is
Emma Upton Vaughn, a Kansas City, Kansas
teacher.  These heart stories, showing keen
insight of human nature--especially woman
nature--deal with every day life, each one a
fascinating revelation, of character and soul.

Mrs. Vaughn was born in Kalamazoo,
Michigan.  Her early life was spent in Kansas.
She is a graduate of the Kansas University, and
has taught in the public schools of the state.

She wrote the ``Bible and the Flag in the
Public Schools'' and has contributed both prose
and verse to the leading magazines and
newspapers.  Feature articles and many good essays
appear over her signature.  Her ``Passing From
Under The Partial Eclipse'' did much to give
Kansas City, Kansas her recognized place
commercially on the map.  A novel, ``The Cresap
Pension,'' exposing a great pension fraud, is
ready for the press.



JESSIE WRIGHT WHITECOMB.


Jessie Wright Whitcomb, a Topeka writer
of juvenile books is a lawyer in active practice
with her husband, Judge George H. Whitcomb
and a mother of a remarkable family of five
boys and one girl.  The oldest son gained his
A. B. in 1910 at the age of eighteen; in 1911
was appointed Rhodes scholar for Kansas; and
is now a student at Oxford.  His father and
mother are in England at present visiting him.

Mrs. Whitcomb is a contributor to the
magazines and in addition, has written ``Odd
Little Lass,'' ``Freshman and Senior,'' ``Majorbanks,''
``His Best Friend,'' ``Pen's Venture,''
``Queer As She Could Be,'' and ``Curly Head.'' 

She is a graduate of the University of Vermont
and the Boston University Law School and was
the first woman to lecture before a man's law
school.



MYRA WILLIAMS JARRELL.


Myra Williams Jarrell, the daughter of the
late Archie L. Williams, for thirty years, the
attorney for the Union Pacific Railway in Kansas,
and the grand-daughter of Judge Archibald
Williams, the first United States Circuit
Judge of Kansas, appointed by Lincoln, comes
of a literary family.  All of the men and some
of the women on the father's side of the family
and also, on the mother's to a great extent, had
literary talent.

As a child, she cherished an ambition to
write and when occasionally one of her letters
to St. Nicholas saw publication, she felt she had
crossed the Alps of her desire.  Her first real
story, however, was written as she rocked the
cradle of her first born.  The day, when she
first saw her ``stuff'' in print, stands out in her
memory second only to the hallowed days of
her personal history, her wedding day and the
days upon which her children were born.

Since then, Mrs. Jarrell has contributed
to almost all the high class magazines and has
furnished special feature articles to newspapers.

Some years ago, a small book, ``Meg, of
Valencia,'' was written and now, a novel, ``The
Hand of The Potter'' is ready for publication.

In 1894, Myra Williams and J. F. Jarrell
were married.  This union was blest with four
children, three sons and one daughter.  Mr.
Jarrell is Publicity Agent of the Santa Fe.  A
number of years ago, he bought the Holton
Signal and in trying to help her husband put
some individuality into the paper, Mrs. Jarrell
began a department headed ``Ramblings.''  Later
this was syndicated and finally issued in book
form.

Last winter, a play, ``The Plain Clothes
Man,'' was produced by the North Brothers
Stock Co., at the Majestic Theatre, Topeka.
This well written play, with its novel and original
characterization and its effective comedy
lines, is now in the hands of two New York
play brokers.  Before many months, Mrs. Jarrell
will be enjoying a royalty.

In preparation, are two plays, as yet nameless;
also, a play in collaboration with Mr.
North of the North Stock Co.  With her
brother, Burus L. Williams, of Kansas City,
Mo., Mrs. Jarrell has written an opera, ``The
Mix Up in the Kingdom of Something-Like,''
which awaits only the lyrics Mr. Williams is
writing and the music.  An opera, ``The Kingdom
of Never Come True,'' also, in collaboration
with Mr. Williams, is being set to music
by Arthur Pryor, the bandmaster.

A serial story, ``John Bishop, Farmer,'' a
collaboration with Albert T. Reed, the artist,
is to be published soon in the Kansas Farmer.
Later, this will appear in book form.  A novel,
which Mrs. Jarrell believes will be her best
work, is in construction and is clamoring to
be written.



ELLEN PALMER ALLERTON.


Ellen Palmer Allerton, the sweet and gentle
poetess, beloved of Kansas, lived at Padonia,
in Brown County, when she wrote her famous
poem, ``Wall of Corn.''

She was past her prime when she came to
Kansas from the Wisconsin home, the subject
of many of her noble gems.  As she grew older,
she grew stronger in poetic strength.

Three volumes of poems have been
published, ``Walls of Corn and Other Poems,''
``Annabel and Other Poems,'' and ``Poems of the
Prairie.''  Her ``Walls of Corn,'' written in
1884, famous from the first, as used as railroad
immigration advertising, was translated in
several languages and distributed all over
Europe.  This and her ``Trail of Forty-nine''
are her best, although the classic beauty of
``Beautiful Things'' is unsurpassed by any
other American writer.

``Beautiful twilight, at set of sun,
Beautiful goal, with race well run,
Beautiful rest, with work well done.''

is a fitting close to the beautiful, useful life
of the author.

Mrs. Allerton was born in Centerville.  New
York, in 1835 and began writing verse at the
age of seventeen.  Much as she has written,
yet writing was only a pastime.  She never let it
interfere with her housework.  Thoroughly
practical, she did all her own work, just
because she loved to do it.  Her flowers of which
she had many, in doors and out, resulted in
many noble, inspiring lines.  In 1862, she was

married to A. B. Allerton of Wisconsin, coming
to Kansas in 1865.  She was best appreciated
for her social qualities and her interest
in charity--that broader charity that praises
the beauty and ignores the blemishes.  Her
last poem, ``When Days Grow Dark'' is a beautiful
pen picture of her sweetness and resignation
in her growing blindness and her love
and trust in him who had been her companion
down the years.

``You take the book and pour into my ear
     In accent sweet, the words I cannot see;
I listen charmed, forget my haunting fear,
     And think with you as with your eyes I see.
In the world's thought, so your dear voice be left,
     I still have part, I am not all bereft.

And if this darkness deepens, when for me
     The new moon bends no more her silver rim,
When stars go out, and over land and sea
     Black midnight falls, where now is twilight dim,
O, then may I be patient, sweet and mild,
     While your hands lead me like a little child!''


She died in 1893, at Padonia, and was
buried in a bed of her favorite white flowers,
donated by loving friends.  In the little graveyard
at Hamlin, one reads ``Beautiful Things''
on a modest stone at the head of her little bed.



EMMA TANNER WOOD.


Mrs. Emma Tanner Wood (Caroline
Cunningham), a Topeka woman, began newspaper
work in 1872.  The result of those early years'
work was ``Spring Showers,'' a volume of prose.
After thirty years of study and experience
among the defectives, she wrote ``Too Fit For
The Unfit,'' advocating surgery for the feeble-
minded.  The story of Mrs. Benton, one of the
characters, led Mrs. Wood to introduce a law
preventing children being sent to the poor
house.  This was the first law purely in the
interest of children ever passed in Kansas.
Later, a law preventing traveling hypnotists
from using school children as subjects in
public exhibitions was drawn up by Mrs. Wood
and passed.

Several years ago, a book on hypnotism,
far in advance of the public thought, was written
and is to be published this year.

Mrs. Wood is seventy years young and as
she says:  ``finds age the very sweetest part of
life.  It is no small satisfaction to laugh at the
follies of others and know that you are past
committing them.  It is equally delightful to
be responsible only to one's self and order one's
life as one chooses.  Every day is a holy day
to me now and the sweetness of common
things, grass, flowers, neighborly love, grand-
children, and home comforts fill me with satis-
faction.  To think kindly of all things under
the sun (but sin); to speak kindly to all; to
do little kindly acts is a greater good to the
world at large than we think while we are in
the heat of battle.''



CORNELIA M. STOCKTON.


A cheerful little room in the East wing of
St. Margaret's Hospital, Kansas City, Kansas;
an invalid chair wheeled up to a window over
looking the street; and the eager, expectant
face and the warm hand clasp of the occupant,
Mrs. Cornelia M. Stockton, assures the visitor
of a hearty welcome.

Greatly enfeebled by long illness and with
impaired sight, this bright, little woman's keen
interest in current events and the latest ``best
seller'' puts to shame the half-hearted zeal of
the average woman.

For four years, Mrs. Stockton has lived at
St. Margaret's, depending upon the visits of
friends and the memory of an eventful life to
pass the days.  Prominence in club work in
her earlier years has brought reward.  The
History Club of Kansas City, Kansas, of which
she was once a member, each week sends a
member to read to her and these are red letter
days to this brave, patient, little woman.

Mrs. Stockton began writing very young.
When a little girl, back in the village of Walden,
New York, she stole up to the pulpit of
the church and wrote in her pastor's Bible:

``I have not seen the minister's eyes,
    And cannot describe his glance divine,
For when he prays he shuts them up
    And when he preaches he shuts mine.''


She was born in 1833 in Shawangunk, New
York, and came to Kansas City in 1859, living
in Missouri some years but most of the time
in Kansas City, Kansas.

In 1892, she published a limited edition of
poems, ``The Shanar Dancing Girl and Other
Poems.'' dedicated to Mrs. Bertha M. Honore
Palmer, her ideal of the perfect type of
gracious and lovely womanhood.  ``The Shanar
Dancing Girl'' was first written for the Friends
in Council, a literary club of Kansas City, Mo.
It has received the encomiums of Thomas
Bailey Aldrich, John J. Ingalls and others for
its beauty of expression and dramatic qualities.
``Invocation,'' an April idyl; ``The Sea-shell;''
and ``Mountain Born'' sing of the love of nature.
``In the Conservatory;'' ``My Summer Heart;''
and ``Tired of the Storm'' hint of sorrow and
unrest and longing.  Then in 1886, ``Compensation''
was written.  ``Irma's Love For The
King'' is a favorite; also, `` `Sold'--A Picture,''
written for her daughter, ``yes, but she never
came.

``The Sorrowful Stone'' Mrs. Stockton
considers her best.

``The story without a suspicion of rhyme,
   And dim with the mists of the morning of Time,
Is told of a goddess, who, wandering alone,
   Did go and sit down on the Sorrowful Stone.

We find our Gethsemane somewhere,
   though late;
The Angel of Shadows
   throws open the gate.
We creep with our burden of pain,
   to atone,
For all of life's ills,
   to the Sorrowful Stone.

Above is the vault of the pitiless stars;
     The trees stretch their arms all blackened
          with scars;
     The gales of lost Paradise are faintly
          blown
     To where we sit down on the Sorrowful
          Stone.''

``From a Poem `Vagaries' '' warns of * * *
     --the product of the age and clime,
     We do too much! grow old before our
          time,

     Yet--would we stray to Morning Hills
          again?
     Unlearn sad prophecies, and dream as
          then!

     Ah, no! with sense of peace the shadows
          creep,
     There droppeth on tired eyes the spell of
          sleep--

     We left the dawn long leagues behind, and
          stand,
     Waiting and wistful in the Evening Land!

     The patient Nurse of Destiny, at best,
     Leads us like children to the needed rest!
 

A ghostly wind puts out our little light,
     And we have bid the busy world ``Good Night!''


Mrs. Stockton was married twice.  Her
first husband was the father of her two sons,
one of whom, Dr. Henry M. Downs, in his
practice, came often to St. Margaret's.  The
second marriage, as the wife of the late Judge
John S. Stockton, was a very happy one.  Last
year, a brother the only surviving member of
her family, died, leaving Mrs. Stockton the
last of a family of five children.  The two
sons have also passed into the Great Beyond.

In her younger days, she contributed many
poems and some prose to newspapers and
magazines over the name of Cora M. Downs.

Ex-Gov. St. John appointed her one of the
regents of the University of Kansas.

Her beautiful poem:  ``In Memoriam'' to
Sarah Walter Chandler Coates was her last.

     `` `We seem like children,' she was wont to
          say,
     `Talking of what we cannot understand,'
And in the dark or daylight, all the way,
     Holding so trustfully a Father's hand.
And this was her religion, not to dwell
     On tenets, creeds, or doctrines, but to
          live
On a pure faith, and striving to do well
     The simple duties that each hour should
          give.''



MARGARET HILL McCARTER.


The most successful Kansas woman writer
financially and the most prolific is Margaret
Hill McCarter of Topeka.  From the advent
of her little book in 1901, ``A Bunch of Things,
Tied Up With Strings'' to the hearty reception
of her latest novel every step of the way spells
success.

Margaret Hill was born in Indiana and
came to Kansas in 1888 to teach English in
the Topeka High School.  Two years later, she
became the wife of Dr. William McCarter.  Of
this union there are two daughters, students
at Baker University and the Topeka High
School and a young son, his mother's literary
critic.

A wife and a mother first, a Kansas woman
second, and an author third is the way Mrs.
McCarter rates herself.  She is capable of and
does do all her housework.

Her love for literature she owes to her
mother, who believed in higher education and
taught Margaret to prize the few books that
came her way.

After leaving the school room, the teacher
instinct still strong within her, she argued if
she could teach out of books written by others,
why not out of books of her own?  Then followed
poems, short stories, biography, textbooks,
the editing of Crane Classics, ``One
Hundred Kansas Women'' and miscellanies.

In 1902, ``Cuddy and Other Folks'' was
written and in 1903, ``The Cottonwood's Story.'' 

This same year, ``The Overflowing Waters,''
the story of the 1903 flood, and one of her best
bits of heart writing paid for the school books
of almost a thousand unfortunate children. 
``Cuddy's Baby'' appeared in 1908, followed the
next year with ``In Old Quivera,'' a thread of
Coronado history.  ``The Price of The Prairies,''
three weeks after publication in the fall
of 1910, became Kansas' best seller.  ``The
Peace of The Solomon Valley'' came out in 1911
and proved a popular gift book.  ``The Wall of
Men,'' Mrs. McCarter's 1912 offering should
be one of the required books in Kansas schools. 
It is authentic history and the close of the story
leaves every Kansan with a greater respect and
love for the state and the heroic pioneers who
stood as a living wall between Kansas and the
slave question.  1913 gave us the ``Master's
Degree,'' considered by many her best work. 
This year we have ``Winning The Wilderness.''

Mrs. McCarter founded the Club Member
and organized the Sorosis, serving as president
seven years and two terms as president of the
Topeka Federation of Women's Clubs.  Baker
University, at Baldwin, Kansas, gave her an
honorary Master's Degree in 1909, its semi-
centennial anniversary.

Red Leaves.

Red leaves--
          Aflame in the air, aflame in the trees.
     Blue streams, smoky hills--
          Gold, gold the sunlight spills--
               Red leaves!

Dead Leaves--
          A swirl in the air-asleep 'neath the
               trees.
     Gone every lark and swallow--
          Haunting echoes bid me follow--
               Dead leaves!
                         Bessie May Bellman--


Mrs. Henthorne's ``If'' is published in a
New York reader.

``If, in a bird-heart, beating 'neath the gray
     There chants a song, no matter what the
          day.
If, in a bird-heart happy sunbeams shine,
               Why not in mine?

If, in a flower-face, beat down by rain,
     The hope of clear skies be in spite of
          pain--
If, in a flower-face a great hope shine,
               Why not in mine?''



AMANDA T. JONES.


One of the few Kansas women to have

``Utah and Other Poems;'' ``A Prairie Idyl;''
``Flowers and a Weed;'' and ``Rubaiyat of
Solomon Valley'' are volumes of verse.  Her
prose:  ``Children's Stories,'' ``Fairy Arrows''
and ``The White Blackbird;'' ``A Psychic
Autobiography,'' published in 1908; ``Man and
Priest,'' a story of psychic detection; ``Mother
of Pioneers,'' and a novel ready for publication,
``A Daughter of Wall St.''

Miss Jones originated a working women's
home and patented many inventions, mostly
household necessities.

MARGARET PERKINS.


As a 1914 Christmas offering, Margaret
Perkins, a Hutchinson High School teacher,
gave us her volume of beautiful poems.  ``The
Love Letters of a Norman Princess'' is the
love story, in verse, of Hersilie, a ward and
relative of William, The Conqueror, and Eric,
a kinsman of the unfortunate King Harold.

``I thought once, in a dream, that Love
          came near
     With silken flutter of empurpled wings
That wafted faint, strange fragrance from
          the things
     Abloom where age and season never
          sear.
The joy of mating birds was in my ear,
     And flamed my path with dancing daffodils
Whose splendor melted into greening hills
     Upseeking, like my spirit, to revere.''

 * * * * * *

``Before you came, this heart of mine
     A fairy garden seemed
With lavender and eglantine;
     And lovely lilies gleamed
Above the purple-pansy sod
     Where ruthless passion never trod.''

 * * * * * *

``If Heaven had been pleased to let you be
     A keeper of the sheep, a peasant me,
Within a shepherd's cottage thatched with
          vine
     Now might we know the bliss of days
          divine.''
--``We are part of Heaven's scheme,
     You and I:
Child of sunshine and the dew
     I was earthly--born as you.

 * * * * * *

``Yet my little hour I go,
     Troubled maid,
Even where the storm blasts blow,
     Unafraid;
Confident that from the sod
     All things upward wend to God.''

 * * * * * *

     ``Dear heart, the homing hour is here,
          The task is done.
     Toilers, and they who course the deer
          Turn, one by one,
          At day's demise,
     Where dwells a deathless glow
          In loving eyes.
     I hear them hearthward go
To castle, or to cottage on the lea;
But him I love comes never home to me.''

 * * * * * *

     The peaks that rift the saffron sheen
          Of sunset skies
     In purple loveliness, when seen
          By nearer eyes,
          Are bleakly bare.
     To brave those boulders gray
          No climbers dare.
     O, in some future may
This mountain mass of unfulfilled desires
Be unto me as yonder haloed spires!''

Chase and all her life since has been spent in
that county.  Until the last few years, she lived
on a farm.

She is a graduate of the State University
and has taught in the grade and high schools. 
In 1905, she became a candidate for Superintendent
of Schools of Chase County.  Her success
and her unusual ability as a teacher were
rewarded by a two to one majority on a close
county ticket.  At the second term, she had no
opposition and out of 1214 votes cast, she
received all but 29.  The present year, after
four elections, is her seventh continuous year
as Superintendent of Chase County.  In addition
to her official duties, Miss Arnold has
written two text-books.  Her ``Civics and
Citizenship'' in 1912 was adopted as the state
text-book on civil government for use in the
public schools of Kansas.  It is being used by
a large number of womens' clubs.  Many
outlines for club work on civic subjects have come
from Miss Arnold's pen.  Her second textbook,
