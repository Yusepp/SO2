<p>BEOWULF<br />PRELUDE OF THE FOUNDER OF THE DANISH HOUSE</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>LO, praise of the prowess of people-kings<br />of spear-armed Danes,
in days long sped,<br />we have heard, and what honor the athelings
won!<br />Oft Scyld the Scefing from squadroned foes,<br />from many
a tribe, the mead-bench tore,<br />awing the earls. Since erst he lay<br />friendless,
a foundling, fate repaid him:<br />for he waxed under welkin, in wealth
he throve,<br />till before him the folk, both far and near,<br />who
house by the whale-path, heard his mandate,<br />gave him gifts: a good
king he!<br />To him an heir was afterward born,<br />a son in his halls,
whom heaven sent<br />to favor the folk, feeling their woe<br />that
erst they had lacked an earl for leader<br />so long a while; the Lord
endowed him,<br />the Wielder of Wonder, with world&rsquo;s renown.<br />Famed
was this Beowulf: <a name="citation0a"></a><a href="#footnote0a">{0a}</a>
far flew the boast of him,<br />son of Scyld, in the Scandian lands.<br />So
becomes it a youth to quit him well<br />with his father&rsquo;s friends,
by fee and gift,<br />that to aid him, aged, in after days,<br />come
warriors willing, should war draw nigh,<br />liegemen loyal: by lauded
deeds<br />shall an earl have honor in every clan.</p>
<p>Forth he fared at the fated moment,<br />sturdy Scyld to the shelter
of God.<br />Then they bore him over to ocean&rsquo;s billow,<br />loving
clansmen, as late he charged them,<br />while wielded words the winsome
Scyld,<br />the leader beloved who long had ruled....<br />In the roadstead
rocked a ring-dight vessel,<br />ice-flecked, outbound, atheling&rsquo;s
barge:<br />there laid they down their darling lord<br />on the breast
of the boat, the breaker-of-rings, <a name="citation0b"></a><a href="#footnote0b">{0b}</a><br />by
the mast the mighty one. Many a treasure<br />fetched from far was freighted
with him.<br />No ship have I known so nobly dight<br />with weapons
of war and weeds of battle,<br />with breastplate and blade: on his
bosom lay<br />a heaped hoard that hence should go<br />far o&rsquo;er
the flood with him floating away.<br />No less these loaded the lordly
gifts,<br />thanes&rsquo; huge treasure, than those had done<br />who
in former time forth had sent him<br />sole on the seas, a suckling
child.<br />High o&rsquo;er his head they hoist the standard,<br />a
gold-wove banner; let billows take him,<br />gave him to ocean. Grave
were their spirits,<br />mournful their mood. No man is able<br />to
say in sooth, no son of the halls,<br />no hero &rsquo;neath heaven,
-- who harbored that freight!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>I</p>
<p>Now Beowulf bode in the burg of the Scyldings,<br />leader beloved,
and long he ruled<br />in fame with all folk, since his father had gone<br />away
from the world, till awoke an heir,<br />haughty Healfdene, who held
through life,<br />sage and sturdy, the Scyldings glad.<br />Then, one
after one, there woke to him,<br />to the chieftain of clansmen, children
four:<br />Heorogar, then Hrothgar, then Halga brave;<br />and I heard
that -- was -- &rsquo;s queen,<br />the Heathoscylfing&rsquo;s helpmate
dear.<br />To Hrothgar was given such glory of war,<br />such honor
of combat, that all his kin<br />obeyed him gladly till great grew his
band<br />of youthful comrades. It came in his mind<br />to bid his
henchmen a hall uprear,<br />ia master mead-house, mightier far<br />than
ever was seen by the sons of earth,<br />and within it, then, to old
and young<br />he would all allot that the Lord had sent him,<br />save
only the land and the lives of his men.<br />Wide, I heard, was the
work commanded,<br />for many a tribe this mid-earth round,<br />to
fashion the folkstead. It fell, as he ordered,<br />in rapid achievement
that ready it stood there,<br />of halls the noblest: Heorot <a name="citation1a"></a><a href="#footnote1a">{1a}</a>
he named it<br />whose message had might in many a land.<br />Not reckless
of promise, the rings he dealt,<br />treasure at banquet: there towered
the hall,<br />high, gabled wide, the hot surge waiting<br />of furious
flame. <a name="citation1b"></a><a href="#footnote1b">{1b}</a> Nor far
was that day<br />when father and son-in-law stood in feud<br />for
warfare and hatred that woke again. <a name="citation1c"></a><a href="#footnote1c">{1c}</a><br />With
envy and anger an evil spirit<br />endured the dole in his dark abode,<br />that
he heard each day the din of revel<br />high in the hall: there harps
rang out,<br />clear song of the singer. He sang who knew <a name="citation1d"></a><a href="#footnote1d">{1d}</a><br />tales
of the early time of man,<br />how the Almighty made the earth,<br />fairest
fields enfolded by water,<br />set, triumphant, sun and moon<br />for
a light to lighten the land-dwellers,<br />and braided bright the breast
of earth<br />with limbs and leaves, made life for all<br />of mortal
beings that breathe and move.<br />So lived the clansmen in cheer and
revel<br />a winsome life, till one began<br />to fashion evils, that
field of hell.<br />Grendel this monster grim was called,<br />march-riever
<a name="citation1e"></a><a href="#footnote1e">{1e}</a> mighty, in moorland
living,<br />in fen and fastness; fief of the giants<br />the hapless
wight a while had kept<br />since the Creator his exile doomed.<br />On
kin of Cain was the killing avenged<br />by sovran God for slaughtered
Abel.<br />Ill fared his feud, <a name="citation1f"></a><a href="#footnote1f">{1f}</a>
and far was he driven,<br />for the slaughter&rsquo;s sake, from sight
of men.<br />Of Cain awoke all that woful breed,<br />Etins <a name="citation1g"></a><a href="#footnote1g">{1g}</a>
and elves and evil-spirits,<br />as well as the giants that warred with
God<br />weary while: but their wage was paid them!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>II</p>
<p>WENT he forth to find at fall of night<br />that haughty house, and
heed wherever<br />the Ring-Danes, outrevelled, to rest had gone.<br />Found
within it the atheling band<br />asleep after feasting and fearless
of sorrow,<br />of human hardship. Unhallowed wight,<br />grim and greedy,
he grasped betimes,<br />wrathful, reckless, from resting-places,<br />thirty
of the thanes, and thence he rushed<br />fain of his fell spoil, faring
homeward,<br />laden with slaughter, his lair to seek.<br />Then at
the dawning, as day was breaking,<br />the might of Grendel to men was
known;<br />then after wassail was wail uplifted,<br />loud moan in
the morn. The mighty chief,<br />atheling excellent, unblithe sat,<br />labored
in woe for the loss of his thanes,<br />when once had been traced the
trail of the fiend,<br />spirit accurst: too cruel that sorrow,<br />too
long, too loathsome. Not late the respite;<br />with night returning,
anew began<br />ruthless murder; he recked no whit,<br />firm in his
guilt, of the feud and crime.<br />They were easy to find who elsewhere
sought<br />in room remote their rest at night,<br />bed in the bowers,
<a name="citation2a"></a><a href="#footnote2a">{2a}</a> when that bale
was shown,<br />was seen in sooth, with surest token, --<br />the hall-thane&rsquo;s
<a name="citation2b"></a><a href="#footnote2b">{2b}</a> hate. Such held
themselves<br />far and fast who the fiend outran!<br />Thus ruled unrighteous
and raged his fill<br />one against all; until empty stood<br />that
lordly building, and long it bode so.<br />Twelve years&rsquo; tide
the trouble he bore,<br />sovran of Scyldings, sorrows in plenty,<br />boundless
cares. There came unhidden<br />tidings true to the tribes of men,<br />in
sorrowful songs, how ceaselessly Grendel<br />harassed Hrothgar, what
hate he bore him,<br />what murder and massacre, many a year,<br />feud
unfading, -- refused consent<br />to deal with any of Daneland&rsquo;s
earls,<br />make pact of peace, or compound for gold:<br />still less
did the wise men ween to get<br />great fee for the feud from his fiendish
hands.<br />But the evil one ambushed old and young<br />death-shadow
dark, and dogged them still,<br />lured, or lurked in the livelong night<br />of
misty moorlands: men may say not<br />where the haunts of these Hell-Runes
<a name="citation2c"></a><a href="#footnote2c">{2c}</a> be.<br />Such
heaping of horrors the hater of men,<br />lonely roamer, wrought unceasing,<br />harassings
heavy. O&rsquo;er Heorot he lorded,<br />gold-bright hall, in gloomy
nights;<br />and ne&rsquo;er could the prince <a name="citation2d"></a><a href="#footnote2d">{2d}</a>
approach his throne,<br />-- &rsquo;twas judgment of God, -- or have
joy in his hall.<br />Sore was the sorrow to Scyldings&rsquo;-friend,<br />heart-rending
misery. Many nobles<br />sat assembled, and searched out counsel<br />how
it were best for bold-hearted men<br />against harassing terror to try
their hand.<br />Whiles they vowed in their heathen fanes<br />altar-offerings,
asked with words <a name="citation2e"></a><a href="#footnote2e">{2e}</a><br />that
the slayer-of-souls would succor give them<br />for the pain of their
people. Their practice this,<br />their heathen hope; &rsquo;twas Hell
they thought of<br />in mood of their mind. Almighty they knew not,<br />Doomsman
of Deeds and dreadful Lord,<br />nor Heaven&rsquo;s-Helmet heeded they
ever,<br />Wielder-of-Wonder. -- Woe for that man<br />who in harm and
hatred hales his soul<br />to fiery embraces; -- nor favor nor change<br />awaits
he ever. But well for him<br />that after death-day may draw to his
Lord,<br />and friendship find in the Father&rsquo;s arms!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>III</p>
<p>THUS seethed unceasing the son of Healfdene<br />with the woe of
these days; not wisest men<br />assuaged his sorrow; too sore the anguish,<br />loathly
and long, that lay on his folk,<br />most baneful of burdens and bales
of the night.</p>
<p>This heard in his home Hygelac&rsquo;s thane,<br />great among Geats,
of Grendel&rsquo;s doings.<br />He was the mightiest man of valor<br />in
that same day of this our life,<br />stalwart and stately. A stout wave-walker<br />he
bade make ready. Yon battle-king, said he,<br />far o&rsquo;er the swan-road
he fain would seek,<br />the noble monarch who needed men!<br />The
prince&rsquo;s journey by prudent folk<br />was little blamed, though
they loved him dear;<br />they whetted the hero, and hailed good omens.<br />And
now the bold one from bands of Geats<br />comrades chose, the keenest
of warriors<br />e&rsquo;er he could find; with fourteen men<br />the
sea-wood <a name="citation3a"></a><a href="#footnote3a">{3a}</a> he
sought, and, sailor proved,<br />led them on to the land&rsquo;s confines.<br />Time
had now flown; <a name="citation3b"></a><a href="#footnote3b">{3b}</a>
afloat was the ship,<br />boat under bluff. On board they climbed,<br />warriors
ready; waves were churning<br />sea with sand; the sailors bore<br />on
the breast of the bark their bright array,<br />their mail and weapons:
the men pushed off,<br />on its willing way, the well-braced craft.<br />Then
moved o&rsquo;er the waters by might of the wind<br />that bark like
a bird with breast of foam,<br />till in season due, on the second day,<br />the
curved prow such course had run<br />that sailors now could see the
land,<br />sea-cliffs shining, steep high hills,<br />headlands broad.
Their haven was found,<br />their journey ended. Up then quickly<br />the
Weders&rsquo; <a name="citation3c"></a><a href="#footnote3c">{3c}</a>
clansmen climbed ashore,<br />anchored their sea-wood, with armor clashing<br />and
gear of battle: God they thanked<br />or passing in peace o&rsquo;er
the paths of the sea.<br />Now saw from the cliff a Scylding clansman,<br />a
warden that watched the water-side,<br />how they bore o&rsquo;er the
gangway glittering shields,<br />war-gear in readiness; wonder seized
him<br />to know what manner of men they were.<br />Straight to the
strand his steed he rode,<br />Hrothgar&rsquo;s henchman; with hand
of might<br />he shook his spear, and spake in parley.<br />&ldquo;Who
are ye, then, ye armed men,<br />mailed folk, that yon mighty vessel<br />have
urged thus over the ocean ways,<br />here o&rsquo;er the waters? A warden
I,<br />sentinel set o&rsquo;er the sea-march here,<br />lest any foe
to the folk of Danes<br />with harrying fleet should harm the land.<br />No
aliens ever at ease thus bore them,<br />linden-wielders: <a name="citation3d"></a><a href="#footnote3d">{3d}</a>
yet word-of-leave<br />clearly ye lack from clansmen here,<br />my folk&rsquo;s
agreement. -- A greater ne&rsquo;er saw I<br />of warriors in world
than is one of you, --<br />yon hero in harness! No henchman he<br />worthied
by weapons, if witness his features,<br />his peerless presence! I pray
you, though, tell<br />your folk and home, lest hence ye fare<br />suspect
to wander your way as spies<br />in Danish land. Now, dwellers afar,<br />ocean-travellers,
take from me<br />simple advice: the sooner the better<br />I hear of
the country whence ye came.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>IV</p>
<p>To him the stateliest spake in answer;<br />the warriors&rsquo; leader
his word-hoard unlocked: --<br />&ldquo;We are by kin of the clan of
Geats,<br />and Hygelac&rsquo;s own hearth-fellows we.<br />To folk
afar was my father known,<br />noble atheling, Ecgtheow named.<br />Full
of winters, he fared away<br />aged from earth; he is honored still<br />through
width of the world by wise men all.<br />To thy lord and liege in loyal
mood<br />we hasten hither, to Healfdene&rsquo;s son,<br />people-protector:
be pleased to advise us!<br />To that mighty-one come we on mickle errand,<br />to
the lord of the Danes; nor deem I right<br />that aught be hidden. We
hear -- thou knowest<br />if sooth it is -- the saying of men,<br />that
amid the Scyldings a scathing monster,<br />dark ill-doer, in dusky
nights<br />shows terrific his rage unmatched,<br />hatred and murder.
To Hrothgar I<br />in greatness of soul would succor bring,<br />so
the Wise-and-Brave <a name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a">{4a}</a>
may worst his foes, --<br />if ever the end of ills is fated,<br />of
cruel contest, if cure shall follow,<br />and the boiling care-waves
cooler grow;<br />else ever afterward anguish-days<br />he shall suffer
in sorrow while stands in place<br />high on its hill that house unpeered!&rdquo;<br />Astride
his steed, the strand-ward answered,<br />clansman unquailing: &ldquo;The
keen-souled thane<br />must be skilled to sever and sunder duly<br />words
and works, if he well intends.<br />I gather, this band is graciously
bent<br />to the Scyldings&rsquo; master. March, then, bearing<br />weapons
and weeds the way I show you.<br />I will bid my men your boat meanwhile<br />to
guard for fear lest foemen come, --<br />your new-tarred ship by shore
of ocean<br />faithfully watching till once again<br />it waft o&rsquo;er
the waters those well-loved thanes,<br />-- winding-neck&rsquo;d wood,
-- to Weders&rsquo; bounds,<br />heroes such as the hest of fate<br />shall
succor and save from the shock of war.&rdquo;<br />They bent them to
march, -- the boat lay still,<br />fettered by cable and fast at anchor,<br />broad-bosomed
ship. -- Then shone the boars <a name="citation4b"></a><a href="#footnote4b">{4b}</a><br />over
the cheek-guard; chased with gold,<br />keen and gleaming, guard it
kept<br />o&rsquo;er the man of war, as marched along<br />heroes in
haste, till the hall they saw,<br />broad of gable and bright with gold:<br />that
was the fairest, &rsquo;mid folk of earth,<br />of houses &rsquo;neath
heaven, where Hrothgar lived,<br />and the gleam of it lightened o&rsquo;er
lands afar.<br />The sturdy shieldsman showed that bright<br />burg-of-the-boldest;
bade them go<br />straightway thither; his steed then turned,<br />hardy
hero, and hailed them thus: --<br />&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis time that I fare
from you. Father Almighty<br />in grace and mercy guard you well,<br />safe
in your seekings. Seaward I go,<br />&rsquo;gainst hostile warriors
hold my watch.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>V</p>
<p>STONE-BRIGHT the street: <a name="citation5a"></a><a href="#footnote5a">{5a}</a>
it showed the way<br />to the crowd of clansmen. Corselets glistened<br />hand-forged,
hard; on their harness bright<br />the steel ring sang, as they strode
along<br />in mail of battle, and marched to the hall.<br />There, weary
of ocean, the wall along<br />they set their bucklers, their broad shields,
down,<br />and bowed them to bench: the breastplates clanged,<br />war-gear
of men; their weapons stacked,<br />spears of the seafarers stood together,<br />gray-tipped
ash: that iron band<br />was worthily weaponed! -- A warrior proud<br />asked
of the heroes their home and kin.<br />&ldquo;Whence, now, bear ye burnished
shields,<br />harness gray and helmets grim,<br />spears in multitude?
Messenger, I,<br />Hrothgar&rsquo;s herald! Heroes so many<br />ne&rsquo;er
met I as strangers of mood so strong.<br />&rsquo;Tis plain that for
prowess, not plunged into exile,<br />for high-hearted valor, Hrothgar
ye seek!&rdquo;<br />Him the sturdy-in-war bespake with words,<br />proud
earl of the Weders answer made,<br />hardy &rsquo;neath helmet: -- &ldquo;Hygelac&rsquo;s,
we,<br />fellows at board; I am Beowulf named.<br />I am seeking to
say to the son of Healfdene<br />this mission of mine, to thy master-lord,<br />the
doughty prince, if he deign at all<br />grace that we greet him, the
good one, now.&rdquo;<br />Wulfgar spake, the Wendles&rsquo; chieftain,<br />whose
might of mind to many was known,<br />his courage and counsel: &ldquo;The
king of Danes,<br />the Scyldings&rsquo; friend, I fain will tell,<br />the
Breaker-of-Rings, as the boon thou askest,<br />the famed prince, of
thy faring hither,<br />and, swiftly after, such answer bring<br />as
the doughty monarch may deign to give.&rdquo;<br />Hied then in haste
to where Hrothgar sat<br />white-haired and old, his earls about him,<br />till
the stout thane stood at the shoulder there<br />of the Danish king:
good courtier he!<br />Wulfgar spake to his winsome lord: --<br />&ldquo;Hither
have fared to thee far-come men<br />o&rsquo;er the paths of ocean,
people of Geatland;<br />and the stateliest there by his sturdy band<br />is
Beowulf named. This boon they seek,<br />that they, my master, may with
thee<br />have speech at will: nor spurn their prayer<br />to give them
hearing, gracious Hrothgar!<br />In weeds of the warrior worthy they,<br />methinks,
of our liking; their leader most surely,<br />a hero that hither his
henchmen has led.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>VI</p>
<p>HROTHGAR answered, helmet of Scyldings: --<br />&ldquo;I knew him
of yore in his youthful days;<br />his aged father was Ecgtheow named,<br />to
whom, at home, gave Hrethel the Geat<br />his only daughter. Their offspring
bold<br />fares hither to seek the steadfast friend.<br />And seamen,
too, have said me this, --<br />who carried my gifts to the Geatish
court,<br />thither for thanks, -- he has thirty men&rsquo;s<br />heft
of grasp in the gripe of his hand,<br />the bold-in-battle. Blessed
God<br />out of his mercy this man hath sent<br />to Danes of the West,
as I ween indeed,<br />against horror of Grendel. I hope to give<br />the
good youth gold for his gallant thought.<br />Be thou in haste, and
bid them hither,<br />clan of kinsmen, to come before me;<br />and add
this word, -- they are welcome guests<br />to folk of the Danes.&rdquo;<br />[To
the door of the hall<br />Wulfgar went] and the word declared: --<br />&ldquo;To
you this message my master sends,<br />East-Danes&rsquo; king, that
your kin he knows,<br />hardy heroes, and hails you all<br />welcome
hither o&rsquo;er waves of the sea!<br />Ye may wend your way in war-attire,<br />and
under helmets Hrothgar greet;<br />but let here the battle-shields bide
your parley,<br />and wooden war-shafts wait its end.&rdquo;<br />Uprose
the mighty one, ringed with his men,<br />brave band of thanes: some
bode without,<br />battle-gear guarding, as bade the chief.<br />Then
hied that troop where the herald led them,<br />under Heorot&rsquo;s
roof: [the hero strode,]<br />hardy &rsquo;neath helm, till the hearth
he neared.<br />Beowulf spake, -- his breastplate gleamed,<br />war-net
woven by wit of the smith: --<br />&ldquo;Thou Hrothgar, hail! Hygelac&rsquo;s
I,<br />kinsman and follower. Fame a plenty<br />have I gained in youth!
These Grendel-deeds<br />I heard in my home-land heralded clear.<br />Seafarers
say how stands this hall,<br />of buildings best, for your band of thanes<br />empty
and idle, when evening sun<br />in the harbor of heaven is hidden away.<br />So
my vassals advised me well, --<br />brave and wise, the best of men,
--<br />O sovran Hrothgar, to seek thee here,<br />for my nerve and
my might they knew full well.<br />Themselves had seen me from slaughter
come<br />blood-flecked from foes, where five I bound,<br />and that
wild brood worsted. I&rsquo; the waves I slew<br />nicors <a name="citation6a"></a><a href="#footnote6a">{6a}</a>
by night, in need and peril<br />avenging the Weders, <a name="citation6b"></a><a href="#footnote6b">{6b}</a>
whose woe they sought, --<br />crushing the grim ones. Grendel now,<br />monster
cruel, be mine to quell<br />in single battle! So, from thee,<br />thou
sovran of the Shining-Danes,<br />Scyldings&rsquo;-bulwark, a boon I
seek, --<br />and, Friend-of-the-folk, refuse it not,<br />O Warriors&rsquo;-shield,
now I&rsquo;ve wandered far, --<br />that I alone with my liegemen here,<br />this
hardy band, may Heorot purge!<br />More I hear, that the monster dire,<br />in
his wanton mood, of weapons recks not;<br />hence shall I scorn -- so
Hygelac stay,<br />king of my kindred, kind to me! --<br />brand or
buckler to bear in the fight,<br />gold-colored targe: but with gripe
alone<br />must I front the fiend and fight for life,<br />foe against
foe. Then faith be his<br />in the doom of the Lord whom death shall
take.<br />Fain, I ween, if the fight he win,<br />in this hall of gold
my Geatish band<br />will he fearless eat, -- as oft before, --<br />my
noblest thanes. Nor need&rsquo;st thou then<br />to hide my head; <a name="citation6c"></a><a href="#footnote6c">{6c}</a>
for his shall I be,<br />dyed in gore, if death must take me;<br />and
my blood-covered body he&rsquo;ll bear as prey,<br />ruthless devour
it, the roamer-lonely,<br />with my life-blood redden his lair in the
fen:<br />no further for me need&rsquo;st food prepare!<br />To Hygelac
send, if Hild <a name="citation6d"></a><a href="#footnote6d">{6d}</a>
should take me,<br />best of war-weeds, warding my breast,<br />armor
excellent, heirloom of Hrethel<br />and work of Wayland. <a name="citation6e"></a><a href="#footnote6e">{6e}</a>
Fares Wyrd <a name="citation6f"></a><a href="#footnote6f">{6f}</a> as
she must.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>VII</p>
<p>HROTHGAR spake, the Scyldings&rsquo;-helmet: --<br />&ldquo;For fight
defensive, Friend my Beowulf,<br />to succor and save, thou hast sought
us here.<br />Thy father&rsquo;s combat <a name="citation7a"></a><a href="#footnote7a">{7a}</a>
a feud enkindled<br />when Heatholaf with hand he slew<br />among the
Wylfings; his Weder kin<br />for horror of fighting feared to hold him.<br />Fleeing,
he sought our South-Dane folk,<br />over surge of ocean the Honor-Scyldings,<br />when
first I was ruling the folk of Danes,<br />wielded, youthful, this widespread
realm,<br />this hoard-hold of heroes. Heorogar was dead,<br />my elder
brother, had breathed his last,<br />Healfdene&rsquo;s bairn: he was
better than I!<br />Straightway the feud with fee <a name="citation7b"></a><a href="#footnote7b">{7b}</a>
I settled,<br />to the Wylfings sent, o&rsquo;er watery ridges,<br />treasures
olden: oaths he <a name="citation7c"></a><a href="#footnote7c">{7c}</a>
swore me.<br />Sore is my soul to say to any<br />of the race of man
what ruth for me<br />in Heorot Grendel with hate hath wrought,<br />what
sudden harryings. Hall-folk fail me,<br />my warriors wane; for Wyrd
hath swept them<br />into Grendel&rsquo;s grasp. But God is able<br />this
deadly foe from his deeds to turn!<br />Boasted full oft, as my beer
they drank,<br />earls o&rsquo;er the ale-cup, armed men,<br />that
they would bide in the beer-hall here,<br />Grendel&rsquo;s attack with
terror of blades.<br />Then was this mead-house at morning tide<br />dyed
with gore, when the daylight broke,<br />all the boards of the benches
blood-besprinkled,<br />gory the hall: I had heroes the less,<br />doughty
dear-ones that death had reft.<br />-- But sit to the banquet, unbind
thy words,<br />hardy hero, as heart shall prompt thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gathered together, the Geatish men<br />in the banquet-hall on bench
assigned,<br />sturdy-spirited, sat them down,<br />hardy-hearted. A
henchman attended,<br />carried the carven cup in hand,<br />served
the clear mead. Oft minstrels sang<br />blithe in Heorot. Heroes revelled,<br />no
dearth of warriors, Weder and Dane.</p>

<p>VIII</p>
<p>UNFERTH spake, the son of Ecglaf,<br />who sat at the feet of the
Scyldings&rsquo; lord,<br />unbound the battle-runes. <a name="citation8a"></a><a href="#footnote8a">{8a}</a>
-- Beowulf&rsquo;s quest,<br />sturdy seafarer&rsquo;s, sorely galled
him;<br />ever he envied that other men<br />should more achieve in
middle-earth<br />of fame under heaven than he himself. --<br />&ldquo;Art
thou that Beowulf, Breca&rsquo;s rival,<br />who emulous swam on the
open sea,<br />when for pride the pair of you proved the floods,<br />and
wantonly dared in waters deep<br />to risk your lives? No living man,<br />or
lief or loath, from your labor dire<br />could you dissuade, from swimming
the main.<br />Ocean-tides with your arms ye covered,<br />with strenuous
hands the sea-streets measured,<br />swam o&rsquo;er the waters. Winter&rsquo;s
storm<br />rolled the rough waves. In realm of sea<br />a sennight strove
ye. In swimming he topped thee,<br />had more of main! Him at morning-tide<br />billows
bore to the Battling Reamas,<br />whence he hied to his home so dear<br />beloved
of his liegemen, to land of Brondings,<br />fastness fair, where his
folk he ruled,<br />town and treasure. In triumph o&rsquo;er thee<br />Beanstan&rsquo;s
bairn <a name="citation8b"></a><a href="#footnote8b">{8b}</a> his boast
achieved.<br />So ween I for thee a worse adventure<br />-- though in
buffet of battle thou brave hast been,<br />in struggle grim, -- if
Grendel&rsquo;s approach<br />thou darst await through the watch of
night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow: --<br />&ldquo;What a deal hast
uttered, dear my Unferth,<br />drunken with beer, of Breca now,<br />told
of his triumph! Truth I claim it,<br />that I had more of might in the
sea<br />than any man else, more ocean-endurance.<br />We twain had
talked, in time of youth,<br />and made our boast, -- we were merely
boys,<br />striplings still, -- to stake our lives<br />far at sea:
and so we performed it.<br />Naked swords, as we swam along,<br />we
held in hand, with hope to guard us<br />against the whales. Not a whit
from me<br />could he float afar o&rsquo;er the flood of waves,<br />haste
o&rsquo;er the billows; nor him I abandoned.<br />Together we twain
on the tides abode<br />five nights full till the flood divided us,<br />churning
waves and chillest weather,<br />darkling night, and the northern wind<br />ruthless
rushed on us: rough was the surge.<br />Now the wrath of the sea-fish
rose apace;<br />yet me &rsquo;gainst the monsters my mailed coat,<br />hard
and hand-linked, help afforded, --<br />battle-sark braided my breast
to ward,<br />garnished with gold. There grasped me firm<br />and haled
me to bottom the hated foe,<br />with grimmest gripe. &rsquo;Twas granted
me, though,<br />to pierce the monster with point of sword,<br />with
blade of battle: huge beast of the sea<br />was whelmed by the hurly
through hand of mine.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>IX</p>
<p>ME thus often the evil monsters<br />thronging threatened. With thrust
of my sword,<br />the darling, I dealt them due return!<br />Nowise
had they bliss from their booty then<br />to devour their victim, vengeful
creatures,<br />seated to banquet at bottom of sea;<br />but at break
of day, by my brand sore hurt,<br />on the edge of ocean up they lay,<br />put
to sleep by the sword. And since, by them<br />on the fathomless sea-ways
sailor-folk<br />are never molested. -- Light from east,<br />came bright
God&rsquo;s beacon; the billows sank,<br />so that I saw the sea-cliffs
high,<br />windy walls. For Wyrd oft saveth<br />earl undoomed if he
doughty be!<br />And so it came that I killed with my sword<br />nine
of the nicors. Of night-fought battles<br />ne&rsquo;er heard I a harder
&rsquo;neath heaven&rsquo;s dome,<br />nor adrift on the deep a more
desolate man!<br />Yet I came unharmed from that hostile clutch,<br />though
spent with swimming. The sea upbore me,<br />flood of the tide, on Finnish
land,<br />the welling waters. No wise of thee<br />have I heard men
tell such terror of falchions,<br />bitter battle. Breca ne&rsquo;er
yet,<br />not one of you pair, in the play of war<br />such daring deed
has done at all<br />with bloody brand, -- I boast not of it! --<br />though
thou wast the bane <a name="citation9a"></a><a href="#footnote9a">{9a}</a>
of thy brethren dear,<br />thy closest kin, whence curse of hell<br />awaits
thee, well as thy wit may serve!<br />For I say in sooth, thou son of
Ecglaf,<br />never had Grendel these grim deeds wrought,<br />monster
dire, on thy master dear,<br />in Heorot such havoc, if heart of thine<br />were
as battle-bold as thy boast is loud!<br />But he has found no feud will
happen;<br />from sword-clash dread of your Danish clan<br />he vaunts
him safe, from the Victor-Scyldings.<br />He forces pledges, favors
none<br />of the land of Danes, but lustily murders,<br />fights and
feasts, nor feud he dreads<br />from Spear-Dane men. But speedily now<br />shall
I prove him the prowess and pride of the Geats,<br />shall bid him battle.
Blithe to mead<br />go he that listeth, when light of dawn<br />this
morrow morning o&rsquo;er men of earth,<br />ether-robed sun from the
south shall beam!&rdquo;<br />Joyous then was the Jewel-giver,<br />hoar-haired,
war-brave; help awaited<br />the Bright-Danes&rsquo; prince, from Beowulf
hearing,<br />folk&rsquo;s good shepherd, such firm resolve.<br />Then
was laughter of liegemen loud resounding<br />with winsome words. Came
Wealhtheow forth,<br />queen of Hrothgar, heedful of courtesy,<br />gold-decked,
greeting the guests in hall;<br />and the high-born lady handed the
cup<br />first to the East-Danes&rsquo; heir and warden,<br />bade him
be blithe at the beer-carouse,<br />the land&rsquo;s beloved one. Lustily
took he<br />banquet and beaker, battle-famed king.</p>
<p>Through the hall then went the Helmings&rsquo; Lady,<br />to younger
and older everywhere<br />carried the cup, till come the moment<br />when
the ring-graced queen, the royal-hearted,<br />to Beowulf bore the beaker
of mead.<br />She greeted the Geats&rsquo; lord, God she thanked,<br />in
wisdom&rsquo;s words, that her will was granted,<br />that at last on
a hero her hope could lean<br />for comfort in terrors. The cup he took,<br />hardy-in-war,
from Wealhtheow&rsquo;s hand,<br />and answer uttered the eager-for-combat.<br />Beowulf
spake, bairn of Ecgtheow: --<br />&ldquo;This was my thought, when my
thanes and I<br />bent to the ocean and entered our boat,<br />that
I would work the will of your people<br />fully, or fighting fall in
death,<br />in fiend&rsquo;s gripe fast. I am firm to do<br />an earl&rsquo;s
brave deed, or end the days<br />of this life of mine in the mead-hall
here.&rdquo;<br />Well these words to the woman seemed,<br />Beowulf&rsquo;s
battle-boast. -- Bright with gold<br />the stately dame by her spouse
sat down.<br />Again, as erst, began in hall<br />warriors&rsquo; wassail
and words of power,<br />the proud-band&rsquo;s revel, till presently<br />the
son of Healfdene hastened to seek<br />rest for the night; he knew there
waited<br />fight for the fiend in that festal hall,<br />when the sheen
of the sun they saw no more,<br />and dusk of night sank darkling nigh,<br />and
shadowy shapes came striding on,<br />wan under welkin. The warriors
rose.<br />Man to man, he made harangue,<br />Hrothgar to Beowulf, bade
him hail,<br />let him wield the wine hall: a word he added: --<br />&ldquo;Never
to any man erst I trusted,<br />since I could heave up hand and shield,<br />this
noble Dane-Hall, till now to thee.<br />Have now and hold this house
unpeered;<br />remember thy glory; thy might declare;<br />watch for
the foe! No wish shall fail thee<br />if thou bidest the battle with
bold-won life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>X</p>
<p>THEN Hrothgar went with his hero-train,<br />defence-of-Scyldings,
forth from hall;<br />fain would the war-lord Wealhtheow seek,<br />couch
of his queen. The King-of-Glory<br />against this Grendel a guard had
set,<br />so heroes heard, a hall-defender,<br />who warded the monarch
and watched for the monster.<br />In truth, the Geats&rsquo; prince
gladly trusted<br />his mettle, his might, the mercy of God!<br />Cast
off then his corselet of iron,<br />helmet from head; to his henchman
gave, --<br />choicest of weapons, -- the well-chased sword,<br />bidding
him guard the gear of battle.<br />Spake then his Vaunt the valiant
man,<br />Beowulf Geat, ere the bed be sought: --<br />&ldquo;Of force
in fight no feebler I count me,<br />in grim war-deeds, than Grendel
deems him.<br />Not with the sword, then, to sleep of death<br />his
life will I give, though it lie in my power.<br />No skill is his to
strike against me,<br />my shield to hew though he hardy be,<br />bold
in battle; we both, this night,<br />shall spurn the sword, if he seek
me here,<br />unweaponed, for war. Let wisest God,<br />sacred Lord,
on which side soever<br />doom decree as he deemeth right.&rdquo;<br />Reclined
then the chieftain, and cheek-pillows held<br />the head of the earl,
while all about him<br />seamen hardy on hall-beds sank.<br />None of
them thought that thence their steps<br />to the folk and fastness that
fostered them,<br />to the land they loved, would lead them back!<br />Full
well they wist that on warriors many<br />battle-death seized, in the
banquet-hall,<br />of Danish clan. But comfort and help,<br />war-weal
weaving, to Weder folk<br />the Master gave, that, by might of one,<br />over
their enemy all prevailed,<br />by single strength. In sooth &rsquo;tis
told<br />that highest God o&rsquo;er human kind<br />hath wielded ever!
-- Thro&rsquo; wan night striding,<br />came the walker-in-shadow. Warriors
slept<br />whose hest was to guard the gabled hall, --<br />all save
one. &rsquo;Twas widely known<br />that against God&rsquo;s will the
ghostly ravager<br />him <a name="citation10a"></a><a href="#footnote10a">{10a}</a>
could not hurl to haunts of darkness;<br />wakeful, ready, with warrior&rsquo;s
wrath,<br />bold he bided the battle&rsquo;s issue.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XI</p>
<p>THEN from the moorland, by misty crags,<br />with God&rsquo;s wrath
laden, Grendel came.<br />The monster was minded of mankind now<br />sundry
to seize in the stately house.<br />Under welkin he walked, till the
wine-palace there,<br />gold-hall of men, he gladly discerned,<br />flashing
with fretwork. Not first time, this,<br />that he the home of Hrothgar
sought, --<br />yet ne&rsquo;er in his life-day, late or early,<br />such
hardy heroes, such hall-thanes, found!<br />To the house the warrior
walked apace,<br />parted from peace; <a name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a">{11a}</a>
the portal opended,<br />though with forged bolts fast, when his fists
had<br />struck it,<br />and baleful he burst in his blatant rage,<br />the
house&rsquo;s mouth. All hastily, then,<br />o&rsquo;er fair-paved floor
the fiend trod on,<br />ireful he strode; there streamed from his eyes<br />fearful
flashes, like flame to see.</p>
<p>He spied in hall the hero-band,<br />kin and clansmen clustered asleep,<br />hardy
liegemen. Then laughed his heart;<br />for the monster was minded, ere
morn should dawn,<br />savage, to sever the soul of each,<br />life
from body, since lusty banquet<br />waited his will! But Wyrd forbade
him<br />to seize any more of men on earth<br />after that evening.
Eagerly watched<br />Hygelac&rsquo;s kinsman his cursed foe,<br />how
he would fare in fell attack.<br />Not that the monster was minded to
pause!<br />Straightway he seized a sleeping warrior<br />for the first,
and tore him fiercely asunder,<br />the bone-frame bit, drank blood
in streams,<br />swallowed him piecemeal: swiftly thus<br />the lifeless
corse was clear devoured,<br />e&rsquo;en feet and hands. Then farther
he hied;<br />for the hardy hero with hand he grasped,<br />felt for
the foe with fiendish claw,<br />for the hero reclining, -- who clutched
it boldly,<br />prompt to answer, propped on his arm.<br />Soon then
saw that shepherd-of-evils<br />that never he met in this middle-world,<br />in
the ways of earth, another wight<br />with heavier hand-gripe; at heart
he feared,<br />sorrowed in soul, -- none the sooner escaped!<br />Fain
would he flee, his fastness seek,<br />the den of devils: no doings
now<br />such as oft he had done in days of old!<br />Then bethought
him the hardy Hygelac-thane<br />of his boast at evening: up he bounded,<br />grasped
firm his foe, whose fingers cracked.<br />The fiend made off, but the
earl close followed.<br />The monster meant -- if he might at all --<br />to
fling himself free, and far away<br />fly to the fens, -- knew his fingers&rsquo;
power<br />in the gripe of the grim one. Gruesome march<br />to Heorot
this monster of harm had made!<br />Din filled the room; the Danes were
bereft,<br />castle-dwellers and clansmen all,<br />earls, of their
ale. Angry were both<br />those savage hall-guards: the house resounded.<br />Wonder
it was the wine-hall firm<br />in the strain of their struggle stood,
to earth<br />the fair house fell not; too fast it was<br />within and
without by its iron bands<br />craftily clamped; though there crashed
from sill<br />many a mead-bench -- men have told me --<br />gay with
gold, where the grim foes wrestled.<br />So well had weened the wisest
Scyldings<br />that not ever at all might any man<br />that bone-decked,
brave house break asunder,<br />crush by craft, -- unless clasp of fire<br />in
smoke engulfed it. -- Again uprose<br />din redoubled. Danes of the
North<br />with fear and frenzy were filled, each one,<br />who from
the wall that wailing heard,<br />God&rsquo;s foe sounding his grisly
song,<br />cry of the conquered, clamorous pain<br />from captive of
hell. Too closely held him<br />he who of men in might was strongest<br />in
that same day of this our life.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XII</p>
<p>NOT in any wise would the earls&rsquo;-defence <a name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a">{12a}</a><br />suffer
that slaughterous stranger to live,<br />useless deeming his days and
years<br />to men on earth. Now many an earl<br />of Beowulf brandished
blade ancestral,<br />fain the life of their lord to shield,<br />their
praised prince, if power were theirs;<br />never they knew, -- as they
neared the foe,<br />hardy-hearted heroes of war,<br />aiming their
swords on every side<br />the accursed to kill, -- no keenest blade,<br />no
farest of falchions fashioned on earth,<br />could harm or hurt that
hideous fiend!<br />He was safe, by his spells, from sword of battle,<br />from
edge of iron. Yet his end and parting<br />on that same day of this
our life<br />woful should be, and his wandering soul<br />far off flit
to the fiends&rsquo; domain.<br />Soon he found, who in former days,<br />harmful
in heart and hated of God,<br />on many a man such murder wrought,<br />that
the frame of his body failed him now.<br />For him the keen-souled kinsman
of Hygelac<br />held in hand; hateful alive<br />was each to other.
The outlaw dire<br />took mortal hurt; a mighty wound<br />showed on
his shoulder, and sinews cracked,<br />and the bone-frame burst. To
Beowulf now<br />the glory was given, and Grendel thence<br />death-sick
his den in the dark moor sought,<br />noisome abode: he knew too well<br />that
here was the last of life, an end<br />of his days on earth. -- To all
the Danes<br />by that bloody battle the boon had come.<br />From ravage
had rescued the roving stranger<br />Hrothgar&rsquo;s hall; the hardy
and wise one<br />had purged it anew. His night-work pleased him,<br />his
deed and its honor. To Eastern Danes<br />had the valiant Geat his vaunt
made good,<br />all their sorrow and ills assuaged,<br />their bale
of battle borne so long,<br />and all the dole they erst endured<br />pain
a-plenty. -- &rsquo;Twas proof of this,<br />when the hardy-in-fight
a hand laid down,<br />arm and shoulder, -- all, indeed,<br />of Grendel&rsquo;s
gripe, -- &rsquo;neath the gabled roof.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XIII</p>
<p>MANY at morning, as men have told me,<br />warriors gathered the
gift-hall round,<br />folk-leaders faring from far and near,<br />o&rsquo;er
wide-stretched ways, the wonder to view,<br />trace of the traitor.
Not troublous seemed<br />the enemy&rsquo;s end to any man<br />who
saw by the gait of the graceless foe<br />how the weary-hearted, away
from thence,<br />baffled in battle and banned, his steps<br />death-marked
dragged to the devils&rsquo; mere.<br />Bloody the billows were boiling
there,<br />turbid the tide of tumbling waves<br />horribly seething,
with sword-blood hot,<br />by that doomed one dyed, who in den of the
moor<br />laid forlorn his life adown,<br />his heathen soul, and hell
received it.<br />Home then rode the hoary clansmen<br />from that merry
journey, and many a youth,<br />on horses white, the hardy warriors,<br />back
from the mere. Then Beowulf&rsquo;s glory<br />eager they echoed, and
all averred<br />that from sea to sea, or south or north,<br />there
was no other in earth&rsquo;s domain,<br />under vault of heaven, more
valiant found,<br />of warriors none more worthy to rule!<br />(On their
lord beloved they laid no slight,<br />gracious Hrothgar: a good king
he!)<br />From time to time, the tried-in-battle<br />their gray steeds
set to gallop amain,<br />and ran a race when the road seemed fair.<br />From
time to time, a thane of the king,<br />who had made many vaunts, and
was mindful of verses,<br />stored with sagas and songs of old,<br />bound
word to word in well-knit rime,<br />welded his lay; this warrior soon<br />of
Beowulf&rsquo;s quest right cleverly sang,<br />and artfully added an
excellent tale,<br />in well-ranged words, of the warlike deeds<br />he
had heard in saga of Sigemund.<br />Strange the story: he said it all,
--<br />the Waelsing&rsquo;s wanderings wide, his struggles,<br />which
never were told to tribes of men,<br />the feuds and the frauds, save
to Fitela only,<br />when of these doings he deigned to speak,<br />uncle
to nephew; as ever the twain<br />stood side by side in stress of war,<br />and
multitude of the monster kind<br />they had felled with their swords.
Of Sigemund grew,<br />when he passed from life, no little praise;<br />for
the doughty-in-combat a dragon killed<br />that herded the hoard: <a name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a">{13a}</a>
under hoary rock<br />the atheling dared the deed alone<br />fearful
quest, nor was Fitela there.<br />Yet so it befell, his falchion pierced<br />that
wondrous worm, -- on the wall it struck,<br />best blade; the dragon
died in its blood.<br />Thus had the dread-one by daring achieved<br />over
the ring-hoard to rule at will,<br />himself to pleasure; a sea-boat
he loaded,<br />and bore on its bosom the beaming gold,<br />son of
Waels; the worm was consumed.<br />He had of all heroes the highest
renown<br />among races of men, this refuge-of-warriors,<br />for deeds
of daring that decked his name<br />since the hand and heart of Heremod<br />grew
slack in battle. He, swiftly banished<br />to mingle with monsters at
mercy of foes,<br />to death was betrayed; for torrents of sorrow<br />had
lamed him too long; a load of care<br />to earls and athelings all he
proved.<br />Oft indeed, in earlier days,<br />for the warrior&rsquo;s
wayfaring wise men mourned,<br />who had hoped of him help from harm
and bale,<br />and had thought their sovran&rsquo;s son would thrive,<br />follow
his father, his folk protect,<br />the hoard and the stronghold, heroes&rsquo;
land,<br />home of Scyldings. -- But here, thanes said,<br />the kinsman
of Hygelac kinder seemed<br />to all: the other <a name="citation13b"></a><a href="#footnote13b">{13b}</a>
was urged to crime!<br />And afresh to the race, <a name="citation13c"></a><a href="#footnote13c">{13c}</a>
the fallow roads<br />by swift steeds measured! The morning sun<br />was
climbing higher. Clansmen hastened<br />to the high-built hall, those
hardy-minded,<br />the wonder to witness. Warden of treasure,<br />crowned
with glory, the king himself,<br />with stately band from the bride-bower
strode;<br />and with him the queen and her crowd of maidens<br />measured
the path to the mead-house fair.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XIV</p>
<p>HROTHGAR spake, -- to the hall he went,<br />stood by the steps,
the steep roof saw,<br />garnished with gold, and Grendel&rsquo;s hand:
--<br />&ldquo;For the sight I see to the Sovran Ruler<br />be speedy
thanks! A throng of sorrows<br />I have borne from Grendel; but God
still works<br />wonder on wonder, the Warden-of-Glory.<br />It was
but now that I never more<br />for woes that weighed on me waited help<br />long
as I lived, when, laved in blood,<br />stood sword-gore-stained this
stateliest house, --<br />widespread woe for wise men all,<br />who
had no hope to hinder ever<br />foes infernal and fiendish sprites<br />from
havoc in hall. This hero now,<br />by the Wielder&rsquo;s might, a work
has done<br />that not all of us erst could ever do<br />by wile and
wisdom. Lo, well can she say<br />whoso of women this warrior bore<br />among
sons of men, if still she liveth,<br />that the God of the ages was
good to her<br />in the birth of her bairn. Now, Beowulf, thee,<br />of
heroes best, I shall heartily love<br />as mine own, my son; preserve
thou ever<br />this kinship new: thou shalt never lack<br />wealth of
the world that I wield as mine!<br />Full oft for less have I largess
showered,<br />my precious hoard, on a punier man,<br />less stout in
struggle. Thyself hast now<br />fulfilled such deeds, that thy fame
shall endure<br />through all the ages. As ever he did,<br />well may
the Wielder reward thee still!&rdquo;<br />Beowulf spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:
--<br />&ldquo;This work of war most willingly<br />we have fought,
this fight, and fearlessly dared<br />force of the foe. Fain, too, were
I<br />hadst thou but seen himself, what time<br />the fiend in his
trappings tottered to fall!<br />Swiftly, I thought, in strongest gripe<br />on
his bed of death to bind him down,<br />that he in the hent of this
hand of mine<br />should breathe his last: but he broke away.<br />Him
I might not -- the Maker willed not --<br />hinder from flight, and
firm enough hold<br />the life-destroyer: too sturdy was he,<br />the
ruthless, in running! For rescue, however,<br />he left behind him his
hand in pledge,<br />arm and shoulder; nor aught of help<br />could
the cursed one thus procure at all.<br />None the longer liveth he,
loathsome fiend,<br />sunk in his sins, but sorrow holds him<br />tightly
grasped in gripe of anguish,<br />in baleful bonds, where bide he must,<br />evil
outlaw, such awful doom<br />as the Mighty Maker shall mete him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More silent seemed the son of Ecglaf <a name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a">{14a}</a><br />in
boastful speech of his battle-deeds,<br />since athelings all, through
the earl&rsquo;s great prowess,<br />beheld that hand, on the high roof
gazing,<br />foeman&rsquo;s fingers, -- the forepart of each<br />of
the sturdy nails to steel was likest, --<br />heathen&rsquo;s &ldquo;hand-spear,&rdquo;
hostile warrior&rsquo;s<br />claw uncanny. &rsquo;Twas clear, they said,<br />that
him no blade of the brave could touch,<br />how keen soever, or cut
away<br />that battle-hand bloody from baneful foe.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XV</p>
<p>THERE was hurry and hest in Heorot now<br />for hands to bedeck it,
and dense was the throng<br />of men and women the wine-hall to cleanse,<br />the
guest-room to garnish. Gold-gay shone the hangings<br />that were wove
on the wall, and wonders many<br />to delight each mortal that looks
upon them.<br />Though braced within by iron bands,<br />that building
bright was broken sorely; <a name="citation15a"></a><a href="#footnote15a">{15a}</a><br />rent
were its hinges; the roof alone<br />held safe and sound, when, seared
with crime,<br />the fiendish foe his flight essayed,<br />of life despairing.
-- No light thing that,<br />the flight for safety, -- essay it who
will!<br />Forced of fate, he shall find his way<br />to the refuge
ready for race of man,<br />for soul-possessors, and sons of earth;<br />and
there his body on bed of death<br />shall rest after revel.<br />Arrived
was the hour<br />when to hall proceeded Healfdene&rsquo;s son:<br />the
king himself would sit to banquet.<br />Ne&rsquo;er heard I of host
in haughtier throng<br />more graciously gathered round giver-of-rings!<br />Bowed
then to bench those bearers-of-glory,<br />fain of the feasting. Featly
received<br />many a mead-cup the mighty-in-spirit,<br />kinsmen who
sat in the sumptuous hall,<br />Hrothgar and Hrothulf. Heorot now<br />was
filled with friends; the folk of Scyldings<br />ne&rsquo;er yet had
tried the traitor&rsquo;s deed.<br />To Beowulf gave the bairn of Healfdene<br />a
gold-wove banner, guerdon of triumph,<br />broidered battle-flag, breastplate
and helmet;<br />and a splendid sword was seen of many<br />borne to
the brave one. Beowulf took<br />cup in hall: <a name="citation15b"></a><a href="#footnote15b">{15b}</a>
for such costly gifts<br />he suffered no shame in that soldier throng.<br />For
I heard of few heroes, in heartier mood,<br />with four such gifts,
so fashioned with gold,<br />on the ale-bench honoring others thus!<br />O&rsquo;er
the roof of the helmet high, a ridge,<br />wound with wires, kept ward
o&rsquo;er the head,<br />lest the relict-of-files <a name="citation15c"></a><a href="#footnote15c">{15c}</a>
should fierce invade,<br />sharp in the strife, when that shielded hero<br />should
go to grapple against his foes.<br />Then the earls&rsquo;-defence <a name="citation15d"></a><a href="#footnote15d">{15d}</a>
on the floor <a name="citation15e"></a><a href="#footnote15e">{15e}</a>
bade lead<br />coursers eight, with carven head-gear,<br />adown the
hall: one horse was decked<br />with a saddle all shining and set in
jewels;<br />&rsquo;twas the battle-seat of the best of kings,<br />when
to play of swords the son of Healfdene<br />was fain to fare. Ne&rsquo;er
failed his valor<br />in the crush of combat when corpses fell.<br />To
Beowulf over them both then gave<br />the refuge-of-Ingwines right and
power,<br />o&rsquo;er war-steeds and weapons: wished him joy of them.<br />Manfully
thus the mighty prince,<br />hoard-guard for heroes, that hard fight
repaid<br />with steeds and treasures contemned by none<br />who is
willing to say the sooth aright.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XVI</p>
<p>AND the lord of earls, to each that came<br />with Beowulf over the
briny ways,<br />an heirloom there at the ale-bench gave,<br />precious
gift; and the price <a name="citation16a"></a><a href="#footnote16a">{16a}</a>
bade pay<br />in gold for him whom Grendel erst<br />murdered, -- and
fain of them more had killed,<br />had not wisest God their Wyrd averted,<br />and
the man&rsquo;s <a name="citation16b"></a><a href="#footnote16b">{16b}</a>
brave mood. The Maker then<br />ruled human kind, as here and now.<br />Therefore
is insight always best,<br />and forethought of mind. How much awaits
him<br />of lief and of loath, who long time here,<br />through days
of warfare this world endures!</p>
<p>Then song and music mingled sounds<br />in the presence of Healfdene&rsquo;s
head-of-armies <a name="citation16c"></a><a href="#footnote16c">{16c}</a><br />and
harping was heard with the hero-lay<br />as Hrothgar&rsquo;s singer
the hall-joy woke<br />along the mead-seats, making his song<br />of
that sudden raid on the sons of Finn. <a name="citation16d"></a><a href="#footnote16d">{16d}</a><br />Healfdene&rsquo;s
hero, Hnaef the Scylding,<br />was fated to fall in the Frisian slaughter.
<a name="citation16e"></a><a href="#footnote16e">{16e}</a><br />Hildeburh
needed not hold in value<br />her enemies&rsquo; honor! <a name="citation16f"></a><a href="#footnote16f">{16f}</a>
Innocent both<br />were the loved ones she lost at the linden-play,<br />bairn
and brother, they bowed to fate,<br />stricken by spears; &rsquo;twas
a sorrowful woman!<br />None doubted why the daughter of Hoc<br />bewailed
her doom when dawning came,<br />and under the sky she saw them lying,<br />kinsmen
murdered, where most she had kenned<br />of the sweets of the world!
By war were swept, too,<br />Finn&rsquo;s own liegemen, and few were
left;<br />in the parleying-place <a name="citation16g"></a><a href="#footnote16g">{16g}</a>
he could ply no longer<br />weapon, nor war could he wage on Hengest,<br />and
rescue his remnant by right of arms<br />from the prince&rsquo;s thane.
A pact he offered:<br />another dwelling the Danes should have,<br />hall
and high-seat, and half the power<br />should fall to them in Frisian
land;<br />and at the fee-gifts, Folcwald&rsquo;s son<br />day by day
the Danes should honor,<br />the folk of Hengest favor with rings,<br />even
as truly, with treasure and jewels,<br />with fretted gold, as his Frisian
kin<br />he meant to honor in ale-hall there.<br />Pact of peace they
plighted further<br />on both sides firmly. Finn to Hengest<br />with
oath, upon honor, openly promised<br />that woful remnant, with wise-men&rsquo;s
aid,<br />nobly to govern, so none of the guests<br />by word or work
should warp the treaty, <a name="citation16h"></a><a href="#footnote16h">{16h}</a><br />or
with malice of mind bemoan themselves<br />as forced to follow their
fee-giver&rsquo;s slayer,<br />lordless men, as their lot ordained.<br />Should
Frisian, moreover, with foeman&rsquo;s taunt,<br />that murderous hatred
to mind recall,<br />then edge of the sword must seal his doom.</p>
<p>Oaths were given, and ancient gold<br />heaped from hoard. -- The
hardy Scylding,<br />battle-thane best, <a name="citation16i"></a><a href="#footnote16i">{16i}</a>
on his balefire lay.<br />All on the pyre were plain to see<br />the
gory sark, the gilded swine-crest,<br />boar of hard iron, and athelings
many<br />slain by the sword: at the slaughter they fell.<br />It was
Hildeburh&rsquo;s hest, at Hnaef&rsquo;s own pyre<br />the bairn of
her body on brands to lay,<br />his bones to burn, on the balefire placed,<br />at
his uncle&rsquo;s side. In sorrowful dirges<br />bewept them the woman:
great wailing ascended.<br />Then wound up to welkin the wildest of
death-fires,<br />roared o&rsquo;er the hillock: <a name="citation16j"></a><a href="#footnote16j">{16j}</a>
heads all were melted,<br />gashes burst, and blood gushed out<br />from
bites <a name="citation16k"></a><a href="#footnote16k">{16k}</a> of
the body. Balefire devoured,<br />greediest spirit, those spared not
by war<br />out of either folk: their flower was gone.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XVII</p>
<p>THEN hastened those heroes their home to see,<br />friendless, to
find the Frisian land,<br />houses and high burg. Hengest still<br />through
the death-dyed winter dwelt with Finn,<br />holding pact, yet of home
he minded,<br />though powerless his ring-decked prow to drive<br />over
the waters, now waves rolled fierce<br />lashed by the winds, or winter
locked them<br />in icy fetters. Then fared another<br />year to men&rsquo;s
dwellings, as yet they do,<br />the sunbright skies, that their season
ever<br />duly await. Far off winter was driven;<br />fair lay earth&rsquo;s
breast; and fain was the rover,<br />the guest, to depart, though more
gladly he pondered<br />on wreaking his vengeance than roaming the deep,<br />and
how to hasten the hot encounter<br />where sons of the Frisians were
sure to be.<br />So he escaped not the common doom,<br />when Hun with
&ldquo;Lafing,&rdquo; the light-of-battle,<br />best of blades, his
bosom pierced:<br />its edge was famed with the Frisian earls.<br />On
fierce-heart Finn there fell likewise,<br />on himself at home, the
horrid sword-death;<br />for Guthlaf and Oslaf of grim attack<br />had
sorrowing told, from sea-ways landed,<br />mourning their woes. <a name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a">{17a}</a>
Finn&rsquo;s wavering spirit<br />bode not in breast. The burg was reddened<br />with
blood of foemen, and Finn was slain,<br />king amid clansmen; the queen
was taken.<br />To their ship the Scylding warriors bore<br />all the
chattels the chieftain owned,<br />whatever they found in Finn&rsquo;s
domain<br />of gems and jewels. The gentle wife<br />o&rsquo;er paths
of the deep to the Danes they bore,<br />led to her land.<br />The lay
was finished,<br />the gleeman&rsquo;s song. Then glad rose the revel;<br />bench-joy
brightened. Bearers draw<br />from their &ldquo;wonder-vats&rdquo; wine.
Comes Wealhtheow forth,<br />under gold-crown goes where the good pair
sit,<br />uncle and nephew, true each to the other one,<br />kindred
in amity. Unferth the spokesman<br />at the Scylding lord&rsquo;s feet
sat: men had faith in his spirit,<br />his keenness of courage, though
kinsmen had found him<br />unsure at the sword-play. The Scylding queen
spoke:<br />&ldquo;Quaff of this cup, my king and lord,<br />breaker
of rings, and blithe be thou,<br />gold-friend of men; to the Geats
here speak<br />such words of mildness as man should use.<br />Be glad
with thy Geats; of those gifts be mindful,<br />or near or far, which
now thou hast.</p>
<p>Men say to me, as son thou wishest<br />yon hero to hold. Thy Heorot
purged,<br />jewel-hall brightest, enjoy while thou canst,<br />with
many a largess; and leave to thy kin<br />folk and realm when forth
thou goest<br />to greet thy doom. For gracious I deem<br />my Hrothulf,
<a name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b">{17b}</a> willing to
hold and rule<br />nobly our youths, if thou yield up first,<br />prince
of Scyldings, thy part in the world.<br />I ween with good he will well
requite<br />offspring of ours, when all he minds<br />that for him
we did in his helpless days<br />of gift and grace to gain him honor!&rdquo;<br />Then
she turned to the seat where her sons wereplaced,<br />Hrethric and
Hrothmund, with heroes&rsquo; bairns,<br />young men together: the Geat,
too, sat there,<br />Beowulf brave, the brothers between.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XVIII</p>
<p>A CUP she gave him, with kindly greeting<br />and winsome words.
Of wounden gold,<br />she offered, to honor him, arm-jewels twain,<br />corselet
and rings, and of collars the noblest<br />that ever I knew the earth
around.<br />Ne&rsquo;er heard I so mighty, &rsquo;neath heaven&rsquo;s
dome,<br />a hoard-gem of heroes, since Hama bore<br />to his bright-built
burg the Brisings&rsquo; necklace,<br />jewel and gem casket. -- Jealousy
fled he,<br />Eormenric&rsquo;s hate: chose help eternal.<br />Hygelac
Geat, grandson of Swerting,<br />on the last of his raids this ring
bore with him,<br />under his banner the booty defending,<br />the war-spoil
warding; but Wyrd o&rsquo;erwhelmed him<br />what time, in his daring,
dangers he sought,<br />feud with Frisians. Fairest of gems<br />he
bore with him over the beaker-of-waves,<br />sovran strong: under shield
he died.<br />Fell the corpse of the king into keeping of Franks,<br />gear
of the breast, and that gorgeous ring;<br />weaker warriors won the
spoil,<br />after gripe of battle, from Geatland&rsquo;s lord,<br />and
held the death-field.<br />Din rose in hall.<br />Wealhtheow spake amid
warriors, and said: --<br />&ldquo;This jewel enjoy in thy jocund youth,<br />Beowulf
lov&rsquo;d, these battle-weeds wear,<br />a royal treasure, and richly
thrive!<br />Preserve thy strength, and these striplings here<br />counsel
in kindness: requital be mine.<br />Hast done such deeds, that for days
to come<br />thou art famed among folk both far and near,<br />so wide
as washeth the wave of Ocean<br />his windy walls. Through the ways
of life<br />prosper, O prince! I pray for thee<br />rich possessions.
To son of mine<br />be helpful in deed and uphold his joys!<br />Here
every earl to the other is true,<br />mild of mood, to the master loyal!<br />Thanes
are friendly, the throng obedient,<br />liegemen are revelling: list
and obey!&rdquo;<br />Went then to her place. -- That was proudest of
feasts;<br />flowed wine for the warriors. Wyrd they knew not,<br />destiny
dire, and the doom to be seen<br />by many an earl when eve should come,<br />and
Hrothgar homeward hasten away,<br />royal, to rest. The room was guarded<br />by
an army of earls, as erst was done.<br />They bared the bench-boards;
abroad they spread<br />beds and bolsters. -- One beer-carouser<br />in
danger of doom lay down in the hall. --</p>
<p>At their heads they set their shields of war,<br />bucklers bright;
on the bench were there<br />over each atheling, easy to see,<br />the
high battle-helmet, the haughty spear,<br />the corselet of rings. &rsquo;Twas
their custom so<br />ever to be for battle prepared,<br />at home, or
harrying, which it were,<br />even as oft as evil threatened<br />their
sovran king. -- They were clansmen good.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XIX</p>
<p>THEN sank they to sleep. With sorrow one bought<br />his rest of
the evening, -- as ofttime had happened<br />when Grendel guarded that
golden hall,<br />evil wrought, till his end drew nigh,<br />slaughter
for sins. &rsquo;Twas seen and told<br />how an avenger survived the
fiend,<br />as was learned afar. The livelong time<br />after that grim
fight, Grendel&rsquo;s mother,<br />monster of women, mourned her woe.<br />She
was doomed to dwell in the dreary waters,<br />cold sea-courses, since
Cain cut down<br />with edge of the sword his only brother,<br />his
father&rsquo;s offspring: outlawed he fled,<br />marked with murder,
from men&rsquo;s delights<br />warded the wilds. -- There woke from
him<br />such fate-sent ghosts as Grendel, who,<br />war-wolf horrid,
at Heorot found<br />a warrior watching and waiting the fray,<br />with
whom the grisly one grappled amain.<br />But the man remembered his
mighty power,<br />the glorious gift that God had sent him,<br />in
his Maker&rsquo;s mercy put his trust<br />for comfort and help: so
he conquered the foe,<br />felled the fiend, who fled abject,<br />reft
of joy, to the realms of death,<br />mankind&rsquo;s foe. And his mother
now,<br />gloomy and grim, would go that quest<br />of sorrow, the death
of her son to avenge.<br />To Heorot came she, where helmeted Danes<br />slept
in the hall. Too soon came back<br />old ills of the earls, when in
she burst,<br />the mother of Grendel. Less grim, though, that terror,<br />e&rsquo;en
as terror of woman in war is less,<br />might of maid, than of men in
arms<br />when, hammer-forged, the falchion hard,<br />sword gore-stained,
through swine of the helm,<br />crested, with keen blade carves amain.<br />Then
was in hall the hard-edge drawn,<br />the swords on the settles, <a name="citation19a"></a><a href="#footnote19a">{19a}</a>
and shields a-many<br />firm held in hand: nor helmet minded<br />nor
harness of mail, whom that horror seized.<br />Haste was hers; she would
hie afar<br />and save her life when the liegemen saw her.<br />Yet
a single atheling up she seized<br />fast and firm, as she fled to the
moor.<br />He was for Hrothgar of heroes the dearest,<br />of trusty
vassals betwixt the seas,<br />whom she killed on his couch, a clansman
famous,<br />in battle brave. -- Nor was Beowulf there;<br />another
house had been held apart,<br />after giving of gold, for the Geat renowned.
--<br />Uproar filled Heorot; the hand all had viewed,<br />blood-flecked,
she bore with her; bale was returned,<br />dole in the dwellings: &rsquo;twas
dire exchange<br />where Dane and Geat were doomed to give<br />the
lives of loved ones. Long-tried king,<br />the hoary hero, at heart
was sad<br />when he knew his noble no more lived,<br />and dead indeed
was his dearest thane.<br />To his bower was Beowulf brought in haste,<br />dauntless
victor. As daylight broke,<br />along with his earls the atheling lord,<br />with
his clansmen, came where the king abode<br />waiting to see if the Wielder-of-All<br />would
turn this tale of trouble and woe.<br />Strode o&rsquo;er floor the
famed-in-strife,<br />with his hand-companions, -- the hall resounded,
--<br />wishing to greet the wise old king,<br />Ingwines&rsquo; lord;
he asked if the night<br />had passed in peace to the prince&rsquo;s
mind.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XX</p>
<p>HROTHGAR spake, helmet-of-Scyldings: --<br />&ldquo;Ask not of pleasure!
Pain is renewed<br />to Danish folk. Dead is Aeschere,<br />of Yrmenlaf
the elder brother,<br />my sage adviser and stay in council,<br />shoulder-comrade
in stress of fight<br />when warriors clashed and we warded our heads,<br />hewed
the helm-boars; hero famed<br />should be every earl as Aeschere was!<br />But
here in Heorot a hand hath slain him<br />of wandering death-sprite.
I wot not whither, <a name="citation20a"></a><a href="#footnote20a">{20a}</a><br />proud
of the prey, her path she took,<br />fain of her fill. The feud she
avenged<br />that yesternight, unyieldingly,<br />Grendel in grimmest
grasp thou killedst, --<br />seeing how long these liegemen mine<br />he
ruined and ravaged. Reft of life,<br />in arms he fell. Now another
comes,<br />keen and cruel, her kin to avenge,<br />faring far in feud
of blood:<br />so that many a thane shall think, who e&rsquo;er<br />sorrows
in soul for that sharer of rings,<br />this is hardest of heart-bales.
The hand lies low<br />that once was willing each wish to please.<br />Land-dwellers
here <a name="citation20b"></a><a href="#footnote20b">{20b}</a> and
liegemen mine,<br />who house by those parts, I have heard relate<br />that
such a pair they have sometimes seen,<br />march-stalkers mighty the
moorland haunting,<br />wandering spirits: one of them seemed,<br />so
far as my folk could fairly judge,<br />of womankind; and one, accursed,<br />in
man&rsquo;s guise trod the misery-track<br />of exile, though huger
than human bulk.<br />Grendel in days long gone they named him,<br />folk
of the land; his father they knew not,<br />nor any brood that was born
to him<br />of treacherous spirits. Untrod is their home;<br />by wolf-cliffs
haunt they and windy headlands,<br />fenways fearful, where flows the
stream<br />from mountains gliding to gloom of the rocks,<br />underground
flood. Not far is it hence<br />in measure of miles that the mere expands,<br />and
o&rsquo;er it the frost-bound forest hanging,<br />sturdily rooted,
shadows the wave.<br />By night is a wonder weird to see,<br />fire
on the waters. So wise lived none<br />of the sons of men, to search
those depths!<br />Nay, though the heath-rover, harried by dogs,<br />the
horn-proud hart, this holt should seek,<br />long distance driven, his
dear life first<br />on the brink he yields ere he brave the plunge<br />to
hide his head: &rsquo;tis no happy place!<br />Thence the welter of
waters washes up<br />wan to welkin when winds bestir<br />evil storms,
and air grows dusk,<br />and the heavens weep. Now is help once more<br />with
thee alone! The land thou knowst not,<br />place of fear, where thou
findest out<br />that sin-flecked being. Seek if thou dare!<br />I will
reward thee, for waging this fight,<br />with ancient treasure, as erst
I did,<br />with winding gold, if thou winnest back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXI</p>
<p>BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow:<br />&ldquo;Sorrow not, sage! It
beseems us better<br />friends to avenge than fruitlessly mourn them.<br />Each
of us all must his end abide<br />in the ways of the world; so win who
may<br />glory ere death! When his days are told,<br />that is the warrior&rsquo;s
worthiest doom.<br />Rise, O realm-warder! Ride we anon,<br />and mark
the trail of the mother of Grendel.<br />No harbor shall hide her --
heed my promise! --<br />enfolding of field or forested mountain<br />or
floor of the flood, let her flee where she will!<br />But thou this
day endure in patience,<br />as I ween thou wilt, thy woes each one.&rdquo;<br />Leaped
up the graybeard: God he thanked,<br />mighty Lord, for the man&rsquo;s
brave words.<br />For Hrothgar soon a horse was saddled<br />wave-maned
steed. The sovran wise<br />stately rode on; his shield-armed men<br />followed
in force. The footprints led<br />along the woodland, widely seen,<br />a
path o&rsquo;er the plain, where she passed, and trod<br />the murky
moor; of men-at-arms<br />she bore the bravest and best one, dead,<br />him
who with Hrothgar the homestead ruled.<br />On then went the atheling-born<br />o&rsquo;er
stone-cliffs steep and strait defiles,<br />narrow passes and unknown
ways,<br />headlands sheer, and the haunts of the Nicors.<br />Foremost
he <a name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a">{21a}</a> fared,
a few at his side<br />of the wiser men, the ways to scan,<br />till
he found in a flash the forested hill<br />hanging over the hoary rock,<br />a
woful wood: the waves below<br />were dyed in blood. The Danish men<br />had
sorrow of soul, and for Scyldings all,<br />for many a hero, &rsquo;twas
hard to bear,<br />ill for earls, when Aeschere&rsquo;s head<br />they
found by the flood on the foreland there.<br />Waves were welling, the
warriors saw,<br />hot with blood; but the horn sang oft<br />battle-song
bold. The band sat down,<br />and watched on the water worm-like things,<br />sea-dragons
strange that sounded the deep,<br />and nicors that lay on the ledge
of the ness --<br />such as oft essay at hour of morn<br />on the road-of-sails
their ruthless quest, --<br />and sea-snakes and monsters. These started
away,<br />swollen and savage that song to hear,<br />that war-horn&rsquo;s
blast. The warden of Geats,<br />with bolt from bow, then balked of
life,<br />of wave-work, one monster, amid its heart<br />went the keen
war-shaft; in water it seemed<br />less doughty in swimming whom death
had seized.<br />Swift on the billows, with boar-spears well<br />hooked
and barbed, it was hard beset,<br />done to death and dragged on the
headland,<br />wave-roamer wondrous. Warriors viewed<br />the grisly
guest.<br />Then girt him Beowulf<br />in martial mail, nor mourned
for his life.<br />His breastplate broad and bright of hues,<br />woven
by hand, should the waters try;<br />well could it ward the warrior&rsquo;s
body<br />that battle should break on his breast in vain<br />nor harm
his heart by the hand of a foe.<br />And the helmet white that his head
protected<br />was destined to dare the deeps of the flood,<br />through
wave-whirl win: &rsquo;twas wound with chains,<br />decked with gold,
as in days of yore<br />the weapon-smith worked it wondrously,<br />with
swine-forms set it, that swords nowise,<br />brandished in battle, could
bite that helm.<br />Nor was that the meanest of mighty helps<br />which
Hrothgar&rsquo;s orator offered at need:<br />&ldquo;Hrunting&rdquo;
they named the hilted sword,<br />of old-time heirlooms easily first;<br />iron
was its edge, all etched with poison,<br />with battle-blood hardened,
nor blenched it at fight<br />in hero&rsquo;s hand who held it ever,<br />on
paths of peril prepared to go<br />to folkstead <a name="citation21b"></a><a href="#footnote21b">{21b}</a>
of foes. Not first time this<br />it was destined to do a daring task.<br />For
he bore not in mind, the bairn of Ecglaf<br />sturdy and strong, that
speech he had made,<br />drunk with wine, now this weapon he lent<br />to
a stouter swordsman. Himself, though, durst not<br />under welter of
waters wager his life<br />as loyal liegeman. So lost he his glory,<br />honor
of earls. With the other not so,<br />who girded him now for the grim
encounter.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXII</p>
<p>BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow: --<br />&ldquo;Have mind, thou
honored offspring of Healfdene<br />gold-friend of men, now I go on
this quest,<br />sovran wise, what once was said:<br />if in thy cause
it came that I<br />should lose my life, thou wouldst loyal bide<br />to
me, though fallen, in father&rsquo;s place!<br />Be guardian, thou,
to this group of my thanes,<br />my warrior-friends, if War should seize
me;<br />and the goodly gifts thou gavest me,<br />Hrothgar beloved,
to Hygelac send!<br />Geatland&rsquo;s king may ken by the gold,<br />Hrethel&rsquo;s
son see, when he stares at the treasure,<br />that I got me a friend
for goodness famed,<br />and joyed while I could in my jewel-bestower.<br />And
let Unferth wield this wondrous sword,<br />earl far-honored, this heirloom
precious,<br />hard of edge: with Hrunting I<br />seek doom of glory,
or Death shall take me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After these words the Weder-Geat lord<br />boldly hastened, biding
never<br />answer at all: the ocean floods<br />closed o&rsquo;er the
hero. Long while of the day<br />fled ere he felt the floor of the sea.</p>
<p>Soon found the fiend who the flood-domain<br />sword-hungry held
these hundred winters,<br />greedy and grim, that some guest from above,<br />some
man, was raiding her monster-realm.<br />She grasped out for him with
grisly claws,<br />and the warrior seized; yet scathed she not<br />his
body hale; the breastplate hindered,<br />as she strove to shatter the
sark of war,<br />the linked harness, with loathsome hand.<br />Then
bore this brine-wolf, when bottom she touched,<br />the lord of rings
to the lair she haunted<br />whiles vainly he strove, though his valor
held,<br />weapon to wield against wondrous monsters<br />that sore
beset him; sea-beasts many<br />tried with fierce tusks to tear his
mail,<br />and swarmed on the stranger. But soon he marked<br />he was
now in some hall, he knew not which,<br />where water never could work
him harm,<br />nor through the roof could reach him ever<br />fangs
of the flood. Firelight he saw,<br />beams of a blaze that brightly
shone.<br />Then the warrior was ware of that wolf-of-the-deep,<br />mere-wife
monstrous. For mighty stroke<br />he swung his blade, and the blow withheld
not.<br />Then sang on her head that seemly blade<br />its war-song
wild. But the warrior found<br />the light-of-battle <a name="citation22a"></a><a href="#footnote22a">{22a}</a>
was loath to bite,<br />to harm the heart: its hard edge failed<br />the
noble at need, yet had known of old<br />strife hand to hand, and had
helmets cloven,<br />doomed men&rsquo;s fighting-gear. First time, this,<br />for
the gleaming blade that its glory fell.<br />Firm still stood, nor failed
in valor,<br />heedful of high deeds, Hygelac&rsquo;s kinsman;<br />flung
away fretted sword, featly jewelled,<br />the angry earl; on earth it
lay<br />steel-edged and stiff. His strength he trusted,<br />hand-gripe
of might. So man shall do<br />whenever in war he weens to earn him<br />lasting
fame, nor fears for his life!<br />Seized then by shoulder, shrank not
from combat,<br />the Geatish war-prince Grendel&rsquo;s mother.<br />Flung
then the fierce one, filled with wrath,<br />his deadly foe, that she
fell to ground.<br />Swift on her part she paid him back<br />with grisly
grasp, and grappled with him.<br />Spent with struggle, stumbled the
warrior,<br />fiercest of fighting-men, fell adown.<br />On the hall-guest
she hurled herself, hent her short sword,<br />broad and brown-edged,
<a name="citation22b"></a><a href="#footnote22b">{22b}</a> the bairn
to avenge,<br />the sole-born son. -- On his shoulder lay<br />braided
breast-mail, barring death,<br />withstanding entrance of edge or blade.<br />Life
would have ended for Ecgtheow&rsquo;s son,<br />under wide earth for
that earl of Geats,<br />had his armor of war not aided him,<br />battle-net
hard, and holy God<br />wielded the victory, wisest Maker.<br />The
Lord of Heaven allowed his cause;<br />and easily rose the earl erect.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines3"><br /><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXIII</p>
<p>&rsquo;MID the battle-gear saw he a blade triumphant,<br />old-sword
of Eotens, with edge of proof,<br />warriors&rsquo; heirloom, weapon
unmatched,<br />-- save only &rsquo;twas more than other men<br />to
bandy-of-battle could bear at all --<br />as the giants had wrought
it, ready and keen.<br />Seized then its chain-hilt the Scyldings&rsquo;
chieftain,<br />bold and battle-grim, brandished the sword,<br />reckless
of life, and so wrathfully smote<br />that it gripped her neck and grasped
her hard,<br />her bone-rings breaking: the blade pierced through<br />that
fated-one&rsquo;s flesh: to floor she sank.<br />Bloody the blade: he
was blithe of his deed.<br />Then blazed forth light. &rsquo;Twas bright
within<br />as when from the sky there shines unclouded<br />heaven&rsquo;s
candle. The hall he scanned.<br />By the wall then went he; his weapon
raised<br />high by its hilts the Hygelac-thane,<br />angry and eager.
That edge was not useless<br />to the warrior now. He wished with speed<br />Grendel
to guerdon for grim raids many,<br />for the war he waged on Western-Danes<br />oftener
far than an only time,<br />when of Hrothgar&rsquo;s hearth-companions<br />he
slew in slumber, in sleep devoured,<br />fifteen men of the folk of
Danes,<br />and as many others outward bore,<br />his horrible prey.
Well paid for that<br />the wrathful prince! For now prone he saw<br />Grendel
stretched there, spent with war,<br />spoiled of life, so scathed had
left him<br />Heorot&rsquo;s battle. The body sprang far<br />when after
death it endured the blow,<br />sword-stroke savage, that severed its
head.<br />Soon, <a name="citation23a"></a><a href="#footnote23a">{23a}</a>
then, saw the sage companions<br />who waited with Hrothgar, watching
the flood,<br />that the tossing waters turbid grew,<br />blood-stained
the mere. Old men together,<br />hoary-haired, of the hero spake;<br />the
warrior would not, they weened, again,<br />proud of conquest, come
to seek<br />their mighty master. To many it seemed<br />the wolf-of-the-waves
had won his life.<br />The ninth hour came. The noble Scyldings<br />left
the headland; homeward went<br />the gold-friend of men. <a name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b">{23b}</a>
But the guests sat on,<br />stared at the surges, sick in heart,<br />and
wished, yet weened not, their winsome lord<br />again to see.</p>
<p>Now that sword began,<br />from blood of the fight, in battle-droppings,
<a name="citation23c"></a><a href="#footnote23c">{23c}</a><br />war-blade,
to wane: &rsquo;twas a wondrous thing<br />that all of it melted as
ice is wont<br />when frosty fetters the Father loosens,<br />unwinds
the wave-bonds, wielding all<br />seasons and times: the true God he!<br />Nor
took from that dwelling the duke of the Geats<br />save only the head
and that hilt withal<br />blazoned with jewels: the blade had melted,<br />burned
was the bright sword, her blood was so hot,<br />so poisoned the hell-sprite
who perished within there.<br />Soon he was swimming who safe saw in
combat<br />downfall of demons; up-dove through the flood.<br />The
clashing waters were cleansed now,<br />waste of waves, where the wandering
fiend<br />her life-days left and this lapsing world.<br />Swam then
to strand the sailors&rsquo;-refuge,<br />sturdy-in-spirit, of sea-booty
glad,<br />of burden brave he bore with him.<br />Went then to greet
him, and God they thanked,<br />the thane-band choice of their chieftain
blithe,<br />that safe and sound they could see him again.<br />Soon
from the hardy one helmet and armor<br />deftly they doffed: now drowsed
the mere,<br />water &rsquo;neath welkin, with war-blood stained.<br />Forth
they fared by the footpaths thence,<br />merry at heart the highways
measured,<br />well-known roads. Courageous men<br />carried the head
from the cliff by the sea,<br />an arduous task for all the band,<br />the
firm in fight, since four were needed<br />on the shaft-of-slaughter
<a name="citation23d"></a><a href="#footnote23d">{23d}</a> strenuously<br />to
bear to the gold-hall Grendel&rsquo;s head.<br />So presently to the
palace there<br />foemen fearless, fourteen Geats,<br />marching came.
Their master-of-clan<br />mighty amid them the meadow-ways trod.<br />Strode
then within the sovran thane<br />fearless in fight, of fame renowned,<br />hardy
hero, Hrothgar to greet.<br />And next by the hair into hall was borne<br />Grendel&rsquo;s
head, where the henchmen were drinking,<br />an awe to clan and queen
alike,<br />a monster of marvel: the men looked on.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXIV</p>
<p>BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow: --<br />&ldquo;Lo, now, this sea-booty,
son of Healfdene,<br />Lord of Scyldings, we&rsquo;ve lustily brought
thee,<br />sign of glory; thou seest it here.<br />Not lightly did I
with my life escape!<br />In war under water this work I essayed<br />with
endless effort; and even so<br />my strength had been lost had the Lord
not shielded me.<br />Not a whit could I with Hrunting do<br />in work
of war, though the weapon is good;<br />yet a sword the Sovran of Men
vouchsafed me<br />to spy on the wall there, in splendor hanging,<br />old,
gigantic, -- how oft He guides<br />the friendless wight! -- and I fought
with that brand,<br />felling in fight, since fate was with me,<br />the
house&rsquo;s wardens. That war-sword then<br />all burned, bright blade,
when the blood gushed o&rsquo;er it,<br />battle-sweat hot; but the
hilt I brought back<br />from my foes. So avenged I their fiendish deeds<br />death-fall
of Danes, as was due and right.<br />And this is my hest, that in Heorot
now<br />safe thou canst sleep with thy soldier band,<br />and every
thane of all thy folk<br />both old and young; no evil fear,<br />Scyldings&rsquo;
lord, from that side again,<br />aught ill for thy earls, as erst thou
must!&rdquo;<br />Then the golden hilt, for that gray-haired leader,<br />hoary
hero, in hand was laid,<br />giant-wrought, old. So owned and enjoyed
it<br />after downfall of devils, the Danish lord,<br />wonder-smiths&rsquo;
work, since the world was rid<br />of that grim-souled fiend, the foe
of God,<br />murder-marked, and his mother as well.<br />Now it passed
into power of the people&rsquo;s king,<br />best of all that the oceans
bound<br />who have scattered their gold o&rsquo;er Scandia&rsquo;s
isle.<br />Hrothgar spake -- the hilt he viewed,<br />heirloom old,
where was etched the rise<br />of that far-off fight when the floods
o&rsquo;erwhelmed,<br />raging waves, the race of giants<br />(fearful
their fate!), a folk estranged<br />from God Eternal: whence guerdon
due<br />in that waste of waters the Wielder paid them.<br />So on the
guard of shining gold<br />in runic staves it was rightly said<br />for
whom the serpent-traced sword was wrought,<br />best of blades, in bygone
days,<br />and the hilt well wound. -- The wise-one spake,<br />son
of Healfdene; silent were all: --<br />&ldquo;Lo, so may he say who
sooth and right<br />follows &rsquo;mid folk, of far times mindful,<br />a
land-warden old, <a name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a">{24a}</a>
that this earl belongs<br />to the better breed! So, borne aloft,<br />thy
fame must fly, O friend my Beowulf,<br />far and wide o&rsquo;er folksteads
many. Firmly thou<br />shalt all maintain,<br />mighty strength with
mood of wisdom. Love of<br />mine will I assure thee,<br />as, awhile
ago, I promised; thou shalt prove a stay<br />in future,<br />in far-off
years, to folk of thine,<br />to the heroes a help. Was not Heremod
thus<br />to offspring of Ecgwela, Honor-Scyldings,<br />nor grew for
their grace, but for grisly slaughter,<br />for doom of death to the
Danishmen.</p>
<p>He slew, wrath-swollen, his shoulder-comrades,<br />companions at
board! So he passed alone,<br />chieftain haughty, from human cheer.<br />Though
him the Maker with might endowed,<br />delights of power, and uplifted
high<br />above all men, yet blood-fierce his mind,<br />his breast-hoard,
grew, no bracelets gave he<br />to Danes as was due; he endured all
joyless<br />strain of struggle and stress of woe,<br />long feud with
his folk. Here find thy lesson!<br />Of virtue advise thee! This verse
I have said for thee,<br />wise from lapsed winters. Wondrous seems<br />how
to sons of men Almighty God<br />in the strength of His spirit sendeth
wisdom,<br />estate, high station: He swayeth all things.<br />Whiles
He letteth right lustily fare<br />the heart of the hero of high-born
race, --<br />in seat ancestral assigns him bliss,<br />his folk&rsquo;s
sure fortress in fee to hold,<br />puts in his power great parts of
the earth,<br />empire so ample, that end of it<br />this wanter-of-wisdom
weeneth none.<br />So he waxes in wealth, nowise can harm him<br />illness
or age; no evil cares<br />shadow his spirit; no sword-hate threatens<br />from
ever an enemy: all the world<br />wends at his will, no worse he knoweth,<br />till
all within him obstinate pride<br />waxes and wakes while the warden
slumbers,<br />the spirit&rsquo;s sentry; sleep is too fast<br />which
masters his might, and the murderer nears,<br />stealthily shooting
the shafts from his bow!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXV</p>
<p>&ldquo;UNDER harness his heart then is hit indeed<br />by sharpest
shafts; and no shelter avails<br />from foul behest of the hellish fiend.
<a name="citation25a"></a><a href="#footnote25a">{25a}</a><br />Him
seems too little what long he possessed.<br />Greedy and grim, no golden
rings<br />he gives for his pride; the promised future<br />forgets
he and spurns, with all God has sent him,<br />Wonder-Wielder, of wealth
and fame.<br />Yet in the end it ever comes<br />that the frame of the
body fragile yields,<br />fated falls; and there follows another<br />who
joyously the jewels divides,<br />the royal riches, nor recks of his
forebear.<br />Ban, then, such baleful thoughts, Beowulf dearest,<br />best
of men, and the better part choose,<br />profit eternal; and temper
thy pride,<br />warrior famous! The flower of thy might<br />lasts now
a while: but erelong it shall be<br />that sickness or sword thy strength
shall minish,<br />or fang of fire, or flooding billow,<br />or bite
of blade, or brandished spear,<br />or odious age; or the eyes&rsquo;
clear beam<br />wax dull and darken: Death even thee<br />in haste shall
o&rsquo;erwhelm, thou hero of war!<br />So the Ring-Danes these half-years
a hundred I ruled,<br />wielded &rsquo;neath welkin, and warded them
bravely<br />from mighty-ones many o&rsquo;er middle-earth,<br />from
spear and sword, till it seemed for me<br />no foe could be found under
fold of the sky.<br />Lo, sudden the shift! To me seated secure<br />came
grief for joy when Grendel began<br />to harry my home, the hellish
foe;<br />for those ruthless raids, unresting I suffered<br />heart-sorrow
heavy. Heaven be thanked,<br />Lord Eternal, for life extended<br />that
I on this head all hewn and bloody,<br />after long evil, with eyes
may gaze!<br />-- Go to the bench now! Be glad at banquet,<br />warrior
worthy! A wealth of treasure<br />at dawn of day, be dealt between us!&rdquo;<br />Glad
was the Geats&rsquo; lord, going betimes<br />to seek his seat, as the
Sage commanded.<br />Afresh, as before, for the famed-in-battle,<br />for
the band of the hall, was a banquet dight<br />nobly anew. The Night-Helm
darkened<br />dusk o&rsquo;er the drinkers.<br />The doughty ones rose:<br />for
the hoary-headed would hasten to rest,<br />aged Scylding; and eager
the Geat,<br />shield-fighter sturdy, for sleeping yearned.<br />Him
wander-weary, warrior-guest<br />from far, a hall-thane heralded forth,<br />who
by custom courtly cared for all<br />needs of a thane as in those old
days<br />warrior-wanderers wont to have.<br />So slumbered the stout-heart.
Stately the hall<br />rose gabled and gilt where the guest slept on<br />till
a raven black the rapture-of-heaven <a name="citation25b"></a><a href="#footnote25b">{25b}</a><br />blithe-heart
boded. Bright came flying<br />shine after shadow. The swordsmen hastened,<br />athelings
all were eager homeward<br />forth to fare; and far from thence<br />the
great-hearted guest would guide his keel.<br />Bade then the hardy-one
Hrunting be brought<br />to the son of Ecglaf, the sword bade him take,<br />excellent
iron, and uttered his thanks for it,<br />quoth that he counted it keen
in battle,<br />&ldquo;war-friend&rdquo; winsome: with words he slandered
not<br />edge of the blade: &rsquo;twas a big-hearted man!<br />Now
eager for parting and armed at point<br />warriors waited, while went
to his host<br />that Darling of Danes. The doughty atheling<br />to
high-seat hastened and Hrothgar greeted.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXVI</p>
<p>BEOWULF spake, bairn of Ecgtheow: --<br />&ldquo;Lo, we seafarers
say our will,<br />far-come men, that we fain would seek<br />Hygelac
now. We here have found<br />hosts to our heart: thou hast harbored
us well.<br />If ever on earth I am able to win me<br />more of thy
love, O lord of men,<br />aught anew, than I now have done,<br />for
work of war I am willing still!<br />If it come to me ever across the
seas<br />that neighbor foemen annoy and fright thee, --<br />as they
that hate thee erewhile have used, --<br />thousands then of thanes
I shall bring,<br />heroes to help thee. Of Hygelac I know,<br />ward
of his folk, that, though few his years,<br />the lord of the Geats
will give me aid<br />by word and by work, that well I may serve thee,<br />wielding
the war-wood to win thy triumph<br />and lending thee might when thou
lackest men.<br />If thy Hrethric should come to court of Geats,<br />a
sovran&rsquo;s son, he will surely there<br />find his friends. A far-off
land<br />each man should visit who vaunts him brave.&rdquo;<br />Him
then answering, Hrothgar spake: --<br />&ldquo;These words of thine
the wisest God<br />sent to thy soul! No sager counsel<br />from so
young in years e&rsquo;er yet have I heard.<br />Thou art strong of
main and in mind art wary,<br />art wise in words! I ween indeed<br />if
ever it hap that Hrethel&rsquo;s heir<br />by spear be seized, by sword-grim
battle,<br />by illness or iron, thine elder and lord,<br />people&rsquo;s
leader, -- and life be thine, --<br />no seemlier man will the Sea-Geats
find<br />at all to choose for their chief and king,<br />for hoard-guard
of heroes, if hold thou wilt<br />thy kinsman&rsquo;s kingdom! Thy keen
mind pleases me<br />the longer the better, Beowulf loved!</p>
<p>Thou hast brought it about that both our peoples,<br />sons of the
Geat and Spear-Dane folk,<br />shall have mutual peace, and from murderous
strife,<br />such as once they waged, from war refrain.<br />Long as
I rule this realm so wide,<br />let our hoards be common, let heroes
with gold<br />each other greet o&rsquo;er the gannet&rsquo;s-bath,<br />and
the ringed-prow bear o&rsquo;er rolling waves<br />tokens of love. I
trow my landfolk<br />towards friend and foe are firmly joined,<br />and
honor they keep in the olden way.&rdquo;<br />To him in the hall, then,
Healfdene&rsquo;s son<br />gave treasures twelve, and the trust-of-earls<br />bade
him fare with the gifts to his folk beloved,<br />hale to his home,
and in haste return.<br />Then kissed the king of kin renowned,<br />Scyldings&rsquo;
chieftain, that choicest thane,<br />and fell on his neck. Fast flowed
the tears<br />of the hoary-headed. Heavy with winters,<br />he had
chances twain, but he clung to this, <a name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a">{26a}</a>
--<br />that each should look on the other again,<br />and hear him
in hall. Was this hero so dear to him.<br />his breast&rsquo;s wild
billows he banned in vain;<br />safe in his soul a secret longing,<br />locked
in his mind, for that loved man<br />burned in his blood. Then Beowulf
strode,<br />glad of his gold-gifts, the grass-plot o&rsquo;er,<br />warrior
blithe. The wave-roamer bode<br />riding at anchor, its owner awaiting.<br />As
they hastened onward, Hrothgar&rsquo;s gift<br />they lauded at length.
-- &rsquo;Twas a lord unpeered,<br />every way blameless, till age had
broken<br />-- it spareth no mortal -- his splendid might.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXVII</p>
<p>CAME now to ocean the ever-courageous<br />hardy henchmen, their
harness bearing,<br />woven war-sarks. The warden marked,<br />trusty
as ever, the earl&rsquo;s return.<br />From the height of the hill no
hostile words<br />reached the guests as he rode to greet them;<br />but
&ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo; he called to that Weder clan<br />as the sheen-mailed
spoilers to ship marched on.<br />Then on the strand, with steeds and
treasure<br />and armor their roomy and ring-dight ship<br />was heavily
laden: high its mast<br />rose over Hrothgar&rsquo;s hoarded gems.<br />A
sword to the boat-guard Beowulf gave,<br />mounted with gold; on the
mead-bench since<br />he was better esteemed, that blade possessing,<br />heirloom
old. -- Their ocean-keel boarding,<br />they drove through the deep,
and Daneland left.<br />A sea-cloth was set, a sail with ropes,<br />firm
to the mast; the flood-timbers moaned; <a name="citation27a"></a><a href="#footnote27a">{27a}</a><br />nor
did wind over billows that wave-swimmer blow<br />across from her course.
The craft sped on,<br />foam-necked it floated forth o&rsquo;er the
waves,<br />keel firm-bound over briny currents,<br />till they got
them sight of the Geatish cliffs,<br />home-known headlands. High the
boat,<br />stirred by winds, on the strand updrove.<br />Helpful at
haven the harbor-guard stood,<br />who long already for loved companions<br />by
the water had waited and watched afar.<br />He bound to the beach the
broad-bosomed ship<br />with anchor-bands, lest ocean-billows<br />that
trusty timber should tear away.<br />Then Beowulf bade them bear the
treasure,<br />gold and jewels; no journey far<br />was it thence to
go to the giver of rings,<br />Hygelac Hrethling: at home he dwelt<br />by
the sea-wall close, himself and clan.<br />Haughty that house, a hero
the king,<br />high the hall, and Hygd <a name="citation27b"></a><a href="#footnote27b">{27b}</a>
right young,<br />wise and wary, though winters few<br />in those fortress
walls she had found a home,<br />Haereth&rsquo;s daughter. Nor humble
her ways,<br />nor grudged she gifts to the Geatish men,<br />of precious
treasure. Not Thryth&rsquo;s pride showed she,<br />folk-queen famed,
or that fell deceit.<br />Was none so daring that durst make bold<br />(save
her lord alone) of the liegemen dear<br />that lady full in the face
to look,<br />but forged fetters he found his lot,<br />bonds of death!
And brief the respite;<br />soon as they seized him, his sword-doom
was spoken,<br />and the burnished blade a baleful murder<br />proclaimed
and closed. No queenly way<br />for woman to practise, though peerless
she,<br />that the weaver-of-peace <a name="citation27c"></a><a href="#footnote27c">{27c}</a>
from warrior dear<br />by wrath and lying his life should reave!<br />But
Hemming&rsquo;s kinsman hindered this. --<br />For over their ale men
also told<br />that of these folk-horrors fewer she wrought,<br />onslaughts
of evil, after she went,<br />gold-decked bride, to the brave young
prince,<br />atheling haughty, and Offa&rsquo;s hall<br />o&rsquo;er
the fallow flood at her father&rsquo;s bidding<br />safely sought, where
since she prospered,<br />royal, throned, rich in goods,<br />fain of
the fair life fate had sent her,<br />and leal in love to the lord of
warriors.<br />He, of all heroes I heard of ever<br />from sea to sea,
of the sons of earth,<br />most excellent seemed. Hence Offa was praised<br />for
his fighting and feeing by far-off men,<br />the spear-bold warrior;
wisely he ruled<br />over his empire. Eomer woke to him,<br />help of
heroes, Hemming&rsquo;s kinsman,<br />Grandson of Garmund, grim in war.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXVIII</p>
<p>HASTENED the hardy one, henchmen with him,<br />sandy strand of the
sea to tread<br />and widespread ways. The world&rsquo;s great candle,<br />sun
shone from south. They strode along<br />with sturdy steps to the spot
they knew<br />where the battle-king young, his burg within,<br />slayer
of Ongentheow, shared the rings,<br />shelter-of-heroes. To Hygelac<br />Beowulf&rsquo;s
coming was quickly told, --<br />that there in the court the clansmen&rsquo;s
refuge,<br />the shield-companion sound and alive,<br />hale from the
hero-play homeward strode.<br />With haste in the hall, by highest order,<br />room
for the rovers was readily made.<br />By his sovran he sat, come safe
from battle,<br />kinsman by kinsman. His kindly lord<br />he first
had greeted in gracious form,<br />with manly words. The mead dispensing,<br />came
through the high hall Haereth&rsquo;s daughter,<br />winsome to warriors,
wine-cup bore<br />to the hands of the heroes. Hygelac then<br />his
comrade fairly with question plied<br />in the lofty hall, sore longing
to know<br />what manner of sojourn the Sea-Geats made.<br />&ldquo;What
came of thy quest, my kinsman Beowulf,<br />when thy yearnings suddenly
swept thee yonder<br />battle to seek o&rsquo;er the briny sea,<br />combat
in Heorot? Hrothgar couldst thou<br />aid at all, the honored chief,<br />in
his wide-known woes? With waves of care<br />my sad heart seethed; I
sore mistrusted<br />my loved one&rsquo;s venture: long I begged thee<br />by
no means to seek that slaughtering monster,<br />but suffer the South-Danes
to settle their feud<br />themselves with Grendel. Now God be thanked<br />that
safe and sound I can see thee now!&rdquo;<br />Beowulf spake, the bairn
of Ecgtheow: --<br />&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis known and unhidden, Hygelac Lord,<br />to
many men, that meeting of ours,<br />struggle grim between Grendel and
me,<br />which we fought on the field where full too many<br />sorrows
he wrought for the Scylding-Victors,<br />evils unending. These all
I avenged.<br />No boast can be from breed of Grendel,<br />any on earth,
for that uproar at dawn,<br />from the longest-lived of the loathsome
race<br />in fleshly fold! -- But first I went<br />Hrothgar to greet
in the hall of gifts,<br />where Healfdene&rsquo;s kinsman high-renowned,<br />soon
as my purpose was plain to him,<br />assigned me a seat by his son and
heir.<br />The liegemen were lusty; my life-days never<br />such merry
men over mead in hall<br />have I heard under heaven! The high-born
queen,<br />people&rsquo;s peace-bringer, passed through the hall,<br />cheered
the young clansmen, clasps of gold,<br />ere she sought her seat, to
sundry gave.<br />Oft to the heroes Hrothgar&rsquo;s daughter,<br />to
earls in turn, the ale-cup tendered, --<br />she whom I heard these
hall-companions<br />Freawaru name, when fretted gold<br />she proffered
the warriors. Promised is she,<br />gold-decked maid, to the glad son
of Froda.<br />Sage this seems to the Scylding&rsquo;s-friend,<br />kingdom&rsquo;s-keeper:
he counts it wise<br />the woman to wed so and ward off feud,<br />store
of slaughter. But seldom ever<br />when men are slain, does the murder-spear
sink<br />but briefest while, though the bride be fair! <a name="citation28a"></a><a href="#footnote28a">{28a}</a><br />&ldquo;Nor
haply will like it the Heathobard lord,<br />and as little each of his
liegemen all,<br />when a thane of the Danes, in that doughty throng,<br />goes
with the lady along their hall,<br />and on him the old-time heirlooms
glisten<br />hard and ring-decked, Heathobard&rsquo;s treasure,<br />weapons
that once they wielded fair<br />until they lost at the linden-play
<a name="citation28b"></a><a href="#footnote28b">{28b}</a><br />liegeman
leal and their lives as well.<br />Then, over the ale, on this heirloom
gazing,<br />some ash-wielder old who has all in mind<br />that spear-death
of men, <a name="citation28c"></a><a href="#footnote28c">{28c}</a> --
he is stern of mood,<br />heavy at heart, -- in the hero young<br />tests
the temper and tries the soul<br />and war-hate wakens, with words like
these: --<br />Canst thou not, comrade, ken that sword<br />which to
the fray thy father carried<br />in his final feud, &rsquo;neath the
fighting-mask,<br />dearest of blades, when the Danish slew him<br />and
wielded the war-place on Withergild&rsquo;s fall,<br />after havoc of
heroes, those hardy Scyldings?<br />Now, the son of a certain slaughtering
Dane,<br />proud of his treasure, paces this hall,<br />joys in the
killing, and carries the jewel <a name="citation28d"></a><a href="#footnote28d">{28d}</a><br />that
rightfully ought to be owned by thee!_<br />Thus he urges and eggs him
all the time<br />with keenest words, till occasion offers<br />that
Freawaru&rsquo;s thane, for his father&rsquo;s deed,<br />after bite
of brand in his blood must slumber,<br />losing his life; but that liegeman
flies<br />living away, for the land he kens.<br />And thus be broken
on both their sides<br />oaths of the earls, when Ingeld&rsquo;s breast<br />wells
with war-hate, and wife-love now<br />after the care-billows cooler
grows.<br />&ldquo;So <a name="citation28e"></a><a href="#footnote28e">{28e}</a>
I hold not high the Heathobards&rsquo; faith<br />due to the Danes,
or their during love<br />and pact of peace. -- But I pass from that,<br />turning
to Grendel, O giver-of-treasure,<br />and saying in full how the fight
resulted,<br />hand-fray of heroes. When heaven&rsquo;s jewel<br />had
fled o&rsquo;er far fields, that fierce sprite came,<br />night-foe
savage, to seek us out<br />where safe and sound we sentried the hall.<br />To
Hondscio then was that harassing deadly,<br />his fall there was fated.
He first was slain,<br />girded warrior. Grendel on him<br />turned
murderous mouth, on our mighty kinsman,<br />and all of the brave man&rsquo;s
body devoured.<br />Yet none the earlier, empty-handed,<br />would the
bloody-toothed murderer, mindful of bale,<br />outward go from the gold-decked
hall:<br />but me he attacked in his terror of might,<br />with greedy
hand grasped me. A glove hung by him <a name="citation28f"></a><a href="#footnote28f">{28f}</a><br />wide
and wondrous, wound with bands;<br />and in artful wise it all was wrought,<br />by
devilish craft, of dragon-skins.<br />Me therein, an innocent man,<br />the
fiendish foe was fain to thrust<br />with many another. He might not
so,<br />when I all angrily upright stood.<br />&rsquo;Twere long to
relate how that land-destroyer<br />I paid in kind for his cruel deeds;<br />yet
there, my prince, this people of thine<br />got fame by my fighting.
He fled away,<br />and a little space his life preserved;<br />but there
staid behind him his stronger hand<br />left in Heorot; heartsick thence<br />on
the floor of the ocean that outcast fell.<br />Me for this struggle
the Scyldings&rsquo;-friend<br />paid in plenty with plates of gold,<br />with
many a treasure, when morn had come<br />and we all at the banquet-board
sat down.<br />Then was song and glee. The gray-haired Scylding,<br />much
tested, told of the times of yore.<br />Whiles the hero his harp bestirred,<br />wood-of-delight;
now lays he chanted<br />of sooth and sadness, or said aright<br />legends
of wonder, the wide-hearted king;<br />or for years of his youth he
would yearn at times,<br />for strength of old struggles, now stricken
with age,<br />hoary hero: his heart surged full<br />when, wise with
winters, he wailed their flight.<br />Thus in the hall the whole of
that day<br />at ease we feasted, till fell o&rsquo;er earth<br />another
night. Anon full ready<br />in greed of vengeance, Grendel&rsquo;s mother<br />set
forth all doleful. Dead was her son<br />through war-hate of Weders;
now, woman monstrous<br />with fury fell a foeman she slew,<br />avenged
her offspring. From Aeschere old,<br />loyal councillor, life was gone;<br />nor
might they e&rsquo;en, when morning broke,<br />those Danish people,
their death-done comrade<br />burn with brands, on balefire lay<br />the
man they mourned. Under mountain stream<br />she had carried the corpse
with cruel hands.<br />For Hrothgar that was the heaviest sorrow<br />of
all that had laden the lord of his folk.<br />The leader then, by thy
life, besought me<br />(sad was his soul) in the sea-waves&rsquo; coil<br />to
play the hero and hazard my being<br />for glory of prowess: my guerdon
he pledged.<br />I then in the waters -- &rsquo;tis widely known --<br />that
sea-floor-guardian savage found.<br />Hand-to-hand there a while we
struggled;<br />billows welled blood; in the briny hall<br />her head
I hewed with a hardy blade<br />from Grendel&rsquo;s mother, -- and
gained my life,<br />though not without danger. My doom was not yet.<br />Then
the haven-of-heroes, Healfdene&rsquo;s son,<br />gave me in guerdon
great gifts of price.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXIX</p>
<p>&ldquo;So held this king to the customs old,<br />that I wanted for
nought in the wage I gained,<br />the meed of my might; he made me gifts,<br />Healfdene&rsquo;s
heir, for my own disposal.<br />Now to thee, my prince, I proffer them
all,<br />gladly give them. Thy grace alone<br />can find me favor.
Few indeed<br />have I of kinsmen, save, Hygelac, thee!&rdquo;<br />Then
he bade them bear him the boar-head standard,<br />the battle-helm high,
and breastplate gray,<br />the splendid sword; then spake in form: --<br />&ldquo;Me
this war-gear the wise old prince,<br />Hrothgar, gave, and his hest
he added,<br />that its story be straightway said to thee. --<br />A
while it was held by Heorogar king,<br />for long time lord of the land
of Scyldings;<br />yet not to his son the sovran left it,<br />to daring
Heoroweard, -- dear as he was to him,<br />his harness of battle. --
Well hold thou it all!&rdquo;<br />And I heard that soon passed o&rsquo;er
the path of this treasure,<br />all apple-fallow, four good steeds,<br />each
like the others, arms and horses<br />he gave to the king. So should
kinsmen be,<br />not weave one another the net of wiles,<br />or with
deep-hid treachery death contrive<br />for neighbor and comrade. His
nephew was ever<br />by hardy Hygelac held full dear,<br />and each
kept watch o&rsquo;er the other&rsquo;s weal.<br />I heard, too, the
necklace to Hygd he presented,<br />wonder-wrought treasure, which Wealhtheow
gave him<br />sovran&rsquo;s daughter: three steeds he added,<br />slender
and saddle-gay. Since such gift<br />the gem gleamed bright on the breast
of the queen.<br />Thus showed his strain the son of Ecgtheow<br />as
a man remarked for mighty deeds<br />and acts of honor. At ale he slew
not<br />comrade or kin; nor cruel his mood,<br />though of sons of
earth his strength was greatest,<br />a glorious gift that God had sent<br />the
splendid leader. Long was he spurned,<br />and worthless by Geatish
warriors held;<br />him at mead the master-of-clans<br />failed full
oft to favor at all.<br />Slack and shiftless the strong men deemed
him,<br />profitless prince; but payment came,<br />to the warrior honored,
for all his woes. --<br />Then the bulwark-of-earls <a name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a">{29a}</a>
bade bring within,<br />hardy chieftain, Hrethel&rsquo;s heirloom<br />garnished
with gold: no Geat e&rsquo;er knew<br />in shape of a sword a statelier
prize.<br />The brand he laid in Beowulf&rsquo;s lap;<br />and of hides
assigned him seven thousand, <a name="citation29b"></a><a href="#footnote29b">{29b}</a><br />with
house and high-seat. They held in common<br />land alike by their line
of birth,<br />inheritance, home: but higher the king<br />because of
his rule o&rsquo;er the realm itself.</p>
<p>Now further it fell with the flight of years,<br />with harryings
horrid, that Hygelac perished, <a name="citation29c"></a><a href="#footnote29c">{29c}</a><br />and
Heardred, too, by hewing of swords<br />under the shield-wall slaughtered
lay,<br />when him at the van of his victor-folk<br />sought hardy heroes,
Heatho-Scilfings,<br />in arms o&rsquo;erwhelming Hereric&rsquo;s nephew.<br />Then
Beowulf came as king this broad<br />realm to wield; and he ruled it
well<br />fifty winters, <a name="citation29d"></a><a href="#footnote29d">{29d}</a>
a wise old prince,<br />warding his land, until One began<br />in the
dark of night, a Dragon, to rage.<br />In the grave on the hill a hoard
it guarded,<br />in the stone-barrow steep. A strait path reached it,<br />unknown
to mortals. Some man, however,<br />came by chance that cave within<br />to
the heathen hoard. <a name="citation29e"></a><a href="#footnote29e">{29e}</a>
In hand he took<br />a golden goblet, nor gave he it back,<br />stole
with it away, while the watcher slept,<br />by thievish wiles: for the
warden&rsquo;s wrath<br />prince and people must pay betimes!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXX</p>
<p>THAT way he went with no will of his own,<br />in danger of life,
to the dragon&rsquo;s hoard,<br />but for pressure of peril, some prince&rsquo;s
thane.<br />He fled in fear the fatal scourge,<br />seeking shelter,
a sinful man,<br />and entered in. At the awful sight<br />tottered
that guest, and terror seized him;<br />yet the wretched fugitive rallied
anon<br />from fright and fear ere he fled away,<br />and took the cup
from that treasure-hoard.<br />Of such besides there was store enough,<br />heirlooms
old, the earth below,<br />which some earl forgotten, in ancient years,<br />left
the last of his lofty race,<br />heedfully there had hidden away,<br />dearest
treasure. For death of yore<br />had hurried all hence; and he alone<br />left
to live, the last of the clan,<br />weeping his friends, yet wished
to bide<br />warding the treasure, his one delight,<br />though brief
his respite. The barrow, new-ready,<br />to strand and sea-waves stood
anear,<br />hard by the headland, hidden and closed;<br />there laid
within it his lordly heirlooms<br />and heaped hoard of heavy gold<br />that
warden of rings. Few words he spake:<br />&ldquo;Now hold thou, earth,
since heroes may not,<br />what earls have owned! Lo, erst from thee<br />brave
men brought it! But battle-death seized<br />and cruel killing my clansmen
all,<br />robbed them of life and a liegeman&rsquo;s joys.<br />None
have I left to lift the sword,<br />or to cleanse the carven cup of
price,<br />beaker bright. My brave are gone.<br />And the helmet hard,
all haughty with gold,<br />shall part from its plating. Polishers sleep<br />who
could brighten and burnish the battle-mask;<br />and those weeds of
war that were wont to brave<br />over bicker of shields the bite of
steel<br />rust with their bearer. The ringed mail<br />fares not far
with famous chieftain,<br />at side of hero! No harp&rsquo;s delight,<br />no
glee-wood&rsquo;s gladness! No good hawk now<br />flies through the
hall! Nor horses fleet<br />stamp in the burgstead! Battle and death<br />the
flower of my race have reft away.&rdquo;<br />Mournful of mood, thus
he moaned his woe,<br />alone, for them all, and unblithe wept<br />by
day and by night, till death&rsquo;s fell wave<br />o&rsquo;erwhelmed
his heart. His hoard-of-bliss<br />that old ill-doer open found,<br />who,
blazing at twilight the barrows haunteth,<br />naked foe-dragon flying
by night<br />folded in fire: the folk of earth<br />dread him sore.
&rsquo;Tis his doom to seek<br />hoard in the graves, and heathen gold<br />to
watch, many-wintered: nor wins he thereby!<br />Powerful this plague-of-the-people
thus<br />held the house of the hoard in earth<br />three hundred winters;
till One aroused<br />wrath in his breast, to the ruler bearing<br />that
costly cup, and the king implored<br />for bond of peace. So the barrow
was plundered,<br />borne off was booty. His boon was granted<br />that
wretched man; and his ruler saw<br />first time what was fashioned in
far-off days.<br />When the dragon awoke, new woe was kindled.<br />O&rsquo;er
the stone he snuffed. The stark-heart found<br />footprint of foe who
so far had gone<br />in his hidden craft by the creature&rsquo;s head.
--<br />So may the undoomed easily flee<br />evils and exile, if only
he gain<br />the grace of The Wielder! -- That warden of gold<br />o&rsquo;er
the ground went seeking, greedy to find<br />the man who wrought him
such wrong in sleep.<br />Savage and burning, the barrow he circled<br />all
without; nor was any there,<br />none in the waste.... Yet war he desired,<br />was
eager for battle. The barrow he entered,<br />sought the cup, and discovered
soon<br />that some one of mortals had searched his treasure,<br />his
lordly gold. The guardian waited<br />ill-enduring till evening came;<br />boiling
with wrath was the barrow&rsquo;s keeper,<br />and fain with flame the
foe to pay<br />for the dear cup&rsquo;s loss. -- Now day was fled<br />as
the worm had wished. By its wall no more<br />was it glad to bide, but
burning flew<br />folded in flame: a fearful beginning<br />for sons
of the soil; and soon it came,<br />in the doom of their lord, to a
dreadful end.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXXI</p>
<p>THEN the baleful fiend its fire belched out,<br />and bright homes
burned. The blaze stood high<br />all landsfolk frighting. No living
thing<br />would that loathly one leave as aloft it flew.<br />Wide
was the dragon&rsquo;s warring seen,<br />its fiendish fury far and
near,<br />as the grim destroyer those Geatish people<br />hated and
hounded. To hidden lair,<br />to its hoard it hastened at hint of dawn.<br />Folk
of the land it had lapped in flame,<br />with bale and brand. In its
barrow it trusted,<br />its battling and bulwarks: that boast was vain!</p>
<p>To Beowulf then the bale was told<br />quickly and truly: the king&rsquo;s
own home,<br />of buildings the best, in brand-waves melted,<br />that
gift-throne of Geats. To the good old man<br />sad in heart, &rsquo;twas
heaviest sorrow.<br />The sage assumed that his sovran God<br />he had
angered, breaking ancient law,<br />and embittered the Lord. His breast
within<br />with black thoughts welled, as his wont was never.<br />The
folk&rsquo;s own fastness that fiery dragon<br />with flame had destroyed,
and the stronghold all<br />washed by waves; but the warlike king,<br />prince
of the Weders, plotted vengeance.<br />Warriors&rsquo;-bulwark, he bade
them work<br />all of iron -- the earl&rsquo;s commander --<br />a war-shield
wondrous: well he knew<br />that forest-wood against fire were worthless,<br />linden
could aid not. -- Atheling brave,<br />he was fated to finish this fleeting
life, <a name="citation31a"></a><a href="#footnote31a">{31a}</a><br />his
days on earth, and the dragon with him,<br />though long it had watched
o&rsquo;er the wealth of thehoard! --<br />Shame he reckoned it, sharer-of-rings,<br />to
follow the flyer-afar with a host,<br />a broad-flung band; nor the
battle feared he,<br />nor deemed he dreadful the dragon&rsquo;s warring,<br />its
vigor and valor: ventures desperate<br />he had passed a-plenty, and
perils of war,<br />contest-crash, since, conqueror proud,<br />Hrothgar&rsquo;s
hall he had wholly purged,<br />and in grapple had killed the kin of
Grendel,<br />loathsome breed! Not least was that<br />of hand-to-hand
fights where Hygelac fell,<br />when the ruler of Geats in rush of battle,<br />lord
of his folk, in the Frisian land,<br />son of Hrethel, by sword-draughts
died,<br />by brands down-beaten. Thence Beowulf fled<br />through strength
of himself and his swimming power,<br />though alone, and his arms were
laden with thirty<br />coats of mail, when he came to the sea!<br />Nor
yet might Hetwaras <a name="citation31b"></a><a href="#footnote31b">{31b}</a>
haughtily boast<br />their craft of contest, who carried against him<br />shields
to the fight: but few escaped<br />from strife with the hero to seek
their homes!<br />Then swam over ocean Ecgtheow&rsquo;s son<br />lonely
and sorrowful, seeking his land,<br />where Hygd made him offer of hoard
and realm,<br />rings and royal-seat, reckoning naught<br />the strength
of her son to save their kingdom<br />from hostile hordes, after Hygelac&rsquo;s
death.<br />No sooner for this could the stricken ones<br />in any wise
move that atheling&rsquo;s mind<br />over young Heardred&rsquo;s head
as lord<br />and ruler of all the realm to be:<br />yet the hero upheld
him with helpful words,<br />aided in honor, till, older grown,<br />he
wielded the Weder-Geats. -- Wandering exiles<br />sought him o&rsquo;er
seas, the sons of Ohtere,<br />who had spurned the sway of the Scylfings&rsquo;-helmet,<br />the
bravest and best that broke the rings,<br />in Swedish land, of the
sea-kings&rsquo; line,<br />haughty hero. <a name="citation31c"></a><a href="#footnote31c">{31c}</a>
Hence Heardred&rsquo;s end.<br />For shelter he gave them, sword-death
came,<br />the blade&rsquo;s fell blow, to bairn of Hygelac;<br />but
the son of Ongentheow sought again<br />house and home when Heardred
fell,<br />leaving Beowulf lord of Geats<br />and gift-seat&rsquo;s
master. -- A good king he!</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXXII</p>
<p>THE fall of his lord he was fain to requite<br />in after days; and
to Eadgils he proved<br />friend to the friendless, and forces sent<br />over
the sea to the son of Ohtere,<br />weapons and warriors: well repaid
he<br />those care-paths cold when the king he slew. <a name="citation32a"></a><a href="#footnote32a">{32a}</a><br />Thus
safe through struggles the son of Ecgtheow<br />had passed a plenty,
through perils dire,<br />with daring deeds, till this day was come<br />that
doomed him now with the dragon to strive.<br />With comrades eleven
the lord of Geats<br />swollen in rage went seeking the dragon.<br />He
had heard whence all the harm arose<br />and the killing of clansmen;
that cup of price<br />on the lap of the lord had been laid by the finder.<br />In
the throng was this one thirteenth man,<br />starter of all the strife
and ill,<br />care-laden captive; cringing thence<br />forced and reluctant,
he led them on<br />till he came in ken of that cavern-hall,<br />the
barrow delved near billowy surges,<br />flood of ocean. Within &rsquo;twas
full<br />of wire-gold and jewels; a jealous warden,<br />warrior trusty,
the treasures held,<br />lurked in his lair. Not light the task<br />of
entrance for any of earth-born men!<br />Sat on the headland the hero
king,<br />spake words of hail to his hearth-companions,<br />gold-friend
of Geats. All gloomy his soul,<br />wavering, death-bound. Wyrd full
nigh<br />stood ready to greet the gray-haired man,<br />to seize his
soul-hoard, sunder apart<br />life and body. Not long would be<br />the
warrior&rsquo;s spirit enwound with flesh.<br />Beowulf spake, the bairn
of Ecgtheow: --<br />&ldquo;Through store of struggles I strove in youth,<br />mighty
feuds; I mind them all.<br />I was seven years old when the sovran of
rings,<br />friend-of-his-folk, from my father took me,<br />had me,
and held me, Hrethel the king,<br />with food and fee, faithful in kinship.<br />Ne&rsquo;er,
while I lived there, he loathlier found me,<br />bairn in the burg,
than his birthright sons,<br />Herebeald and Haethcyn and Hygelac mine.<br />For
the eldest of these, by unmeet chance,<br />by kinsman&rsquo;s deed,
was the death-bed strewn,<br />when Haethcyn killed him with horny bow,<br />his
own dear liege laid low with an arrow,<br />missed the mark and his
mate shot down,<br />one brother the other, with bloody shaft.<br />A
feeless fight, <a name="citation32b"></a><a href="#footnote32b">{32b}</a>
and a fearful sin,<br />horror to Hrethel; yet, hard as it was,<br />unavenged
must the atheling die!<br />Too awful it is for an aged man<br />to
bide and bear, that his bairn so young<br />rides on the gallows. A
rime he makes,<br />sorrow-song for his son there hanging<br />as rapture
of ravens; no rescue now<br />can come from the old, disabled man!<br />Still
is he minded, as morning breaks,<br />of the heir gone elsewhere; <a name="citation32c"></a><a href="#footnote32c">{32c}</a>
another he hopes not<br />he will bide to see his burg within<br />as
ward for his wealth, now the one has found<br />doom of death that the
deed incurred.<br />Forlorn he looks on the lodge of his son,<br />wine-hall
waste and wind-swept chambers<br />reft of revel. The rider sleepeth,<br />the
hero, far-hidden; <a name="citation32d"></a><a href="#footnote32d">{32d}</a>
no harp resounds,<br />in the courts no wassail, as once was heard.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXXIII</p>
<p>&ldquo;THEN he goes to his chamber, a grief-song chants<br />alone
for his lost. Too large all seems,<br />homestead and house. So the
helmet-of-Weders<br />hid in his heart for Herebeald<br />waves of woe.
No way could he take<br />to avenge on the slayer slaughter so foul;<br />nor
e&rsquo;en could he harass that hero at all<br />with loathing deed,
though he loved him not.<br />And so for the sorrow his soul endured,<br />men&rsquo;s
gladness he gave up and God&rsquo;s light chose.<br />Lands and cities
he left his sons<br />(as the wealthy do) when he went from earth.<br />There
was strife and struggle &rsquo;twixt Swede and Geat<br />o&rsquo;er
the width of waters; war arose,<br />hard battle-horror, when Hrethel
died,<br />and Ongentheow&rsquo;s offspring grew<br />strife-keen, bold,
nor brooked o&rsquo;er the seas<br />pact of peace, but pushed their
hosts<br />to harass in hatred by Hreosnabeorh.<br />Men of my folk
for that feud had vengeance,<br />for woful war (&lsquo;tis widely known),<br />though
one of them bought it with blood of his heart,<br />a bargain hard:
for Haethcyn proved<br />fatal that fray, for the first-of-Geats.<br />At
morn, I heard, was the murderer killed<br />by kinsman for kinsman,
<a name="citation33a"></a><a href="#footnote33a">{33a}</a> with clash
of sword,<br />when Ongentheow met Eofor there.<br />Wide split the
war-helm: wan he fell,<br />hoary Scylfing; the hand that smote him<br />of
feud was mindful, nor flinched from the death-blow.<br />-- &ldquo;For
all that he <a name="citation33b"></a><a href="#footnote33b">{33b}</a>
gave me, my gleaming sword<br />repaid him at war, -- such power I wielded,
--<br />for lordly treasure: with land he entrusted me,<br />homestead
and house. He had no need<br />from Swedish realm, or from Spear-Dane
folk,<br />or from men of the Gifths, to get him help, --<br />some
warrior worse for wage to buy!<br />Ever I fought in the front of all,<br />sole
to the fore; and so shall I fight<br />while I bide in life and this
blade shall last<br />that early and late hath loyal proved<br />since
for my doughtiness Daeghrefn fell,<br />slain by my hand, the Hugas&rsquo;
champion.<br />Nor fared he thence to the Frisian king<br />with the
booty back, and breast-adornments;<br />but, slain in struggle, that
standard-bearer<br />fell, atheling brave. Not with blade was he slain,<br />but
his bones were broken by brawny gripe,<br />his heart-waves stilled.
-- The sword-edge now,<br />hard blade and my hand, for the hoard shall
strive.&rdquo;<br />Beowulf spake, and a battle-vow made<br />his last
of all: &ldquo;I have lived through many<br />wars in my youth; now
once again,<br />old folk-defender, feud will I seek,<br />do doughty
deeds, if the dark destroyer<br />forth from his cavern come to fight
me!&rdquo;<br />Then hailed he the helmeted heroes all,<br />for the
last time greeting his liegemen dear,<br />comrades of war: &ldquo;I
should carry no weapon,<br />no sword to the serpent, if sure I knew<br />how,
with such enemy, else my vows<br />I could gain as I did in Grendel&rsquo;s
day.<br />But fire in this fight I must fear me now,<br />and poisonous
breath; so I bring with me<br />breastplate and board. <a name="citation33c"></a><a href="#footnote33c">{33c}</a>
From the barrow&rsquo;s keeper<br />no footbreadth flee I. One fight
shall end<br />our war by the wall, as Wyrd allots,<br />all mankind&rsquo;s
master. My mood is bold<br />but forbears to boast o&rsquo;er this battling-flyer.<br />--
Now abide by the barrow, ye breastplate-mailed,<br />ye heroes in harness,
which of us twain<br />better from battle-rush bear his wounds.<br />Wait
ye the finish. The fight is not yours,<br />nor meet for any but me
alone<br />to measure might with this monster here<br />and play the
hero. Hardily I<br />shall win that wealth, or war shall seize,<br />cruel
killing, your king and lord!&rdquo;<br />Up stood then with shield the
sturdy champion,<br />stayed by the strength of his single manhood,<br />and
hardy &rsquo;neath helmet his harness bore<br />under cleft of the cliffs:
no coward&rsquo;s path!<br />Soon spied by the wall that warrior chief,<br />survivor
of many a victory-field<br />where foemen fought with furious clashings,<br />an
arch of stone; and within, a stream<br />that broke from the barrow.
The brooklet&rsquo;s wave<br />was hot with fire. The hoard that way<br />he
never could hope unharmed to near,<br />or endure those deeps, <a name="citation33d"></a><a href="#footnote33d">{33d}</a>
for the dragon&rsquo;s flame.<br />Then let from his breast, for he
burst with rage,<br />the Weder-Geat prince a word outgo;<br />stormed
the stark-heart; stern went ringing<br />and clear his cry &rsquo;neath
the cliff-rocks gray.<br />The hoard-guard heard a human voice;<br />his
rage was enkindled. No respite now<br />for pact of peace! The poison-breath<br />of
that foul worm first came forth from the cave,<br />hot reek-of-fight:
the rocks resounded.<br />Stout by the stone-way his shield he raised,<br />lord
of the Geats, against the loathed-one;<br />while with courage keen
that coiled foe<br />came seeking strife. The sturdy king<br />had drawn
his sword, not dull of edge,<br />heirloom old; and each of the two<br />felt
fear of his foe, though fierce their mood.<br />Stoutly stood with his
shield high-raised<br />the warrior king, as the worm now coiled<br />together
amain: the mailed-one waited.<br />Now, spire by spire, fast sped and
glided<br />that blazing serpent. The shield protected,<br />soul and
body a shorter while<br />for the hero-king than his heart desired,<br />could
his will have wielded the welcome respite<br />but once in his life!
But Wyrd denied it,<br />and victory&rsquo;s honors. -- His arm he lifted<br />lord
of the Geats, the grim foe smote<br />with atheling&rsquo;s heirloom.
Its edge was turned<br />brown blade, on the bone, and bit more feebly<br />than
its noble master had need of then<br />in his baleful stress. -- Then
the barrow&rsquo;s keeper<br />waxed full wild for that weighty blow,<br />cast
deadly flames; wide drove and far<br />those vicious fires. No victor&rsquo;s
glory<br />the Geats&rsquo; lord boasted; his brand had failed,<br />naked
in battle, as never it should,<br />excellent iron! -- &rsquo;Twas no
easy path<br />that Ecgtheow&rsquo;s honored heir must tread<br />over
the plain to the place of the foe;<br />for against his will he must
win a home<br />elsewhere far, as must all men, leaving<br />this lapsing
life! -- Not long it was<br />ere those champions grimly closed again.<br />The
hoard-guard was heartened; high heaved hisbreast<br />once more; and
by peril was pressed again,<br />enfolded in flames, the folk-commander!<br />Nor
yet about him his band of comrades,<br />sons of athelings, armed stood<br />with
warlike front: to the woods they bent them,<br />their lives to save.
But the soul of one<br />with care was cumbered. Kinship true<br />can
never be marred in a noble mind!</p>

<p>XXXIV</p>
<p>WIGLAF his name was, Weohstan&rsquo;s son,<br />linden-thane loved,
the lord of Scylfings,<br />Aelfhere&rsquo;s kinsman. His king he now
saw<br />with heat under helmet hard oppressed.<br />He minded the prizes
his prince had given him,<br />wealthy seat of the Waegmunding line,<br />and
folk-rights that his father owned<br />Not long he lingered. The linden
yellow,<br />his shield, he seized; the old sword he drew: --<br />as
heirloom of Eanmund earth-dwellers knew it,<br />who was slain by the
sword-edge, son of Ohtere,<br />friendless exile, erst in fray<br />killed
by Weohstan, who won for his kin<br />brown-bright helmet, breastplate
ringed,<br />old sword of Eotens, Onela&rsquo;s gift,<br />weeds of
war of the warrior-thane,<br />battle-gear brave: though a brother&rsquo;s
child<br />had been felled, the feud was unfelt by Onela. <a name="citation34a"></a><a href="#footnote34a">{34a}</a><br />For
winters this war-gear Weohstan kept,<br />breastplate and board, till
his bairn had grown<br />earlship to earn as the old sire did:<br />then
he gave him, mid Geats, the gear of battle,<br />portion huge, when
he passed from life,<br />fared aged forth. For the first time now<br />with
his leader-lord the liegeman young<br />was bidden to share the shock
of battle.<br />Neither softened his soul, nor the sire&rsquo;s bequest<br />weakened
in war. <a name="citation34b"></a><a href="#footnote34b">{34b}</a> So
the worm found out<br />when once in fight the foes had met!<br />Wiglaf
spake, -- and his words were sage;<br />sad in spirit, he said to his
comrades: --<br />&ldquo;I remember the time, when mead we took,<br />what
promise we made to this prince of ours<br />in the banquet-hall, to
our breaker-of-rings,<br />for gear of combat to give him requital,<br />for
hard-sword and helmet, if hap should bring<br />stress of this sort!
Himself who chose us<br />from all his army to aid him now,<br />urged
us to glory, and gave these treasures,<br />because he counted us keen
with the spear<br />and hardy &rsquo;neath helm, though this hero-work<br />our
leader hoped unhelped and alone<br />to finish for us, -- folk-defender<br />who
hath got him glory greater than all men<br />for daring deeds! Now the
day is come<br />that our noble master has need of the might<br />of
warriors stout. Let us stride along<br />the hero to help while the
heat is about him<br />glowing and grim! For God is my witness<br />I
am far more fain the fire should seize<br />along with my lord these
limbs of mine! <a name="citation34c"></a><a href="#footnote34c">{34c}</a><br />Unsuiting
it seems our shields to bear<br />homeward hence, save here we essay<br />to
fell the foe and defend the life<br />of the Weders&rsquo; lord. I wot
&rsquo;twere shame<br />on the law of our land if alone the king<br />out
of Geatish warriors woe endured<br />and sank in the struggle! My sword
and helmet,<br />breastplate and board, for us both shall serve!&rdquo;<br />Through
slaughter-reek strode he to succor his chieftain,<br />his battle-helm
bore, and brief words spake: --<br />&ldquo;Beowulf dearest, do all
bravely,<br />as in youthful days of yore thou vowedst<br />that while
life should last thou wouldst let no wise<br />thy glory droop! Now,
great in deeds,<br />atheling steadfast, with all thy strength<br />shield
thy life! I will stand to help thee.&rdquo;<br />At the words the worm
came once again,<br />murderous monster mad with rage,<br />with fire-billows
flaming, its foes to seek,<br />the hated men. In heat-waves burned<br />that
board <a name="citation34d"></a><a href="#footnote34d">{34d}</a> to
the boss, and the breastplate failed<br />to shelter at all the spear-thane
young.<br />Yet quickly under his kinsman&rsquo;s shield<br />went eager
the earl, since his own was now<br />all burned by the blaze. The bold
king again<br />had mind of his glory: with might his glaive<br />was
driven into the dragon&rsquo;s head, --<br />blow nerved by hate. But
Naegling <a name="citation34e"></a><a href="#footnote34e">{34e}</a>
was shivered,<br />broken in battle was Beowulf&rsquo;s sword,<br />old
and gray. &rsquo;Twas granted him not<br />that ever the edge of iron
at all<br />could help him at strife: too strong was his hand,<br />so
the tale is told, and he tried too far<br />with strength of stroke
all swords he wielded,<br />though sturdy their steel: they steaded
him nought.<br />Then for the third time thought on its feud<br />that
folk-destroyer, fire-dread dragon,<br />and rushed on the hero, where
room allowed,<br />battle-grim, burning; its bitter teeth<br />closed
on his neck, and covered him<br />with waves of blood from his breast
that welled.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXXV</p>
<p>&rsquo;TWAS now, men say, in his sovran&rsquo;s need<br />that the
earl made known his noble strain,<br />craft and keenness and courage
enduring.<br />Heedless of harm, though his hand was burned,<br />hardy-hearted,
he helped his kinsman.<br />A little lower the loathsome beast<br />he
smote with sword; his steel drove in<br />bright and burnished; that
blaze began<br />to lose and lessen. At last the king<br />wielded his
wits again, war-knife drew,<br />a biting blade by his breastplate hanging,<br />and
the Weders&rsquo;-helm smote that worm asunder,<br />felled the foe,
flung forth its life.<br />So had they killed it, kinsmen both,<br />athelings
twain: thus an earl should be<br />in danger&rsquo;s day! -- Of deeds
of valor<br />this conqueror&rsquo;s-hour of the king was last,<br />of
his work in the world. The wound began,<br />which that dragon-of-earth
had erst inflicted,<br />to swell and smart; and soon he found<br />in
his breast was boiling, baleful and deep,<br />pain of poison. The prince
walked on,<br />wise in his thought, to the wall of rock;<br />then
sat, and stared at the structure of giants,<br />where arch of stone
and steadfast column<br />upheld forever that hall in earth.<br />Yet
here must the hand of the henchman peerless<br />lave with water his
winsome lord,<br />the king and conqueror covered with blood,<br />with
struggle spent, and unspan his helmet.<br />Beowulf spake in spite of
his hurt,<br />his mortal wound; full well he knew<br />his portion
now was past and gone<br />of earthly bliss, and all had fled<br />of
his file of days, and death was near:<br />&ldquo;I would fain bestow
on son of mine<br />this gear of war, were given me now<br />that any
heir should after me come<br />of my proper blood. This people I ruled<br />fifty
winters. No folk-king was there,<br />none at all, of the neighboring
clans<br />who war would wage me with &rsquo;warriors&rsquo;-friends&rsquo;
<a name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a">{35a}</a><br />and
threat me with horrors. At home I bided<br />what fate might come, and
I cared for mine own;<br />feuds I sought not, nor falsely swore<br />ever
on oath. For all these things,<br />though fatally wounded, fain am
I!<br />From the Ruler-of-Man no wrath shall seize me,<br />when life
from my frame must flee away,<br />for killing of kinsmen! Now quickly
go<br />and gaze on that hoard &rsquo;neath the hoary rock,<br />Wiglaf
loved, now the worm lies low,<br />sleeps, heart-sore, of his spoil
bereaved.<br />And fare in haste. I would fain behold<br />the gorgeous
heirlooms, golden store,<br />have joy in the jewels and gems, lay down<br />softlier
for sight of this splendid hoard<br />my life and the lordship I long
have held.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXXVI</p>
<p>I HAVE heard that swiftly the son of Weohstan<br />at wish and word
of his wounded king, --<br />war-sick warrior, -- woven mail-coat,<br />battle-sark,
bore &rsquo;neath the barrow&rsquo;s roof.<br />Then the clansman keen,
of conquest proud,<br />passing the seat, <a name="citation36a"></a><a href="#footnote36a">{36a}</a>
saw store of jewels<br />and glistening gold the ground along;<br />by
the wall were marvels, and many a vessel<br />in the den of the dragon,
the dawn-flier old:<br />unburnished bowls of bygone men<br />reft of
richness; rusty helms<br />of the olden age; and arm-rings many<br />wondrously
woven. -- Such wealth of gold,<br />booty from barrow, can burden with
pride<br />each human wight: let him hide it who will! --<br />His glance
too fell on a gold-wove banner<br />high o&rsquo;er the hoard, of handiwork
noblest,<br />brilliantly broidered; so bright its gleam,<br />all the
earth-floor he easily saw<br />and viewed all these vessels. No vestige
now<br />was seen of the serpent: the sword had ta&rsquo;en him.<br />Then,
I heard, the hill of its hoard was reft,<br />old work of giants, by
one alone;<br />he burdened his bosom with beakers and plate<br />at
his own good will, and the ensign took,<br />brightest of beacons. --
The blade of his lord<br />-- its edge was iron -- had injured deep<br />one
that guarded the golden hoard<br />many a year and its murder-fire<br />spread
hot round the barrow in horror-billows<br />at midnight hour, till it
met its doom.<br />Hasted the herald, the hoard so spurred him<br />his
track to retrace; he was troubled by doubt,<br />high-souled hero, if
haply he&rsquo;d find<br />alive, where he left him, the lord of Weders,<br />weakening
fast by the wall of the cave.<br />So he carried the load. His lord
and king<br />he found all bleeding, famous chief<br />at the lapse
of life. The liegeman again<br />plashed him with water, till point
of word<br />broke through the breast-hoard. Beowulf spake,<br />sage
and sad, as he stared at the gold. --<br />&ldquo;For the gold and treasure,
to God my thanks,<br />to the Wielder-of-Wonders, with words I say,<br />for
what I behold, to Heaven&rsquo;s Lord,<br />for the grace that I give
such gifts to my folk<br />or ever the day of my death be run!<br />Now
I&rsquo;ve bartered here for booty of treasure<br />the last of my life,
so look ye well<br />to the needs of my land! No longer I tarry.<br />A
barrow bid ye the battle-fanned raise<br />for my ashes. &rsquo;Twill
shine by the shore of the flood,<br />to folk of mine memorial fair<br />on
Hrones Headland high uplifted,<br />that ocean-wanderers oft may hail<br />Beowulf&rsquo;s
Barrow, as back from far<br />they drive their keels o&rsquo;er the
darkling wave.&rdquo;<br />From his neck he unclasped the collar of
gold,<br />valorous king, to his vassal gave it<br />with bright-gold
helmet, breastplate, and ring,<br />to the youthful thane: bade him
use them in joy.<br />&ldquo;Thou art end and remnant of all our race<br />the
Waegmunding name. For Wyrd hath swept them,<br />all my line, to the
land of doom,<br />earls in their glory: I after them go.&rdquo;<br />This
word was the last which the wise old man<br />harbored in heart ere
hot death-waves<br />of balefire he chose. From his bosom fled<br />his
soul to seek the saints&rsquo; reward.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXXVII</p>
<p>IT was heavy hap for that hero young<br />on his lord beloved to
look and find him<br />lying on earth with life at end,<br />sorrowful
sight. But the slayer too,<br />awful earth-dragon, empty of breath,<br />lay
felled in fight, nor, fain of its treasure,<br />could the writhing
monster rule it more.<br />For edges of iron had ended its days,<br />hard
and battle-sharp, hammers&rsquo; leaving; <a name="citation37a"></a><a href="#footnote37a">{37a}</a><br />and
that flier-afar had fallen to ground<br />hushed by its hurt, its hoard
all near,<br />no longer lusty aloft to whirl<br />at midnight, making
its merriment seen,<br />proud of its prizes: prone it sank<br />by
the handiwork of the hero-king.<br />Forsooth among folk but few achieve,<br />--
though sturdy and strong, as stories tell me,<br />and never so daring
in deed of valor, --<br />the perilous breath of a poison-foe<br />to
brave, and to rush on the ring-board hall,<br />whenever his watch the
warden keeps<br />bold in the barrow. Beowulf paid<br />the price of
death for that precious hoard;<br />and each of the foes had found the
end<br />of this fleeting life.<br />Befell erelong<br />that the laggards
in war the wood had left,<br />trothbreakers, cowards, ten together,<br />fearing
before to flourish a spear<br />in the sore distress of their sovran
lord.<br />Now in their shame their shields they carried,<br />armor
of fight, where the old man lay;<br />and they gazed on Wiglaf. Wearied
he sat<br />at his sovran&rsquo;s shoulder, shieldsman good,<br />to
wake him with water. <a name="citation37b"></a><a href="#footnote37b">{37b}</a>
Nowise it availed.<br />Though well he wished it, in world no more<br />could
he barrier life for that leader-of-battles<br />nor baffle the will
of all-wielding God.<br />Doom of the Lord was law o&rsquo;er the deeds<br />of
every man, as it is to-day.<br />Grim was the answer, easy to get,<br />from
the youth for those that had yielded to fear!<br />Wiglaf spake, the
son of Weohstan, --<br />mournful he looked on those men unloved: --<br />&ldquo;Who
sooth will speak, can say indeed<br />that the ruler who gave you golden
rings<br />and the harness of war in which ye stand<br />-- for he at
ale-bench often-times<br />bestowed on hall-folk helm and breastplate,<br />lord
to liegemen, the likeliest gear<br />which near of far he could find
to give, --<br />threw away and wasted these weeds of battle,<br />on
men who failed when the foemen came!<br />Not at all could the king
of his comrades-in-arms<br />venture to vaunt, though the Victory-Wielder,<br />God,
gave him grace that he got revenge<br />sole with his sword in stress
and need.<br />To rescue his life, &rsquo;twas little that I<br />could
serve him in struggle; yet shift I made<br />(hopeless it seemed) to
help my kinsman.<br />Its strength ever waned, when with weapon I struck<br />that
fatal foe, and the fire less strongly<br />flowed from its head. --
Too few the heroes<br />in throe of contest that thronged to our king!<br />Now
gift of treasure and girding of sword,<br />joy of the house and home-delight<br />shall
fail your folk; his freehold-land<br />every clansman within your kin<br />shall
lose and leave, when lords high-born<br />hear afar of that flight of
yours,<br />a fameless deed. Yea, death is better<br />for liegemen
all than a life of shame!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXXVIII</p>
<p>THAT battle-toil bade he at burg to announce,<br />at the fort on
the cliff, where, full of sorrow,<br />all the morning earls had sat,<br />daring
shieldsmen, in doubt of twain:<br />would they wail as dead, or welcome
home,<br />their lord beloved? Little <a name="citation38a"></a><a href="#footnote38a">{38a}</a>
kept back<br />of the tidings new, but told them all,<br />the herald
that up the headland rode. --<br />&ldquo;Now the willing-giver to Weder
folk<br />in death-bed lies; the Lord of Geats<br />on the slaughter-bed
sleeps by the serpent&rsquo;s deed!<br />And beside him is stretched
that slayer-of-men<br />with knife-wounds sick: <a name="citation38b"></a><a href="#footnote38b">{38b}</a>
no sword availed<br />on the awesome thing in any wise<br />to work
a wound. There Wiglaf sitteth,<br />Weohstan&rsquo;s bairn, by Beowulf&rsquo;s
side,<br />the living earl by the other dead,<br />and heavy of heart
a head-watch <a name="citation38c"></a><a href="#footnote38c">{38c}</a>
keeps<br />o&rsquo;er friend and foe. -- Now our folk may look<br />for
waging of war when once unhidden<br />to Frisian and Frank the fall
of the king<br />is spread afar. -- The strife began<br />when hot on
the Hugas <a name="citation38d"></a><a href="#footnote38d">{38d}</a>
Hygelac fell<br />and fared with his fleet to the Frisian land.<br />Him
there the Hetwaras humbled in war,<br />plied with such prowess their
power o&rsquo;erwhelming<br />that the bold-in-battle bowed beneath
it<br />and fell in fight. To his friends no wise<br />could that earl
give treasure! And ever since<br />the Merowings&rsquo; favor has failed
us wholly.<br />Nor aught expect I of peace and faith<br />from Swedish
folk. &rsquo;Twas spread afar<br />how Ongentheow reft at Ravenswood<br />Haethcyn
Hrethling of hope and life,<br />when the folk of Geats for the first
time sought<br />in wanton pride the Warlike-Scylfings.<br />Soon the
sage old sire <a name="citation38e"></a><a href="#footnote38e">{38e}</a>
of Ohtere,<br />ancient and awful, gave answering blow;<br />the sea-king
<a name="citation38f"></a><a href="#footnote38f">{38f}</a> he slew,
and his spouse redeemed,<br />his good wife rescued, though robbed of
her gold,<br />mother of Ohtere and Onela.<br />Then he followed his
foes, who fled before him<br />sore beset and stole their way,<br />bereft
of a ruler, to Ravenswood.</p>
<p>With his host he besieged there what swords had left,<br />the weary
and wounded; woes he threatened<br />the whole night through to that
hard-pressed throng:<br />some with the morrow his sword should kill,<br />some
should go to the gallows-tree<br />for rapture of ravens. But rescue
came<br />with dawn of day for those desperate men<br />when they heard
the horn of Hygelac sound,<br />tones of his trumpet; the trusty king<br />had
followed their trail with faithful band.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XXXIX</p>
<p>&ldquo;THE bloody swath of Swedes and Geats<br />and the storm of
their strife, were seen afar,<br />how folk against folk the fight had
wakened.<br />The ancient king with his atheling band<br />sought his
citadel, sorrowing much:<br />Ongentheow earl went up to his burg.<br />He
had tested Hygelac&rsquo;s hardihood,<br />the proud one&rsquo;s prowess,
would prove it no longer,<br />defied no more those fighting-wanderers<br />nor
hoped from the seamen to save his hoard,<br />his bairn and his bride:
so he bent him again,<br />old, to his earth-walls. Yet after him came<br />with
slaughter for Swedes the standards of Hygelac<br />o&rsquo;er peaceful
plains in pride advancing,<br />till Hrethelings fought in the fenced
town. <a name="citation39a"></a><a href="#footnote39a">{39a}</a><br />Then
Ongentheow with edge of sword,<br />the hoary-bearded, was held at bay,<br />and
the folk-king there was forced to suffer<br />Eofor&rsquo;s anger. In
ire, at the king<br />Wulf Wonreding with weapon struck;<br />and the
chieftain&rsquo;s blood, for that blow, in streams<br />flowed &rsquo;neath
his hair. No fear felt he,<br />stout old Scylfing, but straightway
repaid<br />in better bargain that bitter stroke<br />and faced his
foe with fell intent.<br />Nor swift enough was the son of Wonred<br />answer
to render the aged chief;<br />too soon on his head the helm was cloven;<br />blood-bedecked
he bowed to earth,<br />and fell adown; not doomed was he yet,<br />and
well he waxed, though the wound was sore.<br />Then the hardy Hygelac-thane,
<a name="citation39b"></a><a href="#footnote39b">{39b}</a><br />when
his brother fell, with broad brand smote,<br />giants&rsquo; sword crashing
through giants&rsquo;-helm<br />across the shield-wall: sank the king,<br />his
folk&rsquo;s old herdsman, fatally hurt.<br />There were many to bind
the brother&rsquo;s wounds<br />and lift him, fast as fate allowed<br />his
people to wield the place-of-war.<br />But Eofor took from Ongentheow,<br />earl
from other, the iron-breastplate,<br />hard sword hilted, and helmet
too,<br />and the hoar-chief&rsquo;s harness to Hygelac carried,<br />who
took the trappings, and truly promised<br />rich fee &rsquo;mid folk,
-- and fulfilled it so.<br />For that grim strife gave the Geatish lord,<br />Hrethel&rsquo;s
offspring, when home he came,<br />to Eofor and Wulf a wealth of treasure,<br />Each
of them had a hundred thousand <a name="citation39c"></a><a href="#footnote39c">{39c}</a><br />in
land and linked rings; nor at less price reckoned<br />mid-earth men
such mighty deeds!<br />And to Eofor he gave his only daughter<br />in
pledge of grace, the pride of his home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such is the feud, the foeman&rsquo;s rage,<br />death-hate
of men: so I deem it sure<br />that the Swedish folk will seek us home<br />for
this fall of their friends, the fighting-Scylfings,<br />when once they
learn that our warrior leader<br />lifeless lies, who land and hoard<br />ever
defended from all his foes,<br />furthered his folk&rsquo;s weal, finished
his course<br />a hardy hero. -- Now haste is best,<br />that we go
to gaze on our Geatish lord,<br />and bear the bountiful breaker-of-rings<br />to
the funeral pyre. No fragments merely<br />shall burn with the warrior.
Wealth of jewels,<br />gold untold and gained in terror,<br />treasure
at last with his life obtained,<br />all of that booty the brands shall
take,<br />fire shall eat it. No earl must carry<br />memorial jewel.
No maiden fair<br />shall wreathe her neck with noble ring:<br />nay,
sad in spirit and shorn of her gold,<br />oft shall she pass o&rsquo;er
paths of exile<br />now our lord all laughter has laid aside,<br />all
mirth and revel. Many a spear<br />morning-cold shall be clasped amain,<br />lifted
aloft; nor shall lilt of harp<br />those warriors wake; but the wan-hued
raven,<br />fain o&rsquo;er the fallen, his feast shall praise<br />and
boast to the eagle how bravely he ate<br />when he and the wolf were
wasting the slain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he told his sorrowful tidings,<br />and little <a name="citation39d"></a><a href="#footnote39d">{39d}</a>
he lied, the loyal man<br />of word or of work. The warriors rose;<br />sad,
they climbed to the Cliff-of-Eagles,<br />went, welling with tears,
the wonder to view.<br />Found on the sand there, stretched at rest,<br />their
lifeless lord, who had lavished rings<br />of old upon them. Ending-day<br />had
dawned on the doughty-one; death had seized<br />in woful slaughter
the Weders&rsquo; king.<br />There saw they, besides, the strangest
being,<br />loathsome, lying their leader near,<br />prone on the field.
The fiery dragon,<br />fearful fiend, with flame was scorched.<br />Reckoned
by feet, it was fifty measures<br />in length as it lay. Aloft erewhile<br />it
had revelled by night, and anon come back,<br />seeking its den; now
in death&rsquo;s sure clutch<br />it had come to the end of its earth-hall
joys.<br />By it there stood the stoups and jars;<br />dishes lay there,
and dear-decked swords<br />eaten with rust, as, on earth&rsquo;s lap
resting,<br />a thousand winters they waited there.<br />For all that
heritage huge, that gold<br />of bygone men, was bound by a spell, <a name="citation39e"></a><a href="#footnote39e">{39e}</a><br />so
the treasure-hall could be touched by none<br />of human kind, -- save
that Heaven&rsquo;s King,<br />God himself, might give whom he would,<br />Helper
of Heroes, the hoard to open, --<br />even such a man as seemed to him
meet.</p>
<div class="GutenbergBlankLines2"><br /><br /></div>
<p>XL</p>
<p>A PERILOUS path, it proved, he <a name="citation40a"></a><a href="#footnote40a">{40a}</a>
trod<br />who heinously hid, that hall within,<br />wealth under wall!
Its watcher had killed<br />one of a few, <a name="citation40b"></a><a href="#footnote40b">{40b}</a>
and the feud was avenged<br />in woful fashion. Wondrous seems it,<br />what
manner a man of might and valor<br />oft ends his life, when the earl
no longer<br />in mead-hall may live with loving friends.<br />So Beowulf,
when that barrow&rsquo;s warden<br />he sought, and the struggle; himself
knew not<br />in what wise he should wend from the world at last.<br />For
<a name="citation40c"></a><a href="#footnote40c">{40c}</a> princes potent,
who placed the gold,<br />with a curse to doomsday covered it deep,<br />so
that marked with sin the man should be,<br />hedged with horrors, in
hell-bonds fast,<br />racked with plagues, who should rob their hoard.<br />Yet
no greed for gold, but the grace of heaven,<br />ever the king had kept
in view. <a name="citation40d"></a><a href="#footnote40d">{40d}</a><br />Wiglaf
spake, the son of Weohstan: --<br />&ldquo;At the mandate of one, oft
warriors many<br />sorrow must suffer; and so must we.<br />The people&rsquo;s-shepherd
showed not aught<br />of care for our counsel, king beloved!<br />That
guardian of gold he should grapple not, urged we,<br />but let him lie
where he long had been<br />in his earth-hall waiting the end of the
world,<br />the hest of heaven. -- This hoard is ours<br />but grievously
gotten; too grim the fate<br />which thither carried our king and lord.<br />I
was within there, and all I viewed,<br />the chambered treasure, when
chance allowed me<br />(and my path was made in no pleasant wise)<br />under
the earth-wall. Eager, I seized<br />such heap from the hoard as hands
could bear<br />and hurriedly carried it hither back<br />to my liege
and lord. Alive was he still,<br />still wielding his wits. The wise
old man<br />spake much in his sorrow, and sent you greetings<br />and
bade that ye build, when he breathed no more,<br />on the place of his
balefire a barrow high,<br />memorial mighty. Of men was he<br />worthiest
warrior wide earth o&rsquo;er<br />the while he had joy of his jewels
and burg.<br />Let us set out in haste now, the second time<br />to
see and search this store of treasure,<br />these wall-hid wonders,
-- the way I show you, --<br />where, gathered near, ye may gaze your
fill<br />at broad-gold and rings. Let the bier, soon made,<br />be
all in order when out we come,<br />our king and captain to carry thither<br />--
man beloved -- where long he shall bide<br />safe in the shelter of
sovran God.&rdquo;<br />Then the bairn of Weohstan bade command,<br />hardy
chief, to heroes many<br />that owned their homesteads, hither to bring<br />firewood
from far -- o&rsquo;er the folk they ruled --<br />for the famed-one&rsquo;s
funeral. &ldquo; Fire shall devour<br />and wan flames feed on the fearless
warrior<br />who oft stood stout in the iron-shower,<br />when, sped
from the string, a storm of arrows<br />shot o&rsquo;er the shield-wall:
the shaft held firm,<br />featly feathered, followed the barb.&rdquo;<br />And
now the sage young son of Weohstan<br />seven chose of the chieftain&rsquo;s
thanes,<br />the best he found that band within,<br />and went with
these warriors, one of eight,<br />under hostile roof. In hand one bore<br />a
lighted torch and led the way.<br />No lots they cast for keeping the
hoard<br />when once the warriors saw it in hall,<br />altogether without
a guardian,<br />lying there lost. And little they mourned<br />when
they had hastily haled it out,<br />dear-bought treasure! The dragon
they cast,<br />the worm, o&rsquo;er the wall for the wave to take,<br />and
surges swallowed that shepherd of gems.<br />Then the woven gold on
a wain was laden --<br />countless quite! -- and the king was borne,<br />hoary
hero, to Hrones-Ness.</p>

<p>THEN fashioned for him the folk of Geats<br />firm on the earth a
funeral-pile,<br />and hung it with helmets and harness of war<br />and
breastplates bright, as the boon he asked;<br />and they laid amid it
the mighty chieftain,<br />heroes mourning their master dear.<br />Then
on the hill that hugest of balefires<br />the warriors wakened. Wood-smoke
rose<br />black over blaze, and blent was the roar<br />of flame with
weeping (the wind was still),<br />till the fire had broken the frame
of bones,<br />hot at the heart. In heavy mood<br />their misery moaned
they, their master&rsquo;s death.<br />Wailing her woe, the widow <a name="citation41a"></a><a href="#footnote41a">{41a}</a>
old,<br />her hair upbound, for Beowulf&rsquo;s death<br />sung in her
sorrow, and said full oft<br />she dreaded the doleful days to come,<br />deaths
enow, and doom of battle,<br />and shame. -- The smoke by the sky was
devoured.<br />The folk of the Weders fashioned there<br />on the headland
a barrow broad and high,<br />by ocean-farers far descried:<br />in
ten days&rsquo; time their toil had raised it,<br />the battle-brave&rsquo;s
beacon. Round brands of the pyre<br />a wall they built, the worthiest
ever<br />that wit could prompt in their wisest men.<br />They placed
in the barrow that precious booty,<br />the rounds and the rings they
had reft erewhile,<br />hardy heroes, from hoard in cave, --<br />trusting
the ground with treasure of earls,<br />gold in the earth, where ever
it lies<br />useless to men as of yore it was.<br />Then about that
barrow the battle-keen rode,<br />atheling-born, a band of twelve,<br />lament
to make, to mourn their king,<br />chant their dirge, and their chieftain
honor.<br />They praised his earlship, his acts of prowess<br />worthily
witnessed: and well it is<br />that men their master-friend mightily
laud,<br />heartily love, when hence he goes<br />from life in the body
forlorn away.</p>
<p>Thus made their mourning the men of Geatland,<br />for their hero&rsquo;s
passing his hearth-companions:<br />quoth that of all the kings of earth,<br />of
men he was mildest and most beloved,<br />to his kin the kindest, keenest
for praise.</p>

&ldquo;The Hart,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Stag,&rdquo; so called from decorations
in the gables that resembled the antlers of a deer. This hall has been
carefully described in a pamphlet by Heyne. The building was rectangular,
with opposite doors -- mainly west and east -- and a hearth in the middle
of th single room. A row of pillars down each side, at some distance
from the walls, made a space which was raised a little above the main
floor, and was furnished with two rows of seats. On one side, usually
south, was the high-seat midway between the doors. Opposite this, on
the other raised space, was another seat of honor. At the banquet soon
to be described, Hrothgar sat in the south or chief high-seat, and Beowulf
opposite to him. The scene for a flying (see below, v.499) was thus
very effectively set. Planks on trestles -- the &ldquo;board&rdquo;
of later English literature -- formed the tables just in front of the
long rows of seats, and were taken away after banquets, when the retainers
were ready to stretch themselves out for sleep on the benches.</p>

<p><a name="footnote16d"></a><a href="#citation16d">{16d}</a> There
is no need to assume a gap in the Ms. As before about Sigemund and Heremod,
so now, though at greater length, about Finn and his feud, a lay is
chanted or recited; and the epic poet, counting on his readers&rsquo;
familiarity with the story, -- a fragment of it still exists, -- simply
gives the headings.</p>
<p><a name="footnote16e"></a><a href="#citation16e">{16e}</a> The exact
story to which this episode refers in summary is not to be determined,
but the following account of it is reasonable and has good support among
scholars. Finn, a Frisian chieftain, who nevertheless has a &ldquo;castle&rdquo;
outside the Frisian border, marries Hildeburh, a Danish princess; and
her brother, Hnaef, with many other Danes, pays Finn a visit. Relations
between the two peoples have been strained before. Something starts
the old feud anew; and the visitors are attacked in their quarters.
Hnaef is killed; so is a son of Hildeburh. Many fall on both sides.
Peace is patched up; a stately funeral is held; and the surviving visitors
become in a way vassals or liegemen of Finn, going back with him to
Frisia. So matters rest a while. Hengest is now leader of the Danes;
but he is set upon revenge for his former lord, Hnaef. Probably he is
killed in feud; but his clansmen, Guthlaf and Oslaf, gather at their
home a force of sturdy Danes, come back to Frisia, storm Finn&rsquo;s
stronghold, kill him, and carry back their kinswoman Hildeburh.</p>
<p><a name="footnote16f"></a><a href="#citation16f">{16f}</a> The &ldquo;enemies&rdquo;
must be the Frisians.</p>
<p><a name="footnote16g"></a><a href="#citation16g">{16g}</a> Battlefield.
-- Hengest is the &ldquo;prince&rsquo;s thane,&rdquo; companion of Hnaef.
&ldquo;Folcwald&rsquo;s son&rdquo; is Finn.</p>
<p><a name="footnote16h"></a><a href="#citation16h">{16h}</a> That is,
Finn would govern in all honor the few Danish warriors who were left,
provided, of course, that none of them tried to renew the quarrel or
avenge Hnaef their fallen lord. If, again, one of Finn&rsquo;s Frisians
began a quarrel, he should die by the sword.</p>

<p><a name="footnote17a"></a><a href="#citation17a">{17a}</a> That is,
these two Danes, escaping home, had told the story of the attack on
Hnaef, the slaying of Hengest, and all the Danish woes. Collecting a
force, they return to Frisia and kill Finn in his home.</p>
<p><a name="footnote17b"></a><a href="#citation17b">{17b}</a> Nephew
to Hrothgar, with whom he subsequently quarrels, and elder cousin to
the two young sons of Hrothgar and Wealhtheow, -- their natural guardian
in the event of the king&rsquo;s death. There is something finely feminine
in this speech of Wealhtheow&rsquo;s, apart from its somewhat irregular
and irrelevant sequence of topics. Both she and her lord probably distrust
Hrothulf; but she bids the king to be of good cheer, and, turning to
the suspect, heaps affectionate assurances on his probity. &ldquo;My
own Hrothulf&rdquo; will surely not forget these favors and benefits
of the past, but will repay them to the orphaned boy.</p>

presently where she is.</p>
<p><a name="footnote20b"></a><a href="#citation20b">{20b}</a> The connection
is not difficult. The words of mourning, of acute grief, are said; and
according to Germanic sequence of thought, inexorable here, the next
and only topic is revenge. But is it possible? Hrothgar leads up to
his appeal and promise with a skillful and often effective description
of the horrors which surround the monster&rsquo;s home and await the
attempt of an avenging foe.</p>

he might or might not see Beowulf again. Old as he was, the latter chance
was likely; but he clung to the former, hoping to see his young friend

<p><a name="footnote28a"></a><a href="#citation28a">{28a}</a> Beowulf
gives his uncle the king not mere gossip of his journey, but a statesmanlike
forecast of the outcome of certain policies at the Danish court. Talk
of interpolation here is absurd. As both Beowulf and Hygelac know, --
and the folk for whom the Beowulf was put together also knew, -- Froda
was king of the Heathobards (probably the Langobards, once near neighbors
of Angle and Saxon tribes on the continent), and had fallen in fight
with the Danes. Hrothgar will set aside this feud by giving his daughter
as &ldquo;peace-weaver&rdquo; and wife to the young king Ingeld, son
of the slain Froda. But Beowulf, on general principles and from his
observation of the particular case, foretells trouble. Note:</p>
<p><a name="footnote28b"></a><a href="#citation28b">{28b}</a> Play of
shields, battle. A Danish warrior cuts down Froda in the fight, and
takes his sword and armor, leaving them to a son. This son is selected
to accompany his mistress, the young princess Freawaru, to her new home
when she is Ingeld&rsquo;s queen. Heedlessly he wears the sword of Froda
in hall. An old warrior points it out to Ingeld, and eggs him on to
vengeance. At his instigation the Dane is killed; but the murderer,
afraid of results, and knowing the land, escapes. So the old feud must
break out again.</p>

<p><a name="footnote28e"></a><a href="#citation28e">{28e}</a> Beowulf
returns to his forecast. Things might well go somewhat as follows, he
says; sketches a little tragic story; and with this prophecy by illustration
returns to the tale of his adventure.</p>

partly told in Scandinavian legend.</p>
<p><a name="footnote29d"></a><a href="#citation29d">{29d}</a> The chronology
of this epic, as scholars have worked it out, would make Beowulf well
over ninety years of age when he fights the dragon. But the fifty years
of his reign need not be taken as historical fact.</p>
<p><a name="footnote29e"></a><a href="#citation29e">{29e}</a> The text
is here hopelessly illegible, and only the general drift of the meaning
can be rescued. For one thing, we have the old myth of a dragon who
guards hidden treasure. But with this runs the story of some noble,
last of his race, who hides all his wealth within this barrow and there
chants his farewell to life&rsquo;s glories. After his death the dragon
takes possession of the hoard and watches over it. A condemned or banished
man, desperate, hides in the barrow, discovers the treasure, and while
the dragon sleeps, makes off with a golden beaker or the like, and carries
it for propitiation to his master. The dragon discovers the loss and
exacts fearful penalty from the people round about.</p>

former by Weohstan is not felt as cause of feud, and is rewarded by
gift of the slain man&rsquo;s weapons.</p>
<p><a name="footnote34b"></a><a href="#citation34b">{34b}</a> Both Wiglaf
and the sword did their duty. -- The following is one of the classic
passages for illustrating the comitatus as the most conspicuous Germanic
institution, and its underlying sense of duty, based partly on the idea
of loyalty and partly on the practical basis of benefits received and
repaid.</p>

the fugitive is meant who discovered the hoard. Ten Brink and Gering

<p><a name="footnote40c"></a><a href="#citation40c">{40c}</a> Ten Brink
points out the strongly heathen character of this part of the epic.
Beowulf&rsquo;s end came, so the old tradition ran, from his unwitting
interference with spell-bound treasure.</p>
<p><a name="footnote40d"></a><a href="#citation40d">{40d}</a> A hard
saying, variously interpreted. In any case, it is the somewhat clumsy
effort of the Christian poet to tone down the heathenism of his material
by an edifying observation.</p>
<p><a name="footnote41a"></a><a href="#citation41a">{41a}</a> Nothing
is said of Beowulf&rsquo;s wife in the poem, but Bugge surmises that
Beowulf finally accepted Hygd&rsquo;s offer of kingdom and hoard, and,
as was usual, took her into the bargain.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

ways.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the

or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by

          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
