<br>
<p><br>
To uphold the "right of private judgment," and our "Christian liberty<br>
wherewith Christ hath made us free;" to add fuel to the fire of<br>
investigation, and in  the crucible of deep inquiry, melt from the gold<br>
of pure religion, the dross of  man's invention; to appeal from the<br>
erring tribunals of a fallible Priesthood, and restore to its original<br>
state the mutilated Testament of the Saviour; also to induce all earnest<br>
thinkers to search not a part, but the whole of the Scriptures, if<br>
therein they think they will find eternal life; I, as an advocate of<br>
free thought and untrammelled opinion, dispute the authority of those<br>
uncharitable, bickering, and ignorant Ecclesiastics who first suppressed<br>
these gospels and epistles; and I join issue with their Catholic and<br>
Protestant successors who have since excluded  them from the New<br>
Testament, of which they formed a part; and were venerated  by the<br>
Primitive Churches, during the first four hundred years of the Christian<br>
Era.</p>
<p>My opposition is based on two grounds; first, the right of every rational<br>
being to become a "Priest unto himself," and by the test of enlightened<br>
reason, to form his own unbiassed judgment of all things natural and<br>
spiritual: second,  that the reputation of the Bishops who extracted<br>
these books from the original New Testament, under the pretence of being<br>
Apocryphal, and forbade them to be read by the people, is proved by<br>
authentic impartial history too odious to entitle them to any deference.<br>
Since the Nicene Council, by a pious fraud, which I shall further allude<br>
to, suppressed these books, several of them have been reissued from time<br>
to time by various translators, who differed considerably in their<br>
versions, as the historical references attached to them in the following<br>
pages will demonstrate. But to the late Mr. William Hone we are indebted<br>
for their complete publication for the first time in one volume, about<br>
the year 1820; which  edition, diligently revised, and purified of many<br>
errors both in the text and the notes attached thereto, I have<br>
re-published in numbers to enable all classes of the nation to purchase<br>
and peruse them. As, however, instead of being called by their own<br>
designation "Apocryphal," (which yet remains to be proved), they  were<br>
re-entitled THE FORBIDDEN BOOKS, and, from communications received,<br>
appear to have agitated a portion of the great mass of ignorant bigotry<br>
which mars the fair form of Religion in these sect-ridden dominions, I<br>
have  modified the title to its present shape with the hope that in spite<br>
of illiberal clerical influence, my fellow Christians will read and<br>
inwardly digest the sublime precepts they inculcate;--as pure, as holy,<br>
and as charitable as those principles of Christianity taught in the<br>
Scriptures they; now read by permission; although their minds may, after<br>
mature reflection, doubt the truth of the miraculous records therein<br>
given.</p>

<p>To ensure these Gospels and Epistles an unprejudiced and serious<br>
attention, which they are entitled to, equally with those now patronised<br>
by Church authority, I will briefly refer to that disgraceful epoch in<br>
Roman Ecclesiastical Annals, when the New Testament was mutilated, and<br>
priestly craft was employed for excluding these books from its pages.<br>
HONE, in the preface to his first edition of the Apocryphal New<br>
Testament, so called, without satisfactory grounds, by the  Council of<br>
Nice, in the reign of the Emperor Constantine, thus opens the  subject:--</p>

<p>"After the writings contained in the New Testament were selected from the<br>
numerous Gospels and Epistles then in existence, what became of the Books<br>
that were rejected by the compilers?"</p>

<p>This question naturally occurs on every investigation as to the period<br>
when and the  persons by whom the New Testament was formed. It has been<br>
supposed by many that the volume was compiled by the first Council of<br>
Nice, which, according to Jortin (Rem. on Eccl. vol. ii. p. 177),<br>
originated thus: Alexander, Bishop of Alexandria, and Arius, who was a<br>
presbyter in his diocese, disputed together about the nature of Christ;<br>
and the bishop being displeased at the notions of Arius, and finding<br>
that they were adopted by other persons, "was very angry." He commanded<br>
Arius to come over to his sentiments, and to quit his own; as if a man<br>
could change his opinions as easily as he can change his coat! He then<br>
called a Council of War, consisting of nearly, a hundred bishops, and<br>
deposed, excommunicated, and anathematized Arius, and with him several<br>
ecclesiastics, two of whom were bishops. Constantine sent a letter, in<br>
which he reprimanded the bishops for disturbing the church with their<br>
insignificant disputes. But the affair was gone too far to be thus<br>
composed. To settle this and other points, the Nicene Council was<br>
summoned, consisting of about 318 bishops. The first thing they did was<br>
to quarrel, and to express their resentments, and to present accusations<br>
to the Emperor against one another. "The Emperor burnt all their libels,<br>
and exhorted them to peace and unity." (See Mosheim's Eccle. Hist.) These<br>
were the  kind of spiritual shepherds of whom Sabinus, the Bishop<br>
Heraclea affirms, that excepting Constantine himself, and Eusebius<br>
Pamphilus, they "were a set of illiterate creatures, that understood<br>
nothing." And now intelligent Catholics, especially Protestants who are<br>
content to read only the books of the Testament authorized by the Council<br>
of Nice, and agreed to ever since by your own bishops, although they and<br>
you profess to dissent from the Papacy, hear what Pappus in his Synodican<br>
to that Council says of their crafty contrivance when they separated the<br>
books of the original New Testament:--He tells us, that having<br>
"promiscuously put all the books that were referred to the Council for<br>
deliberation under the  communion-table in a church, they besought the<br>
Lord that the inspired writings might get on the table, while the<br>
spurious ones remained underneath; and that it happened accordingly!"<br>
(See Com. Mace's N. T. p. 875.) Therefore, good reader, every  Christian<br>
sect from the fourth century to the present period, have been blessed<br>
with the books that climbed upon the communion-table, and in consequence<br>
were  deemed inspired and canonical; at the same time have been forbidden<br>
to read the  Gospels and Epistles herein published, because they could<br>
not perform the same feat, but remained under the table, and were<br>
condemned accordingly, as uninspired and apocryphal writings. If you<br>
believe this popish legend, you will not read the good books I lay before<br>
you, but still continue to possess only HALF THE TESTAMENT, instead of<br>
the PERFECT ONE, which will enable you to burst the trammels of<br>
priestcraft, and by the light of God's whole truth become free. In<br>
conclusion, I implore you to examine for yourselves, and observe the<br>
testimony of Archbishop Wake and other learned divines and historians<br>
appended  thereto; and subscribe myself,</p>
<br>

<h2>THE GOSPEL OF THE BIRTH OF MARY.</h2>
</center>
<br><br>


<p>
CHAPTER I.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 The Parentage of Mary.<br>
     7 Joachim her father, and Anna her mother,<br>
     go to Jerusalem to the feast of the dedication.<br>
     9 Issachar, the high priest, reproaches Joachim<br>
     for being childless.</p>
<br>
<p>THE blessed and ever glorious<br>
Virgin Mary, sprung from<br>
the royal race and family of David,<br>
was born in the city of Nazareth,<br>
and educated at Jerusalem, in the<br>
temple of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Her father's name was Joachim,<br>
and her mother's Anna.<br>
The family of her father was of<br>
Galilee and the city of Nazareth.<br>
The family of her mother was of<br>
Bethlehem.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Their lives were plain and<br>
right in the sight of the Lord,<br>
pious and faultless before men;<br>
for they divided all their substance<br>
into three parts;</p>
<br>
<p>4  One of which they devoted to<br>
the temple and officers of the<br>
temple; another they distributed<br>
among strangers, and persons in<br>
poor circumstances; and the third<br>
they reserved for themselves and<br>
the uses of their own family.</p>
<br>
<p>5  In this manner they lived for<br>
about twenty years chastely, in the<br>
favour of God, and the esteem of<br>
men, without any children.</p>
<br>
<p>6  But they vowed, if God should<br>
favour them with any issue, they<br>
would devote it to the service of<br>
the Lord; on which account they<br>
went at every feast in the year to<br>
the temple of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And it came to pass, that<br>
when the feast of the dedication<br>
drew near, Joachim, with some<br>
others of his tribe, went up to<br>
Jerusalem, and at that time,<br>
Isachar was high-priest;</p>
<br>
<p>8  Who, when he saw Joachim<br>
along with the rest of his<br>
neighbours, bringing his offerings,<br>
despised both him and his offerings,<br>
and asked him,</p>
<br>
<p>9  Why he, who had no children,<br>
would presume to appear among<br>
those who had? Adding, that his<br>
offerings could never be acceptable<br>
to God, who was judged by him<br>
unworthy to have children; the<br>
Scripture having said, Cursed is<br>
every one who shall not beget a<br>
male in Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>10  He further said, that he ought<br>
first to be free from that curse by<br>
begetting some issue, and then<br>
come with his offerings into the<br>
presence of God.</p>
<br>
<p>11  But Joachim being much<br>
confounded with the shame of such<br>
reproach, retired to the shepherds<br>
who were with the cattle in their<br>
pastures;</p>
<br>
<p>12  For he was not inclined to<br>
return home, lest his neighbours,<br>
who were present and heard all<br>
this from the high-priest, should<br>
publicly reproach him in the same<br>
manner.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 An angel appears to Joachim,<br>
     9 and informs him that Anna shall conceive and<br>
     bring forth a daughter, who shall be called Mary,<br>
     11 be brought up in the temple,<br>
     12 and while yet a virgin, in a way unparalleled,<br>
     bring forth the Son of God:<br>
     13 Gives him a sign,<br>
     14 and departs.</p>
<br>
<p>BUT when he had been there for<br>
some time, on a certain day<br>
when he was alone, the angel<br>
of the Lord stood by him with<br>
a prodigious light.</p>
<br>
<p>2  To whom, being troubled at<br>
the appearance, the angel who had<br>
appeared to him, endeavouring to<br>
compose him, said:</p>
<br>
<p>3  Be not afraid, Joachim, nor<br>
troubled at the sight of me, for<br>
I am an angel of the Lord sent by<br>
him to you, that I might inform<br>
you that your prayers are heard,<br>
and your alms ascended in the<br>
sight of God.</p>
<br>
<p>4  For he hath surely seen your<br>
shame, and heard you unjustly<br>
reproached for not having children:<br>
for God is the avenger of sin,<br>
and not of nature;</p>
<br>
<p>5  And so when he shuts the<br>
womb of any person, he does it for<br>
this reason, that he may in a more<br>
wonderful manner again open it,<br>
and that which is born appear to<br>
be not the product of lust, but the<br>
gift of God.</p>
<br>
<p>6  For the first mother of your<br>
nation, Sarah, was she not barren<br>
even till her eightieth year: and<br>
yet even in the end of her old age<br>
brought forth Isaac, in whom the<br>
promise was made of a blessing to<br>
all nations.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Rachel, also, so much in<br>
favour with God, and beloved so<br>
much by holy Jacob, continued<br>
barren for a long time, yet<br>
afterwards was the mother of Joseph,<br>
who was not only governor of<br>
Egypt, but delivered many nations<br>
from perishing with hunger.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Who among the judges was<br>
more valiant than Sampson, or more<br>
holy than Samuel? And yet both<br>
their mothers were barren.</p>
<br>
<p>9  But if reason will not convince<br>
you of the truth of my words, that<br>
there are frequent conceptions in<br>
advanced years, and that those<br>
who were barren have brought forth<br>
to their great surprise; therefore<br>
Anna your wife shall bring you a<br>
daughter, and you shall call her<br>
name Mary;</p>
<br>
<p>10  She shall, according to your<br>
vow, be devoted to the Lord from<br>
her infancy, and be filled with the<br>
Holy Ghost from her mother's<br>
womb;</p>
<br>
<p>11  She shall neither eat nor<br>
drink any thing which is unclean,<br>
nor shall her conversation be<br>
without among the common people,<br>
but in the temple of the Lord;<br>
that so she may not fall under any<br>
slander or suspicion of what is bad.</p>
<br>
<p>12  So in the process of her<br>
years, as she shall be in a<br>
miraculous manner born of one that<br>
was barren, so she shall, while yet<br>
a virgin, in a way unparalleled,<br>
bring forth the Son of the most<br>
High God, who shall, be called<br>
Jesus, and, according to the<br>
signification of his name, be the<br>
Saviour of all nations.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And this shall be a sign to<br>
you of the things which I declare,<br>
namely, when you come to the<br>
golden gate of Jerusalem, you<br>
shall there meet your wife Anna,<br>
who being very much troubled<br>
that you returned no sooner, shall<br>
then rejoice to see you.</p>
<br>
<p>14  When the angel had said this,<br>
he departed from him.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 The angel appears to Anna;<br>
     2 tells her a daughter shall be born unto her,<br>
     3 devoted to the service of the Lord in the temple,<br>
     5, who, being a virgin, and not knowing man,<br>
     shall bring forth the Lord,<br>
     6 and gives her a sign therefore.<br>
     8 Joachim and Anna meet, and rejoice,<br>
     10 and praise the Lord.<br>
     11 Anna conceives, and brings forth a daughter called Mary.</p>
<br>
<p>AFTERWARDS the angel appeared<br>
to Anna his wife, saying;<br>
Fear not, neither think that<br>
which you see is a spirit;</p>
<br>
<p>2  For I am that angel who hath<br>
offered up your prayers and alms<br>
before God, and am now sent to<br>
you, that I may inform you, that<br>
a daughter will be born unto you,<br>
who shall be called Mary, and<br>
shall be blessed above all women.</p>
<br>
<p>3  She shall be, immediately<br>
upon her birth, full of the grace of<br>
the Lord, and shall continue during<br>
the three years of her weaning<br>
in her father's house, and afterwards,<br>
being devoted to the service of the Lord,<br>
shall not depart from the temple,<br>
till she arrive to years of discretion.</p>
<br>
<p>4  In a word, she shall there<br>
serve the Lord night and day in<br>
fasting and prayer, shall abstain<br>
from every unclean thing, and<br>
never know any man;</p>
<br>
<p>5  But, being an unparalleled instance<br>
without any pollution or defilement,<br>
and a virgin not knowing any man,<br>
shall ring forth a son, and a maid<br>
shall bring forth the Lord, who<br>
both by his grace and name and works,<br>
shall be the Saviour of the world.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Arise therefore, and go up to<br>
Jerusalem, and when you shall<br>
come to that which is called the<br>
golden gate (because it is gilt with<br>
gold), as a sign of what I have told<br>
you, you shall meet your husband,<br>
for whose safety you have been so<br>
much concerned.</p>
<br>
<p>7  When therefore you find these<br>
things thus accomplished, believe<br>
that all the rest which I have told<br>
you, shall also undoubtedly be<br>
accomplished.</p>
<br>
<p>8  According therefore to the<br>
command of the angel, both of<br>
them left the places where they<br>
were, and when they came to the<br>
place specified in the angels<br>
prediction, they met each other.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Then, rejoicing at each other's<br>
vision, and being fully satisfied in<br>
the promise of a child, they gave<br>
due thanks to the Lord, who exalts<br>
the humble.</p>
<br>
<p>10  After having praised the<br>
Lord, they returned home, and<br>
lived in a cheerful and assured<br>
expectation of the promise of God.</p>
<br>
<p>11  So Anna conceived, and<br>
brought forth a daughter, and,<br>
according to the angel's command,<br>
the parents did call her name Mary.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Mary brought to the temple at three years old.<br>
     6 Ascends the stairs of the temple by miracle.<br>
     8 Her parents sacrifice and return home.</p>
<br>
<p>AND when three years were<br>
expired, and the time of her<br>
weaning complete, they brought<br>
the Virgin to the temple of the<br>
Lord with offerings.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And there were about the<br>
temple, according to the fifteen<br>
Psalms of degrees, fifteen stairs<br>
to ascend.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For the temple being built in<br>
a mountain, the altar of burnt-<br>
offering, which was without, could<br>
not be come near but by stairs;</p>
<br>
<p>4  The parents of the blessed<br>
Virgin and infant Mary put her<br>
upon one of these stairs;</p>
<br>
<p>5  But while they were putting<br>
off their clothes, in which they had<br>
travelled, and according to custom<br>
putting on some that were more<br>
neat and clean,</p>
<br>
<p>6  In the mean time the Virgin<br>
of the Lord in such a manner went<br>
up all the stairs one after another,<br>
without the help of any to lead her<br>
or lift her, that any one would have<br>
judged from hence, that she was of<br>
perfect age.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Thus the Lord did, in the<br>
infancy of his Virgin, work this<br>
extraordinary work, and evidence by<br>
this miracle how great she was like<br>
to be hereafter.</p>
<br>
<p>8  But the parents having offered<br>
up their sacrifice, according to the<br>
custom of the law, and perfected<br>
their vow, left the Virgin with<br>
other virgins in the apartments of<br>
the temple, who were to be brought<br>
up there, and they returned home.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER V.</p>
<br>
<p>     2 Mary ministered unto by angels.<br>
     4 The high priest orders all virgins of fourteen<br>
     years old to quit the temple and endeavour to be married.<br>
     5 Mary refuses,<br>
     6 having vowed her virginity to the Lord.<br>
     7 The high-priest commands a meeting of the chief persons<br>
     of Jerusalem,<br>
     11 who seek the Lord for counsel in the matter.<br>
     13 A voice from the mercy-seat.<br>
     15 The high-priest obeys it by ordering all the unmarried<br>
     men of the house of David to bring their rods to the altar,<br>
     17 that his rod which should flower, and on which the<br>
     Spirit of God should sit, should betroth the Virgin.</p>
<br>
<p>BUT the Virgin of the Lord, as<br>
she advanced in years, increased<br>
also in perfections, and according<br>
to the saying of the Psalmist,<br>
her father and mother forsook her,<br>
but the Lord took care of her.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For she every day had the<br>
conversation of angels, and every<br>
day received visitors from God,<br>
which preserved her from all sorts<br>
of evil, and caused her to abound<br>
with all good things;</p>
<br>
<p>3  So that when at length she<br>
arrived to her fourteenth year, as<br>
the wicked could not lay any thing<br>
to her charge worthy of reproof,<br>
so all good persons, who were<br>
acquainted with her, admired her<br>
life and conversation.</p>
<br>
<p>4  At that time the high-priest<br>
made a public order, That all the<br>
virgins who had public settlements<br>
in the temple, and were come to<br>
this age, should return home, and,<br>
as they were now of a proper<br>
maturity, should, according to the<br>
custom of their country, endeavour<br>
to be married.</p>
<br>
<p>5  To which command, though<br>
all the other virgins readily yielded<br>
obedience, Mary the Virgin of the<br>
Lord alone answered, that she<br>
could not comply with it,</p>
<br>
<p>6  Assigning these reasons, that<br>
both she and her parents had<br>
devoted her to the service of the<br>
Lord; and besides, that she had<br>
vowed virginity to the Lord,<br>
which vow she was resolved never<br>
to break through by lying with a<br>
man.</p>
<br>
<p>7  The high-priest being hereby<br>
brought into a difficulty,</p>
<br>
<p>8  Seeing he durst neither on the<br>
one hand dissolve the vow, and<br>
disobey the Scripture, which says,<br>
Vow and pay,</p>
<br>
<p>9  Nor on the other hand<br>
introduce a custom, to which<br>
the people were strangers, commanded,</p>
<br>
<p>10  That at the approaching feast<br>
all the principal persons both of<br>
Jerusalem and the neighbouring<br>
places should meet together, that<br>
he might have their advice, how<br>
he had best proceed in so difficult<br>
a case.</p>
<br>
<p>11  When they were accordingly<br>
met, they unanimously agreed to<br>
seek the Lord, and ask counsel<br>
from him on this matter.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And when they were all<br>
engaged in prayer, the high-priest<br>
according to the usual way, went<br>
to consult God.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And immediately there was<br>
a voice from the ark, and the mercy<br>
seat, which all present heard, that<br>
it must be enquired or sought out<br>
by a prophecy of Isaiah, to whom<br>
the Virgin should be given and be<br>
betrothed;</p>
<br>
<p>14  For Isaiah saith, there shall<br>
come forth a rod out of the stem of<br>
Jesse, and a flower shall spring<br>
out of its root,</p>
<br>
<p>15  And the Spirit of the Lord<br>
shall rest upon him, the Spirit of<br>
Wisdom and Understanding, the<br>
Spirit of Counsel and Might, the<br>
Spirit of Knowledge and Piety,<br>
and the Spirit of the fear of the<br>
Lord shall fill him.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Then, according to this<br>
prophecy, he appointed, that all<br>
the men of the house and family<br>
of David, who were marriageable,<br>
and not married, should bring their<br>
several rods to the altar,</p>
<br>
<p>17  And out of whatsoever<br>
person's rod after it was brought,<br>
a flower should bud forth, and on<br>
the top of it the Spirit of the Lord<br>
should sit in the appearance of a<br>
dove, he should be the man to<br>
whom the Virgin should be given<br>
and be betrothed.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Joseph draws back his rod.<br>
     5 The dove pitches on it. He betroths Mary and<br>
     returns to Bethlehem.<br>
     7 Mary returns to her parents' house at Galilee.</p>
<br>
<p>AMONG the rest there was a<br>
man named Joseph of the<br>
house and family of David, and a<br>
person very far advanced in years,<br>
who kept back his rod, when every<br>
one besides presented his.</p>
<br>
<p>2  So that when nothing appeared<br>
agreeable to the heavenly voice,<br>
the high-priest judged it proper to<br>
consult God again.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Who answered that he to<br>
whom the Virgin was to be<br>
betrothed was the only person of<br>
those who were brought together,<br>
who had not brought his rod.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Joseph therefore was betrayed.</p>
<br>
<p>5  For, when he did bring his<br>
rod, and a dove coming from<br>
Heaven pitched upon the top of<br>
it, every one plainly saw, that the<br>
Virgin was to be betrothed to him.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Accordingly, the usual<br>
ceremonies of betrothing being over,<br>
he returned to his own city of<br>
Bethlehem, to set his house in<br>
order, and make the needful<br>
provisions for the marriage.</p>
<br>
<p>7  But the Virgin of the Lord,<br>
Mary, with seven other virgins of<br>
the same age, who had been weaned<br>
at the same time, and who had<br>
been appointed to attend her by<br>
the priest, returned to her parents'<br>
house in Galilee.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>
CHAPTER VII.</p>
<br>
<p>     7 The salutation of the Virgin by Gabriel, who explains to her<br>
     that she shall conceive, without lying with a man, while a Virgin,<br>
     19 by the Holy Ghost coming upon her without the heats of lust.<br>
     21 She submits.</p>
<br>
<p>NOW at this time of her first<br>
coming into Galilee, the<br>
angel Gabriel was sent to her<br>
from God, to declare to her the<br>
conception of our Saviour, and<br>
the manner and way of her<br>
conceiving him.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Accordingly going into her,<br>
he filled the chamber where she<br>
was with a prodigious light, and<br>
in a most courteous manner saluting<br>
her, he said,</p>
<br>
<p>3  Hail, Mary! Virgin of the<br>
Lord most acceptable!    O Virgin<br>
full of grace! The Lord is with<br>
you. You are blessed above all<br>
women, and you are blessed above<br>
all men, that have been hitherto<br>
born.</p>
<br>
<p>4  But the Virgin, who had<br>
before been well acquainted with<br>
the countenances of angels, and<br>
to whom such light from heaven<br>
was no uncommon thing,</p>
<br>
<p>5  Was neither terrified with the<br>
vision of the angel, nor astonished<br>
at the greatness of the light, but<br>
only troubled about the angel's<br>
words,</p>
<br>
<p>6  And began to consider what<br>
so extraordinary a salutation should<br>
mean, what it did portend, or what<br>
sort of end it would have.</p>
<br>
<p>7  To this thought the angel,<br>
divinely inspired, replies;</p>
<br>
<p>8  Fear not, Mary, as though<br>
I intended anything inconsistent<br>
with your chastity in this salutation:</p>
<br>
<p>9  For you have found favour<br>
with the Lord, because you made<br>
virginity your choice.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Therefore while you are a<br>
Virgin, you shall conceive without<br>
sin, and bring forth a son.</p>
<br>
<p>11  He shall be great, because<br>
he shall reign from sea to sea, and<br>
from the rivers even to the ends of<br>
the earth?</p>
<br>
<p>12  And he shall be called the<br>
Son of the Highest; for he who is<br>
born in a mean state on earth,<br>
reigns in an exalted one in heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And the Lord shall give him<br>
the throne of his father David, and<br>
he shall reign over the house of<br>
Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom<br>
there shall be no end.</p>
<br>
<p>14  For he is the King of Kings,<br>
and Lord of Lords, and his throne<br>
is forever and ever.</p>
<br>
<p>15  To this discourse of the<br>
angel the Virgin replied, not, as<br>
though she were unbelieving, but<br>
willing to know the manner of it.</p>
<br>
<p>16  She said, How can that be?<br>
For seeing, according to my vow,<br>
I have never known any man, how<br>
can I bear a child without the<br>
addition of a man's seed.</p>
<br>
<p>17  To this the angel replied<br>
and said, Think not, Mary, that<br>
you shall conceive in the ordinary<br>
way.</p>
<br>
<p>18  For, without lying with a<br>
man, while a Virgin, you shall<br>
conceive; while a Virgin, you<br>
shall bring forth; and while a<br>
Virgin shall give suck.</p>
<br>
<p>19  For the Holy Ghost shall<br>
come upon you, and the power of<br>
the Most High shall overshadow<br>
you, without any of the heats of<br>
lust.</p>
<br>
<p>20  So that which shall be born<br>
of you shall be only holy, because<br>
it only is conceived without sin,<br>
and being born, shall be called the<br>
Son of God.</p>
<br>
<p>21  Then Mary stretching forth<br>
her hands, and lifting her eyes to<br>
heaven, said, Behold the handmaid<br>
of the Lord! Let it be unto me<br>
according to thy word.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Joseph returns to Galilee, to marry the Virgin<br>
     he had betrothed;<br>
     4 perceives she is with child,<br>
     5 is uneasy,<br>
     7 purposes to put her away privily,<br>
     8 is told by the angel of the Lord it is not the<br>
     work of man but the Holy Ghost;<br>
     12 Marries her, but keeps chaste,<br>
     13 removes with her to Bethlehem,<br>
     15 where she brings forth Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>JOSEPH therefore went from<br>
Judaea to Galilee, with intention<br>
to marry the Virgin who was<br>
betrothed to him:</p>
<br>
<p>2  For it was now near three<br>
months since she was betrothed<br>
to him.</p>
<br>
<p>3  At length it plainly appeared<br>
she was with child, and it could<br>
not be hid from Joseph:</p>
<br>
<p>4  For going to the Virgin in a<br>
free manner, as one espoused, and<br>
talking familiarly with her, he<br>
perceived her to be with child,</p>
<br>
<p>5  And thereupon began to be<br>
uneasy and doubtful, not knowing<br>
what course it would be best to take;</p>
<br>
<p>6  For being a just man, he was<br>
not willing to expose her, nor<br>
defame her by the suspicion of<br>
being a harlot, since he was a<br>
pious man:</p>
<br>
<p>7  He purposed therefore privately<br>
to put an end to their agreement,<br>
and as privately to send her away.</p>
<br>
<p>8  But while he was meditating<br>
these things, behold the angel of<br>
the Lord appeared to him in his<br>
sleep, and said, Joseph, son of<br>
David, fear not;</p>
<br>
<p>9  Be not willing to entertain<br>
any suspicion of the Virgin's<br>
being guilty of fornication, or to<br>
think any thing amiss of her,<br>
neither be afraid to take her to wife:</p>
<br>
<p>10  For that which is begotten<br>
in her and now distresses your<br>
mind, is not the work of man, but<br>
the Holy Ghost.</p>
<br>
<p>11  For she of all women is that<br>
only Virgin who shall bring forth<br>
the Son of God, and you shall call<br>
his name Jesus, that is, Saviour:<br>
for he will save his people from<br>
their sins.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Joseph thereupon, according<br>
to the command of the angel,<br>
married the Virgin, and did not<br>
know her, but kept her in chastity.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And now the ninth month<br>
from her conception drew near,<br>
when Joseph took his wife and<br>
what other things were necessary<br>
to Bethlehem, the city from whence<br>
he came.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And it came to pass, while<br>
they were there, the days were<br>
fulfilled for her bringing forth.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And she brought forth her<br>
first-born son, as the holy<br>
Evangelists have taught, even our<br>
Lord Jesus Christ, who with the<br>
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,<br>
lives and reigns to everlasting ages.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>                       REFERENCES TO MARY'S GOSPEL</p>
<br>
<p>[In the primitive ages there was a Gospel extant bearing this name,<br>
attributed to St. Matthew, and received as genuine and authentic by<br>
several of the ancient Christian sects. It is to be found in the works<br>
of Jerome, a Father of the Church, who flourished in the fourth century,<br>
from whence the present translation is made. His contemporaries,<br>
Epiphanius, Bishop of Salamis, and Austin also mention a gospel under<br>
this title. The ancient copies differed from Jerome's, for from one of<br>
them the learned Faustus, a native of Britain, who became Bishop of Riez,<br>
in Provence, endeavoured to prove that Christ was not the Son of God till<br>
after his baptism; and that he was not of the house of David and tribe of<br>
Judah, because, according to the Gospel he cited, the Virgin herself was<br>
not of this tribe, but of the tribe of Levi; her father being a priest of<br>
the name of Joachim. It was likewise  from this Gospel that the sect of<br>
the Collyridians established the worship and offering of manchet bread<br>
and cracknels, or fine wafers, as sacrificed to Mary, whom they imagined<br>
to have been born of a Virgin, as Christ is related in the Canonical<br>
Gospels to have been born of her.  Epiphanius likewise cites a passage<br>
concerning the death of Zacharias, which is not in Jerome's copy, viz.:<br>
"That it was the occasion of the death of Zacharias  in the temple, that<br>
when he had seen a vision, he, through surprise, was willing to disclose<br>
it, and his mouth was stopped.  That which he saw was at the time of his<br>
offering incense, and it was a man standing in the form of an ass.<br>
When he was gone out, and had a mind to speak thus to the people, Woe<br>
unto you, whom do you worship? he who had appeared to him in the temple<br>
took away the use of his speech. Afterwards when he recovered it, and was<br>
able to speak, he declared this to the Jews; and they slew him.  They add<br>
(viz. the Gnostics in this book), that on this very  account the<br>
high-priest was appointed by their lawgiver (by God to Moses)  to carry<br>
little bells, that whensoever he went into the temple to sacrifice  he,<br>
whom they worshipped, hearing the noise of the bells, might have time<br>
enough to hide himself, and not be caught in that ugly shape and figure."<br>
The principal part of this Gospel is contained in the Protevangelion of<br>
James  which follows next in order.]</p>

<p>Or, an Historical Account of the BIRTH of CHRIST, and the perpetual<br>
VIRGIN MARY, his Mother, by JAMES THE LESSER, Cousin and Brother<br>
of the Lord Jesus, chief Apostle and first Bishop of the Christians in<br>
Jerusalem.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER I.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Joachim, a rich man,<br>
     2 offers to the Lord,<br>
     3 is opposed by Reuben the high priest,<br>
     because he has not begotten issue in Israel,<br>
     6 retires into the wilderness and fasts<br>
     forty days and forty nights.</p>
<br>
<p>
IN the history of the twelve<br>
tribes of Israel we read there<br>
was a certain person called<br>
Joachim, who being very rich, made<br>
double offerings to the Lord God,<br>
having made this resolution:<br>
My substance shall be for the<br>
benefit of the whole people, that<br>
I may find mercy from the Lord<br>
God for the forgiveness of my sins.</p>
<br>
<p>2  But at a certain great feast<br>
of  the Lord, when the children of<br>
Israel offered their gifts, and<br>
Joachim also offered his, Reuben the<br>
high-priest opposed him, saying,<br>
it is not lawful for thee to offer<br>
thy gifts, seeing thou hast not<br>
begot any issue in Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>3  At this, Joachim being<br>
concerned very much, went away to<br>
consult the registries of the twelve<br>
tribes, to see whether he was the<br>
only person who had begot no<br>
issue.</p>
<br>
<p>4  But upon inquiry he found<br>
that all the righteous had raised<br>
up seed in Israel;</p>
<br>
<p>5  Then he called to mind the<br>
patriarch Abraham, How that God<br>
in the end of his life had given him<br>
his son Isaac; upon which he was<br>
exceedingly distressed, and would<br>
not be seen by his wife:</p>
<br>
<p>6  But retired into the wilderness,<br>
and fixed his tent there, and<br>
fasted forty days and forty nights,<br>
saying to himself,</p>
<br>
<p>7  I will not go down either to<br>
eat or drink, till the Lord my<br>
God shall look down upon me, but<br>
prayer shall be my meat and drink.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER. II.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Anna, the wife of Joachim mourns her barrennes,<br>
     6 is reproached with it by Judith her maid,<br>
     9 sits under a laurel tree and prays to the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>IN the mean time his wife Anna<br>
was distressed and perplexed<br>
on a double account, and said,<br>
I will mourn both for my widowhood<br>
and my barrenness.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Then drew near a great feast<br>
of the Lord, and Judith her maid,<br>
said, How long will you thus<br>
afflict your soul? The feast of<br>
the Lord is now come, when it is<br>
unlawful for any one to mourn.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Take therefore this hood<br>
which was given by one who<br>
makes such things, for it is not<br>
fit that I, who am a servant should<br>
wear it, but it well suits a person<br>
of your greater character.</p>
<br>
<p>4  But Anna replied, Depart<br>
from me, I am not used to such<br>
things; besides, the Lord hath<br>
greatly humbled me.</p>
<br>
<p>5  I fear some ill-designing person<br>
hath given thee this, and thou<br>
art come to reproach me with my sin.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Then Judith her maid answered,<br>
what evil shall I wish you,<br>
when you will not hearken to me?</p>
<br>
<p>7  I cannot wish you a greater<br>
curse than you are under, in that<br>
God hath shut up your womb, that<br>
you should not be a mother in<br>
Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>8  At this Anna was exceedingly<br>
troubled, and having on her wedding<br>
garment, went about three o'clock<br>
in the afternoon to walk in her<br>
garden.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And she saw a laurel-tree and<br>
sat under it, and prayed unto the<br>
Lord, saying,</p>
<br>
<p>10  O God of my fathers, bless<br>
me and regard my prayer, as thou<br>
didst bless the womb of Sarah;<br>
and gavest her a son Isaac.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Anna perceiving a sparrow's nest in the<br>
     laurels bemoans her barrenness.</p>
<br>
<p>AND as she was looking towards<br>
heaven she perceive a sparrow's<br>
nest in the laurel,</p>
<br>
<p>2  And mourning within herself,<br>
she said, Wo is me, who begat<br>
me? and what womb did bear<br>
me, that I should be thus<br>
accursed before the children of<br>
Israel, and that they should<br>
reproach and deride me in the<br>
temple of my God: Wo is me,<br>
to what can I be compared?</p>
<br>
<p>3  I am not comparable to the<br>
very beasts of the earth, for even<br>
the beasts of the earth are fruitful<br>
before thee, O Lord! Wo is me,<br>
to what can I be compared?</p>
<br>
<p>4  I am not compared to the<br>
brute animal, for even the brute<br>
animals are fruitful before thee,<br>
O Lord! Wo is me, to what am I<br>
comparable?</p>
<br>
<p>5  I cannot be comparable to<br>
these waters, for even the waters<br>
are fruitful before thee, O Lord!<br>
Wo is me, to what can I be compared?</p>
<br>
<p>6  I am not comparable to the<br>
waves of the sea; for these,<br>
whether they are calm, or in motion,<br>
with the fishes which are in them,<br>
praise thee, O Lord! Wo is me to<br>
what can I be compared?</p>
<br>
<p>7  I am not comparable to the<br>
very earth, for the earth produces<br>
its fruits, and praises thee, O Lord!</p>

     two angels appear on the same errand.<br>
     5 Joachim sacrifices.<br>
     8 Anna goes to meet him,<br>
     9 rejoicing that she shall conceive.</p>
<br>
<p>THEN an angel of the Lord<br>
stood by her and said, Anna,<br>
Anna, the Lord hath heard thy<br>
prayer; thou shalt conceive and<br>
bring forth, and thy progeny shall<br>
be spoken of in all the world.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And Anna answered, As the<br>
Lord my God liveth, whatever I<br>
bring forth, whether it be male or<br>
female, I will devote it to the Lord<br>
my God and it shall minister to<br>
him in holy things, during its<br>
whole life.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And behold there appeared<br>
two angels, saying unto her,<br>
Behold Joachim thy husband is<br>
coming with his shepherds.</p>
<br>
<p>
4  For an angel of the Lord<br>
hath also come down to him, and<br>
said, The Lord God hath heard<br>
thy prayer, make haste and go<br>
hence, for behold Anna thy wife<br>
shall conceive.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And Joachim went down and<br>
called his shepherds, saying, Bring<br>
me hither ten she-lambs without<br>
spot or blemish, and they shall<br>
be for the Lord my God.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And bring me twelve calves<br>
without blemish, and the twelve<br>
calves shall be for the priests and<br>
the elders.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Bring me also a hundred<br>
goats, and the hundred goats shall<br>
be for the whole people.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And Joachim went down with<br>
the shepherds, and Anna stood<br>
by the gate and saw Joachim<br>
coming with the shepherds.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And she ran, and hanging<br>
about his neck, said, Now I know<br>
that the Lord hath greatly blessed<br>
me:</p>
<br>
<p>10  For behold, I who was as a<br>
widow am no longer as a widow, and<br>
I who was barren shall conceive.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER V.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Joachim abides the first day in his house but<br>
     sacrifices on the morrow.<br>
     2 Consults the plate on the priests forehead,<br>
     3 and is without sin.<br>
     6 Anna brings forth a daughter,<br>
     9 whom she calls Mary.</p>
<br>
<p>AND Joachim abode the first<br>
day in his house, but on the<br>
morrow he brought his offerings,<br>
and said,</p>
<br>
<p>2  If the Lord be propitious to<br>
me let the plate which is on the<br>
priests forehead make it manifest.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And he consulted the plate<br>
which the priest wore, and saw it,<br>
and behold sin was not found in<br>
him.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And Joachim said, Now I know<br>
that the Lord is propitious<br>
to me, and hath taken away all<br>
my sins.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And he went down from the<br>
temple of the Lord justified,<br>
and he went to his own house.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And when nine months were<br>
fulfilled to Anna, she brought<br>
forth, and said to the midwife,<br>
What have I brought forth?</p>
<br>
<p>7  And she told her, A girl.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Then Anna said, The Lord<br>
hath this day magnified my soul;<br>
and she laid her in bed.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And when the days of her<br>
purification were accomplished,<br>
she gave suck to the child; and<br>
called her name Mary.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Mary at nine months old, walks nine steps.<br>
     3 Anna keeps her holy.<br>
     4 When she is a year old, Joachim makes a great feast.<br>
     7 Anna gives her the breast, and sings a song to the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>AND the child increased in<br>
strength every day, so that<br>
when she was nine months old, her<br>
mother put her upon the ground,<br>
to try if she could stand; and<br>
when she had walked nine steps,<br>
she came again to her mother's<br>
lap.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Then her mother caught her<br>
up, and said, As the Lord my God<br>
liveth, thou shalt not walk again<br>
on this earth, till I bring thee<br>
into the temple of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Accordingly she made her<br>
chamber a holy place, and suffered<br>
nothing uncommon or unclean to<br>
come near her, but invited certain<br>
undefiled daughters of Israel, and<br>
they drew her aside.</p>
<br>
<p>4  But when the child was a year<br>
old, Joachim made a great feast,<br>
and invited the priests, scribes,<br>
elders, and all the people of<br>
Israel;</p>
<br>
<p>5  And Joachim then made an<br>
offering of the girl to the chief-<br>
priests, and they blessed her,<br>
saying, The God of our fathers bless<br>
this girl, and give her a name<br>
famous and lasting through all<br>
generations. And all the people<br>
replied, So be it, Amen:</p>
<br>
<p>6  Then Joachim a second time<br>
offered her to the priests, and they<br>
blessed her, saying, O most high<br>
God, regard this girl, and bless<br>
her with an everlasting blessing.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Upon this her mother took<br>
her up, and gave her the breast,<br>
and sung the following song to the<br>
Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>8  I will sing a song unto the<br>
Lord my God, for he hath visited<br>
me, and taken away from me the<br>
reproach of mine enemies, and<br>
hath given me the fruit of his<br>
righteousness, that it may now be<br>
told the sons of Reuben, that Anna<br>
gives suck.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Then she put the child to rest<br>
in the room which she had consecrated,<br>
and she went out and ministered unto<br>
them.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And when the feast was<br>
ended, they went away rejoicing,<br>
and praising the God of Israel.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>
<br>
<p>     3 Mary being three years old, Joachim causes certain virgins to<br>
     light each a lamp, and goes with her to the temple.<br>
     5 The high-priest places her on the third step of the altar, and<br>
     sits dances with her feet.</p>
<br>
<p>BUT the girl grew, and when<br>
she was two years old, Joachim<br>
said to Anna, Let us lead her<br>
to the temple of the Lord,<br>
that we may perform our vow,<br>
which we have vowed unto the<br>
Lord God, lest he should be angry<br>
with us, and our offering be<br>
unacceptable.</p>
<br>
<p>2  But Anna said, Let us wait<br>
the third year, lest she should<br>
be at a loss to know her father.<br>
And Joachim said, Let us then<br>
wait.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And when the child was<br>
three years old, Joachim said,<br>
Let us invite the daughters of the<br>
Hebrews, who are undefiled, and let<br>
them take each a lamp, and let<br>
them be lighted, that the child<br>
may not turn back again, and her<br>
mind be set against the temple of<br>
the Lord,</p>
<br>
<p>4  And they did thus till they<br>
ascended into the temple of the Lord.<br>
And the high-priest received her,<br>
and blessed her, and said, Mary,<br>
the Lord God hath magnified thy<br>
name to all generations, and to the<br>
very end of time by thee will the<br>
Lord shew his redemption to the<br>
children of Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And he placed her upon the<br>
third step of the altar, and the<br>
Lord gave unto her grace, and she<br>
dance with her feet, and all the<br>
house of Israel loved her.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     2 Mary fed in the temple by angels.<br>
     3 When twelve years old the priests consult what to do with her.<br>
     6 The angel of the Lord warns Zacharias to call together all the<br>
     widowers, each bringing a rod.<br>
     7 The people meet by sound of trumpet.<br>
     8 Joseph throws away his hatchet, and goes to the meeting.<br>
     11 A dove comes forth from his rod, and alights on his head.<br>
     12 He is chosen to betroth the Virgin,<br>
     13 refuses because he is an old man,<br>
     14 is compelled,<br>
     16 takes her home, and goes to mind his trade of building.</p>
<br>
<p>AND her parents went away<br>
filled with wonder, and praising God,<br>
because the girl did not return back<br>
to them.</p>
<br>
<p>2  But Mary continued in the<br>
temple as a dove educated there,<br>
and received her food from the<br>
hand of an angel.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And when she was twelve<br>
years of age, the priests met in a<br>
council, and said, Behold, Mary is<br>
twelve years of age, what shall we<br>
do with her, for fear lest the holy<br>
place of the Lord our God should<br>
be defiled?</p>
<br>
<p>4  Then replied the priests to<br>
Zacharias the high-priest, Do you<br>
stand at the altar of the Lord, and<br>
enter into the holy place, and make<br>
petitions concerning her, and<br>
whatsoever the Lord shall manifest<br>
unto you, that do.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Then the high-priest entered<br>
into the Holy of Holies, and taking<br>
away with him the breast-plate of<br>
judgment made prayers concerning her;</p>
<br>
<p>6  And behold the angel of the<br>
Lord came to him, and said,<br>
Zacharias, Zacharias, Go forth and<br>
call together all the widowers<br>
among the people, and let every<br>
one of them bring his rod, and<br>
he by whom the Lord shall shew<br>
a sign shall be the husband of<br>
Mary.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And the criers went out<br>
through all Judaea, and the trumpet<br>
of the Lord sounded, and all<br>
the people ran and met together.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Joseph also throwing away<br>
his hatchet, went out to meet<br>
them; and when they were met,<br>
they went to the high-priest;<br>
taking every man his rod.</p>
<br>
<p>9  After the high-priest had<br>
received their rods, he went<br>
into the temple to pray;</p>
<br>
<p>10  And when he had finished<br>
his prayer, he took the rods, and<br>
went forth and distributed them,<br>
and there was no miracle attended<br>
them.</p>
<br>
<p>11  The last rod was taken by<br>
Joseph, said behold a dove<br>
proceeded out of the rod, and<br>
flew upon the head of Joseph.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And the high-priest said,<br>
Joseph, Thou art the person<br>
chosen to take the Virgin of the<br>
Lord, to keep her for him:</p>
<br>
<p>13  But Joseph refused, saying,<br>
I am an old man, and have children,<br>
but she is young, and I fear<br>
lest I should appear ridiculous<br>
in Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Then the high-priest replied,<br>
Joseph, Fear the Lord thy God,<br>
and remember how God dealt with<br>
Dathan, Korah, and Abiram, how<br>
the earth opened and swallowed<br>
them up, because of their<br>
contradiction.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Now therefore, Joseph, fear<br>
God lest the like things should<br>
happen in your family.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Joseph then being afraid,<br>
took her unto his house, and<br>
Joseph said unto Mary, Behold, I<br>
have taken thee from the temple<br>
of the Lord, and now I will leave<br>
thee in my house; I must go to<br>
mind my trade of building. The<br>
Lord be with thee.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 The priests desire a new veil for the temple,<br>
     3 seven virgins cast lots for making different parts of it,<br>
     4 the lot to spin the true purple falls to Mary.<br>
     5 Zacharias, the high priest, becomes dumb.<br>
     7 Mary takes a pot to draw water, and hears a voice,<br>
     8 trembles and begins to work,<br>
     9 an angel Appears and salutes her, and tells her she<br>
     shall conceive by the Holy Ghost,<br>
     17 she submits.<br>
     19 Visits her cousin Elizabeth, whose child in her womb leaps.</p>
<br>
<p>AND it came to pass, in a council<br>
of the priests, it was said,<br>
Let us make a new veil for the<br>
temple of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And the high-priest said,<br>
Call together to me seven undefiled<br>
virgins of the tribe of David.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And the servants went and<br>
brought them into the temple of<br>
the Lord, and the high-priest said<br>
unto them, Cast lots before me<br>
now, who of you shall spin the<br>
golden thread, who the blue, who<br>
the scarlet, who the fine linen, and<br>
who the true purple.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Then the high-priest knew<br>
Mary; that she was of the tribe of<br>
David; and he called her, and the<br>
true purple fell to her lot to spin,<br>
and she went away to her own<br>
house.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But from that time Zacharias<br>
the high-priest became dumb, and<br>
Samuel was placed in his room till<br>
Zacharias spoke again.</p>
<br>
<p>6  But Mary took the true purple;<br>
and did spin it.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And she took a pot, and<br>
went out to draw water, and heard<br>
a voice saying unto her, Hail thou<br>
who art full of grace, the Lord<br>
is with thee; thou art blessed<br>
among women.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And she looked round to the<br>
right and to the left (to see) whence<br>
that voice came, and then trembling<br>
went into her house, and laying<br>
down the water-pot, she took<br>
the purple, and sat down in her<br>
seat to work it.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And behold the angel of the<br>
Lord stood by her, and said, Fear<br>
not, Mary, for thou hast found<br>
favour in the sight of God.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Which when she heard, she<br>
reasoned with herself what that<br>
sort of salutation meant.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And the angel said unto her,<br>
The Lord is with thee, and thou<br>
shalt conceive:</p>
<br>
<p>12  To which she replied, What!<br>
shall I conceive by the living God<br>
and bring forth as all other<br>
women do?</p>
<br>
<p>13  But the angel returned<br>
answer, Not so, O Mary, but the<br>
Holy Ghost shall come upon thee,<br>
and the power of the Most High<br>
shall overshadow thee;</p>
<br>
<p>14  Wherefore that which shall<br>
be born of thee shall be holy,<br>
and shall be called the Son of the<br>
Living God, and thou shalt call his<br>
name Jesus; for he shall save his<br>
people from their sins.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And behold thy cousin Elizabeth,<br>
she also hath conceived a son in her<br>
old age.</p>
<br>
<p>16  And this now is the sixth<br>
month with her, who was called<br>
barren: for nothing is impossible<br>
with God.</p>
<br>
<p>17  And Mary said, Behold the<br>
handmaid of the Lord; let it be<br>
unto me according to thy word.</p>
<br>
<p>18  And when she had wrought<br>
her purple, she carried it to the<br>
high-priest, and the high-priest<br>
blessed her, saying, Mary, the<br>
Lord God hath magnified thy name,<br>
and thou shalt be blessed in all the<br>
ages of the world.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Then Mary, filled with joy,<br>
went away to her cousin Elizabeth,<br>
and knocked at the door.</p>
<br>
<p>20  Which when Elizabeth heard,<br>
she ran and opened to her, and<br>
blessed her, and said, Whence is<br>
this to me, that the mother of my<br>
Lord should come unto me?</p>
<br>
<p>21  For lo! as soon as the voice<br>
of thy salutation reached my ears,<br>
that which is in me leaped and<br>
blessed thee.</p>
<br>
<p>22  But Mary, being ignorant of<br>
all those mysterious things which<br>
the archangel Gabriel had spoken<br>
to her, lifted up her eyes to heaven,<br>
and said, Lord! What am I, that<br>
all the generations of the earth<br>
should call me blessed?</p>
<br>
<p>23  But perceiving herself daily<br>
to grow big, and being afraid, she<br>
went home, and hid herself from<br>
the children of Israel; and was<br>
fourteen years old when all these<br>
things happened.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER X.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Joseph returns from building houses, finds the Virgin<br>
     grown big, being six months gone with child,<br>
     2 is jealous and troubled,<br>
     8 reproaches her,<br>
     10 she affirms her innocence,<br>
     13 he leaves her,<br>
     16 determines to dismiss her privately,<br>
     17 is warned in a dream that Mary is with child by the Holy Ghost,<br>
     20 and glorifies God who had shewn him such favour.</p>
<br>
<p>AND when her sixth month was<br>
come, Joseph returned from<br>
his building houses abroad, which<br>
was his trade, and entering into the<br>
house, found the Virgin grown big:</p>
<br>
<p>2  Then smiting upon his face,<br>
he said, With what face can I look<br>
up to the Lord my God? or, what<br>
shall I say concerning this young<br>
woman?</p>
<br>
<p>3  For I received her a Virgin<br>
out of the temple of the Lord my<br>
God, and have not preserved her<br>
such!</p>
<br>
<p>4  Who has thus deceived me?<br>
Who has committed this evil in<br>
my house, and seducing the Virgin<br>
from me, hath defiled her?</p>
<br>
<p>5  Is not the history of Adam exactly<br>
accomplished in me?</p>
<br>
<p>6  For in the very instant of his<br>
glory, the serpent came and found<br>
Eve alone, and seduced her.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Just after the same manner it<br>
has happened to me.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Then Joseph arising from the<br>
ground, called her, and said, O<br>
thou who hast been so much<br>
favoured by God, why hast thou<br>
done this?</p>
<br>
<p>9  Why hast thou thus debased<br>
thy soul, who wast educated in the<br>
Holy of Holies, and received thy<br>
food from the hand of angels?</p>
<br>
<p>10  But she, with a flood of tears,<br>
replied, I am innocent, and have<br>
known no man.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Then said Joseph, How<br>
comes it to pass you are with<br>
child?</p>
<br>
<p>12  Mary answered, As the Lord<br>
my God liveth, I know not by what<br>
means.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Then Joseph was exceedingly afraid,<br>
and went ay from her, considering<br>
what he should do with her;<br>
and he thus reasoned with himself:</p>
<br>
<p>14  If I conceal her crime, I shall<br>
be found guilty by the law of the<br>
Lord;</p>
<br>
<p>15  And if I discover her to the<br>
children of Israel, I fear, lest<br>
she being with child by an angel,<br>
I shall be found to betray the life<br>
of an innocent person.</p>
<br>
<p>16  What therefore shall I do?<br>
I will privately dismiss her.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Then the night was come<br>
upon him, when behold an angel<br>
of the Lord appeared to him in a<br>
dream, and said,</p>
<br>
<p>18  Be not afraid to take that<br>
young woman, for that which is<br>
within her is of the Holy Ghost,</p>
<br>
<p>19  And she shall bring forth<br>
a son, and thou shalt call his name<br>
Jesus, for he shall save his people<br>
from their sins.</p>
<br>
<p>20 Then Joseph arose from his<br>
sleep, and glorified the God of<br>
Israel, who had shewn him such<br>
favour, and preserved the Virgin.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>
<br>
<p>     3 Annas visits Joseph, perceives the Virgin big with child,<br>
     4 informs the high priest that Joseph had privately married her.<br>
     8 Joseph and Mary brought to trial on the charge.<br>
     17 Joseph drinks the water of the Lord as an ordeal,<br>
     and receiving no harm, returns home.</p>
<br>
<p>THEN came Annas the scribe,<br>
and said to Joseph, Wherefore<br>
have we not seen you since<br>
your return?</p>
<br>
<p>2  And Joseph replied, Because<br>
I was weary after my journey, and<br>
rested the first day.</p>
<br>
<p>3  But Annas turning about<br>
perceived the Virgin big with child.</p>
<br>
<p>4 And went away to the priest,<br>
and told him, Joseph in whom you<br>
placed so much confidence, is<br>
guilty of a notorious crime, in<br>
that he hath defiled the Virgin<br>
whom he received out of the temple<br>
of the Lord, and hath privately<br>
married her, not discovering it to<br>
the children of Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Then said the priest, Hath<br>
Joseph done this?</p>
<br>
<p>6  Annas replied, If you send<br>
any of your servants you will find<br>
that she is with child.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And the servants went, and<br>
found it as he said.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Upon this both she and Joseph<br>
were brought to their trial, and<br>
the priest said unto her, Mary,<br>
what hast thou done?</p>
<br>
<p>9  Why hast thou debased thy<br>
soul, and forgot thy God, seeing<br>
thou wast brought up in the Holy<br>
of Holies, and didst receive thy<br>
food from the hands of angels, and<br>
heardest their songs?</p>
<br>
<p>10  Why hast thou done this?</p>
<br>
<p>11  To which with a flood of<br>
tears she answered, As the Lord<br>
my God liveth, I am innocent in<br>
his sight, seeing I know no man.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Then the priest said to Joseph,<br>
Why hast thou done this?</p>
<br>
<p>13  And Joseph answered, As<br>
the Lord my God liveth, I have<br>
not been concerned with her.</p>
<br>
<p>14  But the priest said, Lie not,<br>
but declare the truth; thou hast<br>
privately married her, and not<br>
discovered it to the children of<br>
Israel, and humbled thyself under<br>
the mighty hand (of God), that thy<br>
seed might be blessed:</p>
<br>
<p>15  And Joseph was silent.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Then said the priest<br>
(to Joseph), You must restore to<br>
the temple of the Lord the Virgin<br>
which you took thence.</p>
<br>
<p>17  But he wept bitterly, and the<br>
priest added, I will cause you both<br>
to drink the water of the Lord,<br>
which is for trial, and so your<br>
iniquity shall be laid open before<br>
you.--[bitter water that causeth the curse]</p>
<br>
<p>18  Then the priest took the water,<br>
and made Joseph drink, and sent him<br>
to a mountainous place,</p>
<br>
<p>19  And he returned perfectly<br>
well, and all the people wondered<br>
that his guilt was not discovered.</p>
<br>
<p>20  So the priest said, Since the<br>
Lord hath not made your sins<br>
evident, neither do I condemn<br>
you.</p>
<br>
<p>21 So he sent them away.</p>
<br>
<p>22 Then Joseph took Mary, and<br>
went to his house, rejoicing and<br>
praising the God of Israel.</p>

     one mourning and the other rejoicing.<br>
     10 The delivery being near, he takes her<br>
     from the ass, and places her in a cave.</p>
<br>
<p>AND it came to pass, that there<br>
went forth a decree from<br>
the Emperor Augustus, that all<br>
the Jews should be taxed, who<br>
were of Bethlehem in Judaea.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And Joseph said, I will take<br>
care that my children be taxed;<br>
but what shall I do with this young<br>
woman?</p>
<br>
<p>3  To have her taxed as my wife<br>
I am ashamed; and if I tax her as<br>
my daughter, all Israel knows she<br>
is not my daughter.</p>
<br>
<p>4  When the time of the Lord's<br>
appointment shall come, let him do<br>
as seems good to him.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And he saddled the ass, and<br>
put her upon it, and Joseph and<br>
Simon followed after her, and<br>
arrived at Bethlehem within three<br>
miles.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Then Joseph turning about<br>
saw Mary sorrowful, and said<br>
within himself, Perhaps she is in<br>
pain through that which is within<br>
her.</p>
<br>
<p>7  But when he turned about<br>
again, he saw her laughing, and<br>
said to her,</p>
<br>
<p>8  Mary, how happens it, that I<br>
sometimes see sorrow, and sometimes<br>
laughter and joy in thy countenance?</p>
<br>
<p>9  And Mary replied to him,<br>
I see two people with mine eyes,<br>
the one weeping and mourning,<br>
the other laughing and rejoicing.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And he went again across<br>
the way, and Mary said to Joseph,<br>
Take me down from the ass, for<br>
that which is in me presses to come<br>
forth.</p>
<br>
<p>11  But Joseph replied, Whither<br>
shall I take thee? for the place is<br>
a desert.</p>
<br>
<p>12 Then said Mary again to Joseph,<br>
take me down, for that which is<br>
within me mightily presses me.</p>
<br>
<p>13 And Joseph took her down.</p>
<br>
<p>14 And he found there a cave,<br>
and let her into it.</p>

<br>
<p>     1 Joseph seeks a Hebrew midwife,<br>
     2 perceives the owls stopping in their flight,<br>
     3 the working people at their food not moving,<br>
     8 the sheep standing still,<br>
     9 the shepherd fixed and immoveable,<br>
     10 and kids with their mouths touching<br>
     the water but not drinking.</p>
<br>
<p>AND leaving her and his sons<br>
in the cave, Joseph went<br>
forth to seek a Hebrew midwife in<br>
the village of Bethlehem.</p>
<br>
<p>2  But as I was going (said Joseph),<br>
I looked up into the air,<br>
and I saw the clouds astonished,<br>
and the fowls of the air stopping in<br>
the midst of their flight.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And I looked down towards<br>
the earth, and saw a table spread,<br>
and working people sitting around<br>
it, but their hands were upon the<br>
table and they did not move to<br>
eat.</p>
<br>
<p>4  They who had meat in their<br>
mouths did not eat.</p>
<br>
<p>5  They who lifted their hands<br>
up to their heads did not draw<br>
them back,</p>
<br>
<p>6  And they who lifted them up<br>
to their mouths did not put any<br>
thing in;</p>
<br>
<p>7  But all their faces were fixed<br>
upwards.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And I beheld the sheep dispersed,<br>
and yet the sheep stood still.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And the shepherd lifted up<br>
his hand to smite them, and his<br>
hand continued up.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And I looked unto a river,<br>
and saw the kids with their mouths<br>
close to the water, and touching it,<br>
but they did not drink.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Joseph finds a midwife.<br>
     10 A bright cloud overshadows the cave.<br>
     11 A great light in the cave, gradually<br>
     increases until the infant is born.<br>
     13 The mid-wife goes out, and tells Salome<br>
     that she has seen a virgin bring forth.<br>
     17 Salome doubts it.<br>
     20 her hand withers,<br>
     22 she supplicates the Lord,<br>
     28 is cured,<br>
     30 but warned not to declare what she had seen.</p>
<br>
<p>THEN I beheld a woman coming<br>
down from the mountains,<br>
and she said to me, Where art thou<br>
going, O man?</p>
<br>
<p>2  And I said to her, I go to<br>
enquire for a Hebrew midwife.</p>
<br>
<p>3  She replied to me, Where is<br>
the woman that is to be delivered?</p>
<br>
<p>4  And I answered, In the cave,<br>
and she is betrothed to me.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Then said the midwife, Is she<br>
not thy wife?</p>
<br>
<p>6  Joseph answered, It is Mary,<br>
who was educated in the Holy of<br>
Holies, in the house of the Lord,<br>
and she fell to me by lot, and is<br>
not my wife, but has conceived by<br>
the Holy Ghost.</p>
<br>
<p>7  The midwife said, Is this true?</p>
<br>
<p>8  He answered, Come and see.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And the midwife went along<br>
with him, and stood in the cave.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Then a bright cloud over-<br>
shadowed the cave, and the mid-<br>
wife said, This day my soul is<br>
magnified, for mine eyes have seen<br>
surprising things, and salvation is<br>
brought forth to Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>11  But on a sudden the cloud<br>
became a great light in the cave,<br>
so that their eyes could not bear it.</p>
<br>
<p>12  But the light gradually<br>
decreased, until the infant appeared,<br>
and sucked the breast of his mother,<br>
Mary.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Then the midwife cried out,<br>
and said, How glorious a day is<br>
this, wherein mine eyes have seen<br>
this extraordinary sight!</p>
<br>
<p>14  And the midwife went out<br>
from the cave, and Salome met<br>
her.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And the midwife said to her,<br>
Salome, Salome, I will tell you a<br>
most surprising thing which I saw,</p>
<br>
<p>16  A virgin hath brought forth,<br>
which is a thing contrary to<br>
nature.</p>
<br>
<p>17  To which Salome replied, As<br>
the Lord my God liveth unless I<br>
receive particular proof of this<br>
matter, I will not believe that a<br>
virgin hath brought forth.</p>
<br>
<p>18  If Then Salome went in, and<br>
the midwife said, Mary, shew thyself,<br>
for a controversy is risen<br>
concerning thee.</p>
<br>
<p>19  And Salome received satisfaction.</p>
<br>
<p>20  But her hand was withered,<br>
and she groaned bitterly;</p>
<br>
<p>21  And said, Woe to me, because<br>
of mine iniquity; for I have<br>
tempted the living God, and my<br>
hand is ready to drop off.</p>
<br>
<p>22 Then Salome made her<br>
supplication to the Lord, and said,<br>
O God of my Fathers, remember me,<br>
for I am of the seed of Abraham,<br>
and Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
<br>
<p>23  Make me not a reproach<br>
among the children of Israel, but<br>
restore me sound to my parents.</p>
<br>
<p>24  For thou well knowest,<br>
O Lord, that I have performed many<br>
offices of charity in thy name,<br>
and have received my reward from<br>
thee.</p>
<br>
<p>25  Upon this an angel of the<br>
Lord stood by Salome, and said,<br>
The Lord God hath heard thy<br>
prayer, reach forth thy hand to<br>
the child, and carry him, and by<br>
that means thou shalt be restored.</p>
<br>
<p>26  Salome filled with exceeding<br>
joy, went to the child, and said,<br>
I will touch him.</p>
<br>
<p>27  And she purposed to worship<br>
him, for she said, This is a great<br>
king, which is born in Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>28  And straightway Salome was<br>
cured.</p>
<br>
<p>29  Then the midwife went out<br>
of the cave, being approved by God.</p>
<br>
<p>30  And lo! a voice came to Salome.<br>
Declare not the strange things<br>
which thou hast seen, till<br>
the child shall come to Jerusalem.</p>
<br>
<p>31  So Salome also departed,<br>
approved by God.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Wise men come from the east.<br>
     3 Herod alarmed;<br>
     8 desires them if they find the child to bring him word.<br>
     10 They visit the cave and offer the child their treasure,<br>
     11 and being warned in a dream, do not return to Herod,<br>
     but go home another way.</p>
<br>
<p>THEN Joseph was preparing to<br>
go away, because there arose<br>
a great disorder in Bethlehem by<br>
the coming of some wise men<br>
from the east,</p>
<br>
<p>2  Who said, Where is the King<br>
of the Jews born?  For we have<br>
seen his star in the east, and are<br>
come to worship him.</p>
<br>
<p>3  When Herod heard this, he<br>
was exceedingly troubled, and sent<br>
messengers to the wise men, and<br>
to the priests, and enquired of<br>
them in the town-hall,</p>
<br>
<p>4  And said unto them, Where<br>
have you it written concerning<br>
Christ the king, or where should<br>
he be born?</p>
<br>
<p>5  Then they say unto him, In<br>
Bethlehem of Judaea; for thus it<br>
is written: And thou Bethlehem in<br>
the land of Judah, art not the least<br>
among the princes of Judah, for<br>
out of thee shall come a ruler,<br>
who shall rule my people Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And having sent away the<br>
chief priests, he enquired of the<br>
wise men in the town-hall, and<br>
said unto them, What sign was it<br>
ye saw concerning the king that is<br>
born?</p>
<br>
<p>7  They answered him, We saw<br>
an extraordinary large star shining<br>
among the stars of heaven, and so<br>
out-shined all the other stars, as<br>
that they became not visible, and<br>
we knew thereby that a great king<br>
was born in Israel, and therefore<br>
we are come to worship him.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Then said Herod to them, Go<br>
and make diligent inquiry; and if<br>
ye find the child, bring me word<br>
again, that I may come and worship<br>
him also.</p>
<br>
<p>9  So the wise men went forth,<br>
and behold, the star which they<br>
saw in the east went before them,<br>
till it came and stood over the cave<br>
where the young child was with<br>
Mary his mother.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Then they brought forth out<br>
of their treasures, and offered unto<br>
him gold and frankincense, and<br>
myrrh.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And being warned in a dream<br>
by an angel, that they should not<br>
return to Herod through Judaea,<br>
they departed into their own country<br>
by another way.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Herod enraged, orders the infants in Bethlehem to be slain.<br>
     2 Mary puts her infant in an ox-manger.<br>
     3 Elizabeth flees with her son John to the mountains.<br>
     6 A mountain miraculously divides and receives them.<br>
     9 Herod incensed at the escape of John, causes Zacharias<br>
     to be murdered at the altar.<br>
     23 The roofs of the temple rent, the body miraculously<br>
     conveyed, and the blood petrified.<br>
     25 Israel mourns for him.<br>
     27 Simeon chosen his successor by lot.</p>
<br>
<p>THEN Herod perceiving that<br>
he was mocked by the wise<br>
men, and being very angry,<br>
commanded certain men to go and<br>
to kill all the children that were<br>
in Bethlehem, from two years old<br>
and under.</p>
<br>
<p>2  But Mary hearing that the<br>
children were to be, killed, being<br>
under much fear, took the child,<br>
and wrapped him up in swaddling<br>
clothes, and laid him in an ox-<br>
manger, because there was no<br>
room for them in the inn.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Elizabeth also, hearing that<br>
her son John was about to be<br>
searched for; took him and went<br>
up unto the mountains, and looked<br>
around for a place to hide him;</p>
<br>
<p>4  And there was no secret place<br>
to be found.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Then she groaned within herself,<br>
and said, O mountain of the Lord,<br>
receive the mother with the child.</p>
<br>
<p>6  For Elizabeth could not climb up,</p>
<br>
<p>7  And instantly the mountain<br>
was divided and received them.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And there appeared to them<br>
an angel of the Lord to preserve<br>
them.</p>
<br>
<p>9  But Herod made search after<br>
John, and sent servants to Zacharias,<br>
when he was (ministering) at the altar,<br>
and said unto him, Were hast thou hid<br>
thy son?</p>
<br>
<p>10  He replied, to them, I am a<br>
minister of God, and a servant at<br>
the altar: how should I know<br>
where my son is?</p>
<br>
<p>11  So the servants went back,<br>
and told Herod the whole; at<br>
which he was incensed, and said,<br>
Is not this son of his like to be<br>
king of Israel?</p>
<br>
<p>12  He sent therefore again his<br>
servants to Zacharias, saying, Tell<br>
us the truth, where is thy son, for<br>
you know that your life is in my<br>
hand.</p>
<br>
<p>13  So the servants went and told<br>
him all this:</p>
<br>
<p>14  But Zacharias replied to<br>
them, I am a martyr for God, and<br>
if ye skied my blood, the Lord will<br>
receive my soul.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Besides know that ye shed<br>
innocent blood.</p>
<br>
<p>16  However Zacharias was murdered<br>
in the entrance of the temple<br>
said altar, and about the partition;</p>
<br>
<p>17  But the children of Israel<br>
knew not when he want killed.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Then at the hour of salutation<br>
the pnests went into the temple<br>
but Zacharias did not according<br>
to custom, meet them and bless them.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Yet they still continued<br>
waiting for him to salute them;</p>
<br>
<p>20  And when they found he did<br>
not in a long time come, one of<br>
them ventured into the holy place<br>
where the altar was, and he saw<br>
blood lying upon the ground<br>
congealed:</p>
<br>
<p>21  When, behold, a voice from<br>
heaven said, Zacharias is murdered,<br>
and his blood shall not be<br>
wiped away, until the revenger<br>
of his blood come.</p>
<br>
<p>22  But when he heard this, he<br>
was afraid; and went forth and told<br>
the priests what he had seen and<br>
heard; and they all went in, and<br>
saw the fact.</p>
<br>
<p>23  Then the roofs of the temple<br>
howled, and were rent from the<br>
top to the bottom:</p>
<br>
<p>24  And they could not find the<br>
body, but only blood made hard<br>
like stone.</p>
<br>
<p>25  And they went away, and<br>
told the people, that Zacharias<br>
was murdered, and all the tribes<br>
of Israel heard thereof, and mourned<br>
for him, and lamented three days:</p>
<br>
<p>26  Then the priests took<br>
council together concerning<br>
a person to succeed him.</p>
<br>
<p>27  And Simeon and the other<br>
priests cast lots, and the lot fell<br>
upon Simeon.</p>
<br>
<p>28  For he had been assured by<br>
the Holy Spirit, that he should not<br>
die, till he had seen Christ come in<br>
the flesh.</p>
<br>
<p>     (I James wrote this History in Jerusalem: and when the disturbance<br>
     was I retired into a desert place, until the death of Herod, and the<br>
     disturbances ceased at Jerusalem. That which remains is, that I<br>
     glorify God that he hath given me such wisdom to write unto you who<br>
     are spiritual, and who love God: to whom (be ascribed) glory and<br>
     dominion for ever and ever. Amen.)</p>

                          THE PROTEVANGELION.<br>
              Note on the death of Zacharias in, Chap. 16.</p>
<br>
<p>There is a story both in the Jerusalem and Babylonish Talmud very similar<br>
to this. It is cited by Dr. Lightfoot, Talmud, Hierosol, in Taanith, fol.<br>
69; and  Talmud. Babyl. in Sanhedr., fol. 96.  "O Rabbi Jochanan said,<br>
Eighty thousand priests were slain for the blood of Zacharias. Rabbi<br>
Judas asked Rabbi Achan, Where did they kill Zacharias? Was it in the<br>
woman's court, or in the court of Israel? He answered, Neither in the<br>
court of Israel, nor in the court of women, but in the court of the<br>
priests; and they did not treat his blood in the same manner as they were<br>
wont to treat the blood of a ram or young goat.   For of these it is<br>
written, He shall pour out his blood, and cover it with dust. But it is<br>
written  here, The blood is in the midst of her: she set it upon the top<br>
of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground. (Ezek. xxiv. 7.) But why<br>
was this? That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance: I have<br>
set his blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.<br>
They committed seven evils that day: they murdered a priest, a prophet,<br>
and a king; they shed the blood of the innocent they polluted the court:<br>
that day was the Sabbath: and the day of expiation.  When therefore<br>
Nebuzaradan came there (viz. to Jerusalem,) he saw his blood  bubbling,<br>
and said to them, What meaneth this? They answered, It is the blood of<br>
calves, lambs, and rams, which we have offered upon the altar. He<br>
commanded  then, that they should bring calves, and lambs, and rams, and<br>
said I will try  whether this be their blood: accordingly they brought<br>
and slew them, but the blood of Zacharias still bubbled, but the blood of<br>
these did not bubble. Then he  said, Declare to me the truth of this<br>
matter, or else I will comb your flesh with iron combs. Then said they to<br>
him, He was a priest, prophet, and judge, who prophesied to Israel all<br>
these calamities which we have suffered from you; but we arose against<br>
him, and slew him.  Then, said he, I will appease him then he  took the<br>
rabbins and slew them upon his (viz. Zacharias's) blood, and he was not<br>
yet appeased. Next he took the young boys from the schools, and slew them<br>
upon his blood; and yet it bubbled. Then he brought the young priests and<br>
slew them  in the-same place, and yet it still bubbled. So he slew at<br>
length ninety-four thousand persons upon his blood, and it did not as yet<br>
cease bubbling, then he drew  near to it, and said, O Zacharias,<br>
Zacharias, thou halt occasioned the death of the  chief of thy<br>
countrymen, shall I slay them all? then the blood ceased, and did bubble<br>
no more."</p>

                    REFERENCES TO THE PROTEVANGELION.</p>
<br>
<p>[This Gospel is ascribed to James. The allusions to it in the ancient<br>
Fathers are  frequent, and their expressions indicate that it had<br>
obtained a very general credit in the Christian world. The controversies<br>
founded upon it chiefly  relate to the age of Joseph at the birth of<br>
Christ, and to his being a widower with children, before his marriage<br>
with the Virgin. It seems material to remark, that the legends of the<br>
latter ages affirm the virginity of Joseph, notwithstanding Epiphanius,<br>
Hilary, Chrysostom, Cyril, Euthymius, Thephylaet, Occumenius, and indeed<br>
all the Latin Fathers till Ambrose, and the Greek Fathers afterwards,<br>
maintain the opinions of Joseph's age and family, founded upon their<br>
belief in the authenticity of this book. It is supposed to have been<br>
originally composed in Hebrew. Postellus brought the MS. of this Gospel<br>
from the Levant, translated it into Latin, and sent it to Oporimus,<br>
a printer at Basil, where Bibliander, a Protestant Divine, and the<br>
Professor of Divinity at Zurich, caused it to be printed in 1552.<br>
Postellus asserts that it was publicly read as canonical in the eastern<br>
churches they making no doubt that James was the author, of it. It is,<br>
nevertheless considered apocryphal by some of the most learned divines in<br>
the Protestant and Catholic churches.]</p>

<br>
<p>CHAPTER I.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Caiphas relates that Jesus, when in his cradle,<br>
     informed his mother that he was the Son of God.<br>
     5 Joseph and Mary going to Bethlehem to be taxed, Mary's<br>
     time of bringing forth arrives, and she goes into a cave.<br>
     8 Joseph fetches in a Hebrew woman. The cave filled with<br>
     great lights.<br>
     11 The infant born,<br>
     17 and cures the woman.<br>
     19 Arrival of the shepherds.</p>
<br>
<p>THE following accounts we found<br>
in the book of Joseph the<br>
high-priest, called by some<br>
Caiphas:</p>
<br>
<p>2  He relates, that Jesus spake<br>
even when he was in the cradle,<br>
and said to his mother:</p>
<br>
<p>3  Mary, I am Jesus the Son of<br>
God, that word, which thou didst<br>
bring forth according to the<br>
declaration of the angel Gabriel to<br>
thee, and my father hath sent me<br>
for the salvation of the world.</p>
<br>
<p>4  In the three hundred and<br>
ninth year of the era of Alexander,<br>
Augustus published a decree that<br>
all persons should go to be taxed<br>
in their own country.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Joseph therefore arose, and<br>
with Mary his spouse he went to<br>
Jerusalem, and then came to Bethlehem,<br>
that he and his family might be taxed<br>
in the city of his fathers.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And when they came by the cave,<br>
Mary confessed to Joseph that her<br>
time of bringing forth was come,<br>
and she could not go on to the city,<br>
and said, Let us go into this cave.</p>
<br>
<p>7  At that time the sun was very<br>
near going down.</p>
<br>
<p>8  But Joseph hastened away,<br>
that he might fetch her a midwife;<br>
and when he saw an old Hebrew<br>
woman who was of Jerusalem, he<br>
said to her, Pray come hither,<br>
good woman, and go into that cave,<br>
and you will there see a woman<br>
just ready to bring forth.</p>
<br>
<p>9  It was after sunset, when the<br>
old woman and Joseph with her<br>
reached the cave, and they both<br>
went into it.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And behold, it was all filled<br>
with lights, greater than the light<br>
of lamps and candles, and greater<br>
than the light of the sun itself.</p>
<br>
<p>11  The infant was then wrapped<br>
up in swaddling clothes, and sucking<br>
the breasts of his mother St.<br>
Mary.</p>
<br>
<p>12  When they both saw this<br>
light, they were surprised; the<br>
old woman asked St. Mary, Art<br>
thou the mother of this child?</p>
<br>
<p>13  St. Mary replied, She was.</p>
<br>
<p>14  On which the old woman<br>
said, Thou art very different from<br>
all other women.</p>
<br>
<p>15  St. Mary answered, As there<br>
is not any child like to my son,<br>
so neither is there any woman like<br>
to his mother.</p>
<br>
<p>16  The old woman answered,<br>
and said, O my Lady, I am come<br>
hither that I may obtain an<br>
everlasting reward.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Then our Lady St. Mary<br>
said to her, Lay thine hands upon<br>
the infant, which, when she had<br>
done, she became whole.</p>
<br>
<p>18  And as she was going forth,<br>
she said, From henceforth, all the<br>
days of my life, I will attend upon<br>
and be a servant of this infant.</p>
<br>
<p>19  After this, when the shepherds<br>
came, and had made a fire, and they<br>
were exceedingly rejoiceing, the<br>
heavenly host appeared to them,<br>
praising and adoring the supreme God.</p>
<br>
<p>20  And as the shepherds were<br>
engaged in the same employment,<br>
the cave at that time seemed like<br>
a glorious temple, because both<br>
the tongues of angels and men<br>
united to adore and magnify God,<br>
on account of the birth of the Lord<br>
Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>21  But when the old Hebrew<br>
woman saw all these evident miracles,<br>
she gave praises to God, and<br>
said, I thank thee, O God, thou<br>
God of Israel, for that mine eyes<br>
have seen the birth of the Saviour<br>
of the world.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAP. II.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 The child circumcised in the cave,<br>
     2 and the old woman preserving his foreskin or navel-string in a<br>
     box of spikenard, Mary afterwards annoints Christ with it.<br>
     5 Christ brought to the temple;<br>
     6 He shines,<br>
     7 and angels stand around him adoring.<br>
     8 Simeon praises Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>AND when the time of his<br>
circumcision was come: namely,<br>
the eighth day, on which the<br>
law commanded the child to be<br>
circumcised; they circumcised<br>
him in the cave.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And the old Hebrew woman<br>
took the foreskin (others say she<br>
took the navel-string), and preserved<br>
it in an alabaster-box of old oil<br>
of spikenard.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And she had a son who was a<br>
druggist, to whom she said, Take<br>
heed thou sell not this alabaster-<br>
box of spikenard-ointment, although<br>
thou shouldst be offered three<br>
hundred pence for it.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Now this is that alabaster-<br>
box which Mary the sinner procured,<br>
and poured forth the ointment out<br>
of it upon the head and the feet<br>
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and wiped<br>
them off with the hairs of her head.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Then after ten days they<br>
brought him to Jerusalem, and on<br>
the fortieth day from his birth<br>
they presented him in the temple<br>
before the Lord, making the proper<br>
offerings for him, according<br>
to the requirement of the law of<br>
Moses: namely, that every male<br>
which opens the womb shall be<br>
called holy unto God.</p>
<br>
<p>6  At that time old Simeon saw<br>
him shining as a pillar of light,<br>
when St. Mary the Virgin, his<br>
mother, carried him in her arms,<br>
and was filled with the greatest<br>
pleasure at the sight.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And the angels stood around<br>
him, adoring him, as a king's<br>
guards stand around him.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Then Simeon going near to<br>
St. Mary, and stretching forth his<br>
hands towards her, said to the<br>
Lord Christ, Now, O My Lord,<br>
thy servant shall depart in peace,<br>
according to thy word;</p>
<br>
<p>9  For mine eyes have seen thy<br>
mercy, which thou hast prepared<br>
for the salvation of all nations;<br>
a light to all people, and the glory<br>
of thy people Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Hannah the prophetess was<br>
also present, and drawing near,<br>
she gave praises to God, and<br>
celebrated the happiness of Mary.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 The wise men visit Christ. Mary gives them<br>
     one of his swaddling clothes.<br>
     3 An angel appears to them in the form of a star.<br>
     4 They return and make a fire, and worship the<br>
     swaddling cloth, and put it in the fire where it<br>
     remains unconsumed.</p>
<br>
<p>AND it came to pass, when the<br>
Lord Jesus was born at Bethlehem,<br>
a city of Judaea, in the time of Herod<br>
the King;--the wise  men came from the<br>
East to Jerusalem, according to the<br>
prophecy of Zoradascht,[Zoroaster]<br>
and brought with them offerings:<br>
namely, gold, frankincense, and myrrh,<br>
and worshipped him, and offered to him<br>
their gifts.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Then the Lady Mary took one<br>
of his swaddling clothes in which<br>
the infant was wrapped, and gave<br>
it to them instead of a blessing,<br>
which they received from her as a<br>
most noble present.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And at the same time there<br>
appeared to them an angel in the<br>
form of that star which had before<br>
been their guide in their journey;<br>
the light of which they followed<br>
till they returned into their own<br>
country.</p>
<br>
<p>4  On their return their kings<br>
and princes came to them inquiring,<br>
whom they had seen and done?<br>
What sort of journey and return<br>
they had?  What Company<br>
they had on the road?</p>
<br>
<p>5  But they produced the swaddling<br>
cloth which St. Mary had given<br>
them, on account whereof they kept<br>
a feast.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And having, according to the<br>
custom of their country, made<br>
a fire, they worshipped it.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And casting the swaddling<br>
cloth into it, the fire took it<br>
and kept it.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And when the fire was put out,<br>
they took forth the swaddling cloth<br>
unhurt, as much as if the fire had<br>
not touched it.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Then they began to kiss it,<br>
and put it upon their heads and<br>
their eyes saying, This is certainly<br>
an undoubted truth, and it is really<br>
surprising that the fire could not<br>
burn it, and consume it.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Then they took it, and with<br>
the greatest respect laid it up<br>
among their treasures.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Herod intends to put Christ to death.<br>
     3 An angel warns Joseph to take the child<br>
     and his mother into Egypt.<br>
     6 Consternation on their arrival.<br>
     13 The idols fall down.<br>
     15 Mary washes Christ's swaddling clothes, hangs them to<br>
     dry on a post, and the son of a priest puts one on his head;<br>
     16 And being possessed of devils they leave him.</p>
<br>
<p>NOW Herod perceiving that the<br>
wise men did delay and not return<br>
to him, called together the priest<br>
and wise men, and said, Tell me in<br>
what place the Christ should be born.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And when they replied, in<br>
Bethlehem,--a city of Judaea, he<br>
began to contrive in his own mind<br>
the death of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>3  But an angel of the Lord<br>
appeared to Joseph in his sleep,<br>
and said, Arise, take the child and<br>
his mother, and go into Egypt as soon<br>
as the cock crows. So he arose,<br>
and went.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And as he was considering<br>
with himself about his journey,<br>
the morning came upon him.</p>
<br>
<p>5  In the length of the journey<br>
the girts of the saddle broke.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And now he drew near to a great<br>
city, in which there was an idol,<br>
to which the priests of the other<br>
idols and gods of Egypt brought<br>
their offerings and vows.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And there was by this idol a<br>
priest ministering to it, who, as<br>
often as Satan spoke out of that<br>
idol, related the things he said to<br>
the inhabitants of Egypt, and those<br>
countries.</p>
<br>
<p>8  This priest had a son three<br>
years old, who was possessed with<br>
a great multitude of devils, who<br>
uttered many strange things and<br>
when the devils seized him, walked<br>
about naked with his clothes torn,<br>
throwing stones at those whom<br>
he saw.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Near to that idol was the inn<br>
of the city, into which when Joseph<br>
and St. Mary were come, and had<br>
turned into that inn, all the<br>
inhabitants of the city were<br>
astonished.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And all the magistrates and<br>
priests of the idols assembled<br>
before that idol, and made inquiry<br>
there, saying, What means all this<br>
consternation, and dread, which<br>
has fallen upon all our country?</p>
<br>
<p>11  The idol answered them,<br>
The unknown God is come thither,<br>
who is truly God; nor is there any<br>
one besides him, who is worthy of<br>
divine worship for he is truly the<br>
Son of God.</p>
<br>
<p>12  At the fame of him this<br>
country trembled, and at his<br>
coming it is under the present<br>
commotion and consternation, and<br>
we ourselves are afrighted by the<br>
greatness of his power.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And at the same instant this<br>
idol fell down, and at his fall all<br>
the inhabitants of Egypt, besides<br>
others ran together.</p>
<br>
<p>14  But the son of the priest,<br>
when his usual disorder came upon<br>
him going into the inn, found<br>
there Joseph and St. Mary, whom<br>
all the rest had left behind and<br>
forsook.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And when the Lady St. Mary<br>
had washed the swaddling clothes<br>
of the Lord Christ, and hanged<br>
them out to dry upon a post, the<br>
boy possessed with the devil took<br>
down one of them, and put it upon<br>
his head.</p>
<br>
<p>16  And presently the devils<br>
began to come out of his mouth,<br>
and fly away in the shape of crows<br>
and serpents.</p>
<br>
<p>17  From that time the boy was<br>
healed by the power of the Lord<br>
Christ and he began to sing<br>
praises, and give thanks to the<br>
Lord who had healed him.</p>
<br>
<p>18  When his father saw him<br>
restored to his former state of<br>
health, he said, My son, what has<br>
happened to thee, and by what<br>
means wert thou cured?</p>
<br>
<p>19  The son answered, When the<br>
devils seized me, I went into the<br>
inn, and there found a very<br>
handsome woman with a boy, whose<br>
swaddling clothes she had just<br>
before washed, and hanged out upon<br>
a post.</p>
<br>
<p>20  One of these I took, and put<br>
it upon my head, and immediately<br>
the devils left me, and fled away.</p>
<br>
<p>21  At this the father exceedingly<br>
rejoiced, and said, My son,<br>
perhaps this boy is the son of the<br>
living God, who made the heavens<br>
and the earth.</p>
<br>
<p>22  For as soon as he came<br>
amongst us, the idol was broken,<br>
and all the gods fell down, and<br>
were destroyed by a greater power.</p>
<br>
<p>23  Then was fulfilled the prophecy<br>
which saith, Out of Egypt I have<br>
called my son.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER V.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Joseph and Mary leave Egypt.<br>
     3 Go to the Haunts of robbers,<br>
     4 Who hearing a mighty noise,<br>
     as of a great army flee away.</p>
<br>
<p>NOW Joseph and Mary when<br>
they heard that the idol was<br>
fallen down and destroyed, were<br>
seized with fear and, trembling,<br>
and said, When we Were in the<br>
land of Israel, Herod, intending<br>
to kill Jesus, slew for that purpose<br>
all the infants at Bethlehem, and<br>
that neighbourhood.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And there is no doubt but<br>
the Egyptians if they come to<br>
hear that this idol is broken and<br>
fallen down, will burn us with fire.</p>
<br>
<p>3  They went therefore hence to<br>
the secret places of robbers, who<br>
robbed travellers as they pass by,<br>
of their carriages and their clothes<br>
and carried them away bound.</p>
<br>
<p>4  These thieves upon their<br>
coming heard a great noise such<br>
as the noise of a king with a great<br>
army, and many horse and the<br>
trumpets sounding at his departure<br>
from his own city, at which they<br>
were so affrighted, as to leave<br>
all their booty behind them and<br>
fly away in haste.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Upon this the prisoners arose,<br>
and loosed each other's bonds,<br>
and taking each man his bags,<br>
they went way, and saw Joseph<br>
and Mary coming towards them,<br>
and inquired, Where is that king,<br>
the noise of whose approach the<br>
robbers heard, and left us,<br>
so that we are now come off safe?</p>
<br>
<p>6  Joseph answered, He will come<br>
after us.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Mary looks on a woman in whom Satan had taken<br>
     up his abode, and she becomes dispossesed.<br>
     5 Christ kissed by a bride made dumb by sorcerers,<br>
     cures her.<br>
     11 Miraculously cures a gentlewoman in whom Satan<br>
     had taken up his abode.<br>
     16 A leprous girl cured by the water in which he was<br>
     washed, and becomes the servant of Joseph and Mary.<br>
     20 The leprous son of a prince's wife cured in like manner.<br>
     37 Has mother offers large gifts to Mary, and dismisses her.</p>
<br>
<p>
THEN they went into another<br>
city where there was a woman<br>
possessed with a devil, and in<br>
whom Satan, that cursed rebel,<br>
had taken up his abode.</p>
<br>
<p>2  One night, when she went to<br>
fetch water, she could neither<br>
endure her clothes on, nor to be<br>
in any house; but as often as they<br>
tied her with chains or cords, she<br>
brake them, and went out into desert<br>
places, and sometimes standing<br>
where roads crossed, and in<br>
church yards, would throw stones<br>
at men.</p>
<br>
<p>3  When St. Mary saw this<br>
woman, she pitied her; where<br>
upon Satan presently left her, and<br>
fled away in the form of a young<br>
man, saying, Wo to me, because<br>
of thee, Mary, and thy son.</p>
<br>
<p>4  So the woman was delivered<br>
from her torment; but considering<br>
herself naked, she blushed,<br>
and avoided seeing any man and<br>
having put on her clothes, went<br>
home, and gave an account of her<br>
case to her father and relations<br>
who, as they were the best of the<br>
city, entertained St. Mary and<br>
Joseph with the greatest respect.</p>
<br>
<p>5  The next morning having<br>
received a sufficient supply of<br>
provisions for the road, they went<br>
from them, and about the evening of<br>
the day arrived at another town,<br>
where a marriage was then about<br>
to be solemnized; but by the arts<br>
of Satan and the practices of a<br>
sorcerers, the bride was become<br>
so dumb, that she could not so<br>
much as open her mouth.</p>
<br>
<p>6  But when this dumb bride<br>
saw the Lady St. Mary entering<br>
into the town, and carrying<br>
Lord Christ in her arms, she<br>
stretched out her hands to the<br>
Lord Christ, and-took him in her<br>
arms, and closely hugging him,<br>
very often kissed him, continually<br>
moving him and, pressing him to<br>
her body.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Straightway the string of her<br>
tongue was loosed, and her ears<br>
were opened, and she began to<br>
sing praises unto God, who had<br>
restored her.</p>
<br>
<p>8  So there was great joy among<br>
the inhabitants of the town that<br>
night, who thought that God and<br>
his angels were come down among<br>
them.</p>
<br>
<p>9  In this place they abode<br>
three days, meeting with the greatest<br>
respect and most splendid entertainment.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And being then furnished by<br>
the people with provisions for the<br>
road, they departed and went to<br>
another city, in which they were<br>
inclined to lodge, because it was a<br>
famous place.</p>
<br>
<p>11  There was in this city a<br>
gentlewoman, who, as she went down<br>
one day to the river to bathe, behold<br>
cursed Satan leaped upon her in the<br>
form of a serpent.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And folded himself about her<br>
belly, and every night lay upon<br>
her.</p>
<br>
<p>13  This woman seeing the Lady<br>
St. Mary, and the Lord Christ the<br>
infant in her bosom, asked the<br>
Lady St. Mary, that she would<br>
give her the child to kiss, and<br>
carry in her arms.</p>
<br>
<p>14  When she had consented,<br>
and as soon as the woman had<br>
moved the child, Satan left her,<br>
and fled away, nor did the woman<br>
ever afterwards see him.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Hereupon all the neighbors<br>
praised the Supreme God, and the<br>
woman reward them with ample,<br>
beneficence.</p>
<br>
<p>16  On the morrow, the same<br>
woman brought perfumed water to<br>
wash the Lord Jesus; and when<br>
she had washed him, she preserved<br>
the water.</p>
<br>
<p>17  And there was a girl there,<br>
whose body was white with a<br>
leprosy, who being sprinkled with<br>
this water, and washed, was<br>
instantly cleansed from her leprosy.</p>
<br>
<p>18  The people therefore said<br>
Without doubt Joseph and Mary,<br>
and that boy are Gods, for they do<br>
not look like mortals.</p>
<br>
<p>19  And when they were making<br>
ready to go away, the girl, who<br>
had been troubled with the leprosy,<br>
came and desired they would<br>
permit her to go along with them;<br>
so they consented and the girl went<br>
with them till they came to a city<br>
in which was the palace of a great<br>
king, and whose house was not far<br>
from the inn.</p>
<br>
<p>20  Here they staid, and when<br>
the girl went one day to the<br>
prince's wife, and found her in a<br>
sorrowful and mournful condition,<br>
she asked her the reason of her<br>
tears.</p>
<br>
<p>21  She replied, wonder not at<br>
my groans, for I am under a great<br>
misfortune, of which I dare not<br>
tell any one.</p>
<br>
<p>22  But, says the, girl, if you<br>
will entrust me with your private<br>
grievance, perhaps I may find you<br>
a remedy for it.</p>
<br>
<p>23  Thou, therefore, says the<br>
prince's wife, shall keep the<br>
secret, and not discover it to<br>
any one alive.</p>
<br>
<p>24  I have been married to this<br>
prince, who  rules as king over<br>
large dominions, and lived long<br>
with him before he had any child<br>
by me.</p>
<br>
<p>25  At length I conceived by<br>
him, but alas! I brought forth a<br>
leprous son; which, when he saw<br>
him would not own to be his, but<br>
said to me,</p>
<br>
<p>26  Either do thou kill him, or<br>
send him to some nurse in such a<br>
place, that he may be never heard<br>
of; and now take care of yourself;<br>
I will never see you more.</p>
<br>
<p>27  So here I pine, lamenting<br>
my wretched and miserable<br>
circumstances. Alas, my son! alas,<br>
my husband; Have I disclosed it<br>
to you?</p>
<br>
<p>28  The girl replied I have found<br>
a remedy for your disease, which<br>
I promise you, for I also was<br>
leprous, but God hath cleansed<br>
me, even he who is called Jesus<br>
the son of the Lady Mary.</p>
<br>
<p>29  The woman inquiring where<br>
that God was, whom she spake<br>
of; the girl answered, He lodges<br>
with you here, in the same house.</p>
<br>
<p>30  But how can this be? says<br>
she; where is he? Behold, replied<br>
the girl, Joseph and Mary; and<br>
the infant who is, with them is<br>
called Jesus; and it is he who<br>
delivered me from my disease and<br>
torment.</p>
<br>
<p>31  But by what means, says she,<br>
were you cleansed from your leprosy?<br>
Will not you tell me that?</p>
<br>
<p>32  Why not? says the girl; I<br>
took the water with which his<br>
body had been washed, and poured<br>
it upon me, and my leprosy<br>
vanished.</p>
<br>
<p>33  The prince's wife then arose<br>
and entertained them, providing a<br>
great feast for Joseph among a<br>
large company of men.</p>
<br>
<p>34  And the next day took<br>
perfumed water to wash the Lord<br>
Jesus, and afterwards  poured the<br>
same water upon her son, whom<br>
she had brought with her, and her<br>
son was instantly cleansed from<br>
his leprosy,</p>
<br>
<p>35  Then she sang thanks and<br>
unto God, and said, Blessed<br>
is the mother that bare thee,<br>
O Jesus!</p>
<br>
<p>36  Dost thou thus cure men of<br>
the same nature with thyself, with<br>
the water with which thy body is<br>
washed?</p>
<br>
<p>37 She then offered very large<br>
gifts to the Lady Mary, and sent<br>
her away with all imaginable<br>
respect.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 A man who could not enjoy his wife, freed from his disorder.<br>
     5 A young man who had been bewitched, and turned into a<br>
     mule miraculously cured by Christ being put on his back,<br>
     28 and is married to the girl who had been cured of leprosy.</p>
<br>
<p>
THEY came afterwards to another<br>
city, and had a mind to lodge there.</p>
<br>
<p>
2  Accordingly they went to a man's<br>
house, who was newly married<br>
but by the influence of sorcerers<br>
could not enjoy his wife.</p>
<br>
<p>3  But they lodging at his house<br>
that night, the man was freed of<br>
his disorder.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And when they were preparing<br>
early in the morning to go forward<br>
on their jouney, the new-married<br>
person hindered them, and<br>
provided a noble entertainment<br>
for them.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But going forward on the<br>
morrow, they came to another<br>
city, and saw three women going<br>
from a certain grave with great<br>
weeping.</p>
<br>
<p>6  When St. Mary saw them, she<br>
spake to the girl who was their<br>
companion, saying, Go and inquire<br>
of them, what is the matter with<br>
them, and what misfortune has<br>
befallen them?</p>
<br>
<p>7  When the girl asked them,<br>
they made her no answer, but<br>
asked her again, Who are ye? and<br>
where are you going? For the day<br>
is far spent, and night is at hand.</p>
<br>
<p>8  We are travellers, saith the<br>
girl, and we are seeking for an inn<br>
to lodge at.</p>
<br>
<p>9  They replied, Go along with<br>
us, and lodge with us.</p>
<br>
<p>10  They then followed them,<br>
and were introduced into a new<br>
house, well furnished with all<br>
sorts of furniture.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Now it was winter-time, and<br>
the girl went into the parlour<br>
where these women were, and<br>
found them weeping and lamenting<br>
as before.</p>
<br>
<p>12  By them stood a mule, covered<br>
over with silk, and an ebony collar<br>
hanging down from his neck, whom<br>
they kissed and were feeding.</p>
<br>
<p>13  But when the girl said, How<br>
handsome, ladies, that mule is!<br>
they replied with tears, and said,<br>
This mule, which you see, was our<br>
brother, born of this same mother<br>
as we;</p>
<br>
<p>14  For when our father died,<br>
and left us a very large estate, and<br>
we had only this brother, and we<br>
endeavoured to procure him a suitable<br>
match, and thought he should<br>
be married as other men, some<br>
giddy and jealous women bewitched<br>
him without our knowledge.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And we one night, a little before<br>
day, while the doors of the house<br>
were all shut fast, saw this our<br>
brother was changed into a mule,<br>
such as you now see him to be:</p>
<br>
<p>16  And we in the melancholy<br>
condition in which you see us,<br>
having no father to comfort us,<br>
have applied to all the wise men,<br>
magicians, and diviners in the<br>
world, but they have been of no<br>
service to us.</p>
<br>
<p>17  As often therefore as we find<br>
ourselves oppressed with grief, we<br>
rise and go with this our mother<br>
to our father's tomb, where, when<br>
we have cried sufficiently, we<br>
return home.</p>
<br>
<p>18  When the girl had heard this<br>
she said, Take courage, and cease<br>
your fears, for you have a remedy<br>
for your afflictions near at hand<br>
even amoung you and in the midst<br>
of your house.</p>
<br>
<p>19  For I was also leprous; but<br>
when I saw this woman, and this<br>
little infant with her, whose name<br>
is Jesus, I sprinkled my body with<br>
the water with which his mother<br>
had washed him and I was<br>
presently made well.</p>
<br>
<p>20  And I am certain that he is<br>
also capable of relieving you under<br>
your distress.  Wherefore arise,<br>
go to my mistress Mary, and when<br>
you have brought her into your<br>
own parlour, disclose to her the<br>
secret, at the same time earnestly<br>
beseeching her to compassionate<br>
your case.</p>
<br>
<p>21  As soon as the women had<br>
heard the girl's discourse, they<br>
hastened away to the Lady St.<br>
Mary, introduced themselves to<br>
her, and sitting down before her,<br>
they wept.</p>
<br>
<p>22  And said, O our Lady St.<br>
Mary, pity your handmaids, for<br>
we have no head of our family, no<br>
one elder than us; no father or<br>
brother to go in or out before us.</p>
<br>
<p>23  But this mule, which you<br>
see, was our brother, which some<br>
women by witchcraft have brought<br>
into this condition which you see:<br>
we therefore entreat you to<br>
compassionate us.</p>
<br>
<p>24  Hereupon St. Mary was<br>
grieved at their case, and taking<br>
the Lord Jesus, put him upon the<br>
back of the mule.</p>
<br>
<p>25  And said to her son, O Jesus<br>
Christ, restore (or heal) according<br>
to thy extraordinary power this<br>
mule, and grant him to have again<br>
the shape of a man and a rational<br>
creature, as he had formerly.</p>
<br>
<p>26  This was scarce said by the<br>
Lady St. Mary, but the mule<br>
immediately passed into a human<br>
form, and became a young man<br>
without any deformity.</p>
<br>
<p>27  Then he and his mother and<br>
the sisters worshipped the Lady<br>
St. Mary, and lifting the child<br>
upon their heads, they kissed him,<br>
and said, Blessed is thy mother,<br>
O Jesus, O Saviour of the world!<br>
Blessed are the eyes which are<br>
so happy to see thee.</p>
<br>
<p>28  Then both the sisters told<br>
their mother, saying, Of a truth,<br>
our brother is restored to his former<br>
shape by the help of the Lord<br>
Jesus Christ, and the kindness<br>
of that girl who told us of Mary<br>
and her son.</p>
<br>
<p>29  And inasmuch as our brother<br>
is unmarried, it is fit that we<br>
marry him to this girl their<br>
servant.</p>
<br>
<p>30  When they had consulted<br>
Mary in this matter, and she had<br>
given her consent, they made a<br>
splendid wedding for this girl.</p>
<br>
<p>31  And so their sorrow being<br>
turned into gladness, and their<br>
mourning into mirth, they began<br>
to rejoice, and to make merry,<br>
and sing, being dressed in their<br>
richest attire, with bracelets.</p>
<br>
<p>32  Afterwards they glorified and<br>
praised God, saying, O Jesus, son<br>
of David, who changest sorrow<br>
into gladness, and mourning into<br>
mirth!</p>
<br>
<p>33  After this Joseph and Mary<br>
tarried there ten days, then went<br>
away, having received great<br>
respect from these people.</p>
<br>
<p>34  Who, when they took their<br>
leave of them, and returned home,<br>
cried,</p>
<br>
<p>35  But especially the girl.</p>

<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Joseph and Mary pass through a country infested by robbers.<br>
     3 Titus a humane thief, offers Dumachus, his comrade,<br>
     forty groats to let Joseph and Mary pass unmolested.<br>
     6 Jesus prophecies that the thieves Dumachus and Titus shall be<br>
     crucified with him and that Titus shall go before him into paradise.<br>
     10 Christ causes a well to spring from a sycamore tree, and Mary<br>
     washes his coat in it.<br>
     11 A balsam grows there from his sweat.  They go to Memphis, where<br>
     Christ works more miracles. Return to Judea.<br>
     15 Being warned, depart for Nazareth.</p>
<br>
<p>
IN their journey from hence they<br>
came into a desert country and<br>
were told it was infested with<br>
robbers; so Joseph and St. Mary<br>
prepared to pass through it in the<br>
night.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And as they were going along,<br>
behold they saw two robbers asleep<br>
in the road, and with them a great<br>
number of robbers, who were their<br>
confederates, also asleep.</p>
<br>
<p>3  The names of these two were<br>
Titus and Dumachus; and Titus<br>
said to Dumachus, I beseech thee<br>
let these persons go along quietly,<br>
that our company may not perceive<br>
anything of them.</p>
<br>
<p>4  But Damachus refusing, Titus<br>
again said, I will give thee forty<br>
groats, and as a pledge take my<br>
girdle, which he gave him before<br>
he had done speaking, that he<br>
might not open his mouth or make<br>
a noise.</p>
<br>
<p>5  When the Lady St. Mary saw<br>
the kindness which this robber did<br>
shew them, she said to him, The<br>
Lord God will receive thee to his<br>
right hand and grant thee pardon<br>
of thy sins.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Then the Lord Jesus answered,<br>
and said to his mother, When<br>
thirty years are expired, O mother,<br>
the Jews will crucify me at<br>
Jerusalem;</p>
<br>
<p>7  And these two thieves shall<br>
be with me at the same time upon<br>
the cross, Titus on my right hand,<br>
and Dumachus on my left, and<br>
from that time Titus shall go before<br>
me into paradise;</p>
<br>
<p>8  And when she had said, God<br>
forbid this should be thy lot, O<br>
my son, they went on to a city in<br>
which were several idols; which,<br>
as soon as they came near to it,<br>
was turned into hills of sand.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Hence they  went to that<br>
sycamore tree, which is now called<br>
Matarea.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And in Materea the Lord<br>
Jesus caused a well to spring<br>
forth, in which St. Mary washed<br>
his coat;</p>
<br>
<p>11  And a balsam is produced,<br>
or grows, in that country, from<br>
the sweat which ran down there<br>
from the Lord Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Thence they proceeded to<br>
Memphis, and saw Pharoah, and<br>
abode three years in Egypt.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And the Lord Jesus did very<br>
many miracles, in Egypt, which<br>
are neither to be found in<br>
Gospel of the Infancy nor in the<br>
Gospel of Perfection.</p>
<br>
<p>14  At the end of three years<br>
he returned out of Egypt, and<br>
when he came near to Judea,<br>
Joseph was afraid to enter;</p>
<br>
<p>15  For hearing that Herod was<br>
dead, and that Archelaus his son<br>
reigned in his stead, he was afraid.</p>
<br>
<p>16  And when he went to Judea,<br>
an, angel of God appeard to<br>
him, and said, O Joseph go<br>
into the city of Nazareth, and<br>
abide there.</p>
<br>
<p>17  It is strange indeed, that he,<br>
who is the Lord of all countries,<br>
should be thus carried backward and<br>
forward, through so many countries.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>
<br>
<p>2 Two sick children cured by water<br>
wherein Christ was washed.</p>
<br>
<p>WHEN they came afterwards<br>
into the city of Bethlehem,<br>
they found there several very<br>
desperate distempers, which became<br>
so troublesome to children by seeing<br>
them, that most of them died.</p>
<br>
<p>2  There was there a woman who<br>
had a sick son, whom she brought,<br>
when he was at the point of death,<br>
to the Lady St. Mary, who saw<br>
her when she was washing Jesus<br>
Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Then said the woman, O my<br>
Lady Mary, look down upon this<br>
my son, who is afflicted with most<br>
dreadful pains.</p>
<br>
<p>4  St. Mary hearing her, said,<br>
Take a little of that water with<br>
which I have washed my son, and<br>
sprinkle it upon him.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Then she took a little of that<br>
water, as St. Mary had commanded,<br>
and sprinkled it upon her son,<br>
who being wearied with his violent<br>
pains, was fallen asleep; and after<br>
he had slept a little, awaked<br>
perfectly well and recovered.</p>
<br>
<p>6  The mother being abundantly<br>
glad of this success, went again to<br>
St. Mary, and St. Mary said to<br>
her, Give praise to God, who hath<br>
cured this thy son.</p>
<br>
<p>7  There was in the same place<br>
another woman, a neighbour of<br>
her, whose son was now cured.</p>
<br>
<p>8  This woman's son was afflicted<br>
with the same disease, and his eyes<br>
were now almost quite shut, and<br>
she was lamenting for him day<br>
and night.</p>
<br>
<p>9  The mother of the child which<br>
was cured, said to her, Why do<br>
you not bring your son to St. Mary,<br>
as I brought my son to her, when<br>
he was in the agonies of death;<br>
and he was cure by that water,<br>
with which the body of her son<br>
Jesus was washed?</p>
<br>
<p>10  When the woman heard her<br>
say this, she also went, and having<br>
procured the same water, washed<br>
her son with it, whereupon his<br>
body and his eyes were instantly<br>
restored to their former state.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And when she brought her<br>
son to St. Mary, and opened his<br>
case to her, she commanded her to<br>
give thanks to God for the recovery<br>
of her son's health, and tell<br>
no one what had happened.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER X.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Two wives of one man, each have a son sick.<br>
     2 One of them named Mary, and whose son's name was Caleb,<br>
     presents the Virgin with a handsome carpet, and Caleb is cured;<br>
     but the son of the other wife dies,<br>
     4 which occasions a difference between the women.<br>
     5 The other wife puts Caleb into a hot oven, and he is<br>
     miraculously preserved,<br>
     9 she afterwards throws him into a well,<br>
     and he is again preserved;<br>
     11 his mother appeals to the Virgin against the other wife,<br>
     12 whose downfall the Virgin prophecies,<br>
     13 and who accordingly falls into the well,<br>
     14 therein fulfilling a saying of old.</p>
<br>
<p>THERE were in the same city<br>
two wives of one man, who<br>
had each a son sick. One of them<br>
was called Mary, and her son's<br>
name was Caleb.</p>
<br>
<p>2  She arose, and taking her son,<br>
went to the Lady St. Mary, the<br>
mother of Jesus, and offered her a<br>
very handsome carpet, saying, O<br>
my Lady Mary accept this carpet<br>
of me, and instead of it give me a<br>
small swaddling cloth.</p>
<br>
<p>3  To this Mary agreed, and<br>
when the mother of Caleb was<br>
gone, she made a coat for her son<br>
of the swaddling cloth, put it on<br>
him, and his disease was cured;<br>
but the son of the other wife died.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Hereupon there arose between<br>
them a difference in doing<br>
the business of the family by turns,<br>
each her week;</p>
<br>
<p>5  And when the turn of Mary<br>
the mother of Caleb came, and she<br>
was heating the oven to bake<br>
bread, and went away to fetch the<br>
meal, she left her son Caleb by the<br>
oven;</p>
<br>
<p>6  Whom the other wife, her<br>
rival, seeing to be by himself,<br>
took and cast him into the oven,<br>
which was very hot, and then went<br>
away.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Mary on her return saw her<br>
son Caleb lying in the middle of<br>
the oven laughing, and the oven<br>
quite as cold as though it had not<br>
been before heated, and knew that<br>
her rival the other wife had thrown<br>
him into the fire.</p>
<br>
<p>8  When she took him out, she<br>
brought him to the Lady St. Mary,<br>
and told her the story, to whom<br>
she replied, Be quiet, I am<br>
concerned lest thou shouldest make<br>
this matter known.</p>
<br>
<p>9  After this her rival, the other<br>
wife, as she was drawing water at<br>
the well, and saw Caleb playing<br>
by the well, and that no one was<br>
near, took him, and threw him<br>
into the well.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And when some men came to<br>
fetch water from the well, they<br>
saw the boy sitting on the<br>
superficies of the water, and<br>
drew him out with ropes, and were<br>
exceedingly surprised at the child,<br>
and praised God.</p>
<br>
<p>11 Then came the mother and<br>
took him and carried him to the<br>
Lady St. Mary, lamenting. and<br>
saying, O my Lady, see what my<br>
rival hath done to my son, and<br>
how she hath cast him into the<br>
well, and I do not question but<br>
one time or other she will be the<br>
occasion of his death.</p>
<br>
<p>12  St. Mary replied to her, God<br>
will vindicate your injured cause.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Accordingly a few days after,<br>
when the other wife came to the<br>
well to draw water, her foot was<br>
entangled in the rope, so that she<br>
fell headlong into the well, and<br>
they who ran to her assistance<br>
found her skull broken, and bones<br>
bruised.</p>
<br>
<p>14 So she came to a bad end,<br>
and in her was fulfilled that saying<br>
of the author, They digged a well,<br>
and made it deep, but fell themselves<br>
into the pit which they prepared.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Bartholomew, when a child and sick, miraculously<br>
     restored by being laid on Christ's bed.</p>
<br>
<p>ANOTHER woman in that city<br>
had. likewise two son's sick.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And when one was dead, the<br>
other, who lay at the point of<br>
death, she took in her arms to the<br>
Lady St. Mary, and in a flood of<br>
tears addressed herself to her,<br>
saying,</p>
<br>
<p>3  O my Lady, help and relieve<br>
me; for I had two sons, the one I<br>
have just now buried, the other I<br>
see is fast at the point of death<br>
behold how I (earnestly) seek for<br>
your from God, and pray to him.</p>
<br>
<p>4 Then she said, O Lord, thou<br>
art gracious, and merciful, and<br>
kind; thou, hast given me two<br>
sons; one of them thou halt taken<br>
to thyself, O spare me this other.</p>
<br>
<p>5  St. Mary then perceiving the<br>
greatness of her sorrow, pitied her<br>
and said, Do thou place thy son in<br>
my son's bed, and cover him with<br>
his clothes.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And when she had placed him<br>
in the bed wherein Christ lay,<br>
at the moment when his eyes were<br>
just closed by death; as soon as<br>
ever the small of the garments of<br>
the Lord Jesus Christ reached the<br>
boy, his eyes were opened, and<br>
calling with a loud voice to his<br>
mother, he asked for bread, and<br>
when he had received it, he sucked<br>
it.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Than his mother said, O Lady<br>
Mary, now I am assured that the<br>
powers of God do dwell in you, so<br>
that thy son can cure children who<br>
are of the same sort as himself, as<br>
soon as they touch his garments.</p>
<br>
<p>8 This boy, who was thus cured,<br>
is the same who in the Gospel is<br>
called Bartholomew.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>
<br>
<p>       A leprous woman healed by Christ's washing water.<br>
     7 A princess healed by it and restored to her husband.</p>
<br>
<p>
AGAIN, there was a leprous<br>
woman who went to the Lady<br>
St. Mary, the mother of Jesus,<br>
and said, O my Lady, help me.</p>
<br>
<p>2  St. Mary replied, What help<br>
does thou desire? Is it gold or<br>
silver, or that thy body be cured<br>
of its leprosy?</p>
<br>
<p>3  Who, says the woman, can<br>
grant me this?</p>
<br>
<p>4  St. Mary replied to her, Wait<br>
a little till I have washed my son<br>
Jesus, and put him to bed.</p>
<br>
<p>5  The woman waited, as she<br>
was commanded; and Mary when<br>
she had put Jesus in bed, giving<br>
her the water with which she had<br>
washed his body, said, Take some<br>
of the water, and pour it upon thy<br>
body;</p>
<br>
<p>6  Which when she had done,<br>
she instantly became clean, and<br>
praised God, and gave thanks to<br>
him.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Then she went away, after<br>
she had abode with her three<br>
days;</p>
<br>
<p>8  And going into the city, she<br>
saw a certain prince, who had<br>
married another princes daughter;</p>
<br>
<p>9  But when he came to see her,<br>
he perceived between her eyes the<br>
signs of leprosy like a star, and<br>
thereupon declared the marriage<br>
dissolved and void.</p>
<br>
<p>10  When the woman saw these<br>
persons in this condition, exceeding<br>
sorrowful, and shedding abundance<br>
of tears, she inquired of them<br>
the reason of their crying;</p>
<br>
<p>11  They replied, inquire not<br>
into our circumstances; for we<br>
are not able to declare our<br>
misfortunes to any, person,<br>
whatsoever.</p>
<br>
<p>12  But she still pressed and<br>
desired them to communicate their<br>
case to her; intimating, that she<br>
might be able to direct them<br>
to a remedy.</p>
<br>
<p>13  So when they showed the young<br>
woman to her, and the signs<br>
of the leprosy, which appeared<br>
between her eyes;</p>
<br>
<p>14  She said, I also whom ye<br>
see in this place, was afflicted<br>
with the same distemper, and going<br>
on some business to Bethlehem, I<br>
went into a certain cave, and saw<br>
a woman named Mary, who had a<br>
son called Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>15  She seeing me to be leprous,<br>
was concerned for me, and gave<br>
me some water with which she<br>
had washed her son's body, with<br>
that I sprinkled my body, and<br>
became clean.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Then said these women, Will<br>
you Mistress, go along with us,<br>
and show the Lady St. Mary to<br>
us?</p>
<br>
<p>17  To which she consenting,<br>
they arose and went to the Lady<br>
St. Mary, taking with them very<br>
noble presents.</p>
<br>
<p>18  And when they came in and<br>
offered their presents to her,<br>
they showed the leprous young woman<br>
whom they brought with them to<br>
her.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Then said St. Mary, The<br>
mercy of the Lord Jesus Christ<br>
rest upon you;</p>
<br>
<p>20  And giving them a little of<br>
that water, with which she had<br>
washed the body of Jesus Christ,<br>
she bade them wash the diseased<br>
person with it, which when they<br>
had done, she was presently<br>
cured;</p>
<br>
<p>21 So they, and all who were<br>
present, praised God; and being<br>
filled with joy, they went back to<br>
their own city, and gave praises to<br>
God on that account.</p>
<br>
<p>22  Then the prince hearing that<br>
his wife was cured, took her home<br>
and made a second marriage, giving<br>
thanks unto God for the recovery<br>
of his wife's health.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 A girl, whose blood Satan sucked receives one<br>
     of Christ's swaddling clothes from the Virgin,<br>
     14 Satan comes like a dragon, and she shews it to him;<br>
     flames and burning coals proceed from it and fall upon him;<br>
     19 he is miraculously discomfited, and leaves the girl.</p>
<br>
<p>THERE was also a girl, who<br>
was afflicted by Satan,</p>
<br>
<p>2  For that cursed spirit did<br>
frequently appear to her in the shape<br>
of a dragon, and was inclined to<br>
swallow her up, and had so sucked<br>
out all her blood, that she looked<br>
like a dead carcass.</p>
<br>
<p>3  As often as she came to herself,<br>
with her hands wringed about<br>
her head she would cry out, and<br>
say, Wo, Wo is me, that there is<br>
no one to be found, who can deliver<br>
me from that impious dragon!</p>
<br>
<p>4  Her father and mother, and<br>
all who were about her and saw<br>
her, mourned and wept over her;</p>
<br>
<p>5  And all who were present<br>
would especially be under sorrow<br>
and in tears, when they heard her<br>
bewailing and saying, My brethren<br>
and friends, is here no one who can<br>
deliver me from this murderer?</p>
<br>
<p>6  Then the prince's daughter,<br>
who had been cured of her leprosy,<br>
hearing the complaint of that girl,<br>
went upon the top of her castle,<br>
and saw her with her hands twisted<br>
about her head, pouring out a flood<br>
of tears, and all the people that<br>
were about her in tears.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Then she asked the husband<br>
of the possessed person, Whether<br>
his wife's mother was alive? He<br>
told her, That her father and<br>
mother were both alive,</p>
<br>
<p>8  Then she ordered her mother<br>
to be sent to her; to whom, when<br>
she saw her coming, she said,<br>
Is this possessed girl thy daughter?<br>
She moaning and bewailing said,<br>
Yes madam I bore her.</p>
<br>
<p>9  The prince's daughter answered,<br>
Disclose the secret of her case to me,<br>
for I confess to you that I was leprous,<br>
but the Lady Mary, the mother of<br>
Jesus Christ, healed me.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And if you desire your<br>
daughter to be restored to her<br>
former state, take her to Bethlehem,<br>
and inquire for Mary the mother<br>
of Jesus, and doubt not but your<br>
daughter will be cured; for I do<br>
not question but you will come<br>
home with great joy at your<br>
daughter's recovery.</p>
<br>
<p>11  As soon as ever she had done<br>
speaking, she arose and went with<br>
her daughter to the place appointed,<br>
and to Mary, and told her the case<br>
of her daughter.</p>
<br>
<p>12  When St. Mary had heard<br>
her story, she gave her a little<br>
of the water with which she had<br>
washed the body of her son Jesus,<br>
and bade her pour it upon the<br>
body of her daughter.</p>
<br>
<p>13 Likewise she gave her one of<br>
the swaddling cloths of the Lord<br>
Jesus, and said, Take this swaddling<br>
cloth, and shew it to thine<br>
enemy as often as thou seest him<br>
and she sent them away in<br>
peace.</p>
<br>
<p>14  After they bad left that<br>
city and returned home, and the<br>
time was come in which Satan was<br>
wont to seize her, in the same<br>
moment this cursed spirit appeared<br>
to her in the shape of a huge<br>
dragon, and the girl seeing him<br>
was afraid,</p>
<br>
<p>15  The mother said to her, Be<br>
not afraid, daughter; let him alone<br>
till he come nearer to thee! then<br>
shew him the swaddling cloth,<br>
which the Lady Mary gave us, and<br>
we shall see the event.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Satan then coming like a<br>
dreadful dragon, the body of the<br>
girl trembled for fear.</p>
<br>
<p>17  But as soon as she had put<br>
the swaddling cloth upon her<br>
head, and about her eyes, and<br>
chewed it to him, presently there<br>
issued forth from the swaddling<br>
cloth flames and burning coals,<br>
and fell upon the dragon.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Oh! how great a miracle was<br>
this, which was done: as soon as<br>
the dragon saw the swaddling<br>
cloth of the Lord Jesus, fire went<br>
forth and was scattered upon his<br>
head and eyes; so that he cried<br>
out with a loud voice, What have<br>
I to do with thee, Jesus, thou son<br>
of Mary? Whither shall I flee<br>
from thee?</p>
<br>
<p>19 So he drew back much<br>
affrighted, and left the girl.</p>
<br>
<p>20 And she was delivered from<br>
this trouble, and sang praises and<br>
thanks to God, and with her all<br>
who were present at the working<br>
of the miracle.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Judas when a boy possessed by Satan, and brought up<br>
     by his parents to Jesus to be cured, whom he tries to bite,<br>
     7 but failing, strikes Jesus and makes him cry out.<br>
     Whereupon Satan goes from Jesus in the shape of a dog.</p>
<br>
<p>ANOTHER woman likewise<br>
lived there, whose son was<br>
possessed by Satan,</p>
<br>
<p>2  This boy, named Judas, as<br>
often as Satan seized him, was<br>
inclined to bite all that were<br>
present; and if he found no one else<br>
near him, he would bite his own<br>
hands and other parts.</p>
<br>
<p>3  But the mother of this miserable<br>
boy, hearing of St. Mary and her son<br>
Jesus, arose presently and taking<br>
her son in her arms, brought him<br>
to the Lady Mary.</p>
<br>
<p>4  In the meantime, James and<br>
Joses had taken away the infant,<br>
the Lord Jesus, to play at a proper<br>
season with other children;<br>
and when they went forth, they<br>
sat down and the Lord Jesus with<br>
them.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Then Judas, who was possessed,<br>
came and sat down at the right hand<br>
of Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>6  When Satan was acting upon him<br>
as usual, he went about to bite<br>
the Lord Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And because he could not do<br>
it, he struck Jesus on the right<br>
side, so that he cried out.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And in the same moment Satan<br>
went out of the boy, and ran<br>
away like a mad dog.</p>
<br>
<p>9  This same boy who struck<br>
Jesus, and out of whom Satan went<br>
in the form of a dog, was Judas<br>
Iscariot, who betrayed him to the<br>
Jews.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And that same side, on which<br>
Judas: struck him, the Jews<br>
pierced with a spear.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Jesus and other boys play together,<br>
     and make clay figures of animals.<br>
     4 Jesus causes them to walk,<br>
     6 also makes clay birds, which he causes to fly,<br>
     and eat and drink.<br>
     7 The children's parents alarmed,<br>
     and take Jesus for a sorcerer.<br>
     8 He goes to a dyer's shop, and throws all the<br>
     cloths into the furnace, and works a miracle therewith.<br>
     15 Whereupon the Jews praise God.</p>
<br>
<p>AND when the Lord Jesus was<br>
seven years of age, he was<br>
on a certain day with other boys<br>
his companions about the same<br>
age;</p>
<br>
<p>2  Who, when they were at play,<br>
made clay into several shapes,<br>
namely-asses, oxen, birds, and<br>
other figures;</p>
<br>
<p>3  Each boasting of his work,<br>
and endeavouring to exceed the<br>
rest.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Then the Lord Jesus said to<br>
the boys, I will command these<br>
figures which I have made to<br>
walk.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And immediately they moved,<br>
and when he commanded them to<br>
return, they returned.</p>
<br>
<p>6  He had also made the figures<br>
of birds and sparrows, which,<br>
when he commanded to fly, did<br>
fly, and when he commanded to<br>
stand still, did stand still; and if<br>
he gave them meat and drink, they<br>
did eat and drink.</p>
<br>
<p>7  When at length the boys went<br>
away, and related these things to<br>
their parents, their fathers said to<br>
them, Take heed, children, for the<br>
future of his company, for he is a<br>
sorcerer; shun and avoid him, and<br>
from henceforth never play with<br>
him.</p>
<br>
<p>8  On a certain day also, when<br>
the Lord Jesus was playing with<br>
the boys, and running about, he<br>
passed by a dyer's shop, whose<br>
name was Salem.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And there were in his shop<br>
many pieces of cloth belonging to<br>
the people of that city, which they<br>
designed to dye of several colours.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Then the Lord Jesus going<br>
into the dyer's shop, took all the<br>
cloths, and threw them into the<br>
furnace.</p>
<br>
<p>11  When Salem came home, and<br>
saw the cloths spoiled, he began to<br>
make a great noise, and to chide<br>
the Lord Jesus, saying,</p>
<br>
<p>12  What hast thou done to me,<br>
O thou son of Mary? Thou hast<br>
injured both me and my neighbours;<br>
they all desired their cloths<br>
of a proper colour; but thou hast<br>
come and spoiled them all.</p>
<br>
<p>13  The Lord Jesus replied, I<br>
will change the colour of every<br>
cloth to what colour thou desirest.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And then he presently began<br>
to take the cloths out of the furnace,<br>
and they were all dyed of those same<br>
colours which the dyer desired.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And when the Jews saw this<br>
surprising miracle, they praised<br>
God.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAP. XVI.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Christ miraculously widens or contracts the gates,<br>
     milk pails, sieves, or boxes, not properly made by Joseph,<br>
     4 he not being skilful at his carpenter's trade.<br>
     5 The King of Jerusalem gives Joseph an order for a throne.<br>
     6 Joseph works on it for two years in the king's palace,<br>
     and makes it two spans too short. The king being angry with him,<br>
     10 Jesus comforts him,<br>
     13 commands him to pull one side of the throne, while he<br>
     pulls the other, and brings it to its proper dimensions.<br>
     14 Whereupon the bystanders praise God.</p>
<br>
<p>AND Joseph, wheresoever he<br>
went in the city, took the<br>
Lord Jesus with him, where he<br>
was sent for to work to make<br>
gates, or milk-pails, or sieves, or<br>
boxes; the Lord Jesus was with<br>
him, wheresoever be went.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And as often as Joseph had<br>
anything in his work, to make<br>
longer, or shorter, or wider, or<br>
narrower, the Lord Jesus would<br>
stretch his hand towards it.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And presently it became as<br>
Joseph would have it:</p>
<br>
<p>4  So that he had no need to<br>
finish anything with his own hands,<br>
for he was not very skilful at his<br>
carpenter's trade.</p>
<br>
<p>5  On a certain time the King<br>
of Jerusalem sent for him, and<br>
said, I would have thee make me<br>
a throne of the same dimensions<br>
with that place in which I<br>
commonly sit.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Joseph obeyed, and forthwith<br>
began the work, and continued two<br>
years in the king's palace before<br>
he finished it.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And when he came to fix it<br>
in its place, he found it wanted<br>
two spans on each side of the<br>
appointed messure.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Which when the king saw,<br>
he was very angry with Joseph;</p>
<br>
<p>9  And Joseph afraid of the<br>
king's anger, went to bed without<br>
his supper, taking not any thing<br>
to eat.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Then the Lord Jesus asked<br>
him, What he was afraid of?</p>
<br>
<p>11  Joseph replied, Because I<br>
have lost my labour in the work<br>
which I have been about these two<br>
years.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Jesus said to him, Fear not,<br>
neither be cast down;</p>
<br>
<p>13  Do thou lay hold on one side<br>
of the throne, and I will the other,<br>
and we will bring it to its just<br>
dimensions.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And when Joseph had done<br>
as the Lord Jesus said, and each<br>
of them had with strength drawn<br>
his side, the throne obeyed, and<br>
was brought to the proper<br>
dimensions of the place:</p>
<br>
<p>15 Which miracle when they<br>
who stood by saw, they were<br>
astonished, and praised God.</p>
<br>
<p>16 The throne was made of the<br>
same wood which was in being<br>
in Solomon's time, namely, wood<br>
adorned with various shapes, and<br>
figures.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAP. XVII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Jesus plays with boys at hide and seek.<br>
     3 Some women put his playfellows in a furnace,<br>
     7 where they are transformed by Jesus into kids.<br>
     10 Jesus calls them to go and play, and they<br>
     are restored to their former shape.</p>
<br>
<p>ON another day the Lord Jesus<br>
going out into the street,<br>
and seeing some boys who were<br>
met to play, joined himself to their<br>
company.</p>
<br>
<p>2 But when they saw him, they<br>
hid themselves, and left him to<br>
seek for them;</p>
<br>
<p>3 The Lord Jesus came to the<br>
gate of a certain house, and asked<br>
some women who were standing<br>
there, Where the boys were gone?</p>
<br>
<p>4 And when they answered,<br>
That there was no one there; the<br>
Lord Jesus said, Who are those<br>
whom ye see in the furnace?</p>
<br>
<p>5 They answered, They were<br>
kids of three years old.</p>
<br>
<p>6 Then Jesus cried out aloud,<br>
and said, Come out hither, O ye<br>
kids, to your shepherd;</p>
<br>
<p>7 And presently the boys came<br>
forth like kids, and leaped about<br>
him; which when the women saw,<br>
they were exceedingly amazed, and<br>
trembled,</p>
<br>
<p>8 Then they immediately worshipped,<br>
the Lord Jesus, and beseeched him,<br>
saying, O our Lord Jesus, son of<br>
Mary, thou art truly that good<br>
shepherd of Israel! have mercy<br>
on thy handmaids, who stand before<br>
thee, who do not doubt, but that<br>
thou, O Lord, art come to save,<br>
and not to destroy.</p>
<br>
<p>9  After that, when the Lord<br>
Jesus said, the children of Israel<br>
are like Ethiopians among the<br>
people; the women said, Thou,<br>
Lord, knowest all things, nor is<br>
any thing concealed from thee:<br>
but now we entreat thee, and<br>
beseech of thy mercy, that thou<br>
wouldest restore those boys to<br>
their former state.</p>
<br>
<p>10 Then Jesus said, Come hither,<br>
O boys, that we may go and<br>
play; and immediately, in the<br>
presence of these women, the kids<br>
were changed, and returned into<br>
the shape of boys.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Jesus becomes the king of his playfellows,<br>
     and they crown him with flowers;<br>
     4 miraculously causes a serpent who had<br>
     bitten Simon the Cananite, then a boy,<br>
     to suck out all the poison again;<br>
     16 the serpent bursts, and Christ restores the boy to health.</p>
<br>
<p>
IN the month Adar Jesus<br>
gathered together the boys, and<br>
ranked them as though he had<br>
been a king.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For they spread their garments<br>
on the ground for him to sit<br>
on; and having made a crown of<br>
flowers, put it upon his head, and<br>
stood on his right and left as the<br>
guards of a king.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And if any one happened to<br>
pass by, they took him by force,<br>
and said, Come hither, and worship<br>
the king, that you may have a<br>
prosperous journey.</p>
<br>
<p>4  In the mean time, while<br>
these things were doing, there<br>
came certain men, carrying a boy<br>
upon a couch;</p>
<br>
<p>5  For this boy having gone with<br>
his companions to the mountain to<br>
gather wood, and having found<br>
there a partridge's nest, and put<br>
his hand in to take out the eggs,<br>
was stung by a poisonous serpent,<br>
which leaped out of the nest; so<br>
that he was forced to cry out for<br>
the help of his companions; who,<br>
when they came, found him lying<br>
upon the earth like a dead person.</p>
<br>
<p>6  After which his neighbours<br>
came and carried him back into<br>
the city.</p>
<br>
<p>7  But when they came to the<br>
place where the Lord Jesus, was<br>
sitting like a king, and the other<br>
boys stood around him like his<br>
ministers, the boys made haste to<br>
meet him, who was bitten by the<br>
serpent, and said to his neighbours,<br>
Come and pay your respects to the<br>
king;</p>
<br>
<p>8  But when, by reason of their<br>
sorrow, they refused to come, the<br>
boys drew them, and forced them<br>
against their wills to come.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And when they came to the<br>
Lord Jesus, he inquired, On what<br>
account they carried that boy?</p>
<br>
<p>10  And when they answered that<br>
a serpent had bitten him, the Lord<br>
Jesus said to the boys, Let us go<br>
and kill that serpent.</p>
<br>
<p>11  But when the parents of the<br>
boy desired to be excused, because<br>
their son lay at the point of death;<br>
the boys made answer, and said,<br>
Did not ye hear what the king<br>
said? Let us go and kill the serpent;<br>
and will not ye obey him?</p>
<br>
<p>12  So they brought the couch<br>
back again, whether they would<br>
or not.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And when they were come to<br>
the nest, the Lord Jesus said to<br>
the boys, Is this the serpent's<br>
lurking place? They said, It was.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Then the Lord Jesus calling<br>
the serpent, it presently came forth<br>
and submitted to him; to whom he<br>
said, Go and suck out all the poison<br>
which thou hast infused into that<br>
boy:</p>
<br>
<p>15  So the serpent crept to the<br>
boy, and took away all its poison<br>
again.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Then the Lord Jesus cursed<br>
the serpent, so that it immediately<br>
burst asunder, and died;</p>
<br>
<p>17  And he touched the boy with<br>
his hand to restore him to his<br>
former health;</p>
<br>
<p>18  And when he began to cry,<br>
the Lord Jesus said, Cease crying<br>
for hereafter thou shale be my<br>
disciple;</p>
<br>
<p>19 And this is that Simon the<br>
Canaanite, who is mentioned in<br>
the Gospel.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 James being bitten by a viper,<br>
     Jesus blows on the wound and cures him.<br>
     4 Jesus charged with throwing a boy from<br>
     the roof of, a house,<br>
     10 miraculously raises the dead boy to acquit him;<br>
     12 fetches water for his mother, breaks the pitcher<br>
     and miraculously gathers the water in his mantle<br>
     and brings it home;<br>
     16 makes fish pools on the Sabbath,<br>
     20 causes a boy to die who broke them down,<br>
     22 another boy runs against him,<br>
     whom he also causes to die.</p>
<br>
<p>ON another day Joseph sent his<br>
son James to gather wood,<br>
and the Lord Jesus went with<br>
him;</p>
<br>
<p>2  And when they came to the<br>
place where the wood was, and<br>
James began to gather it, behold,<br>
a venemous viper bit him, so that<br>
he began to cry, and make a<br>
noise.</p>
<br>
<p>3  The Lord Jesus seeing him in<br>
this condition, came to him, and<br>
blowed upon the place where the<br>
viper had bit him, and it was<br>
instantly well.</p>
<br>
<p>4  On a certain day the Lord<br>
Jesus was with some boys, who<br>
were playing on the house-top,<br>
and one of the boys fell down, and<br>
presently died.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Upon which the other boys all<br>
running away, the Lord Jesus was<br>
left alone on the house-top.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And the boy's relations came<br>
to him and said to the Lord Jesus,<br>
Thou didst throw our son down<br>
from the house-top.</p>
<br>
<p>7  But he denying it, they cried<br>
out, Our son is dead, and this is<br>
he who killed him.</p>
<br>
<p>8  The Lord Jesus replied to<br>
them, Do not charge me with a<br>
crime of which you are not able to<br>
convict me, but let us go and ask<br>
the boy himself, who will bring<br>
the truth to light.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Then the Lord Jesus going<br>
down stood over the head of the<br>
dead boy, and said with a loud<br>
voice, Zeinunus, Zeinunus, who<br>
threw thee down from the housetop?</p>
<br>
<p>10  Then the dead boy answered,<br>
thou didst not throw me down,<br>
but such a one did.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And when the Lord Jesus<br>
bade those who stood by to take<br>
present praised God on account<br>
of that miracle.</p>
<br>
<p>12  On a certain time the<br>
Lady St. Mary had commanded<br>
the Lord Jesus to fetch her some<br>
water out of the well;</p>
<br>
<p>13  And when he had gone to<br>
fetch the water, the pitcher, when<br>
it was brought up full, brake;</p>
<br>
<p>14  But Jesus spreading his mantle<br>
gathered up the water again,<br>
and brought it in that to his<br>
mother;</p>
<br>
<p>15  Who, being astonished at<br>
this wonderful thing, laid up this,<br>
and all the other things which she<br>
had seen, in her memory.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Again on another day the<br>
Lord Jesus was with some boys<br>
by a river, and they drew water<br>
out of the river by little channels,<br>
and made little fish-pools.</p>
<br>
<p>17  But the Lord Jesus had<br>
made twelve sparrows, and placed<br>
them about his pool on each side,<br>
three on a side.</p>
<br>
<p>18  But it was the Sabbath day,<br>
and the son of Hanani a Jew came<br>
by, and saw them making these<br>
things, and said, Do ye thus make<br>
figures of clay on the Sabbath?<br>
And he ran to them, and broke<br>
down their fish-pools.</p>
<br>
<p>19  But when the Lord Jesus<br>
clapped his hands over the sparrows<br>
which he had made, they fled away<br>
chirping.</p>
<br>
<p>20  At length the son of Hanani<br>
coming to the fish-pool of Jesus<br>
to destroy it, the water vanished<br>
away, and the Lord Jesus said to<br>
him,</p>
<br>
<p>21  In like manner as this water<br>
had vanished, so shall thy life<br>
vanish; and presently the boy<br>
died.</p>
<br>
<p>22  Another time, when the<br>
Lord Jesus was coming home in<br>
the evening with Joseph, he met<br>
a boy, who ran so hard against<br>
him, that he threw him down;</p>
<br>
<p>23  To whom the Lord Jesus<br>
said, As thou hast thrown me<br>
down, so shalt thou fall, nor ever<br>
rise.</p>
<br>
<p>24 And that moment the boy<br>
fell down and died.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>
<br>
<p>     4 Christ sent to school to Zaccheus to learn<br>
     his letters, and teaches Zaccheus.<br>
     13 Sent to another schoolmaster,<br>
     14 refuses to tell his letters, and the schoolmaster<br>
     going to whip him, his hand withers and he dies.</p>
<br>
<p>THERE was also at Jerusalem<br>
one named Zaccheus, who<br>
was a schoolmaster:</p>
<br>
<p>2  And he said to Joseph, Joseph,<br>
why dost thou not send Jesus to me,<br>
that he may learn his letters?</p>
<br>
<p>3  Joseph agreed, and told St. Mary;</p>
<br>
<p>4  So they brought him to that<br>
master; who, as soon as he saw<br>
him, wrote out an alphabet for him,</p>
<br>
<p>5  And he bade him say Aleph;<br>
and when he had said Aleph, the<br>
master bade him pronounce Beth.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Then the Lord Jesus said to<br>
him, Tell me first the meaning of<br>
the letter Aleph, and then I will<br>
pronounce Beth.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And when the master threatened<br>
to whip him, the Lord Jesus<br>
explained to him the meaning of<br>
the letters Aleph and Beth;</p>
<br>
<p>8  Also which were the straight<br>
figures of the letters, which the<br>
oblique, and what letters had<br>
double figures; which had points,<br>
and which had none; why one<br>
letter went before another; and<br>
many other things he began to tell<br>
him, and explain, of which the<br>
master himself had never heard,<br>
nor read in any book.</p>
<br>
<p>9  The Lord Jesus farther said<br>
to the master, Take notice how I<br>
say to thee; then he began clearly<br>
and distinctly to say Aleph, Beth,<br>
Gimel, Daleth, and so on to the<br>
end of the alphabet.</p>
<br>
<p>10  At this the master was so<br>
surprised, that he said, I believe<br>
this boy was born before Noah;</p>
<br>
<p>11  And turning to Joseph, he<br>
said, Thou hast brought a boy to<br>
me to be taught, who is more<br>
learned than any master.</p>
<br>
<p>12  He said also to St. Mary,<br>
This your son has no need of any<br>
learning.</p>
<br>
<p>13  They brought him then<br>
to a more learned master, who,<br>
when he saw him, said, say Aleph;</p>
<br>
<p>14  And when he had sand Aleph,<br>
the master bade him pronounce<br>
Beth; to which the Lord Jesus<br>
replied, Tell me first the meaning<br>
of the letter Aleph, and then I<br>
will pronounce Beth.</p>
<br>
<p>15  But this master, when he did<br>
lift up his hand to whip him, had<br>
his hand presently withered, and<br>
he died.</p>
<br>
<p>16 Then said Joseph to St. Mary,<br>
Henceforth we will not allow him<br>
to go out of the house; for every<br>
one who displeases him is killed.</p>

<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>
<br>
<p>     [Compare Luke ii. 42, whose meagre account is deficient<br>
     of the sublime details here given of the subjects disputed upon.]</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Disputes learnedly with the doctors in the temple,<br>
     7 on law,<br>
     9 on astronomy,<br>
     12 on physics and metaphysics.<br>
     21 Is worshiped by a philosopher,<br>
     28 and fetched home by his mother.</p>
<br>
<p>AND when he was twelve years<br>
old, they brought him to<br>
Jerusalem to the feast; and when<br>
the feast was over, they returned.</p>
<br>
<p>2  But the Lord Jesus continued<br>
behind in the temple among the<br>
doctors and elders, and learned<br>
men of Israel; to whom he proposed<br>
several questions of learning,<br>
and also gave them answers:</p>
<br>
<p>3  For he said to them, Whose<br>
son is the Messiah?  They answered,<br>
the son of David.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Why then, said he, does he in<br>
the spirit call him Lord? When he<br>
saith, The Lord said to my Lord,<br>
sit thou at my right hand, till I<br>
have made thine enemies thy foot-<br>
stool.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Then a certain principal Rabbi<br>
asked him, Hast thou read books?</p>
<br>
<p>6  Jesus answered, be had read<br>
both books, and the things which<br>
were contained in books.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And he explained to them the<br>
books of the law, and precepts,<br>
and statutes: and the mysteries<br>
which are contained in the books<br>
of the prophets; things which<br>
the mind of no creature could<br>
reach.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Then said that Rabbi, I never<br>
yet have seen or heard of such<br>
knowledge! What do you think<br>
that boy will be?</p>
<br>
<p>9  When a certain astronomer,<br>
who was present, asked the Lord<br>
Jesus, Whether he had studied<br>
astronomy?</p>
<br>
<p>10  The Lord Jesus replied, and<br>
told him the number of the spheres<br>
and heavenly bodies, as also their<br>
triangular, square, and sextile<br>
aspect; their progressive and<br>
retrograde motion; their size and<br>
several prognostications; and other<br>
things which the reason of man<br>
had never discovered.</p>
<br>
<p>11  There was also among them<br>
a philosopher well skilled in<br>
physic and natural philosophy,<br>
who asked the Lord Jesus, Whether<br>
he had studied physic?</p>
<br>
<p>12  He replied, and explained to<br>
him physics and metaphysics.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Also those things which were<br>
above and below the power of nature;</p>
<br>
<p>14  The powers also of the body,<br>
its humours, and their effects.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Also the number of its members,<br>
and bones, veins, arteries,<br>
and nerves;</p>
<br>
<p>16  The several constitutions of<br>
body, hot and dry, cold and moist,<br>
and the tendencies of them;</p>
<br>
<p>17  How the soul operated upon<br>
the body;</p>
<br>
<p>18  What its various sensations<br>
and faculties, were;</p>
<br>
<p>19  The faculty of speaking, anger,<br>
desire;</p>
<br>
<p>20  And lastly the manner of its<br>
composition and dissolution; and<br>
other things, which the<br>
understanding of no creature<br>
had ever reached.</p>
<br>
<p>21  Then that philosopher arose,<br>
and worshipped the Lord Jesus,<br>
and said, O Lord Jesus, from<br>
henceforth I will be thy disciple<br>
and servant.</p>
<br>
<p>22  While they were discoursing<br>
on these and such like things,<br>
the Lady St. Mary came in, having<br>
been three days walking about<br>
with Joseph, seeking for him.</p>
<br>
<p>23  And when she saw him sitting<br>
among the doctors, and in his turn<br>
proposing questions to them, and<br>
giving answers, she said to him,<br>
My son, why hast thou done thus<br>
by us? Behold I and thy father<br>
have been at much pains in<br>
seeking thee.</p>
<br>
<p>24  He replied, Why did  ye seek<br>
me? Did ye not know that I ought<br>
to be employed in my father's<br>
house?</p>
<br>
<p>25  But they understood not the<br>
words which he said to them.</p>
<br>
<p>26  Then the doctors asked Mary,<br>
Whether this were her son? And<br>
when she said, He was, they said,<br>
O happy Mary, who hast borne<br>
such a son.</p>
<br>
<p>27  Then he returned with them<br>
to Nazareth, and obeyed them in<br>
all things.</p>
<br>
<p>28  And his mother kept all these<br>
things in her mind;</p>
<br>
<p>29  And the Lord Jesus grew in<br>
stature and wisdom, and favour<br>
with God and man.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Jesus conceals his miracles,<br>
     2 studies the law,<br>
     3 and is baptized.</p>
<br>
<p>NOW from this time Jesus began<br>
to conceal his miracles and<br>
secret works,</p>
<br>
<p>2  And gave himself to the study<br>
of the law, till he arrived to the<br>
end of his thirtieth year;</p>
<br>
<p>3  At which time the Father publicly<br>
owned him at Jordan, sending<br>
down this voice from heaven, This<br>
is my beloved son, in whom I am<br>
well pleased;</p>
<br>
<p>4  The Holy Ghost being also<br>
present in the form of a dove.</p>
<br>
<p>5  This is he whom we worship<br>
with all reverence, because he gave<br>
us our life and being, and brought<br>
us from our mother's womb,<br>
Glory to God,</p>
<br>
<p>6  Who, for our sakes, took a<br>
human body, and hath redeemed<br>
us, that so he might embrace<br>
us with everlasting mercy, and<br>
shew his free, large, bountiful<br>
grace and goodness to us.</p>
<br>
<p>7  To him be glory and praise,<br>
and power, and dominion, from<br>
henceforth said for evermore.<br>
Amen.</p>

                   REFERENCES TO THE FIRST GOSPEL OF<br>
                      THE INFANCY OF JESUS CHRIST</p>
<br>
<p>[Mr. Henry Sike, Professor of Oriental Languages at Cambridge, first<br>
translated and published this Gospel in 1697. It was received by the<br>
Gnostics, a sect of Christians in the second century; and several of its<br>
relations were credited in  the following ages by other Christians, viz.,<br>
Eusebius, Athanasius, Epiphanius; Chrysostom. &amp;c. Sozomen says, he was<br>
told by many, and he credits the relations, of the idols in Egypt falling<br>
down on Joseph, and Mary's flight thither with Christ; and of Christ<br>
making a well to wash his clothes in a sycamore-tree, from whence balsam<br>
afterwards proceeded; which stories are from this Gospel. Chemnitius, out<br>
of Stipulensis, who had it from Peter Martyr, Bishop  of Alexandria, in<br>
the third century, says, that the place in Egypt where Christ  was<br>
banished is now called Matarea, about ten miles beyond Cairo; that the<br>
inhabitants constantly burn a lamp in remembrance of it; and that there<br>
is a garden of trees yielding a balsam, which were planted by Christ when<br>
a boy.  M. La Crosse cites a synod at Angamala, in the Mountain of<br>
Malabar, A. D.  1599, which shows this Gospel was commonly read by the<br>
Nestorians in the country. Ahmed Ibu Idris, a Mahometan divine, says, it<br>
was used by some  Christians in common with the other four Gospels; and<br>
Ocobius de Castro mentions a Gospel of Thomas, which he says, he saw and<br>
had translated to him by an Armenian Archbishop at Amsterdam, that was<br>
read in very many churches of Asia and Africa, as the only rule of their<br>
faith. Fabricius takes it to be this Gospel. It has been supposed, that<br>
Mahomet and his coadjutors used it in compiling the Koran. There are<br>
several stories believed of Christ, proceeding from this Gospel; as that<br>
which Mr. Sike relates out of La Brosse's Persic Lexicon, that Christ<br>
practised the trade of a dyer, and his working a miracle with the<br>
colours; from whence the Persian dyers honour him as their patron, and<br>
call a dye-house the shop of Christ. Sir John Chardin mentions Persian<br>
legends concerning Christ's dispute with his schoolmaster about his ABC;<br>
and his lengthening the cedar-board which Joseph sawed too short.]</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>        Note on the Miracles of Christ in the preceding Gospels.</p>
<br>
<p>A great void in the early life of the Saviour is filled up by these<br>
Gospels. In none of the Canonical Evangelists is any mention made of the<br>
childhood of Jesus.  The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, more<br>
rapidly than satisfactorily, pass over the period intervening between His<br>
birth and ministry. It is natural to suppose that the Infant Redeemer's<br>
earliest days were spent in the society of other young children, and it<br>
is quite consistent with every sincere Christians faith to  believe that<br>
He had the power to perform the miracles here ascribed to him otherwise,<br>
a limit will be set to His divine attributes, doubts raised against His<br>
performance of the miracles related by the four Evangelists, in the<br>
authorised version of the Testament, and a denial given of the<br>
declaration therein, "With  GOD nothing is impossible!"</p>

                      THE INFANCY OF JESUS CHRIST.</h2>
<br>
<h4>    An Account of the ACTIONS and MIRACLES of our Lord and Saviour<br>
                      JESUS CHRIST in his INFANCY.</h4></center>
<br>
<p>
CHAPTER I.</p>
<br>
<p>     2 Jesus miraculously clears the water after rain.<br>
     4 Plays with clay sparrows, which he animates<br>
     on the Sabbath day.</p>
<br>
<p>I THOMAS, an Israelite, judged<br>
it necessary to make known to<br>
our brethren among the Gentiles,<br>
the actions and miracles of Christ<br>
in his childhood, which our Lord<br>
and God Jesus Christ wrought<br>
after his birth in Bethlehem in our<br>
country, at which I myself, was<br>
astonished; the beginning of which<br>
was as followeth.</p>
<br>
<p>2  When the child Jesus was<br>
five years of age, and there had<br>
been a shower of rain, which was<br>
now over, Jesus was playing with<br>
other Hebrew boys by a running<br>
stream; and the water running<br>
over the banks, stood in little<br>
lakes;</p>
<br>
<p>3  But the water instantly became<br>
clear and useful again; he<br>
having smote them only by his<br>
word, they readily obeyed him.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Then he took from the bank<br>
of the stream some soft clay, and<br>
formed out of it twelve sparrows;<br>
and there were other boys playing<br>
with him.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But a certain Jew seeing the<br>
things which he was doing, namely,<br>
his forming clay into the figures<br>
of sparrows on the Sabbath day,<br>
went presently away, and told<br>
his father Joseph, and said,</p>
<br>
<p>6  Behold, thy boy is playing by<br>
the river side, and has taken clay,<br>
and formed it into twelve sparrows,<br>
and profaneth the Sabbath.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Then Joseph came to the<br>
place where he was, and when he<br>
saw him, called to him, and said,<br>
Why doest thou that which it is<br>
not lawful to do on the Sabbath<br>
day?</p>
<br>
<p>8  Then Jesus clapping together<br>
the palms of his hands, called to<br>
the sparrows, and said to them<br>
Go, fly away; and while ye live<br>
remember me.</p>
<br>
<p>9  So the sparrows fled away<br>
making a noise.</p>
<br>
<p>10  The Jews seeing this, were<br>
astonished, and went away, and<br>
told their chief persons what a<br>
strange miracle they had seen<br>
wrought by Jesus.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<br>
<p>     2 Causes a boy to wither who broke down his fish-pools;<br>
     6 Partly restores him.<br>
     7 Kills another boy.<br>
     16 causes blindness to fall on his accusers,<br>
     18 for which, Joseph pulls him by the ear.</p>
<br>
<p>BESIDES this, the son of Annas<br>
the scribe, was standing there<br>
with Joseph, and took a bough<br>
of a willow tree, and scattered<br>
the waters which Jesus had<br>
gathered into lakes.</p>
<br>
<p>2  But the boy Jesus seeing what<br>
he had done, became angry, and<br>
said to him, Thou fool, what harm<br>
did the lake do thee, that thou<br>
shouldest scatter the water?</p>
<br>
<p>3  Behold, now thou shalt wither<br>
as a tree, and shalt not bring forth<br>
either leaves, or branches, or fruit.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And immediately he became<br>
withered all over.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Then Jesus went away home.<br>
But the parents of the boy who<br>
was withered, lamenting the<br>
misfortune of his youth, took and<br>
carried him to Joseph, accusing him,<br>
and said, Why dost thou keep a<br>
son who is guilty of such actions?</p>
<br>
<p>6  Then Jesus at the request of<br>
all who were present did heal him,<br>
leaving only some small member<br>
to continue withered, that they<br>
might take warning.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Another time Jesus went<br>
forth into the street, and a boy<br>
running by, rushed upon his<br>
shoulder;</p>
<br>
<p>8  At which Jesus being angry,<br>
said to him, Thou shalt go no<br>
farther;</p>
<br>
<p>9  And he instantly fell down<br>
dead:</p>
<br>
<p>10  Which when some persons<br>
saw, they said, Where was this<br>
boy born, that every thing which<br>
he says presently cometh to pass?</p>
<br>
<p>11  Then the parents of the dead<br>
boy going to Joseph, complained,<br>
saying, You are not fit to live with<br>
us, in our city, having such a boy<br>
as that:</p>
<br>
<p>12  Either teach him that he<br>
bless and not curse, or else depart<br>
hence with him, for he kills our<br>
children.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Then Joseph calling the<br>
boy Jesus by himself, instructed<br>
him, saying, Why doest thou such<br>
things to injure the people so, that<br>
they hate us and prosecute us?</p>
<br>
<p>14  But Jesus replied, I know<br>
that what thou sayest is not of<br>
thyself, but for thy sake I will<br>
say nothing;</p>
<br>
<p>15  But they who have said these<br>
things to thee, shall suffer<br>
everlasting punishment.</p>
<br>
<p>16  And immediately they who<br>
had accused him became blind,</p>
<br>
<p>17  And all they who saw it were<br>
exceedingly afraid and confounded,<br>
and said concerning him, Whatsoever<br>
he saith, whether good or bad,<br>
immediately cometh to pass and<br>
they were amazed.</p>
<br>
<p>18  And when they saw this action<br>
of Christ, Joseph arose, and<br>
plucked him by the ear, at which<br>
the boy was angry, and said to<br>
him, Be easy;</p>
<br>
<p>19  For if they seek for us, they<br>
shall not find us: thou hast done<br>
very imprudently.</p>
<br>
<p>20  Dost thou not know that I<br>
am thine? Trouble me no more.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Astonishes his schoolmaster by his learning.</p>
<br>
<p>A CERTAIN schoolmaster<br>
named Zaccheaus, standing<br>
in a certain place, heard Jesus<br>
speaking these things to his father.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And he was much surprised,<br>
that being a child he should speak<br>
such things; and after a few days<br>
he came to Joseph, and said,</p>
<br>
<p>3  Thou hast a wise and sensible<br>
child, send him to me, that he may<br>
learn to read.</p>
<br>
<p>4  When he sat down to teach<br>
the letters to Jesus, he began with<br>
the first letter Aleph;</p>
<br>
<p>5  But Jesus pronounced the<br>
second letter Mpeth (Beth) Cghimel<br>
(Gimel), and said over all the<br>
letters to him to the end.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Then opening a book, he<br>
taught his master the prophets<br>
but he was ashamed, and was at a<br>
loss to conceive how he came to<br>
know the letters.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And he arose and went home,<br>
wonderfully surprised at so strange<br>
a thing.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>

<p>     1 Fragment of an adventure at a dyer's.</p>
<br>
<p>AS Jesus was passing by a certain<br>
shop, he saw a young man dipping<br>
(or dyeing) some cloths and stockings<br>
in a furnace, of a sad colour, doing<br>
them according to every person's<br>
particular order;</p>
<br>
<p>2  The boy Jesus going to the<br>
young man who was doing this,<br>
took also some of the cloths ......</p>

<br><br><br>
<p>
The Gospel of NICODEMUS, the disciple,<br>
concerning the Sufferings and Resurrection<br>
of our Master and Saviour, JESUS CHRIST.</p>
<br>
<p>
CHAPTER I.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Christ accused to Pilate by the Jews<br>
     of healing on the Sabbath.<br>
     9 Summoned before Pilate by a messenger<br>
     who does him honour.<br>
     20 Worshipped by the standards bowing down to him.</p>
<br>
<p>ANNAS and Caiphas, and<br>
Summas, and Datam, Gamaliel,<br>
Judas, Levi, Nepthalim, Alexander,<br>
Cyrus, and other Jews, went<br>
to Pilate about Jesus, accusing<br>
him with many bad crimes.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And said, We are assured that<br>
Jesus is the son of Joseph, the<br>
carpenter, and born of Mary, and<br>
that he declares himself the Son of<br>
God, and a king; and not only so,<br>
but attempts the dissolution of the<br>
Sabbath, and the laws of our<br>
fathers.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Pilate replied, What is it<br>
which he declares? and what is it<br>
which he attempts dissolving?</p>
<br>
<p>4  The Jews told him, We have<br>
a law which forbids doing cures<br>
on the Sabbath day; but he cures<br>
both the lame and the deaf, those<br>
afflicted with the palsy, the blind,<br>
the lepers, and demoniacs, on that<br>
day, by wicked methods.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Pilate replied, How can he<br>
do this by wicked methods? They<br>
answered He is a conjurer, and<br>
casts out devils by the prince of<br>
the devils; and so all things,<br>
become subject to him.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Then said Pilate, Casting out<br>
devils seems not to be the work of<br>
an unclean spirit, but to proceed<br>
from the power of God.</p>
<br>
<p>7  The Jews replied to Pilate,<br>
We entreat your highness to summon<br>
him to appear before your tribunal,<br>
and hear him yourself.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Then Pilate called a messenger,<br>
and said to him, By what means<br>
will Christ be brought hither?</p>
<br>
<p>9  Then went the messenger<br>
forth, and knowing Christ,<br>
worshipped him; and having spread<br>
the cloak which he had in his hand<br>
upon the ground, he said, Lord,<br>
walk upon this, and go in, for the<br>
governor calls thee.</p>
<br>
<p>10  When the Jews perceived<br>
what the messenger had done,<br>
they exclaimed (against him) to<br>
Pilate, and said, Why did you not<br>
give him his summons by a beadle,<br>
and not by a messenger?--For the<br>
messenger, when he saw him,<br>
worshipped him, and spread the<br>
cloak which he had in his hand<br>
upon the ground before him, and<br>
said to him, Lord, the governor<br>
calls thee.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Then Pilate called the<br>
messenger, and said, Why hast thou<br>
done thus?</p>
<br>
<p>12  The messenger replied, When<br>
thou sentest me from Jerusalem to<br>
Alexander, I saw Jesus sitting in<br>
a mean figure upon a she-ass, and<br>
the children of the Hebrews cried<br>
out, Hosannah, holding boughs of<br>
trees in their hands.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Others spread their garments<br>
in the way, and said, Save us, thou<br>
who art in heaven; blessed is he<br>
who cometh in the name of the<br>
Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Then the Jews cried out,<br>
against the messenger, and said,<br>
The children of the Hebrews made<br>
their acclamations in the Hebrew<br>
language; and how couldst thou,<br>
who art a Greek, understand the<br>
Hebrew?</p>
<br>
<p>15  The messenger answered<br>
them and said, I asked one of the<br>
Jews and said, What is this which<br>
the children do cry out in the<br>
Hebrew language?</p>
<br>
<p>16  And he explained it to me,<br>
saying, they cry out, Hosannah,<br>
which being interpreted, is, O<br>
Lord, save me; or, O Lord, save.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Pilate then said to them,<br>
Why do you yourselves testify to<br>
the words spoken by the children,<br>
namely, by your silence?  In what<br>
has the messenger done amiss?<br>
And they were silent.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Then the governor said unto<br>
the messenger, Go forth and<br>
endeavour by any means to bring<br>
him in.</p>
<br>
<p>19  But the messenger went forth<br>
and did as before; and said, Lord<br>
come in, for the governor calleth<br>
thee.</p>
<br>
<p>20  And as Jesus was going in<br>
by the ensigns, who carried the<br>
standards, the tops of them bowed<br>
down and worshipped Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>21  Whereupon the Jews exclaimed<br>
more vehemently against the ensigns.</p>
<br>
<p>22  But Pilate said to the Jews,<br>
I know it is not pleasing to you<br>
that the tops of the standards did<br>
of themselves bow and worship<br>
Jesus; but why do ye exclaim<br>
against the ensigns, as if they had<br>
bowed and worshipped?</p>
<br>
<p>23  They replied to Pilate,<br>
We saw the ensigns themselves<br>
bowing and worshipping Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>24  Then the governor called the<br>
ensigns, and said unto them, Why<br>
did you do thus?</p>
<br>
<p>25  The ensigns said to Pilate,<br>
We are all Pagans and worship<br>
the gods in temples; and how<br>
should we think anything about<br>
worshipping him?  We only held<br>
the standards in our hands,<br>
and they bowed themselves and<br>
worshipped him.</p>
<br>
<p>26  Then said Pilate to the rulers<br>
of the synagogue, Do ye yourselves<br>
choose some strong men, and let<br>
them hold the standards, and we<br>
shall see whether they will then<br>
bend of themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>27  So the elders of the Jews<br>
sought out twelve of the most<br>
strong and able old men, and made<br>
them hold the standards, and they<br>
stood in the presence of the governor.</p>
<br>
<p>28  Then Pilate said to the<br>
messenger, Take Jesus out, and by<br>
some means bring him in again.<br>
And Jesus and the messenger went<br>
out of the hall.</p>
<br>
<p>29  And Pilate called the ensigns<br>
who before had borne the standards,<br>
and swore to them, that if they<br>
had not borne the standards in<br>
that manner when Jesus before<br>
entered in, he would cut off<br>
their heads.</p>
<br>
<p>30  Then the governor commanded<br>
Jesus to come in again.</p>
<br>
<p>31  And the messenger did as he<br>
had done before, and very much<br>
entreated Jesus that he would go<br>
upon his cloak, and walk on it;<br>
and he did walk upon it, and went<br>
in.</p>
<br>
<p>32  And when Jesus went in,<br>
the standards bowed themselves as<br>
before, and worshipped him.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<br>
<p>     2 Is comppassionated by Pilate's wife,<br>
     7 charged with being born in fornication.<br>
     12 Testimony to the betrothing of his parents.<br>
     15 Hatred of the Jews to him.</p>
<br>
<p>NOW when Pilate saw this, he<br>
was afraid, and was about to<br>
rise from his seat.</p>
<br>
<p>2  But while he thought to rise,<br>
his own wife who stood at a<br>
distance, sent to him, saying, Have<br>
thou nothing to do with that just<br>
man; for I have suffered much<br>
concerning him in a vision this<br>
night.</p>
<br>
<p>3  When the Jews heard this<br>
they said to Pilate, Did we not say<br>
unto thee, He is a conjuror? Behold,<br>
he hath caused thy wife to dream.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Pilate then calling Jesus, said,<br>
thou hast heard what they testify<br>
against thee, and makest no answer?</p>
<br>
<p>5  Jesus replied, If they had not<br>
a power of speaking, they could<br>
not have spoke; but because every<br>
one has the command of his own<br>
tongue, to speak both good and<br>
bad, let him look to it.</p>
<br>
<p>6  But the elders of the Jews<br>
answered, and said to Jesus, What<br>
shall we look to?</p>
<br>
<p>7  In the first place, we know<br>
this concerning thee, that thou<br>
wast born through fornication;<br>
secondly, that upon the account of<br>
thy birth the infants were slain in<br>
Bethlehem; thirdly, that thy father<br>
and mother Mary fled into Egypt,<br>
because they could not trust their<br>
own people.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Some of the Jews who stood<br>
by spake more favourably, We<br>
cannot say that he was born<br>
through fornication; but we know<br>
that his mother Mary was betrothed<br>
to Joseph, and so he was not born<br>
through fornication.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Then said Pilate to the Jews<br>
who affirmed him to be born<br>
through fornication, This your<br>
account is not true, seeing there was<br>
a betrothment, as they testify who<br>
are of your own nation.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Annas and Caiphas spake to<br>
Pilate, All this multitude of people<br>
is to be regarded, who cry out,<br>
that he was born through fornication,<br>
and is a conjurer; but they who deny<br>
him to be born through fornication,<br>
are his proselytes and disciples.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Pilate answered Annas and<br>
Caiphas, Who are the proselytes?<br>
They answered, They are those<br>
who are the children of Pagans,<br>
and are not become Jews, but<br>
followers of him.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Then replied Eleazer, and<br>
Asterius, and Antonius, and James,<br>
Caras and Samuel, Isaac and Phinees,<br>
Crispus and Agrippa, Annas and Judas,<br>
We are not proselytes, but children<br>
of Jews, and speak the truth,<br>
and were present when Mary was<br>
betrothed.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Then Pilate addressing<br>
himself to the twelve men who<br>
spake this, said to them, I conjure<br>
you by the life of Caesar, that ye<br>
faithfully declare whether he was<br>
born through fornication, and those<br>
things be true which ye have related.</p>
<br>
<p>14  They answered Pilate, We<br>
have a law whereby we are forbid<br>
to swear, it being a sin: Let them<br>
swear by the life of Caesar that it<br>
is not as we have said, and we will<br>
be contented to be put to death.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Then said Annas and Caiphas<br>
to Pilate, Those twelve men will<br>
not believe that we know him to be<br>
basely born, and to be a conjurer,<br>
although he pretends that he is<br>
the Son of God, and a king: which<br>
we are so far from believing, that<br>
we tremble to hear.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Then Pilate commanded<br>
every one to go out except the<br>
twelve men who said he was not<br>
born through fornication, and<br>
Jesus to withdraw to a distance,<br>
and said to them, Why have the Jews<br>
a mind to kill Jesus?</p>
<br>
<p>17  They answered him, They<br>
are angry because he wrought<br>
cures on the sabbath day. Pilate<br>
said, Will they kill him for a<br>
good work? They say unto him,<br>
Yes, Sir.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<br>
<p>1 Is exonerated by Pilate.<br>
11 Disputes with Pilate concerning truth.</p>
<br>
<p>THEN Pilate, filled with anger,<br>
went out of the hall, and said<br>
to the Jews, I call the whole<br>
world to witness that I find no<br>
fault in that man.</p>
<br>
<p>2  The Jews replied to Pilate,<br>
If he had not been a wicked person,<br>
we had not brought him before thee.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Pilate said to them, Do ye take<br>
him and try him by your law.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Then the Jews said, It is not<br>
lawful for us to put any one to<br>
death.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Pilate said to the Jews, The<br>
command, therefore, thou shalt<br>
not kill, belongs to you, but<br>
not to me.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And he went again into the<br>
hall, and called Jesus by himself,<br>
and said to him, Art thou the king<br>
of the Jews?</p>
<br>
<p>7  And Jesus answering, said<br>
to Pilate, Dost thou speak this<br>
of thyself, or did the Jews tell<br>
it thee concerning me?</p>
<br>
<p>8  Pilate answering, said to<br>
Jesus, Am I a Jew? The whole<br>
nation and rulers of the Jews have<br>
delivered thee up to me. What<br>
hast thou done?</p>
<br>
<p>9  Jesus answering, said, My<br>
kingdom is not of this world:<br>
if my kingdom were of this world,<br>
then would my servants fight,<br>
and I should not have been<br>
delivered to the Jews: but now<br>
my kingdom is not from hence.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Pilate said, Art thou a king<br>
then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest<br>
that I am a king: to this end<br>
was I born, and for this end came<br>
I into the world; and for this<br>
purpose I came, that I should bear<br>
witness to the truth; and every<br>
one who is of the truth, heareth<br>
my voice.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Pilate saith to him, What is<br>
truth?</p>
<br>
<p>12  Jesus said, Truth is from<br>
heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Pilate said, Therefore truth<br>
is not on earth.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Jesus saith to Pilate,<br>
Believe that truth is on earth<br>
among those, who when they have<br>
the power of judgment, are governed<br>
by truth, and form right judgment.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Pilate finds no fault in Jesus.<br>
     16 The Jews demand his crucifixion.</p>
<br>
<p>THEN Pilate left Jesus in the hall,<br>
and went out to the Jews, and said,<br>
I find not any one fault in Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>2  The Jews say unto him, But<br>
he said, I can destroy the temple<br>
of God, and in three days build it<br>
up again.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Pilate saith to them, What<br>
sort of temple is that of which he<br>
speaketh?</p>
<br>
<p>4  The Jews say unto him,<br>
That which Solomon was forty-six<br>
years in building, he said he<br>
would destroy, and in three days<br>
build up.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Pilate said to them again, I<br>
am innocent from the blood of that<br>
man! do ye look to it.</p>
<br>
<p>6  The Jews say to him, His<br>
blood be upon us and our children.<br>
Then Pilate calling together the<br>
elders and scribes, priests and<br>
Levites, saith to them privately,<br>
Do not act thus; I have found<br>
nothing in your charge (against<br>
him) concerning his curing sick<br>
persons, and breaking the sabbath,<br>
worthy of death.</p>
<br>
<p>7  The priests and Levites replied<br>
to Pilate, By the life of Caesar,<br>
if any one be a blasphemer, he is<br>
worthy of death; but this man hath<br>
blasphemed against the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Then the governor again<br>
commanded the Jews to depart out<br>
of the hall; and calling Jesus,<br>
said to him, What shall I do with<br>
thee?</p>
<br>
<p>9  Jesus answered him, Do according<br>
as it is written.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Pilate said to him, How is it<br>
written?</p>
<br>
<p>11  Jesus saith to him, Moses<br>
and the prophets have prophesied<br>
concerning my suffering and<br>
resurrection.</p>
<br>
<p>12  The Jews hearing this, were<br>
provoked, and said to Pilate,<br>
Why wilt thou any longer hear the<br>
blasphemy of that man?</p>
<br>
<p>13  Pilate saith to them, If these<br>
words seem to you blasphemy, do<br>
ye take him, bring him to your<br>
court, and try him according to<br>
your law.</p>
<br>
<p>14  The Jews reply to Pilate,<br>
Our law saith, he shall be obliged<br>
to receive nine and thirty stripes,<br>
but if after this manner he shall<br>
blaspheme against the Lord, he<br>
shall be stoned.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Pilate saith unto them, If<br>
that speech of his was blasphemy,<br>
do ye try him according to your<br>
law.</p>
<br>
<p>16  The Jews say to Pilate, Our<br>
law command us not to put any one<br>
to death. We desire that he may be<br>
crucified, because he deserves the<br>
death of the cross.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Pilate saith to them, It is not<br>
fit he should be crucified: let him<br>
be only whipped and sent away.</p>
<br>
<p>18  But when the governor looked<br>
upon the people that were present<br>
and the Jews, he saw many of the<br>
Jews in tears, and said to the<br>
chief priests of the Jews, All<br>
the people do not desire his death.</p>
<br>
<p>19  The elders of the Jews answered<br>
to Pilate, We and all the people<br>
came hither for this very purpose,<br>
that he should die.</p>
<br>
<p>20  Pilate saith to them, Why should<br>
he die?</p>
<br>
<p>21  They said to him, Because<br>
he declares himself to be the Son<br>
of God and a King.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAP. V.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Nicodemus speaks in defence of Christ,<br>
     and relates his miracles.<br>
     12 Another Jew,<br>
     26 with Veronica,<br>
     34 Centurio, and others,<br>
     testify of other miracles.</p>
<br>
<p>BUT Nicodemus, a certain Jew,<br>
stood before the governor,<br>
and said, I entreat thee,<br>
O righteous judge, that thou<br>
wouldst favour me with the<br>
liberty of speaking a few words.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Pilate said to him, Speak on.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Nicodemus said, I spake to<br>
the elders of the Jews, and the<br>
scribes, and priests and Levites,<br>
and all the multitude of the Jews,<br>
in their assembly; What is it ye<br>
would do with this man?</p>
<br>
<p>4  He is a man who hath wrought<br>
many useful and glorious miracles,<br>
such as no man on earth ever<br>
wrought before, nor will ever<br>
work.  Let him go, and do him<br>
no harm; if he cometh from God,<br>
his miracles, (his miraculous<br>
cures) will continue; but if from<br>
men, they will come to nought.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Thus Moses, when he was<br>
sent by God into Egypt, wrought<br>
the miracles which God commanded<br>
him, before Pharaoh king of Egypt;<br>
and though the magicians of that<br>
country, Jannes and Jambres,<br>
wrought by their magic the same<br>
miracles which Moses did, yet they<br>
could not work all which he did;</p>
<br>
<p>6  And the miracles which the<br>
magicians wrought, were not of<br>
God, as ye know, O Scribes and<br>
Pharisees; but they who wrought<br>
them perished, and all who<br>
believed them.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And now let this man go;<br>
because the very miracles for<br>
which ye accuse him, are from<br>
God; and he is not worthy of<br>
death.</p>
<br>
<p>8  The Jews then said to Nicodemus,<br>
Art thou become his disciple,<br>
and making speeches in his favour?</p>
<br>
<p>9  Nicodemus said to them, Is<br>
the governor become his disciple<br>
also, and does he make speeches<br>
for him? Did not Caesar place<br>
him in that high post?</p>
<br>
<p>10  When the Jews heard this<br>
they trembled, and gnashed their<br>
teeth at Nicodemus, and said to<br>
him, Mayest thou receive his<br>
doctrine for truth, and have<br>
thy lot with Christ!</p>
<br>
<p>11  Nicodemus replied, Amen;<br>
I will receive his doctrine, and<br>
my lot with him, as ye have said.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Then another certain Jew<br>
rose up, and desired leave of the<br>
governor to hear him a few words.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And the governor said,<br>
Speak, what thou hast a mind.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And he said, I lay for thirty-<br>
eight years by the sheep-pool at<br>
Jerusalem, labouring under a great<br>
infirmity, and waiting for a cure<br>
which should be wrought by the<br>
coming of an angel, who at a<br>
certain time troubled the water: and<br>
whosoever first after the troubling<br>
of the water stepped in, was made<br>
whole of whatsoever disease he had.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And when Jesus saw me languishing<br>
there, he said to me, Wilt thou be<br>
made whole? And I answered, Sir,<br>
I have no man, when the water is<br>
troubled, to put me into the pool.</p>
<br>
<p>16  And he said unto me, Rise,<br>
take up thy bed and walk. And<br>
I was immediately made whole,<br>
and took up my bed and walked.</p>
<br>
<p>17  The Jews then said to Pilate,<br>
Our Lord Governor, pray ask<br>
him what day it was on which he<br>
was cured of his infirmity.</p>
<br>
<p>18  The infirm person replied,<br>
It was on the sabbath.</p>
<br>
<p>19  The Jews said to Pilate, Did<br>
we not say that he wrought his<br>
cures on the sabbath, and cast out<br>
devils by the prince of devils?</p>
<br>
<p>20  Then another certain Jew<br>
came forth, and said, I was blind,<br>
could hear sounds, but could not<br>
see any one; and as Jesus was<br>
going along, I heard the multitude<br>
passing by, and I asked what<br>
was there?</p>
<br>
<p>21  They told me that Jesus was<br>
passing by: then I cried out,<br>
saying, Jesus, Son of David, have<br>
mercy on me. And he stood still,<br>
and commanded that I should be<br>
brought to him, and said to me,<br>
What wilt thou?</p>
<br>
<p>22  I said, Lord, that I may<br>
receive my sight.</p>
<br>
<p>23  He said to me, Receive thy<br>
sight: and presently I saw, and<br>
followed him, rejoicing and giving<br>
thanks,</p>
<br>
<p>24  Another Jew also came forth,<br>
and said, I was a leper, and he<br>
cured me by his word only, saying,<br>
I will, be thou clean; and presently<br>
I was cleansed from my leprosy.</p>
<br>
<p>25  And another Jew came<br>
forth, and said I was crooked,<br>
and he made me straight by his<br>
word.</p>
<br>
<p>26  And a certain woman<br>
named Veronica, said, I was<br>
afflicted with an issue of blood<br>
twelve years, and I touched the<br>
hem of his garment, and presently<br>
the issue of blood stopped.</p>
<br>
<p>27  The Jews then said, We<br>
have a law, that a woman shall<br>
not be allowed as an evidence.</p>
<br>
<p>28  And, after other things,<br>
another Jew said, I saw Jesus<br>
invited to a wedding with his<br>
disciples, and there was a want<br>
of wine in Cana of Galilee;</p>
<br>
<p>29  And when the wine was all<br>
drank, he commanded the servants<br>
that they should fill six pots which<br>
were there with water, and they<br>
filled them up to the brim, and he<br>
blessed them and turned the water<br>
into wine, and all the people drank,<br>
being surprised at this miracle,</p>
<br>
<p>30 And another Jew stood forth,<br>
and  said, I saw Jesus teaching<br>
in the synagogue at Capernaum;<br>
and there was in the synagogue<br>
a certain man who had a devil;<br>
and he cried out, saying,<br>
let me alone; what have we to<br>
do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth?<br>
Art thou come to destroy us?<br>
I know that thou art the Holy One<br>
of God.</p>
<br>
<p>31 And Jesus rebuked him, saying,<br>
Hold thy peace, unclean spirit,<br>
and come out of the man; and<br>
presently he came out of him, and<br>
did not at all hurt him.</p>
<br>
<p>32  The following things were<br>
also said by a Pharisee: I saw<br>
that a great company came to<br>
Jesus from Galilee and Judea, and<br>
the sea-cost, and many countries<br>
about Jordan; and many infirm<br>
persons came to him, and he healed<br>
them all.</p>
<br>
<p>33  And I heard the unclean<br>
spirits crying out, and saying,<br>
Thou art the Son of God. And<br>
Jesus strictly charged them, that<br>
they should not make him known.</p>
<br>
<p>34  After this another person,<br>
whose name was Centurio, said,<br>
I saw Jesus in Capernaum, and I<br>
entreated him, saying, Lord, my<br>
servant lieth at home sick of the<br>
palsy.</p>
<br>
<p>35  And Jesus said to me, I<br>
will come and cure him.</p>
<br>
<p>36  But I said, Lord, I am not<br>
worthy that thou shouldst come<br>
under my roof; but only speak<br>
the word, and my servant shall be<br>
healed.</p>
<br>
<p>37  And Jesus said unto me, Go<br>
thy way; and as thou hast believed<br>
so be it done unto thee. And my<br>
servant was healed from that same<br>
hour.</p>
<br>
<p>38  Then a certain nobleman<br>
said, I had a son in Capernaum,<br>
who lay at the point of death; and<br>
when I heard that Jesus was come<br>
into Galilee, I went and besought<br>
him that he would come down to<br>
my house, and heal my son, for he<br>
was at the point of death.</p>
<br>
<p>39  He said to me, Go thy way,<br>
thy son liveth.</p>
<br>
<p>40  And my son was cured from<br>
that hour.</p>
<br>
<p>41  Besides these, also many<br>
others of the Jews, both men and<br>
Women, cried out and said, He is<br>
truly the Son of God, who cures<br>
all diseases only by his word, and<br>
to whom the devils are altogether<br>
subject.</p>
<br>
<p>42  Some of them farther said,<br>
This power can proceed from none<br>
but God.</p>
<br>
<p>43  Pilate said to the Jews, Why<br>
are not the devils subject to your<br>
doctors?</p>
<br>
<p>44  Some of them said, The<br>
power of subjecting devils cannot<br>
proceed but from God.</p>
<br>
<p>45  But others said to Pilate,<br>
That he had raised Lazarus from<br>
the dead, after he had been four<br>
days in his grave.</p>
<br>
<p>46  The governor hearing this,<br>
trembling, said to the multitude of<br>
the Jews, What will it profit you<br>
to shed innocent blood?</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Pilate dismayed by the turbulence of the Jews,<br>
     5 who demand Barabbas to be released, and Christ<br>
     to be crucified.<br>
     9 Pilate warmly expostulates with them,<br>
     20 washes his hands of Christ's blood,<br>
     23 and sentences him to be whipped and crucified.</p>
<br>
<p>THEN Pilate having called<br>
together Nicodemus, and the<br>
fifteen men who said that Jesus<br>
was not born through fornication,<br>
said to them, What shall I do,<br>
seeing there is like to be a tumult<br>
among the people.</p>
<br>
<p>2  They say unto him, We know<br>
not; let them look to it who raise<br>
the tumult.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Pilate then called the<br>
multitude again, and said to them,<br>
Ye know that ye have a custom, that<br>
I should release to you one prisoner<br>
at the feast of the passover:</p>
<br>
<p>4  I have a noted prisoner, a<br>
murderer, who is called Barabbas,<br>
and Jesus who is called Christ, in<br>
whom I find nothing that deserves<br>
death; which of them, therefore,<br>
have you a mind that I should<br>
release to you?</p>
<br>
<p>5  They all cry out, and say,<br>
Release to us Barabbas.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Pilate saith to them, What<br>
then shall I do with Jesus who is<br>
called Christ?</p>
<br>
<p>7  They all answer, Let him be<br>
crucified.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Again they cry out and say to<br>
Pilate, You are not the friend of<br>
Caesar, if you release this man;<br>
for he hath declared that he is the<br>
Son of God, and a king.  But are<br>
you inclined that he should be<br>
king, and not Caesar?</p>
<br>
<p>9  Then Pilate filled with anger<br>
said to them, Your nation hath<br>
always been seditious, and you are<br>
always against those who have<br>
been serviceable to you.</p>
<br>
<p>10  The Jews replied, Who are those<br>
who have been serviceable to us?</p>
<br>
<p>11  Pilate answered them, Your<br>
God who delivered you from the<br>
hard bondage of the Egyptians,<br>
and brought you over the Red Sea<br>
as though it had been dry land,<br>
and fed you in the wilderness with<br>
manna and the flesh of quails, and<br>
brought water out of the rock, and<br>
gave you a law from heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Ye provoked him all ways,<br>
and desired for yourselves a<br>
molten calf, and worshipped it,<br>
and sacrificed to it, and said,<br>
These are thy Gods, O Israel,<br>
which brought thee out of the<br>
land of Egypt:</p>
<br>
<p>13  On account of which your<br>
God was inclined to destroy you;<br>
but Moses interceded for you, and<br>
your God heard him, and forgave<br>
your iniquity.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Afterwards ye were enraged<br>
against, and would have killed<br>
your prophets, Moses and Aaron,<br>
when they fled to the tabernacle,<br>
and ye were always murmuring<br>
against God and his prophets.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And arising from his<br>
judgment seat, he would have gone<br>
out; but the Jews all cried out,<br>
We acknowledge Caesar to be king,<br>
and not Jesus;</p>
<br>
<p>16  Whereas this person, as<br>
soon as he was born, the wise<br>
men came and offered gifts unto<br>
him; which when Herod heard,<br>
he was exceedingly troubled,<br>
and would have killed him:</p>
<br>
<p>17  When his father knew this,<br>
he fled with him and his mother<br>
Mary into Egypt. Herod, when<br>
he heard he was born, would have<br>
slain him; and accordingly sent<br>
and slew all the children which<br>
were in Bethlehem, and in all the<br>
coasts thereof, from two years old<br>
and under.</p>
<br>
<p>18  When Pilate heard this<br>
account, he was afraid; and<br>
commanding silence among the<br>
people, who made a noise, he said<br>
to Jesus, Art thou therefore a king?</p>
<br>
<p>19  All the Jews replied to<br>
Pilate, he is the very person<br>
whom Herod sought to have slain.</p>
<br>
<p>20  Then Pilate taking water,<br>
washed his hands before the people<br>
and said, I am innocent of the<br>
blood of this just person; look ye<br>
to it.</p>
<br>
<p>21  The Jews answered and said,<br>
His blood be upon us and our<br>
children.</p>
<br>
<p>22  Then Pilate commanded Jesus<br>
to be brought before him, and<br>
spake to him in the following<br>
words;</p>
<br>
<p>23  Thy own nation hath charged<br>
thee as making thyself a king;<br>
wherefore I, Pilate, sentence thee<br>
to be whipped according to the<br>
laws of former governors; and<br>
that thou be first bound, then<br>
hanged upon a cross in that place<br>
where thou art now a prisoner;<br>
and also two criminals with thee,<br>
whose names are Dimas and Gestas.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAP. VII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Manner of Christ's crucifixion<br>
     with the two thieves.</p>
<br>
<p>THEN Jesus went out of the<br>
hall, and the two thieves<br>
with him.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And when they came to the<br>
place which is called Golgotha,<br>
they stript him of his raiment, and<br>
girt him about with a linen cloth,<br>
and put a crown of thorns upon his<br>
head, and put a reed in his hand.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And in like manner did they<br>
to the two thieves who were<br>
crucified with him, Dimas on his<br>
right hand and Gestas on his left.</p>
<br>
<p>4  But Jesus said, My Father,<br>
forgive them, For they know not<br>
what they do.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And they divided his garments,<br>
and upon his vesture they cast lots.</p>
<br>
<p>6  The people in the mean time<br>
stood by, and the chief priests<br>
and elders of the Jews mocked him,<br>
saying, He saved others, let him<br>
now save himself if he can; if he<br>
be the son of God, let him now<br>
come down from the cross.</p>
<br>
<p>7  The soldiers also mocked him,<br>
and taking vinegar and gall, offered<br>
it to him to drink, and said to him,<br>
If thou art king of the Jews,<br>
deliver thyself.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Then Longinus, a certain soldier,<br>
taking a spear,' pierced his side,<br>
and presently there came forth blood<br>
and water.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And Pilate wrote the title<br>
upon the cross in Hebrew, Latin,<br>
and Greek letters, viz., THIS IS<br>
THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<br>
<p>10  But one of the two thieves<br>
who were crucified with Jesus,<br>
whose name was Gestas, said to<br>
Jesus, If thou art the Christ,<br>
deliver thyself and us.</p>
<br>
<p>11 But the thief who was<br>
crucified on his right hand,<br>
whose name was Dimas, answering,<br>
rebuked him, and said, Dost not<br>
thou fear God, who art condemned<br>
to this punishment? We indeed<br>
receive rightly and justly the<br>
demerit of our actions; but this<br>
Jesus, what evil hath he done.</p>
<br>
<p>12  After this, groaning, he said<br>
to Jesus, Lord, remember me<br>
when thou comest into thy kingdom.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Jesus answering, said to<br>
him, Verily I say unto thee, that<br>
this day thou shalt be with me in<br>
Paradise.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Miraculous appearance at his death.<br>
     10 The Jews say the eclipse was natural.<br>
     12 Joseph of Arimathcea embalms Christ's<br>
     body and buries it.</p>
<br>
<p>AND it was about the sixth<br>
hour, and darkness was upon<br>
the face of the whole earth until<br>
the ninth hour.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And while the sun was eclipsed,<br>
behold the veil of the temple was<br>
rent from the top, to the bottom;<br>
and the rocks also were rent, and<br>
the graves opened, and many<br>
bodies of saints, which slept,<br>
arose.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And about the ninth hour<br>
Jesus cried out with a loud voice,<br>
Eli, Eli, lama sabacthani? which<br>
being interpreted is, My God, My<br>
God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
<br>
<p>4  And after these things, Jesus<br>
said, Father, into thy hands I<br>
commend my spirit; and having<br>
said this, he gave up the ghost.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But when the centurion saw<br>
that Jesus thus crying out gave up<br>
the ghost, he glorified God, and<br>
said, Of a truth this was a just<br>
man.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And all the people who stood<br>
by, were exceedingly troubled at<br>
the sight; and reflecting upon<br>
what had passed, smote upon their<br>
breasts, and then returned to the<br>
city of Jerusalem.</p>
<br>
<p>7  The centurion went to the<br>
governor, and related to him all<br>
that had passed:</p>
<br>
<p>8  And when he had heard all<br>
these things, he was exceedingly<br>
sorrowful;</p>
<br>
<p>9  And calling the Jews together,<br>
said to them, Have ye seen the<br>
miracle of the sun's eclipse, and<br>
the other things which came to<br>
pass, while Jesus was dying?</p>
<br>
<p>10  Which when the Jews heard,<br>
they answered to the governor,<br>
The eclipse of the sun happened<br>
according to its usual custom.</p>
<br>
<p>11  But all those who were the<br>
acquaintance of Christ, stood at<br>
a distance, as did the women who<br>
had followed Jesus from Galilee,<br>
observing all these things.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And behold a certain man<br>
of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who<br>
was also a disciple of Jesus, but<br>
not openly so, for fear of the Jews,<br>
came to the governor, and entreated<br>
the governor that he would give him<br>
leave to take away the body of Jesus<br>
from the cross.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And the governor gave him leave.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And Nicodemus came, bringing<br>
with him a mixture of myrrh and<br>
aloes about a hundred pounds<br>
weight; and they took down Jesus<br>
from the cross with tears, and<br>
bound him in linen cloths with<br>
spices, according to the custom of<br>
burying among the Jews;</p>
<br>
<p>15  And placed him in a new<br>
tomb, which Joseph had built,<br>
and caused to be cut out of a rock,<br>
in which never any man had been<br>
put; and they rolled a great stone<br>
to the door of the sepulchre.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 The Jews angry with Nicodemus:<br>
     5 and with, Joseph of Arimathaea,<br>
     7 whom they imprison.</p>
<br>
<p>WHEN the unjust Jews heard<br>
that Joseph had begged and buried<br>
the body of Jesus, they sought<br>
after Nicodemus, and those fifteen<br>
men who had testified before the<br>
governor, that Jesus was not born<br>
through fornication, and other<br>
good persons who had shown any<br>
good actions towards him.</p>
<br>
<p>2  But when they all concealed<br>
themselves through fear of the<br>
Jews, Nicodemus alone showed<br>
himself to them, and said, How<br>
can such persons as these enter<br>
into the synagogue?</p>
<br>
<p>3  The Jews answered him, But<br>
how durst thou enter into the<br>
synagogue, who wast a confederate<br>
with Christ? Let thy lot be along<br>
with him in the other world.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Nicodemus answered, Amen;<br>
so may it be, that I may have<br>
my lot with him in his kingdom.</p>
<br>
<p>5  In like manner Joseph, when<br>
he came to the Jews, said to them,<br>
Why are ye angry with me for<br>
desiring the body of Jesus of<br>
Pilate? Behold, I have put him in<br>
my tomb, and wrapped him up in<br>
clean linen, and put a stone at the<br>
door of the sepulchre:</p>
<br>
<p>6  I have acted rightly towards<br>
him; but ye have acted unjustly<br>
against that just person, in<br>
crucifying him, giving him vinegar<br>
to drink, crowning him with thorns,<br>
tearing his body with whips, and<br>
praying down the guilt of his blood<br>
upon you.</p>
<br>
<p>7  The Jews at the hearing of<br>
this were disquieted and troubled;<br>
and they seized Joseph, and<br>
commanded him to be put in custody<br>
before the Sabbath, and kept there<br>
till the Sabbath was over.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And they said to him, Make<br>
confession; for at this time it is<br>
not lawful to do thee any harm,<br>
till the first day of the week come.<br>
But we know that thou wilt not be<br>
thought worthy of a burial; but<br>
we will give thy flesh to the birds<br>
of the air, and the beasts of the<br>
earth.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Joseph answered, That speech<br>
is like the speech of proud Goliath,<br>
who reproached the living God in<br>
speaking against David. But ye<br>
scribes and doctors know that God<br>
saith by the prophet, Vengeance is<br>
mine, and I will repay to you evil<br>
equal to that which ye have<br>
threatened to me.</p>
<br>
<p>10  The God whom you have<br>
hanged upon the cross, is able to<br>
deliver me out of your hands. All<br>
your wickedness will return upon<br>
you.</p>
<br>
<p>11  For the governor, when he<br>
washed his hands, said, I am clear<br>
from the blood of this just person.<br>
But ye answered and cried out,<br>
His blood be upon us and our<br>
children. According as ye have<br>
said, may ye perish for ever.</p>
<br>
<p>12  The elders of the Jews hearing<br>
these words, were exceedingly<br>
enraged; and seizing Joseph, they<br>
put him into a chamber where<br>
there was no window; they fastened<br>
the door, and put a seal upon<br>
the lock;</p>
<br>
<p>13  And Annas and Caiaphas placed<br>
a guard upon it, and took counsel<br>
with the priests and Levites,<br>
that they should all meet after<br>
the Sabbath, and they contrived<br>
to what death they should put Joseph.</p>
<br>
<p>14  When they had done this, the<br>
rulers, Annas and Caiaphas,<br>
ordered Joseph to be brought<br>
forth.</p>
<br>
<p>(In this place there is a portion<br>
of the Gospel lost or omitted.<br>
which cannot be supplied. It<br>
may, nevertheless, be surmised<br>
from the occurrence related in<br>
the next chapter, that the order<br>
of Annas and Caiaphas were rendered<br>
unnecessary by Joseph's miraculous<br>
escape, and which was announced<br>
to an assembly of people.)</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER X.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Joseph's escape.<br>
     2 The soldiers relate Christ's resurrection.<br>
     18 Christ is seen preaching in Galilee.<br>
     21 The Jews repent of their cruelty to him.</p>
<br>
<p>WHEN all the assembly heard<br>
this (about Joseph's escape),<br>
they admired and were astonished,<br>
because they found the same seal<br>
upon the lock of the chamber, and<br>
could not find Joseph.</p>
<br>
<p>2 Then Annas and Caiaphas went<br>
forth, and while they were all<br>
admiring at Joseph's being gone,<br>
behold one of the soldiers, who<br>
kept the sepulchre of Jesus, spake<br>
in the assembly,</p>
<br>
<p>3  That while they were guarding<br>
the sepulchre of Jesus, there was<br>
an earthquake; and we saw an angel<br>
of God roll away the stone of the<br>
sepulchre and sit upon it;</p>
<br>
<p>4  And his countenance was like<br>
lightning and his garment like<br>
snow; and we became through fear<br>
like persons dead.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And we heard an angel saying<br>
to the women at the sepulchre of<br>
Jesus, Do not fear; I know that<br>
you seek Jesus who was crucified;<br>
he is risen as he foretold;</p>
<br>
<p>6  Come and see the place where<br>
he was laid; and go presently, and<br>
tell his disciples that he is risen<br>
from the dead; and he will go before<br>
you into Galilee; there ye shall<br>
see him as he told you.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Then the Jews called together<br>
all the soldiers who kept the sepulchre<br>
of Jesus, and said to them, Who are<br>
those women, to whom the angel spoke?<br>
Why did ye not seize them.</p>
<br>
<p>8  The soldiers answered and said,<br>
We know not who the women were;<br>
besides we became as dead persons<br>
through fear, and how could we<br>
seize those women?</p>
<br>
<p>9  The Jews said to them, As the<br>
Lord liveth, we do not believe you;</p>
<br>
<p>10  The soldiers answering said to<br>
the Jews, when ye saw and heard<br>
Jesus working so many miracles,<br>
and did not believe him, how should<br>
ye believe us? Ye well said,<br>
As the Lord liveth, for the Lord<br>
truly does live.</p>
<br>
<p>11  We have heard that ye shut<br>
up Joseph, who buried the body of<br>
Jesus, in a chamber, under a lock<br>
which was sealed; and when ye<br>
opened it, found him not there.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Do ye then produce Joseph<br>
whom ye put under guard in the<br>
chamber, and we will produce<br>
Jesus whom we guarded in the<br>
sepulchre.</p>
<br>
<p>13  The Jews answered and said,<br>
We will produce Joseph, do ye<br>
produce Jesus. But Joseph is in<br>
his own city of Arimathaea.</p>
<br>
<p>14  The soldiers replied,<br>
If Joseph be in Arimathaea,<br>
and Jesus in Galilee, we heard<br>
the angel inform the women.</p>
<br>
<p>15  The Jews hearing this, were<br>
afraid, and said among themselves,<br>
If by any means these things<br>
should become public, then<br>
everybody will believe in Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Then they gathered a large<br>
sum of money, and gave it to the<br>
soldiers, saying, Do ye tell the<br>
people that the disciples of Jesus<br>
came in the night when ye were<br>
asleep, and stole away the body of<br>
Jesus; and if Pilate the governor<br>
should hear of this, we will satisfy<br>
him and secure you.</p>
<br>
<p>17  The soldiers accordingly took<br>
the money, and said as they were<br>
instructed by the Jews; and their<br>
report was spread abroad among<br>
all the people.</p>
<br>
<p>18  But a certain priest Phinees,<br>
Ada a schoolmaster, and a Levite,<br>
named Ageus, they three came from<br>
Galilee to Jerusalem, and told<br>
the chief priests and all who<br>
were in the synagogues, saying,</p>
<br>
<p>19  We have seen Jesus, whom<br>
ye crucified, talking with his<br>
eleven disciples, and sitting in the<br>
midst of them in Mount Olivet,<br>
and saying to them,</p>
<br>
<p>20  Go forth into the whole world,<br>
preach the Gospel to all nations,<br>
baptizing them in the name of the<br>
Father, and the Son, and the Holy<br>
Ghost; and whosoever shall believe<br>
and be baptized, shall be saved.</p>
<br>
<p>21  And when he had said these<br>
things to his disciples, we saw him<br>
ascending up to heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>22  When the chief priests and<br>
elders, and Levites heard these<br>
things, they said to these three<br>
men, Give glory to the God of<br>
Israel, and make confession to<br>
him, whether those things are true,<br>
which ye say ye have seen and heard.</p>
<br>
<p>23  They answering said, As the<br>
Lord of our fathers liveth, the<br>
God of Abraham, and the God of<br>
Isaac, and the God of Jacob,<br>
according as we heard Jesus talking<br>
with his disciples, and according<br>
as we saw him ascending up to<br>
heaven, so we have related the<br>
truth to you.</p>
<br>
<p>24  And the three men farther<br>
answered, and said, adding these<br>
words, If we should not own the<br>
words which we heard Jesus speak,<br>
and that we saw him ascending<br>
into heaven, we should be guilty<br>
of sin.</p>
<br>
<p>25  Then the chief priests<br>
immediately rose up, and holding<br>
the book of the law in their hands,<br>
conjured these men, saying, Ye<br>
shall no more hereafter declare<br>
those things which ye have spoken<br>
concerning Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>26  And they gave them a large<br>
sum of money, and sent other<br>
persons along with them, who<br>
should conduct them to their own<br>
country, that they might not by any<br>
means make any stay at Jerusalem.</p>
<br>
<p>27  Then the Jews did assemble<br>
all together, and having expressed<br>
the most lamentable concern said,<br>
What is this extraordinary thing<br>
which is come to pass in Jerusalem?</p>
<br>
<p>28  But Annas and Caiaphas comforted<br>
them, saying, Why should we believe<br>
the soldiers who guarded the sepulchre<br>
of Jesus, in telling us, that an angel<br>
rolled away the stone from the door<br>
of the sepulchre?</p>
<br>
<p>29  Perhaps his own disciples told<br>
them this, and gave them money<br>
that they should say so, and they<br>
themselves took away the body of Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>30  Besides, consider this, that<br>
there is no credit to be given to<br>
foreigners, because they also took<br>
a large sum of us, and they have<br>
declared to us according to the<br>
instructions which we gave them.<br>
They must either be faithful to us<br>
or to the disciples of Jesus.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Nicodemus counsels the Jews.<br>
     6 Joseph found.<br>
     11 Invited by the Jews to return.<br>
     19 Relates the manner of his miraculous escape.</p>
<br>
<p>THEN Nicodemus arose, and<br>
said, Ye say right, O sons of<br>
Israel; ye have heard what those<br>
three men have sworn by the Law<br>
of God, who said, We have seen<br>
Jesus speaking with his disciples<br>
upon mount Olivet, and we saw<br>
him ascending up to heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And the scripture teacheth<br>
us that the blessed prophet Elijah<br>
was taken up to heaven, and Elisha<br>
being asked by the sons of the<br>
prophets, Where is our father Elijah?<br>
He said to them, that he is taken up<br>
to heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And the sons of the prophets<br>
said to him, Perhaps the spirit<br>
hath carried him into one of the<br>
mountains of Israel, there perhaps<br>
we shall find him. And they besought<br>
Elisha, and he walked about with<br>
them three days, and they could<br>
not find him.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And now hear me, O sons of<br>
Israel, and let us send men into<br>
the mountains of Israel, lest<br>
perhaps the spirit hath carried<br>
away Jesus, and there perhaps we<br>
shall find him, and be satisfied.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And the counsel of Nicodemus<br>
pleased all the people; and they<br>
sent forth men who sought for Jesus,<br>
but could not find him; and they<br>
returning, said, We went all about,<br>
but could not find Jesus, but we<br>
have found Joseph in his city of<br>
Arimathaea.</p>
<br>
<p>6  The rulers hearing this, and<br>
all the people, were glad, and<br>
praised the God of Israel, because<br>
Joseph was found, whom they had<br>
shut up in a chamber, and could<br>
not find.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And when they had formed a<br>
large assembly, the chief priests<br>
said, By what means shall we bring<br>
Joseph to us to speak with him?</p>
<br>
<p>8  And taking a piece of paper,<br>
they wrote to him, and said, Peace<br>
be with thee, and all thy family,<br>
We know that we have offended<br>
against God and thee. Be pleased<br>
to give a visit to us, your fathers,<br>
for we were perfectly surprised at<br>
your escape from prison.</p>
<br>
<p>9  We know that it was malicious<br>
counsel which we took against<br>
thee, and that the Lord took care<br>
of thee, and the Lord himself<br>
delivered thee from our designs.<br>
Peace be unto thee, Joseph, who<br>
art honourable among all the<br>
people.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And they chose seven of<br>
Joseph's friends, and said to them,<br>
When ye come to Joseph, salute<br>
him in peace, and give him this<br>
letter.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Accordingly, when the men<br>
came to Joseph, they did salute<br>
him in peace, and gave him the<br>
letter.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And when Joseph had read it,<br>
he said, Blessed be the Lord God,<br>
who didst deliver me from the<br>
Israelites, that they could not<br>
shed my blood. Blessed be God,<br>
who hast protected me under thy<br>
wings.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And Joseph kissed them, and<br>
took them into his house. And on<br>
the morrow, Joseph mounted his<br>
ass, and went along with them to<br>
Jerusalem.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And when all the Jews heard<br>
these things, they went out to<br>
meet him, and cried out, saying,<br>
Peace attend thy coming hither,<br>
father Joseph.</p>
<br>
<p>15  To which he answered,<br>
Prosperity from the Lord attend<br>
all the people.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And they all kissed him; and<br>
Nicodemus took him to his house,<br>
having prepared a large<br>
entertainment.</p>
<br>
<p>17  But on the morrow, being<br>
a preparation-day, Annas, and<br>
Caiaphas, and Nicodemus, said to<br>
Joseph, Make confession to the<br>
God of Israel, and answer to us<br>
all those questions which we shall<br>
ask thee;</p>
<br>
<p>18  For we have been very much<br>
troubled, that thou didst bury the<br>
body of Jesus; and that when we<br>
had locked thee in a chamber, we<br>
could not find thee; and we have<br>
been afraid ever since, till this<br>
time of thy appearing among us.<br>
Tell us therefore before God, all<br>
that came to pass.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Then Joseph answering,<br>
said Ye did indeed put me under<br>
confinement, on the day of<br>
preparation, till the morning.</p>
<br>
<p>20  But while I was standing at<br>
prayer in the middle of the night,<br>
the house was surrounded with<br>
four angels; and I saw Jesus as<br>
the brightness of the sun, and fell<br>
down upon the earth for fear.</p>
<br>
<p>21  But Jesus laying hold on my<br>
hand, lifted me from the ground,<br>
and the dew was then sprinkled<br>
upon me; but he, wiping my face,<br>
kissed me, and said unto me, Fear<br>
not, Joseph; look upon me for<br>
it is I.</p>
<br>
<p>22  Then I looked upon him, and<br>
said, Rabboni Elias! He answered<br>
me, I am not Elias, but Jesus of<br>
Nazareth, whose body thou didst<br>
bury.</p>
<br>
<p>23  I said to him, show me the<br>
tomb in which I laid thee.</p>
<br>
<p>24  Then Jesus, taking me by the<br>
hand, led me unto the place where<br>
I laid him, and showed me the<br>
linen clothes, and napkin which I<br>
put round his head. Then I knew<br>
that it was Jesus, and worshipped<br>
him, and said; Blessed be he who<br>
cometh in the name of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>25  Jesus again taking me by the<br>
hand, led me to Arimathaea, to my<br>
own house, and said to me, Peace<br>
be to thee; but go not out of thy<br>
house till the fortieth day; but<br>
I must go to my disciples.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 The Jews astonished and confounded.<br>
     16 Simeon's two sons, Charinus and Lenthius,<br>
     rise from the dead at Christ's crucifixion.<br>
     19 Joseph proposes to get them to relate the<br>
     mysteries of their resurrection.<br>
     21 They are sought and found,<br>
     22 brought to the synagogue,<br>
     23 privately sworn to secrecy,<br>
     25 and undertake to write what they had seen.</p>
<br>
<p>WHEN the chief priests and<br>
Levites heard all these<br>
things, they were astonished, and<br>
fell down with their faces on the<br>
ground as dead men, and crying<br>
out to one another, said, What is<br>
this extraordinary sign which is<br>
come to pass in Jerusalem? We<br>
know the father and mother of<br>
Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And a certain Levite said,<br>
I know many of his relations,<br>
religions persons, who are wont to<br>
offer sacrifices and burnt-offerings<br>
to the God of Israel, in the temple,<br>
with prayers.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And when the high-priest<br>
Simeon took him up in his arms,<br>
he said to him, Lord, now lettest<br>
thou thy servant depart in peace,<br>
according to thy word; for mine<br>
eyes have seen thy salvation,<br>
which then halt prepared before<br>
the face of all people; a light to<br>
enlighten the Gentiles, and the<br>
glory of thy people Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Simeon in like manner blessed<br>
Mary the Mother of Jesus, and<br>
said to her, I declare to thee<br>
concerning that child; He is<br>
appointed for the fall and rising<br>
again of many, and for a sign<br>
which shall be spoken against;</p>
<br>
<p>5  Yea, a sword shall pierce<br>
through thine own soul also, and<br>
the thoughts of many hearts shall<br>
he revealed.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Then said all the Jews, Let<br>
us send to those three men, who<br>
said they saw him talking with<br>
his disciples in mount Olivet.</p>
<br>
<p>7  After this, they asked them<br>
what they had seen; who answered<br>
with one accord, In the presence<br>
of the God of Israel we affirm,<br>
that we plainly saw Jesus talking<br>
with his disciples in Mount Olivet,<br>
and ascending up to heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Then Annas and Caiaphas took<br>
them into separate places, and<br>
examined them separately; who<br>
unanimously confessed the truth,<br>
and said, they had seen Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Then Annas and Caiaphas said<br>
"Our law saith, By the mouth of<br>
two or three witnesses every word<br>
shall be established."</p>
<br>
<p>10  But what have we said?<br>
The blessed Enoch pleased God,<br>
and was translated by the word of<br>
God; and the burying-place of the<br>
blessed Moses is known.</p>
<br>
<p>11  But Jesus was delivered to<br>
Pilate, whipped, crowned with<br>
thorns, spit upon, pierced with a<br>
spear, crucified, died upon the<br>
cross, and was buried, and his<br>
body the honourable Joseph buried<br>
in a new sepulchre, and he testifies<br>
that he saw him alive.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And besides, these men have<br>
declared, that they saw him talking<br>
with his disciples in Mount Olivet,<br>
and ascending up to heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Then Joseph rising up, said<br>
to Annas and Caiaphas, Ye may be<br>
justly under a great surprise,<br>
that you have been told, that<br>
Jesus is alive, and gone up to<br>
heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>14  It is indeed a thing really<br>
surprising, that he should not<br>
only himself arise from the dead,<br>
but also raise others from their<br>
graves, who have been seen by<br>
many in Jerusalem.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And now hear me a little<br>
We all knew the blessed Simeon,<br>
the high-priest, who took Jesus<br>
when an infant into his arms in<br>
the temple.</p>
<br>
<p>16  This same Simeon had two sons<br>
of his own, and we were all present<br>
at their death and funeral.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Go therefore and see their<br>
tombs, for these are open, and<br>
they are risen: and behold, they<br>
are in the city of Arimathaea,<br>
spending their time together in<br>
offices of devotion.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Some, indeed, have heard<br>
the sound of their voices in prayer,<br>
but they will not discourse with<br>
anyone, but they continue as mute<br>
as dead men.</p>
<br>
<p>19  But come, let us go to them,<br>
and behave ourselves towards them<br>
with all due respect and caution.<br>
And if we can bring them to swear,<br>
perhaps they will tell us some of<br>
the mysteries of their resurrection.</p>
<br>
<p>20  When the Jews heard this<br>
they were exceedingly rejoiced.</p>
<br>
<p>21  Then Annas and Caiaphas,<br>
Nicodemus, Joseph, and Gamaliel,<br>
went to Arimathaea, but did not<br>
find them in their graves; but<br>
walking about the city, they found<br>
them on their bended knees at<br>
their devotions:</p>
<br>
<p>22  Then saluting them with all<br>
respect and deference to God, they<br>
brought them to the synagogue at<br>
Jerusalem; and having shut the<br>
gates, they took the book of the<br>
law of the Lord,</p>
<br>
<p>23  And putting it in their hands,<br>
swore them by God Adonai, and<br>
the God of Israel, who spake to<br>
our fathers by the law and the<br>
prophets, saying, If ye believe<br>
him who raised you from the dead,<br>
to be Jesus, tell us what ye have<br>
seen, and how ye were raised from<br>
the dead.</p>
<br>
<p>24 Charinus and Lenthius, the<br>
two sons of Simeon, trembled<br>
when they heard these things, and<br>
were disturbed, and groaned; and<br>
at the same time looking up to<br>
heaven, they made the sign of the<br>
cross with their fingers on their<br>
tongues,</p>
<br>
<p>25  And immediately they spake,<br>
and said, Give each of us some<br>
paper, and we will write down for<br>
you all those things which we have<br>
seen. And they each sat down<br>
and wrote, saying:--</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 The narrative of Charinus and Lenthius commences.<br>
     3 A great light in hell.<br>
     7 Simeon arrives, and announces the coming of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>O LORD Jesus and Father, who<br>
art God, also the resurrection<br>
and life of the dead, give us<br>
leave to declare thy mysteries,<br>
which we saw after death, belonging<br>
to thy cross; for we are sworn by<br>
thy name.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For thou hast forbidden thy<br>
servants to declare the secret<br>
things, which were wrought by<br>
thy divine power in hell.</p>
<br>
<p>3  When we were Placed with<br>
our fathers in the dept of hell,<br>
in the blackness of darkness,<br>
on a sudden there appeared the<br>
colour of the sun like gold,<br>
and a substantial purple-coloured<br>
light enlightening the place.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Presently upon this, Adam,<br>
the father of all mankind, with<br>
all the patriarchs and prophets,<br>
rejoiced and said, That light is the<br>
author of everlasting light, who<br>
hath promised to translate us to<br>
everlasting light.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Then Isaiah the prophet cried<br>
out and said, This is the light<br>
of the Father, and the Son of God,<br>
according to my prophecy, when I<br>
was alive upon earth.</p>
<br>
<p>6  The land of Zabulon, and the<br>
land of Nephthalim, beyond Jordan,<br>
a people who walked in darkness,<br>
saw a great light; and to them<br>
who dwelled in the region of the<br>
shadow of death, light is arisen.<br>
And now he is come, and hath<br>
enlightened us who sat in death.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And while we were all rejoicing<br>
in the light which shone upon us,<br>
our father Simeon came among us,<br>
and congratulating all the company,<br>
said, Glorify the Lord Jesus Christ<br>
the Son of God.</p>
<br>
<p>8 Whom I took up in my arms when<br>
an infant in the temple, and<br>
being moved by the Holy Ghost,<br>
said to him, and acknowledged,<br>
That now mine eyes have seen thy<br>
salvation, which thou hast prepared<br>
before the face of all people; a<br>
light to enlighten the Gentiles,<br>
and the glory of thy people Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>9  All the saints who were in<br>
the depth of hell, hearing this,<br>
rejoiced the more.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Afterwards there came forth<br>
one like a little hermit, and was<br>
asked by every one, Who art thou?</p>
<br>
<p>11  To which he replied, I am<br>
the voice of one crying in the<br>
wilderness, John the Baptist, and<br>
the prophet of the Most High, who<br>
went before his coming to prepare<br>
his way, to give the knowledge of<br>
salvation to his people for the<br>
forgiveness of sins.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And I, John, when I saw<br>
Jesus coming to me, being moved<br>
by the Holy Ghost, I said, Behold<br>
the Lamb of God, behold him who<br>
takes away the sins of the world.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And I baptized him in the<br>
river Jordan, and saw the Holy<br>
Ghost descending upon him in the<br>
form of a dove, and heard a voice<br>
from heaven saying, This is my<br>
beloved Son, in whom I am well<br>
pleased.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And now while I was going<br>
before him, I came down hither to<br>
acquaint you, that the Son of God<br>
will next visit us, and, as the<br>
day-spring from on high, will come to<br>
us, who are in darkness and the<br>
shadow of death.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Adam causes Seth to relate what he heard<br>
     from Michael the archangel, when he sent him<br>
     to Paradise to entreat God to anoint his<br>
     head in his sickness.</p>
<br>
<p>BUT when the first man our father<br>
Adam heard these things, that<br>
Jesus was baptized in Jordan,<br>
he called out to his son Seth,<br>
and said,</p>
<br>
<p>2  Declare to your sons, the<br>
patriarchs and prophets, all those<br>
things, which thou didst hear from<br>
Michael, the archangel, when I<br>
sent thee to the gates of Paradise,<br>
to entreat God that he would<br>
annoint my head when I was sick.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Then Seth, coming near to the<br>
patriarchs and prophets, said, I,<br>
Seth, when I was praying to God<br>
at the gates of Paradise, beheld<br>
the angel of the Lord, Michael,<br>
appear unto me, saying, I am sent<br>
unto thee from the Lord; I am<br>
appointed to preside over human<br>
bodies.</p>
<br>
<p>4  I tell thee, Seth, do not pray<br>
to God in tears, and entreat him<br>
for the oil of the tree of mercy<br>
wherewith to anoint thy father<br>
Adam for his head-ache;</p>
<br>
<p>5  Because thou canst not by any<br>
means obtain it till the last day<br>
and times, namely, till five thousand<br>
and five hundred years be past.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Then will Christ, the most<br>
merciful Son of God, come on<br>
earth to raise again the human<br>
body of Adam, and at the same<br>
time to raise the bodies of the<br>
dead, and when he cometh he will<br>
be baptized in Jordan;</p>
<br>
<p>7  Then with the oil of his<br>
mercyhe will anoint all those<br>
who believe in him; and the oil<br>
of his mercy will continue to<br>
future generations, for those<br>
who shall be born of the water<br>
and the Holy Ghost unto eternal<br>
life.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And when at that time the<br>
most merciful Son of God, Christ<br>
Jesus, shall come down on earth,<br>
he will introduce our father Adam<br>
into Paradise, to the tree of mercy.</p>
<br>
<p>9 When all the patriarchs and<br>
prophets heard all these things<br>
from Seth, they rejoiced more.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Quarrel between Satan and the prince of hell,<br>
     concerning the expected arrival of Christ in hell.</p>
<br>
<p>WHILE all the saints were<br>
rejoicing, behold Satan, the<br>
prince and captain of death, said<br>
to the prince of hell,</p>
<br>
<p>2  Prepare to receive Jesus of<br>
Nazareth himself, who boasted<br>
that he was the Son of God, and<br>
yet was a man afraid of death, and<br>
said, My soul is sorrowful even to<br>
death.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Besides he did many injuries<br>
to me and to many others; for<br>
those whom I made blind and lame<br>
and those also whom I tormented<br>
with several devils, he cured by<br>
his word; yea, and those whom I<br>
brought dead to thee, he by force<br>
takes away from thee.</p>
<br>
<p>4  To this the prince of hell<br>
replied to Satan, Who is that so<br>
powerful prince, and yet a man who<br>
is afraid of death?</p>
<br>
<p>5  For all the potentates of the<br>
earth are subject to my power,<br>
whom thou broughtest to subjection<br>
by thy power.</p>
<br>
<p>6  But if he be so powerful in his<br>
human nature, I affirm to thee for<br>
truth, that he is almighty in his<br>
divine nature, and no man can<br>
resist his power:</p>
<br>
<p>7  When therefore he said he was<br>
afraid of death, he designed to<br>
ensnare thee, and unhappy it will be<br>
to thee for everlasting ages,</p>
<br>
<p>8  Then Satan replying, said to<br>
the prince of hell, Why didst thou<br>
express a doubt, and wast afraid to<br>
receive that Jesus of Nazareth,<br>
both thy adversary and mine?</p>
<br>
<p>9  As for me, I tempted him and<br>
stirred up my old people the Jews<br>
with zeal and anger against him;</p>
<br>
<p>10  I sharpened the spear for his<br>
suffering; I mixed the gall and<br>
vinegar, and commanded that he<br>
should drink it; I prepared the<br>
cross to crucify him, and the nails<br>
to pierce through his hands and<br>
feet; and now his death is near<br>
at hand, I will bring him hither,<br>
subject both to thee and me.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Then the prince of hell<br>
answering, said, Thou saidst to me<br>
just now, that he took away the<br>
dead from me by force.</p>
<br>
<p>12  They who have been kept here<br>
till they should live again upon<br>
earth, were taken away hence,<br>
not by their own power, but by<br>
prayers made to God, and their<br>
almighty God took them from me.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Who then is that Jesus of<br>
Nazareth that by his word hath<br>
taken away the dead from me<br>
without prayer to God?</p>
<br>
<p>14  Perhaps it is the same who<br>
took away from me Lazarus, after<br>
he had been four days dead, and<br>
did both stink and was rotten, and<br>
of whom I had possession as a dead<br>
person, yet he brought him to life<br>
again by his power.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Satan answering, replied to<br>
the prince of hell, It is the very<br>
same person, Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Which when the prince of hell<br>
heard, he said to him, I adjure<br>
thee by the powers which belong<br>
to thee and me, that thou bring<br>
him not to me.</p>
<br>
<p>17  For when I heard of the power<br>
of his word, I trembled for fear,<br>
and all my impious company were<br>
at the same disturbed;</p>
<br>
<p>18  And we were not able to detain<br>
Lazarus, but he gave himself a<br>
shake, and with all the signs of<br>
malice he immediately went away<br>
from us; and the very earth, in<br>
which the dead body of Lazarus<br>
was lodged, presently turned him<br>
out alive.</p>
<br>
<p>19  And I know now that he is<br>
Almighty God who could perform<br>
such things, who is mighty in his<br>
dominion, and mighty in his human<br>
nature, who is the Saviour of<br>
mankind.</p>
<br>
<p>20  Bring not therefore this person<br>
hither, for he will set at liberty<br>
all those whom I hold in prison<br>
under unbelief, and bound with<br>
the fetters of their sins, and will<br>
conduct them to everlasting life.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Christ's arrival at hell-gates;<br>
     the confusion thereupon.<br>
     19 He descends into hell.</p>
<br>
<p>AND while Satan and the Prince<br>
of hell were discoursing thus<br>
to each other, on a sudden there<br>
was a voice as of thunder, and the<br>
rushing of winds, saying, Lift up<br>
your gates, O ye princes; and be<br>
ye lift up, O everlasting gates,<br>
and the King of Glory shall come in.</p>
<br>
<p>2  When the prince of hell heard<br>
this, he said to Satan, Depart from<br>
me, and begone out of my habitations;<br>
if thou art a powerful warrior,<br>
fight with the King of Glory.<br>
But what hast thou to do with<br>
him?</p>
<br>
<p>3  And he cast him forth from his<br>
habitations.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And the prince said to his<br>
impious officers, Shut the brass gates<br>
of cruelty, and make them fast with<br>
iron bars, and fight courageously,<br>
lest we be taken captives.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But when all the company of<br>
the saints heard this they spake<br>
with a loud voice of anger to the<br>
prince of hell,</p>
<br>
<p>6  Open thy gates, that the King<br>
of Glory may come in.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And the divine prophet David<br>
cried out, saying, Did not I, when<br>
on earth, truly prophesy and say,<br>
O that men would praise the Lord<br>
for his goodness, and for his<br>
wonderful works to the children<br>
of men!</p>
<br>
<p>8  For he hath broken the gates<br>
of brass, and cut the bars of iron<br>
in sunder. He hath taken them<br>
because of their iniquity, and<br>
because of their unrighteousness<br>
they are afflicted.</p>
<br>
<p>9  After this, another prophet,<br>
namely, holy Isaiah, spake in like<br>
manner to all the saints, Did not<br>
I rightly prophesy to you when I<br>
was alive on earth?</p>
<br>
<p>10  The dead men shall live, and<br>
they shall rise again who are in<br>
their graves, and they shall rejoice<br>
who are in the earth; for the dew<br>
which is from the Lord, shall<br>
bring deliverance to them.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And I said in another place,<br>
O grave, where is thy victory?<br>
O death, where is thy sting?</p>
<br>
<p>12  When all the saints heard<br>
these things spoken by Isaiah,<br>
they said to the prince of hell,<br>
Open now thy gates, and take<br>
away thine iron bars; for thou<br>
wilt now be bound, and have no<br>
power.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Then was there a great voice,<br>
as of the sound of thunder, saying,<br>
Lift up your gates, O princes; and<br>
be ye lifted up, ye gates of hell,<br>
and the King of Glory will enter<br>
in.</p>
<br>
<p>14  The prince of hell perceiving<br>
the same voice repeated, cried out,<br>
as though he had been ignorant,<br>
Who is that King of Glory?</p>
<br>
<p>15  David replied to the prince<br>
of hell, and said, I understand the<br>
words of that voice, because I<br>
spake them in his spirit. And now,<br>
as I have before said, I say unto<br>
thee, the Lord strong and powerful,<br>
the Lord mighty in battle: he is<br>
the King of Glory, and he is the<br>
Lord in heaven and in earth.</p>
<br>
<p>16  He hath looked down to hear<br>
the groans of the prisoners, and to<br>
set loose those that are appointed<br>
to death.</p>
<br>
<p>17  And now, thou filthy and<br>
stinking prince of hell, open thy<br>
gates, that the King of Glory may<br>
enter in; for he is the Lord of<br>
heaven and earth.</p>
<br>
<p>18  While David was saying this,<br>
the mighty Lord appeared in the<br>
form of a man, and enlightened<br>
those places which had ever before<br>
been in darkness.</p>
<br>
<p>19  And broke asunder the fetters<br>
which before could not be broken;<br>
and with his invincible power<br>
visited those who sate in the deep<br>
darkness by iniquity, and the shadow<br>
of death by sin.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Death and the devils in great horror<br>
     at Christ's coming.<br>
     13 He tramples on death, seizes the prince<br>
     of hell, and takes Adam with him to Heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>IMPIOUS death and her cruel<br>
officers hearing these things,<br>
were seized with fear in their<br>
several kingdoms, when they saw<br>
the clearness of the light,</p>
<br>
<p>2  And Christ himself on a sudden<br>
appearing in their habitations,<br>
they cried out therefore, and said,<br>
We are bound by thee; thou seemest<br>
to intend our confusion before<br>
the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Who art thou, who has no signs<br>
of corruption, but that bright<br>
appearance which is a full proof of<br>
thy greatness, of which yet thou<br>
seemest to take no notice?</p>
<br>
<p>4  Who art thou, so powerful,<br>
and so weak, so great and so little;<br>
mean, and yet a soldier of the first<br>
rank, who can command in the form<br>
of a servant and a common soldier?</p>
<br>
<p>5  The king of Glory, dead and<br>
alive, though once slain upon the<br>
cross?</p>
<br>
<p>6  Who layest dead in the grave,<br>
and art come down alive to us,<br>
and in thy death all the creatures<br>
trembled, and all the stars were<br>
moved; and now hast thy liberty<br>
among the dead, and givest<br>
disturbance to our legions?</p>
<br>
<p>7  Who art thou, who dost release<br>
the captives that were held<br>
in chains by original sin, and<br>
bringest them into their former<br>
liberty?</p>
<br>
<p>8  Who art thou, who dost spread<br>
so glorious and divine a light over<br>
those who were made blind by the<br>
darkness of sin?</p>
<br>
<p>9  In like manner all the legions<br>
of devils were seized with the like<br>
horror, and with the most submissive<br>
fear cried out, and said,</p>
<br>
<p>10  Whence comes it, O thou<br>
Jesus Christ, that thou art a man<br>
so powerful and glorious in majesty<br>
so bright as to have no spot, and<br>
so pure as to have no crime? For<br>
that lower world of earth, which<br>
was ever till now subject to us,<br>
and from whence we received<br>
tribute, never sent us such a<br>
dead man before, never sent such<br>
presents as these to the princes of<br>
hell.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Who therefore art thou, who<br>
with such courage enterest among<br>
our abodes, and art not only not<br>
afraid to threaten us with the<br>
greatest punishments, but also<br>
endeavourest to rescue all others<br>
from the chains in which we hold<br>
them?</p>
<br>
<p>12  Perhaps thou art that Jesus,<br>
of whom Satan just now spoke to<br>
our prince, that by the death of<br>
the cross thou wert about to<br>
receive the power of death.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Then the King of Glory<br>
trampling upon death, seized the<br>
prince of hell, deprived him of all<br>
his power, and took our earthly<br>
father Adam with him to his glory.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Beelzebub, prince of hell, vehemently upbraids Satan for<br>
     persecuting Christ and bringing him to hell.<br>
     14 Christ gives Beelzebub dominion over Satan forever,<br>
     as a recompence for taking away Adam and his sons.</p>
<br>
<p>THEN the prince of hell took<br>
Satan, and with great indignation<br>
said to him, O thou prince of<br>
destruction, author of Beelzebub's<br>
defeat and banishment, the scorn<br>
of God's angels and loathed by all<br>
righteous persons! What inclined<br>
thee to act thus?</p>
<br>
<p>2  Thou wouldst crucify the King<br>
of Glory, and by his destruction,<br>
hast made us promises of very<br>
large advantages, but as a fool<br>
wert ignorant of what thou wast<br>
about.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For behold now that Jesus of<br>
Nazareth, with the brightness of<br>
his glorious divinity, puts to flight<br>
all the horrid powers of darkness<br>
and death;</p>
<br>
<p>4  He has broke down our prisons<br>
from top to bottom, dismissed<br>
all the captives, released all<br>
who were bound, and all who were<br>
wont formerly to groan under the<br>
weight of their torments, have<br>
now insulted us, and we are like<br>
to be defeated by their prayers.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Our impious dominions are<br>
subdued, and no part of mankind<br>
is now left in our subjection, but<br>
on the other hand, they all boldly<br>
defy us;</p>
<br>
<p>6  Though, before, the dead never<br>
durst behave themselves insolently<br>
towards us, nor being prisoners,<br>
could ever on any occasion be<br>
merry.</p>
<br>
<p>7  O Satan, thou prince of all<br>
the wicked, father of the impious<br>
and abandoned, why wouldest thou<br>
attempt this exploit, seeing our<br>
prisoners were hitherto always<br>
without the least hope of<br>
salvation and life?</p>
<br>
<p>8  But now there is not one of<br>
them does ever groan, nor is there<br>
the least appearance of a tear in<br>
any of their faces.</p>
<br>
<p>9  O prince Satan, thou great<br>
keeper of the infernal regions,<br>
all thy advantages which thou didst<br>
acquire by the forbidden tree, and<br>
the loss of Paradise, thou hast<br>
now lost by the wood of the<br>
cross;</p>
<br>
<p>10  And thy happiness all then<br>
expired, when thou didst crucify<br>
Jesus Christ the King of Glory.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Thou hast acted against thine<br>
own interest and mine, as thou<br>
wilt presently perceive by those<br>
large torments and infinite<br>
punishments which thou art<br>
about to suffer.</p>
<br>
<p>12 O Satan, prince of all evil,<br>
author of death, and source of all<br>
pride, thou shouldest first have<br>
inquired into the evil crimes of<br>
Jesus of Nazareth, and then thou<br>
wouldest have found that he was<br>
guilty of no fault worthy of death.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Why didst thou venture,<br>
without either reason or justice,<br>
to crucify him, and hast brought<br>
down to our regions a person<br>
innocent and righteous, and thereby<br>
hast lost all the sinners, impious<br>
and unrighteous persons in the<br>
whole world?</p>
<br>
<p>14  While the prince of hell was<br>
thus speaking to Satan, the King<br>
of Glory said to Beelzebub the<br>
prince of hell, Satan the prince<br>
shall he subject to thy dominions<br>
for ever, in the room of Adam and<br>
his righteous sons, who are mine,</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Christ takes Adam by the hand,<br>
     the rest of the saints join hands,<br>
     and they all ascend with him to Paradise.</p>
<br>
<p>THEN Jesus stretched forth his<br>
hand, and said, Come to me,<br>
all ye my saints, who were created<br>
in my image, who were condemned<br>
by the tree of the forbidden fruit,<br>
and by the devil and death;</p>
<br>
<p>2  Live now by the wood of my<br>
cross; the devil, the prince of this<br>
world, is overcome, and death is<br>
conquered,</p>
<br>
<p>3  Then presently all the saints<br>
were joined together under the<br>
hand of the most high God; and<br>
the Lord Jesus laid hold on Adam's<br>
hand, and said to him, Peace be<br>
to thee, and all thy righteous<br>
posterity, which is mine.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Then Adam, casting himself<br>
at the feet of Jesus, addressed<br>
himself to him with tears, in<br>
humble language, and a loud voice,<br>
saying,</p>
<br>
<p>5  "I will extol thee, O Lord, for<br>
thou halt lifted me up, and hast<br>
not made my foes to rejoice over<br>
me. O Lord my God, I cried<br>
unto thee, and thou hast healed<br>
me."</p>
<br>
<p>6  "O Lord thou hast brought up<br>
my soul from the grave; thou<br>
hast kept me alive, that I should<br>
not go down to the pit."</p>
<br>
<p>7  "Sing unto the Lord, all ye<br>
saints of his, and give thanks at<br>
the remembrance of his holiness,<br>
for his anger endureth but for a<br>
moment; in his favour is life."</p>
<br>
<p>8  In like manner all the saints,<br>
prostrate at the feet of Jesus,<br>
said with one voice, Thou art come,<br>
O Redeemer of the world, and hast<br>
actually accomplished all things,<br>
which thou didst foretell by the<br>
law and thy holy prophets.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Thou hast redeemed the living<br>
by thy cross, and art come down<br>
to us, that by the death of the<br>
cross thou mightest deliver us<br>
from hell, and by thy power from<br>
death.</p>
<br>
<p>10  O Lord, as thou hast put the<br>
ensigns of thy glory in heaven,<br>
and hast set up the sign of thy<br>
redemption, even thy cross on earth;<br>
so, Lord, set the sign of the victory<br>
of thy cross in hell, that death<br>
may have dominion no longer.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Then the Lord stretching<br>
forth his hand, made the sign of<br>
the cross upon Adam, and upon<br>
all his saints.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And taking hold of Adam by<br>
his right hand, he ascended from<br>
hell, and all the saints of God<br>
followed him.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Then the royal prophet, David,<br>
boldly cried, and said, O sing<br>
unto the Lord a new song, for he<br>
hath done marvellous things; his<br>
right hand and his holy arm have<br>
gotten him the victory.</p>
<br>
<p>14  The Lord hath made known<br>
his salvation, his righteousness<br>
hath he openly shewn in the sight<br>
of the heathen.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And the whole multitude of<br>
saints answered, saying, This<br>
honour have all his saints, Amen,<br>
Praise ye the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Afterwards, the prophet<br>
Habbakuk cried out, and said,<br>
Thou wentest forth for the salvation<br>
of thy people, even for salvation<br>
with thine anointed.</p>
<br>
<p>17  And all the saints said,<br>
Blessed is he who cometh in the<br>
name of the Lord; for the Lord<br>
hath enlightened us. This is our<br>
God for ever and ever; he shall<br>
reign over us to everlasting ages.<br>
Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>18  In like manner all the prophets<br>
spake the sacred things of his<br>
praise, and followed the Lord.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Christ delivers Adam to Michael the archangel.<br>
     3 They meet Enoch and Elijah in heaven,<br>
     5 and also the blessed thief, who relates<br>
     how he came to Paradise.</p>
<br>
<p>THEN the Lord, holding Adam<br>
by the hand, delivered him<br>
to Michael the archangel; and he<br>
led them into Paradise, filled with<br>
mercy and glory;</p>
<br>
<p>2  And two very ancient men<br>
met them, and were asked by the<br>
saints, Who are ye, who have not<br>
yet been with us in hell, and have<br>
had your bodies placed in Paradise?</p>
<br>
<p>3  One of them answering, said,<br>
I am Enoch, who was translated<br>
by the word of God: and this man<br>
who is with me, is Elijah the<br>
Tishbite, who was translated in a<br>
fiery chariot.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Here we have hitherto been,<br>
and have not tasted death, but are<br>
now about to return at the coming<br>
of Antichrist, being armed with<br>
divine signs and miracles, to<br>
engage with him in battle, and to be<br>
slain by him at Jerusalem, and to<br>
be taken up alive again into the<br>
clouds, after three days and a<br>
half.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And while the holy Enoch<br>
and Elias were relating this,<br>
behold there came another man in a<br>
miserable figure, carrying the sign<br>
of the cross upon his shoulders.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And when all the saints saw<br>
him, they said to him, Who art<br>
thou? For thy countenance is like<br>
a thief's; and why dost thou carry<br>
a cross upon thy shoulders?</p>
<br>
<p>7  To which he answering, said,<br>
Ye say right, for I was a thief,<br>
who committed all sorts of wicked.<br>
ness upon earth.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And the Jews crucified me<br>
with Jesus; and I observed the<br>
surprising things which happened<br>
in the creation at the crucifixion<br>
of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And I believed him to be the<br>
Creator of all things, and the<br>
Almighty King; and I prayed to<br>
him, saying, Lord remember me,<br>
when thou comest into thy kingdom.</p>
<br>
<p>10  He presently regarded my<br>
supplication, and said to me,<br>
Verily I say unto thee, this day<br>
thou shalt be with me in Paradise.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And he gave me this sign of<br>
the cross, saying, Carry this, and<br>
go to Paradise; and if the angel<br>
who is the guard of Paradise will<br>
not admit thee, show him the sign<br>
of the cross, and say unto him<br>
Jesus Christ who is now crucified,<br>
hath sent me hither to thee.</p>
<br>
<p>12  When I did this and told the<br>
angel who is the guard of Paradise<br>
all these things, and he heard<br>
them, he presently opened the<br>
gates, introduced me, and placed<br>
me on the right hand in Paradise,</p>
<br>
<p>13  Saying, Stay here a little<br>
time, till Adam, the father of all<br>
mankind, shall enter in, with all<br>
his sons, who are the holy and<br>
righteous servants of Jesus Christ,<br>
who was crucified.</p>
<br>
<p>14  When they heard all this<br>
account from the thief, all the<br>
patriarchs said with one voice,<br>
Blessed be thou, O Almighty God,<br>
the Father of everlasting goodness,<br>
and the Father of mercies, who hast<br>
shown such favour to those who were<br>
sinners against him, and hast<br>
brought them to the mercy of<br>
Paradise, and hast placed them<br>
amidst thy large and spiritual<br>
provisions, in a spiritual and<br>
holy life.  Amen.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Charinus and Lenthius being only allowed<br>
     three days to remain on earth,<br>
     7 deliver in their narratives, which miraculously<br>
     correspond; they vanish,<br>
     13 and Pilate records these transactions.</p>
<br>
<p>THESE are the divine and<br>
sacred mysteries which we saw<br>
and heard. We, Charinus and<br>
Lenthius are not allowed to declare<br>
the other mysteries of God, as the<br>
archangel Michael ordered us,</p>
<br>
<p>2  Saying, ye shall go with my<br>
brethren to Jerusalem, and shall<br>
continue in prayers, declaring and<br>
glorifying the resurrection of<br>
Jesus Christ, seeing he hath raised<br>
you from the dead at the same<br>
time with himself.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And ye shall not talk with<br>
any man, but sit as dumb persons<br>
till the time come when the Lord<br>
will allow you to relate the<br>
mysteries of his divinity.</p>
<br>
<p>4  The archangel Michael farther<br>
commanded us to go beyond Jordan,<br>
to an excellent and fat country,<br>
where there are many who rose<br>
from the dead along with us<br>
for the proof of the resurrection<br>
of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>5  For we have only three days<br>
allowed us from the dead, who<br>
arose to celebrate the passover of<br>
our Lord with our parents, and to<br>
bear our testimony for Christ the<br>
Lord, and we have been baptized<br>
in the holy river of Jordan. And<br>
now they are not seen by any one.</p>
<br>
<p>6  This is as much as God allowed<br>
us to relate to you; give ye<br>
therefore praise and honour to<br>
him, and repent, and he will have<br>
mercy upon you. Peace be to you<br>
from the Lord God Jesus Christ,<br>
and the Saviour of us all. Amen,<br>
Amen, Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And after they had made an<br>
end of writing, and had written<br>
on two distinct pieces of paper,<br>
Charinus gave what he wrote into the<br>
hands of Annas, and Caiaphas, and<br>
Gamaliel.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Lenthius likewise gave what<br>
be wrote into the hands of Nicodemus<br>
and Joseph; and immediately they<br>
were changed into exceeding white<br>
forms and were seen no more.</p>
<br>
<p>9  But what they had written<br>
was found perfectly to agree, the<br>
one not containing one letter more<br>
or less than the other.</p>
<br>
<p>10  When all the assembly of the<br>
Jews heard all these surprising<br>
relations of Charinus and Lenthius,<br>
they said to each other, Truly all<br>
these things were wrought by<br>
God, and blessed be the Lord Jesus<br>
for ever and ever, Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And they went all out with<br>
great concern, and fear, and<br>
trembling, and smote upon their<br>
breasts and went away every one<br>
to his home.</p>
<br>
<p>12  But immediately all these<br>
things which were related by the<br>
Jews in their synagogues concerning<br>
Jesus, were presently told by Joseph<br>
and Nicodemus to the governor.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And Pilate wrote down all<br>
these transactions, and placed all<br>
these accounts in the public records<br>
of his hall.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Pilate goes to the temple; calls together<br>
     the rulers, and scribes, and doctors.<br>
     2 Commands the gates to be shut;<br>
     orders the book of the Scriptures; and<br>
     causes the Jews to relate what they really<br>
     knew concerning Christ.<br>
     14 They declare that they crucified Christ<br>
     in ignorance, and that they now know him<br>
     to be the Son of God, according to the<br>
     testimony of the Scriptures; which,<br>
     after they put him to death, were examined.</p>
<br>
<p>AFTER these things Pilate went<br>
to the temple of the Jews,<br>
and called together all the rulers<br>
and scribes, and doctors of the<br>
law, and went with them into a<br>
chapel of the temple.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And commanding that all the<br>
gates should be shut, said to them,<br>
I have heard that ye have a certain<br>
large book in this temple; I desire<br>
you, therefore, that it may be<br>
brought before me.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And when the great book,<br>
carried by four ministers of the<br>
temple, and adorned with gold and<br>
precious stones, was brought,<br>
Pilate said to them all, I adjure<br>
you by the God of your Fathers,<br>
who made and commanded this temple<br>
to be built, that ye conceal not the<br>
truth from me.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Ye know all the things which<br>
are written in that book; tell me<br>
therefore now, if ye in the<br>
Scriptures have found any thing of<br>
that Jesus whom ye crucified, and at<br>
what time of the world he, ought<br>
to have come: show it me.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Then having sworn Annas and<br>
Caiaphas, they commanded all the<br>
rest who were with them to go out<br>
of the chapel.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And they shut the gates of the<br>
temple and of the chapel, and said<br>
to Pilate, Thou hast made us to<br>
swear, O judge, by the building of<br>
this temple, to declare to thee that<br>
which is true and right.</p>
<br>
<p>7  After we had crucified Jesus,<br>
not knowing that he was the Son<br>
of God, but supposing he wrought<br>
his miracles by some magical arts,<br>
we summoned a large assembly in<br>
this temple.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And when we were deliberating<br>
among one another about the<br>
miracles which Jesus had wrought,<br>
we found many witnesses of our<br>
own country, who declared that<br>
they had seen him alive after his<br>
death, and that they heard him<br>
discoursing with his disciples, and<br>
saw him ascending into the height<br>
of the heavens, and entering into<br>
them;</p>
<br>
<p>9  And we saw two witnesses,<br>
whose bodies Jesus raised from the<br>
dead, who told us of many strange<br>
things which Jesus did among the<br>
dead, of which we have a written<br>
account in our hands.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And it is our custom annually<br>
to open this holy book before an<br>
assembly, and to search there for<br>
the counsel of God.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And we found in the first of<br>
the seventy books, where Michael<br>
the archangel is speaking to the<br>
third son of Adam the first man,<br>
an account that after five thousand<br>
five hundred years, Christ the<br>
most beloved son of God was to<br>
come on earth,</p>
<br>
<p>12  And we further considered,<br>
that perhaps he was the very God<br>
of Israel who spoke to Moses,<br>
Thou shalt make the ark of the<br>
testimony; two cubits and a half<br>
shall be the length thereof, and a<br>
cubit and a half the breadth thereof,<br>
and a cubit and a half the height<br>
thereof.</p>
<br>
<p>13  By these five cubits and a<br>
half for the building of the ark<br>
of the Old Testament, we perceived<br>
and knew that in five thousand<br>
years and half (one thousand) years,<br>
Jesus Christ was to come in the<br>
ark or tabernacle of a body;</p>
<br>
<p>14  And so our Scriptures testify<br>
that he is the Son of God, and the<br>
Lord and King of Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And because after his suffering,<br>
our chief priests were surprised<br>
at the signs which were wrought<br>
by his means, we opened that book<br>
to search all the generations down<br>
to the generation of Joseph and<br>
Mary the mother of Jesus,<br>
supposing him to be of the<br>
seed of David;</p>
<br>
<p>16  And we found the account of<br>
the creation, and at what time he<br>
made the heaven and the earth,<br>
and the first man Adam, and that<br>
from thence to the flood, were two<br>
thousand seven hundred and forty-<br>
eight years.</p>
<br>
<p>17  And from the flood to Abraham,<br>
nine hundred and twelve.<br>
And from Abraham to Moses, four<br>
hundred and thirty. And from<br>
Moses to David the King, five<br>
hundred and ten.</p>
<br>
<p>18  And from David to the Babylonish<br>
captivity five hundred years.<br>
And from the Babylonish captivity<br>
to the incarnation of Christ, four<br>
hundred years.</p>
<br>
<p>19  The sum of all which amounts<br>
to five thousand and half (a thousand.)</p>
<br>
<p>20  And so it appears, that Jesus<br>
whom we crucified, is Jesus Christ<br>
the Son of God, and true Almighty<br>
God. Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>(In the name of the Holy Trinity,<br>
thus end the acts of our Saviour<br>
Jesus Christ, which the Emperor<br>
Theodosius the Great found at<br>
Jerusalem, in the hall of Pontius<br>
Pilate, among the public records;<br>
the things were acted in the<br>
nineteenth year of Tiberius Caesar,<br>
Emperor of the Romans, and in<br>
the seventeenth year of the<br>
government of Herod, the son of<br>
Herod and of Galilee, on the<br>
eighth of the calends of April,<br>
which is the twenty-third day of<br>
the month of March, in the CCIId<br>
Olympiad, when Joseph and Caiaphas<br>
were rulers of the Jews; being a<br>
History written in Hebrew by<br>
Nicodemus, of what happened after<br>
our Saviour's crucifixion.)</p>

<p>            REFERENCES TO THE GOSPEL OF NICODEMUS, FORMERLY<br>
                   CALLED THE ACTS OF PONTIUS PILATE.</p>
<br>
<p>[Although this Gospel is, by some among the learned, supposed to have<br>
been  really written by Nicodemus, who became a disciple of Jesus Christ,<br>
and conversed with him; others conjecture that it was a forgery towards<br>
the close  of the third century by some zealous believer, who, observing<br>
that there had  been appeals made by the Christians of the former age,<br>
to the acts of Pilate,  but that such acts could not be produced,<br>
imagined it would be of service to  Christianity to fabricate and publish<br>
this Gospel; as it would both confirm the Christians under persecution,<br>
and convince the Heathens of the truth of  the Christian religion. The<br>
Rev. Jeremiah Jones says, that such pious frauds  were very common among<br>
Christians even in the first three centuries; and  that a forgery of this<br>
nature, with the view above-mentioned, seems natural  and probable. The<br>
same author, in noticing that Eusebius in his Ecclesiastical History,<br>
charges the Pagans with having forged and published a book,  called "The<br>
Acts of Pilate," takes occasion to observe that the internal evidence  of<br>
this Gospel shows it was not the work of any Heathen, but that if in the<br>
latter  end of the third century we find it in use among Christians (as<br>
it was then  certainly in some churches), and about the same time find a<br>
forgery of the  Heathens under the same title, it seems exceedingly<br>
probable that some  Christians, at that time, should publish such a piece<br>
as this, in order partly  to confront the spurious one of the Pagans, and<br>
partly to support those appeals  which had been made by former Christians<br>
to the Acts of Pilate; and Mr. Jones says, he thinks so more particularly<br>
as we have innumerable instances  of forgeries by the faithful in the<br>
primitive ages, grounded on less plausible reasons. Whether it be<br>
canonical or not, it is of very great antiquity, and is appealed to by<br>
several of the ancient Christians. The present translation is made from<br>
the Gospel, published by Grynaeus in the Orthodoxographa, vol, i,  tom,<br>
ii, p. 613.]</p>
<br>
<p>Notwithstanding the diversity of opinions here alluded to, the majority<br>
of the learned believe  that the internal evidence of the authenticity of<br>
this Gospel is manifested in the correct details  of that period of<br>
Christ's life on which it treats, while it far excels the canonical<br>
Evangelists narrative of the trial of our Saviour before Pilate, with<br>
more minute particulars of persons, evidence, circumstance, &amp;c.</p>

<br><br><br>
<p>
CHAPTER I.</p>
<br>
<p>     A copy of a letter written by King Abgarus to Jesus;<br>
     and sent to him by Ananius, his footman, to Jerusalem,<br>
     5 inviting him to Edessa.</p>
<br>
<p>ABGARUS, king of Edessa, to<br>
Jesus the good Saviour, who<br>
appears at Jerusalem, greeting.</p>
<br>
<p>2  I have been informed concerning<br>
you and your cures, which are<br>
performed without the use of<br>
medicines and herbs.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For it is reported, that you<br>
cause the blind to see, the lame to<br>
walk, do both cleanse lepers, and<br>
cast out unclean spirits and devils,<br>
and restore them to health who have<br>
been long diseased; and raiseth up<br>
the dead;</p>
<br>
<p>4  All which when I heard, I was<br>
pursuaded of one of these two,<br>
namely, either that you are God<br>
himself descended from heaven;<br>
who do these things, or the Son<br>
of God.</p>
<br>
<p>5  On this account therefore I<br>
have written to you, earnestly to<br>
desire you would take the trouble<br>
of a journey hither, and cure a<br>
disease which I am under.</p>
<br>
<p>6  For I hear the Jews ridicule<br>
you and, intend you mischief.</p>
<br>
<p>7  My city is indeed small, but<br>
neat, and large enough for us<br>
both.</p>

<p>     The answer of Jesus by Ananias the footman<br>
     to Abgarus the king,<br>
     3 declining to visit Edessa.</p>
<br>
<p>ABGARUS, you are happy,<br>
forasmuch as you have<br>
believed on me, whom you<br>
have not seen.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For it is written concerning<br>
me, that those who have seen me<br>
should not believe on me, that<br>
they who have not seen might<br>
believe and live.</p>
<br>
<p>3  As to that part of your letter,<br>
which relates to my giving you a<br>
visit, I must inform you, that I<br>
must fulfil all the ends of my<br>
mission in this country, and after<br>
that be received up again to him<br>
who sent me.</p>
<br>
<p>4  But after my ascension I will<br>
send one of my disciples, who will<br>
cure your disease, and give life to<br>
you, and all that are with you.</p>

                        ABGARUS KING OF EDESSA.</p>
<br>
<p>[The first writer who makes any mention of the Epistles that passed<br>
between  Jesus Christ and Abgarus, is Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea, in<br>
Palestine, who flourished in the early part of the fourth century. For<br>
their genuineness, he appeals to the public registers and records of the<br>
City of Edessa in Mesopotamia, where Abgarus reigned, and where he<br>
affirms that he found them written in the Syriac language. He published a<br>
Greek translation of them, in his Ecclesiastical History. The learned<br>
world has been much divided on  this subject; but, notwithstanding the<br>
erudite Grabe, with Archbishop Cave, Dr, Parker, and other divines, have<br>
strenuously contended for their admission into the canon of Scripture,<br>
they are deemed apocryphal. The Rev. Jeremiah  Jones observes, that the<br>
common people in England have this Epistle in their  houses in many<br>
places, fixed in a frame, with the picture of Christ before it; and that<br>
they generally, with much honesty and devotion, regard it as the word of<br>
God, and the genuine Epistle of Christ.]</p>

<br>
<p>I SUPPOSE, Paul, you have been<br>
informed of that conversation,<br>
which passed yesterday between<br>
me and my Lucilius, concerning<br>
hypocrisy and other subjects; for<br>
there were some of your disciples<br>
in company with us;</p>
<br>
<p>2  For when we were retired into<br>
the Sallustian gardens, through<br>
which they were also passing, and<br>
would have gone another way, by<br>
our persuasion they joined<br>
company with us.</p>
<br>
<p>3  I desire you to believe, that<br>
we much wish for your conversation;</p>
<br>
<p>4  We were much delighted with<br>
your book of many Epistles, which<br>
you have written to some cities<br>
and chief towns of provinces, and<br>
contain wonderful instructions for<br>
moral conduct:</p>
<br>
<p>5  Such sentiments, as I suppose<br>
you were not the author of, but<br>
only the instrument of conveying,<br>
though sometimes both the author<br>
and the instrument,</p>
<br>
<p>6  For such is the sublimity of<br>
those, doctrines, and their grandeur,<br>
that I suppose the age of a man<br>

them. I wish your welfare, my brother.<br>

<p>4  I reckon myself very happy in<br>
having the judgment of so valuable<br>
a person, that you are delighted<br>
with my Epistles:</p>

inconstancy, but judgment.<br>

it is not proper for me to mention<br>

marks, and the other evidently<br>
declares things.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Especially since I know that<br>
there are near you, as well as me,<br>
those who will understand my<br>
meaning.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Deference is to be paid to<br>
all men, and so much the more,<br>
as they are more likely to take<br>
occasions of quarrelling.</p>

<br>
<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>
<br>
<p>ANNAEUS SENECA to PAUL Greeting.</p>
<br>
<p>I PROFESS myself extremely<br>
pleased with the reading your<br>
letters to the Galatians,<br>
Corinthians, and people of Achaia.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For the Holy Ghost has in<br>
them by you delivered those<br>
sentiments which are very lofty,<br>
sublime, deserving of all respect,<br>
and beyond your own invention.</p>
<br>
<p>3  I could wish therefore, that<br>
when you are writing things so<br>
extraordinary, there might not<br>
be wanting an elegancy of speech<br>
agreeable to their majesty.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And I must own, my brother,<br>
that I may not at once dishonestly<br>
conceal anything from you, and be<br>
unfaithful to my own conscience,<br>
that the emperor is extremely<br>
pleased with the sentiments of<br>
your Epistles;</p>
<br>
<p>5  For when he heard the beginning<br>
of them read, he declared, that he<br>
was surprised to find such notions<br>
in a person, who had not had a<br>
regular education.</p>
<br>
<p>6  To which I replied, That the<br>
Gods sometimes made use of mean<br>
(innocent) persons to speak by, and<br>
gave him an instance of this in a<br>
mean countryman named Vatienus,<br>
who, when he was in the country<br>
of Reate, had two men appeared<br>
to him, called Castor and Pollux,<br>
and received a revelation from the<br>
gods. Farewell.</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
<br>
<p>PAUL to SENECA Greeting.</p>
<br>
<p>ALTHOUGH I know the emperor is<br>
both an admirer and favourer of<br>
our religion, yet give me leave<br>
to advise you against your suffering<br>
any injury (by showing favour to us).</p>
<br>
<p>2  I think indeed you ventured<br>
upon a very dangerous attempt,<br>
when you would declare (to the<br>
emperor) that which is so very<br>
contrary to his religion, and way<br>
of worship; seeing he is a<br>
worshipper of the heathen gods.</p>
<br>
<p>3  I know not what you particularly<br>
had in view, when you told him of<br>
this; but I suppose you did it out<br>
of too great respect for me.</p>
<br>
<p>4  But I desire that for the future<br>
you would not do so; for you had<br>
need be careful, lest by showing<br>
your affection for me, you should<br>
offend your master:</p>
<br>
<p>5  His anger indeed will do us no<br>
harm, if he continue a heathen;<br>
nor will his not being angry be<br>
of any service to us:</p>
<br>
<p>6  And if the empress act worthy<br>
of her character, she will not be<br>
angry; but if she act as a woman,<br>
she will be affronted. Farewell.</p>

<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>
<br>
<p>ANNEUS SENECA to PAUL Greeting.</p>
<br>
<p>KNOW that my letter, wherein<br>
I acquainted you, that I had<br>
read to the Emperor your Epistles,<br>
does not so much affect you as the<br>
nature of the things (contained<br>
in them.)</p>
<br>
<p>2  Which do so powerfully divert<br>
men's minds from their former<br>
manners and practices, that I have<br>
always been surprised, and have<br>
been fully convinced of it by many<br>
arguments heretofore.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Let us therefore begin afresh;<br>
and if any thing heretofore has<br>
been imprudently acted, do you<br>
forgive.</p>

<p>PAUL to SENECA Greeting.</p>
<br>
<p>AS often as I write to you,<br>
and place my name before yours,<br>
I do a thing both disagreeable<br>
to myself, and contrary to our<br>
religion:</p>
<br>
<p>2  For I ought, as I have often<br>
declared, to become all things to<br>
all men, and to have that regard<br>
to your quality, which the Roman<br>
law has honoured all senators with;<br>
namely, to put my name last in the<br>
(inscription of the) Epistle, that<br>
I may not at length with uneasiness<br>
and shame be obliged to do that<br>
which it was always my inclination<br>
to do. Farewell, most respected<br>
master. Dated the fifth of the<br>

Consulship of Nero, and Messala.</p>

<p>2  If a person so great, and<br>
every way agreeable as you are,<br>
become not only a common, but<br>
a most intimate friend to me,<br>
how happy will be the case of<br>
Seneca!</p>
<br>
<p>3  You therefore, who are so<br>
eminent, and so far exalted above<br>
all, even the greatest, do not think<br>
yourself unfit to be first named in<br>
the inscription of an Epistle;</p>
<br>
<p>4  Lest I should suspect you intend<br>
not so much to try me, as to banter<br>
me; for you know yourself to be a<br>
Roman citizen.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And I could wish to be in that<br>
circumstance or station which you<br>
are, and that you were in the same<br>
that I am. Farewell, dearest Paul.<br>

Paul. Do you not suppose I am<br>
extremely concerned and grieved<br>
that your innocence should bring<br>
you into sufferings?</p>
<br>
<p>2  And that all the people should<br>
suppose you (Christians) so criminal,<br>
and imagine all the misfortunes<br>
that happen to the city, to be<br>
caused by you?</p>
<br>
<p>3  But let us bear the charge<br>
with a patient temper, appealing<br>
for our innocence to the court<br>
above, which is the only one our<br>
hard fortune will allow us to address<br>
to, till at length our misfortunes<br>
shall end in unalterable happiness.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Former ages have produced<br>
(tyrants) Alexander the son of<br>
Philip, and Dionysius; ours also<br>
has produced Caius Caesar; whose<br>
inclinations were their only laws.</p>
<br>
<p>5  As to the frequent burnings<br>
of the city of Rome, the cause is<br>
manifest; and if a person in my<br>
mean circumstances might be allowed<br>
to speak, and one might declare<br>
these dark things without danger,<br>
every one should see the whole of<br>
the matter.</p>
<br>
<p>6  The Christians and Jews are<br>
indeed commonly punished for the<br>
crime of burning the city; but that<br>
impious miscreant, who delights<br>
in murders and butcheries, and<br>
disguises his villainies with lies,<br>
is appointed to, or reserved till,<br>
his proper time.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And as the life of every<br>
excellent person is now sacrificed<br>
instead of that one person (who is<br>
the author of the mischief), so this<br>
one shall be sacrificed for many,<br>
and be shall be devoted to be burnt<br>
with fire instead of all.</p>
<br>
<p>8  One hundred and thirty-two houses,<br>
and four whole squares (or islands)<br>
were burnt down in six days: the<br>
seventh put an end to the burning.<br>
I wish you all happiness.</p>

<br>
<p>ANNAEUS SENECA to PAUL Greeting.</p>
<br>
<p>ALL happiness to you, my dearest<br>
Paul.</p>
<br>
<p>2  You have written many volumes in<br>
an allegorical and mystical style,<br>
and therefore such mighty matters<br>
and business being committed to you,<br>
require not to be set off with any<br>
rhetorical flourishes of speech,<br>
but only with some proper elegance.</p>
<br>
<p>3  I remember you often said,<br>
that many by affecting such a style<br>
do injury to their subjects, and<br>
lose the force of the matters they<br>
treat of.</p>
<br>
<p>4  But in this I desire you to<br>
regard me, namely, to have respect<br>
to true Latin, and to choose just<br>
words, that so you may the better<br>
manage the noble trust which is<br>
reposed in you.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Farewell. Dated the fifth of<br>

<br>
<p>PAUL to SENECA Greeting.</p>
<br>
<p>YOUR serious consideration is<br>
requited with those discoveries,<br>
which the Divine Being has<br>
granted but to few;</p>
<br>
<p>2  I am thereby assured that<br>
I sow the most strong seed in a<br>
fertile soil, not anything material,<br>
which is subject to corruption, but<br>
the durable word of God, which<br>
shall increase and bring forth fruit<br>
to eternity.</p>
<br>
<p>3  That which by your wisdom you<br>
have attained to, shall abide<br>
without decay for ever.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Believe that you ought to<br>
avoid the superstitions of Jews<br>
and Gentiles.</p>
<br>
<p>5  The things which you have in<br>
some measure arrived to, prudently<br>
make known to the emperor, his<br>
family, and to faithful friends;</p>
<br>
<p>6  And though your sentiments<br>
will seem disagreeable, and not<br>
be comprehended by them, seeing<br>
most of them will not regard your<br>
discourses, yet the Word of God<br>
once infused into them, will at<br>
length make them become new men,<br>
aspiring towards God.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Farewell Seneca, who art<br>
most dear to us. Dated on the<br>
calends of August, in the<br>

<p>          REFERENCES TO THE EPISTLES OF ST. PAUL THE APOSTLE<br>
                   TO SENECA, WITH SENECA'S TO PAUL.</p>
<br>
<p>[Several very learned writers have entertained a favourable opinion of<br>
these Epistles. They are undoubtedly of high antiquity. Salmeron cites<br>
them to prove that Seneca was one of Caesar's household, referred to by<br>
Paul, Philip iv. 22, as saluting the brethren at Philippi. In Jerome's<br>
enumeration of  illustrious men, he places Seneca, on account of these<br>
Epistles, amongst the  ecclesiastical and holy writers of the Christian<br>
Church. Sixtus Senensis has published them in his Bibliotheque, p 89, 90;<br>
and it is from thence that the present translation is made. Baronius,<br>
Bellarmine, Dr. Cave, Spanheim, and  others, contend that they are not<br>
genuine.]</p>

     first Martyr and Apostle Thecla.</p>
<br>
<p>
CHAPTER I.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Demas and Hermogenes become Paul's companions.<br>
     4 Paul visits Onesiphorus.<br>
     8 Invited by Demos and Hermogenes.<br>
     11 Preaches to the household of Onesiphorus.<br>
     12 His sermon.</p>
<br>
<p>WHEN Paul went up to Iconium,<br>
after his flight from Antioch,<br>
Demas and Hermogenes became<br>
his companions, who were then<br>
full of hypocrisy.</p>
<br>
<p>2  But Paul looking only at the<br>
goodness of God, did them no<br>
harm, but loved them greatly.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Accordingly he endeavoured<br>
to make agreeable to them all the<br>
oracles and doctrines of Christ,<br>
and the design of the Gospel of<br>
God's well-beloved son; instructing<br>
them in the knowledge of Christ,<br>
as it was revealed to him.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And a certain man named<br>
Onesiphorus, hearing that Paul<br>
was come to Iconium, went out<br>
speedily to meet him, together<br>
with his wife Lectra, and his sons<br>
Simmia and Zeno, to invite him to<br>
their house.</p>
<br>
<p>5  For Titus had given them a<br>
description of Paul's personage,<br>
they as yet not knowing him in<br>
person, but only being acquainted<br>
with his character.</p>
<br>
<p>6  They went in the king's highway<br>
to Lystra, and stood there waiting<br>
for him, comparing all who passed<br>
by with that description which<br>
Titus had given them.</p>
<br>
<p>7  At length they saw a man coming<br>
(namely Paul), of a low stature,<br>
bald on the head; with crooked thighs,<br>
handsome legs, hollow-eyes; and a<br>
crooked nose; full of grace, for<br>
sometimes he appeared as a man,<br>
sometimes he had the countenance<br>
of an angel. And Paul saw Onesiphorus,<br>
and was glad.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And Onesiphorus said:<br>
Hail, thou servant of the blessed<br>
God. Paul replied, The grace of<br>
God be with thee and thy family.</p>
<br>
<p>9  But Denies and Hermogenes<br>
were moved with envy, and, under<br>
a show of great religion, Demas<br>
said, And are not we also servants<br>
of the blessed God? Why didst<br>
thou not salute us?</p>
<br>
<p>10  Onesiphorus replied, Because<br>
I have not perceived in you the<br>
fruits of righteousness; nevertheless,<br>
if ye are of that sort, ye shall be<br>
welcome to my house also.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Then Paul went into the house<br>
of Onesiphorus, and there was great<br>
joy among the family on that account:<br>
and they employed themselves in prayer,<br>
breaking of bread, and hearing Paul<br>
preach the word of God concerning<br>
temperance and the resurrection,<br>
in the following manner:</p>
<br>
<p>12  Blessed are the pure in<br>
heart; for they shall see God.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Blessed are they who keep<br>
their flesh undefiled (or pure);<br>
for they shall be the temple of God.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Blessed are the temperate<br>
(or chaste); for God will reveal<br>
himself to them.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Blessed are they who abandon<br>
their worldly enjoyments; for they<br>
shall be accepted of God.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Blessed are they who have<br>
wives, as though they had them<br>
not; for they shall be made angels<br>
of God.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Blessed are they who tremble<br>
at the word of God; for they<br>
shall be comforted.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Blessed are they who keep<br>
their baptism pure; for they shall<br>
find peace with the Father, Son,<br>
and Holy Ghost.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Blessed are they who pursue<br>
the wisdom or doctrine of Jesus<br>
Christ; for they shall be called<br>
the sons of the Most High.</p>
<br>
<p>20  Blessed are they who observe<br>
the instructions of Jesus Christ;<br>
for they shall dwell in eternal<br>
light.</p>
<br>
<p>21  Blessed are they, who for the<br>
love of Christ abandon the glories<br>
of the world, for they shall judge<br>
angels, and be placed at the right<br>
hand of Christ, and shall not suffer<br>
the bitterness of the last judgment.</p>
<br>
<p>22  Blessed are the bodies and souls<br>
of virgins; for they are acceptable<br>
to God, and shall not lose the reward<br>
of their virginity; for the word of<br>
their (heavenly) Father shall prove<br>
effectual to their salvation in the<br>
day of his Son, and they shall enjoy<br>
rest for evermore.</p>

<br>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Thecla listens anxiously to Paul's preaching.<br>
     5 Thamyris, her admirer, concerts with Theoclia<br>
     her mother to dissuade her,<br>
     12 in vain.<br>
     14 Demas and Hermogenes vilify Paul to Thamyris.</p>
<br>
<p>WHILE Paul was preaching<br>
this sermon in the church<br>
which was in the house of<br>
Onesiphorus, a certain virgin<br>
named Thecla (whose mother's<br>
name was Theoclia, and who was<br>
betrothed to a man named Thamyris)<br>
sat at a certain window in her house.</p>
<br>
<p>2  From whence, by the advantage<br>
of a window in the house where<br>
Paul was, she both night and day<br>
heard Paul's sermons concerning<br>
God, concerning charity, concerning<br>
faith in Christ, and concerning<br>
prayer;</p>
<br>
<p>3  Nor would she depart from<br>
the window, till with exceeding<br>
joy she was subdued to the<br>
doctrines of faith.</p>
<br>
<p>4  At length, when she saw many<br>
women and virgins going into<br>
Paul, she earnestly desired that<br>
she might be thought worthy to<br>
appear in his presence, and hear<br>
the word of Christ; for she had<br>
not yet seen Paul's person, but only<br>
heard his sermons, and that alone.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But when she would not be<br>
prevailed upon to depart from the<br>
window, her mother sent to Thamyris,<br>
who came with the greatest pleasure,<br>
as hoping now, to marry her.<br>
Accordingly he said to Theoclia,<br>
Where is my Thecla?</p>
<br>
<p>6  Theoclia replied, Thamyris,<br>
I have something very strange to<br>
tell you; for Thecla, for the space<br>
of three days, will not move from<br>
the window, not so much as to eat<br>
or drink, but is so intent in<br>
hearing the artful and delusive<br>
discourses of a certain foreigner,<br>
that I perfectly wonder Thamyris,<br>
that a young woman of her known<br>
modesty, will suffer herself to be<br>
so prevailed upon.</p>
<br>
<p>7  For that man has disturbed<br>
the whole city of Iconium, and<br>
even your Thecla, among others.<br>
All the women and young men<br>
flock to him to receive his<br>
doctrine; who, besides all the<br>
rest, tells them that there is<br>
but one God, who alone is to be<br>
worshipped, and that we ought<br>
to live in chastity.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Notwithstanding this, my<br>
daughter Thecla, like a spider's<br>
web fastened to the window, is<br>
captivated, by the discourses of<br>
Paul, and attends' upon them with<br>
prodigious eagerness, and vast<br>
delight; and thus, by attending<br>
on what he says, the young woman<br>
is seduced.    Now then do you go,<br>
and speak to her, for she is<br>
betrothed to you.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Accordingly Thamyris went,<br>
and having saluted her, and taking<br>
care not to surprise her, he said,<br>
Thecla, my spouse, why sittest<br>
thou in this melancholy posture?<br>
What strange impressions are<br>
made upon thee? Turn to Thamyris,<br>
and blush.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Her mother also spake to her<br>
after the same manner, and said,<br>
Child, why dost thou sit so<br>
melancholy, and, like one<br>
astonished, makest no reply?</p>
<br>
<p>11  Then they wept exceedingly,<br>
Thamyris, that he had lost his<br>
spouse; Theoclia, that she had<br>
lost her daughter; and the maids,<br>
that they had lost their mistress;<br>
and there was an universal<br>
mourning in the family.</p>
<br>
<p>12  But all these things made no<br>
impression upon Thecla, so as to<br>
incline her so much as to turn to<br>
them, and take notice of them;<br>
for she still regarded the<br>
discourses of Paul.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Then Thamyris ran forth into<br>
the street to observe who they<br>
were that went in to Paul, and<br>
came out from him; and he saw<br>
two men engaged in a very warm<br>
dispute, and said to them;</p>
<br>
<p>14  Sirs, what business have<br>
you here? and who is that man<br>
within, belonging to you, who<br>
deludes the minds of men, both<br>
young men and virgins, persuading<br>
them, that they ought not to marry,<br>
but continue as they are?</p>
<br>
<p>15  I promise to give you a<br>
considerable sum, if ye will give<br>
me a just account of him; for I am<br>
the chief person of this city.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Demas and Hermogenes replied,<br>
We cannot so exactly tell who he<br>
is; but this we know, that he<br>
deprives young men of their<br>
(intended) wives, and virgins of<br>
their (intended) husbands, by<br>
teaching, There can be no future<br>
resurrection, unless ye continue<br>
in chastity, and do not defile your<br>
flesh.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<br>
<p>1 They betray Paul.<br>
7 Thamyris arrests him with officers.</p>
<br>
<p>THEN said Thamyris, Come along<br>
with me to my house, and refresh<br>
yourselves. So they went to a very<br>
splendid entertainment, where<br>
there was wine in abundance,<br>
and very rich provision.</p>
<br>
<p>2  They were brought to a table<br>
richly spread, and made to drink<br>
plentifully by Thamyris, on account<br>
of the love he had for Thecla<br>
and his desire to marry her.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Then Thamyris said, I desire<br>
ye would inform me what the<br>
doctrines of this Paul are, that<br>
I may understand them; for I am<br>
under no small concern about Thecla,<br>
seeing she so delights in that<br>
stranger's discourses, that I am in<br>
danger of losing my intended wife.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Then Demas and Hermogenes<br>
answered both together, and said,<br>
Let him be brought before the<br>
governor Castellius, as one who<br>
endeavours to persuade the people<br>
into the new religion of the<br>
Christians, and he, according to<br>
the order of Caesar, will put him<br>
to death, by which means you will<br>
obtain your wife;</p>
<br>
<p>5  While we at the same time will<br>
teach her, that the resurrection<br>
which he speaks of is already come,<br>
and consists in our having children;<br>
and that we then arose again,<br>
when we came to the knowledge of God.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Thamyris having this account<br>
from them, was filled with hot<br>
resentment:</p>
<br>
<p>7  And rising early in the morning<br>
he went to the house of Onesiphorus,<br>
attended by the magistrates, the<br>
Jailor, and a great multitude of<br>
people with staves, and said to Paul;</p>
<br>
<p>8  Thou hast perverted the city<br>
of Iconium, and among the rest,<br>
Thecla, who is betrothed to me,<br>
so that now she will not marry<br>
me. Thou shalt therefore go with<br>
us to the governor Castellius.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And all the multitude cried<br>
out, Away with this imposter, for<br>
he has perverted the minds of our<br>
wives, and all the people hearken<br>
to him.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Paul accused before the governor by Thamyris.<br>
     5 Defends himself.<br>
     9 Is committed to prison,<br>
     10 and visited by Thecla.</p>
<br>
<p>THEN Thamyris standing before<br>
the governor's judgment-seat,<br>
spake with a loud voice in the<br>
following manner.</p>
<br>
<p>2 O governor, I know not whence<br>
this man cometh; but he is one<br>
who teaches that matrimony is<br>
unlawful. Command him therefore<br>
to declare before you for what<br>
reason he publishes such doctrines.</p>
<br>
<p>3  While he was saying thus,<br>
Demas and Hermogenes (whispered to<br>
Thamyris, and) said; Say that he<br>
is a Christian, and he will<br>
presently be put to death.</p>
<br>
<p>4  But the governor was more<br>
deliberate, and calling to Paul,<br>
he said, Who art thou? What dost<br>
thou teach? They seem to lay<br>
gross crimes to thy charge.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Paul then spake with a loud<br>
voice, saying, As I am now called<br>
to give an account, O governor,<br>
of my doctrines, I desire your<br>
audience.</p>
<br>
<p>6  That God, who is a God of<br>
vengeance, and who strands in need<br>
of nothing but the salvation of his<br>
creatures, has sent me to reclaim<br>
them from their wickedness, and<br>
corruptions; from all (sinful)<br>
pleasures, and from death; and to<br>
persuade them to sin no more.</p>
<br>
<p>7  On this account, God sent his<br>
Son Jesus Christ, whom I preach,<br>
and in whom I instruct men to<br>
place their hopes, as that person<br>
who only had such compassion on<br>
the deluded world, that it might<br>
not, O governor, be condemned,<br>
but have faith, the fear of God,<br>
the knowlege of religion, and the<br>
love of truth.</p>
<br>
<p>8  So that if I only teach those<br>
things which I have received by<br>
revelation from God, where is my<br>
crime?</p>
<br>
<p>9  When the governor heard this,<br>
he ordered Paul to be bound,<br>
and to be put in prison, till he<br>
should be more at leisure to hear<br>
him more fully.</p>
<br>
<p>10  But in the night, Thecla<br>
taking off her ear-rings, gave them<br>
to the turnkey of the prison, who<br>
then opened the door to her, and<br>
let her in;</p>
<br>
<p>11  And when she made a present<br>
of a silver looking-glass to the<br>
jailor, was allowed to go into the<br>
room where Paul was; then she set<br>
down at his feet, and heard from<br>
him the great things of God.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And as she perceived Paul<br>
not to be afraid of suffering,<br>
but that by divine assistance<br>
he behaved himself with courage,<br>
her faith so far increased that<br>
she kissed his chains.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER V.</p>
<br>
<p>1 Thecla sought and found by her relations.<br>
4 Brought with Paul before the governor.<br>
9 Ordered to be burnt, and Paul to be whipt.<br>
15 Thecla miraculously saved.</p>
<br>
<p>AT length Thecla was missed<br>
and sought for by the family<br>
and by Thamyris in every street,<br>
as though she had been lost; till<br>
one of the porter's fellow-servants<br>
told them, that she had gone out<br>
in the night-time.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Then they examined the porter,<br>
and he told them, that she was<br>
gone to the prison to the strange<br>
man.</p>
<br>
<p>3  They went therefore according<br>
to his direction, and there found<br>
her; and when they came out, they<br>
got a mob together, and went and<br>
told the governor all that had<br>
happened.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Upon which he ordered Paul<br>
to be brought before his judgment<br>
seat.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Thecla in the mean time lay<br>
wallowing on the ground in the<br>
prison, in that same place where<br>
Paul had sat to teach her; upon<br>
which the governor also ordered<br>
her to be brought before his<br>
judgment-seat; which summons she<br>
received with joy, and went.</p>
<br>
<p>6  When Paul was brought thither,<br>
the mob with more vehemence cried<br>
out, He is a magician, let him die.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Nevertheless the governor<br>
attended with pleasure upon Paul's<br>
discourses of the holy works of<br>
Christ; and, after a council called,<br>
he summoned Thecla, and said to<br>
her, Why do you not, according<br>
to the law of the Iconians, marry<br>
Thamyris?</p>
<br>
<p>8  She stood still, with her eyes<br>
fixed upon Paul; and finding she<br>
made no reply, Theoclia, her<br>
mother cried out saying, Let the<br>
unjust creature be burnt; let her<br>
be burnt in the midst of the theatre,<br>
for refusing Thamyris, that all<br>
women may learn from her to avoid<br>
such practices.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Then the governor was exceedingly<br>
concerned, and ordered Paul to be<br>
whipt out of the city, and Thecla<br>
to be burnt.</p>
<br>
<p>10  So the governor arose, and went<br>
immediately into the theatre; and<br>
all the people went forth to see<br>
the dismal sight.</p>
<br>
<p>11  But Thecla, just as a lamb in<br>
the wilderness looks every way to<br>
see his shepherd, looked around<br>
for Paul;</p>
<br>
<p>12  And as she was looking upon<br>
the multitude, she saw the Lord<br>
Jesus in the likeness of Paul, and<br>
said to herself, Paul is come to see<br>
me in my distressed circumstances.<br>
And she fixed her eyes upon him;<br>
but he instantly ascended up to<br>
heaven, while she looked on him.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Then the young men and women<br>
brought wood and straw for the<br>
burning of Thecla; who being brought<br>
naked to the stake, extorted tears<br>
from the governor, with surprise<br>
beholding the greatness of her beauty.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And when they had placed<br>
the wood in order, the people<br>
commanded her to go upon it; which<br>
she did, first making the sign of<br>
the cross.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Then the people set fire to<br>
the pile; though the flame was<br>
exceeding large, it did not touch<br>
her; for God took compassion on<br>
her, and caused a great eruption<br>
from the earth beneath, and a<br>
cloud from above to pour down<br>
great quantities of rain and hail;</p>
<br>
<p>16  Insomuch that by the rupture<br>
of the earth, very many were<br>
in great danger, and some were<br>
killed, the fire was extinguished,<br>
and Thecla preserved.</p>

<br>
<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
<br>
<p>1 Paul with Onesiphorus in a cave.<br>
7 Thecla discovers Paul;<br>
12 proffers to follow him:<br>
13 he exhorts her not for fear of fornication.</p>
<br>
<p>IN the mean time Paul, together<br>
with Onesiphorus, his wife and<br>
children, was keeping a fast in a<br>
certain cave, which was in the<br>
road from Iconium to Daphne.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And when they had fasted for<br>
several days, the children said to<br>
Paul, Father, we are hungry, and<br>
have not wherewithal to buy bread;<br>
for Onesiphorus had left all his<br>
substance to follow Paul with his<br>
family.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Then Paul, taking off his coat,<br>
said to the boy, Go, child, and buy<br>
bread, and bring it hither.</p>
<br>
<p>4  But while the boy was buying<br>
the bread, he saw his neighbour<br>
Thecla, and was surprised, and<br>
said to her, Thecla, where are you<br>
going?</p>
<br>
<p>5  She replied, I am in pursuit<br>
of Paul, having been delivered<br>
from the flames.</p>
<br>
<p>6  The boy then said, I will bring<br>
you to him, for he is under great<br>
concern on your account, and has<br>
been in prayer and fasting these<br>
six days.</p>
<br>
<p>7  When Thecla came to the cave,<br>
she found Paul upon his knees<br>
praying and saying, O holy Father,<br>
O Lord Jesus Christ, grant that<br>
the fire may not touch Thecla;<br>
but be her helper, for she is<br>
thy servant.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Thecla then standing behind<br>
him, cried out in the following<br>
words: O sovereign Lord Creator<br>
of heaven and earth, the Father of<br>
thy beloved and holy Son, I praise<br>
thee that thou hast preserved me<br>
from the fire, to see Paul again.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Paul then arose, and when he<br>
saw her, said, O God, who searchest<br>
the heart, Father of my Lord Jesus<br>
Christ, I praise thee that thou hast<br>
answered my prayer.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And there prevailed among them<br>
in the cave an entire affection to<br>
each other; Paul, Onesiphorus,<br>
and all that were with them being<br>
filled with joy.</p>
<br>
<p>11  They had five loaves, some<br>
herbs and water, and they solaced<br>
each other in reflections upon the<br>
holy works of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Then said Thecla to Paul,<br>
If you be pleased with it, I will<br>
follow you whithersoever you go.</p>
<br>
<p>13  He replied to her, Persons<br>
are now much given to fornication,<br>
and you being handsome, I am<br>
afraid lest you should meet with<br>
greater temptation than the former,<br>
and should Not withstand, but be<br>
overcome by it.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Thecla replied, Grant me<br>
only the seal of Christ, and no<br>
temptation shall affect me.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Paul answered, Thecla, wait<br>
with patience, and you shall<br>
receive the gift of Christ.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Paul and Thecla go to Antioch.<br>
     2 Alexander, a magistrate, falls in love with Thecla:<br>
     4 kisses her by force:<br>
     5 she resists him:<br>
     6 is carried before the governor, and condemned<br>
     to be thrown to wild beasts.</p>
<br>
<p>THEN Paul sent back Onesiphorus<br>
and his family to their own home,<br>
and taking Thecla along with him,<br>
went for Antioch;</p>
<br>
<p>2  And as soon as they came in.<br>
to the city, a certain Syrian,<br>
named Alexander, a magistrate in<br>
the city, who had done many<br>
considerable services for the city<br>
during his magistracy, saw Thecla,<br>
and fell in love with her, and<br>
endeavoured by many rich presents<br>
to engage Paul in his interest.</p>
<br>
<p>3  But Paul told him, I know not<br>
the woman of whom you speak, nor<br>
does she belong to me.</p>
<br>
<p>4  But he being a person of great<br>
power in, Antioch, seized her in<br>
the street and kissed her: which<br>
Thecla would not bear, but looking<br>
about for Paul, cried out in a<br>
distressed loud tone, Force me not,<br>
who am a stranger; force me not,<br>
who am a servant of God; I am<br>
one of the principal persons of<br>
Iconium, and was obliged to leave<br>
that city because I would not be<br>
married to Thamyris.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Then she laid hold on Alexander,<br>
tore his coat, and took his crown<br>
off his head, and made him appear<br>
ridiculous before all the people.</p>
<br>
<p>6 But Alexander, partly as he<br>
loved her, and partly being ashamed<br>
of what had been done, led her to<br>
the governor, and upon her confession<br>
of what she had done, he condemned<br>
her to be thrown among the beasts.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     2 Thecla entertained by Trifina;<br>
     3 brought out to the wild beasts;<br>
     a she-lion licks her feet.<br>
     5 Trifina upon a vision of her deceased<br>
     daughter, adopts Thecla,<br>
     11 who is taken to the amphitheatre again.</p>
<br>
<p>WHICH when the people saw, they<br>
said: The judgments passed in this<br>
city are unjust. But Thecla desired<br>
the favour of the governor, that<br>
her chastity might not be attacked,<br>
but preserved till she should be<br>
cast to the beasts.</p>
<br>
<p>2  The governor then inquired,<br>
Who would entertain her; upon<br>
which a certain very rich widow,<br>
named Trifina, whose daughter<br>
was lately dead, desired that she<br>
might have the keeping of her;<br>
and she began to treat her in her<br>
house as her own daughter.</p>
<br>
<p>3  At length a day came, when<br>
the beasts were to be brought forth<br>
to be seen; and Thecla was brought<br>
to the amphitheatre, and put into<br>
a den in which was an exceeding<br>
fierce she-lion, in the presence of<br>
a multitude of spectators.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Trifina; without any surprise,<br>
accompanied Thecla, and the<br>
she-lion licked the feet of Thecla.<br>
The title written which denoted<br>
her crime, was Sacrilege. Then<br>
the women cried out, O God, the<br>
judgments of this city are<br>
unrighteous.</p>
<br>
<p>5  After the beasts had been<br>
shown, Trifina took Thecla home<br>
with her, and they went to bed;<br>
and behold, the daughter of Trifina,<br>
who was dead, appeared to her<br>
mother, and said; Mother, let the<br>
young woman, Thecla, be reputed<br>
by you as your daughter in my<br>
stead; and desire her that she<br>
should pray for me, that I may be<br>
translated to a state of happiness.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Upon which Trifina, with a<br>
mournful air, said, My daughter<br>
Falconilla has appeared to me, and<br>
ordered me to receive you in her<br>
room; wherefore I desire, Thecla,<br>
that you would pray for my daughter,<br>
that she may be translated into<br>
a state of happiness, and to life<br>
eternal.</p>
<br>
<p>7  When Thecla heard this, she<br>
immediately prayed to the Lord,<br>
and said: O Lord God of heaven and<br>
earth, Jesus Christ, thou Son of<br>
the Most High, grant that her<br>
daughter Falconilla may live forever.<br>
Trifina hearing this, groaned again,<br>
and said: O unrighteous judgments!<br>
O unreasonable wickedness! that<br>
such a creature should (again)<br>
be cast to the beasts!</p>
<br>
<p>8  On the morrow, at break of day,<br>
Alexander came to Trifina's house,<br>
and said: The governor and the<br>
people are waiting; bring the<br>
criminal forth.</p>
<br>
<p>9  But Trifina ran in so violently<br>
upon him, that he was affrighted,<br>
and ran away. Trifina was one of<br>
the royal family; and she thus<br>
expressed her sorrow, and said;<br>
Alas! I have trouble in my house<br>
on two accounts, and there is no<br>
one who will relieve me, either<br>
under the loss of my daughter, or<br>
my being unable to save Thecla.<br>
But now, O Lord God, be thou the<br>
helper of Thecla thy servant.</p>
<br>
<p>10  While she was thus engaged.<br>
the governor sent one of his own<br>
officers to bring Thecla. Trifina<br>
took her by the hand, and, going<br>
with her, said: I went with<br>
Falconilla to her grave, and now<br>
must go with Thecla to the beasts.</p>
<br>
<p>11  When Thecla heard this, she<br>
weeping prayed, and said: O Lord<br>
God, whom I have made my confidence<br>
and refuge, reward Trifina for her<br>
compassion to me, and preserving<br>
my chastity.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Upon this there was a great<br>
noise in the amphitheatre; the<br>
beasts roared, and the people<br>
cried out, Bring in the criminal.</p>
<br>
<p>13  But the women cried out,<br>
and said: Let the whole city<br>
suffer for such crimes; and<br>
order all of us, O governor,<br>
to the same punishment. O unjust<br>
judgment! O cruel sight!</p>
<br>
<p>14  Others said, Let the whole<br>
city be destroyed for this vile<br>
action. Kill us all, O governor.<br>
O cruel sight! O unrighteous<br>
judgment.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Thecla thrown naked to the wild beasts;<br>
     2 but they all refuse to attack her.<br>
     8 She baptizes herself in a pit of water.<br>
     10 Other wild beasts refuse to injure her.<br>
     11 Tied to wild bulls.<br>
     13 Miraculously saved.<br>
     21. Released.<br>
     24 Entertained by Trifina,</p>
<br>
<p>THEN Thecla was taken out of<br>
the hand of Trifina, stripped<br>
naked, had a girdle put on, and<br>
thrown into the place appointed<br>
for fighting with the beasts: and<br>
the lions and the bears were let<br>
loose upon her.</p>
<br>
<p>2  But a she-lion, which was of<br>
all the most fierce, ran to Thecla,<br>
and fell down at her feet. Upon<br>
which the multitude of women<br>
shouted aloud.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Then a she-bear ran fiercely<br>
towards her, but the she lion met<br>
the bear, and tore it in pieces.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Again a he-lion, who had been<br>
wont to devour men, and which<br>
belonged to Alexander, ran towards<br>
her; but the she-lion encountered<br>
the he-lion, and they killed each<br>
other.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Then the women were under<br>
a greater concern, because the<br>
she-lion, which had helped Thecla,<br>
was dead.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Afterwards they brought out<br>
many other wild beasts; but Thecla<br>
stood with her hands stretched<br>
towards heaven, and prayed; and<br>
when she had done praying, she<br>
turned about, and saw a pit of<br>
water, and said, Now it is a proper<br>
time for me to be baptized.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Accordingly she threw herself<br>
into the water, and said, In thy<br>
name, O my Lord Jesus Christ, I<br>
am this last day baptized. The<br>
women and the people seeing this,<br>
cried out and said, Do not throw<br>
yourself into the water. And the<br>
governor himself cried out, to<br>
think that the fish (sea-calves)<br>
were like to devour so much<br>
beauty.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Notwithstanding all this,<br>
Thecla threw herself into the water,<br>
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>9  But the fish (sea-calves) when<br>
they saw the lightning and fire,<br>
were killed, and swam dead upon<br>
the surface of the water, and a<br>
cloud of fire surrounded Thecla;<br>
so that as the beasts could not<br>
come near her, so the people could<br>
not see her nakedness.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Yet they turned other wild<br>
beasts upon her; upon which they<br>
made a very mournful outcry; and<br>
some of them scattered spikenard,<br>
others cassia, others amomus (a<br>
sort of spikenard, or the herb of<br>
Jerusalem, or ladies rose), others<br>
ointment; so that the quantity of<br>
ointment was large, in proportion<br>
to the number of people; and upon<br>
this all the beasts lay as though<br>
they had been fast asleep, and did<br>
not touch Thecla.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Whereupon Alexander said<br>
to the governor, I have some very<br>
terrible bulls; let us bind her to<br>
them. To which the governor, with<br>
concern, replied, You may do what<br>
you think fit.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Then they put a cord round<br>
Thecla's waist, which bound also<br>
her feet, and with it tied her to<br>
the bulls, to whose privy-parts they<br>
applied red-hot irons, that so they<br>
being the more tormented, might<br>
more violently drag Thecla about,<br>
till they had killed her.</p>
<br>
<p>13  The bulls accordingly tore<br>
about, making a most hideous noise;<br>
but the flame which was about Thecla,<br>
burnt off the cords which were<br>
fastened to the members of the<br>
bulls, and she stood in the middle<br>
of the stage, as unconcerned as<br>
if she had not been bound.</p>
<br>
<p>14  But in the mean time Trifina,<br>
who sat upon one of the benches,<br>
fainted away and died; upon which<br>
the whole city was under a very<br>
great concern.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And Alexander himself was<br>
afraid, and desired the governor,<br>
saying: I entreat you, take<br>
compassion on me and the city,<br>
and release this woman, who has<br>
fought with the beasts; lest both<br>
you and I, and the whole city,<br>
be destroyed;</p>
<br>
<p>16  For if Caesar should have any<br>
account of what has passed now,<br>
he will certainly immediately<br>
destroy the city, because Trifina,<br>
a person of royal extract, and a<br>
relation of his, is dead upon her<br>
seat.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Upon this the governor called<br>
Thecla from among the beasts to him,<br>
and said to her, Who art thou? and<br>
what are thy circumstances, that not<br>
one of the beasts will touch thee?</p>
<br>
<p>18  Thecla replied to him; I am<br>
a servant of the living God; and<br>
as to my state, I am a believer on<br>
Jesus Christ his Son, in whom<br>
God is well pleased; and for that<br>
reason none of the beasts could<br>
touch me.</p>
<br>
<p>19  He alone is the way to eternal<br>
salvation, and the foundation of<br>
eternal life. He is a refuge to<br>
those who are in distress; a support<br>
to the afflicted, hope and defence<br>
to those who are hopeless; and in<br>
a word, all those who do not<br>
believe on him, shall not live,<br>
but suffer eternal death.</p>
<br>
<p>20  When the governor heard these<br>
things, he ordered her clothes<br>
to be brought, and said to her,<br>
Put on your clothes.</p>
<br>
<p>21  Thecla replied: May that God<br>
who clothed me when I was naked<br>
among the beasts, in the day of<br>
judgment clothe your soul with<br>
the robe of salvation. Then she<br>
took her clothes, and put them<br>
on; and the governor immediately<br>
published an order in these words:<br>
I release to you Thecla the servant<br>
of God.</p>
<br>
<p>22  Upon which the women cried<br>
out together with a loud voice,<br>
and with one accord gave praise<br>
unto God, and said; There is but<br>
one God, who is the God of Thecla;<br>
the one God who hath delivered<br>
Thecla.</p>
<br>
<p>23  So loud were their voices,<br>
that the whole city seemed to be<br>
shaken; and Trifina herself heard<br>
the glad tidings, and arose again,<br>
and ran with the multitude to<br>
meet Thecla; and embracing her,<br>
said: Now I believe there shall<br>
be a resurrection of the dead;<br>
now I am persuaded that my daughter<br>
is alive. Come therefore home<br>
with me, my daughter Thecla, and<br>
I will make all over that I have<br>
to you.</p>
<br>
<p>24  So Thecla went with Trifina,<br>
and was entertained there a few<br>
days, teaching her the word of the<br>
Lord, whereby many young women<br>
were converted; and there was<br>
great joy in the family of Trifina.</p>
<br>
<p>25  But Thecla longed to see Paul,<br>
and inquired and sent every where<br>
to find him; and when at length<br>
she was informed that he was at<br>
Myra, in Lycia, she took with her<br>
many young men and women; and<br>
putting on a girdle, and dressing<br>
herself in the habit of a man,<br>
she went to him to Myra in Lycia,<br>
and there found Paul preaching<br>
the word of God; and she stood<br>
by him among the throng.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER X.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Thecla visits Paul;<br>
     6 visits Onesiphorus;<br>
     8 and visits her Mother<br>
     9 who repulses her.<br>
     14 Is tempted by the devil.<br>
     16 Works miracles.</p>
<br>
<p>BUT it was no small surprise<br>
to Paul when he saw her and the<br>
people with her; for he imagined<br>
some fresh trial was coming upon them;</p>
<br>
<p>2  Which when Thecla perceived,<br>
she said to him: I have been baptized,<br>
O Paul; for he who assists you in<br>
preaching, has assisted me to baptize.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Then Paul took her, and led her<br>
to the house of Hermes; and Thecla<br>
related to Paul all that had<br>
befallen her in Antioch, insomuch<br>
that Paul exceedingly wondered,<br>
and all who heard were confirmed<br>
in the faith, and prayed for<br>
Trifina's happiness.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Then Thecla arose, and said<br>
to Paul, I am going to Iconium.<br>
Paul replied to her: Go and teach<br>
the word of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But Trifina had sent large sums<br>
of money to Paul, and also clothing<br>
by the hands of Thecla, for the<br>
relief of the poor.</p>
<br>
<p>6  So Thecla went to Iconium.<br>
And when she came to the house<br>
of Onesiphorus, she fell down upon<br>
the floor where Paul had sat and<br>
preached, and, mixing tears with<br>
her prayers, she praised and<br>
glorified God in the following<br>
words:</p>
<br>
<p>7 O Lord the God of this house,<br>
in which I was first enlightened by<br>
thee; O Jesus, son of the living<br>
God, who wast my helper before<br>
the governor, my helper in the<br>
fire, and my helper among the<br>
beasts; thou alone art God for<br>
ever and ever, Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Thecla now (on her return)<br>
found Thamyris dead, but her<br>
mother living. So calling her<br>
mother, she said to her: Theoclia,<br>
my mother, is it possible for you<br>
to be brought to a belief, that<br>
there is but one Lord God, who<br>
dwells in the heavens? If you<br>
desire great riches, God will<br>
give them to you by me; if you<br>
want your daughter again, here<br>
I am.</p>
<br>
<p>9  These and many other things<br>
she represented to her mother,<br>
(endeavouring) to persuade her<br>
(to her own opinion). But her<br>
mother Theoclia gave no credit to<br>
the things which were said by the<br>
martyr Thecla.</p>
<br>
<p>10  So that Thecla perceiving,<br>
she discoursed to no purpose,<br>
signing her whole body with the<br>
sign (of the cross), left the house<br>
and went to Daphne; and when<br>
she came there, she went to the<br>
cave, where she had found Paul<br>
with Onesiphorus, and fell down<br>
upon the ground; and wept before<br>
God.</p>
<br>
<p>11  When she departed thence,<br>
she went to Seleucia, and<br>
enlightened many in the knowledge<br>
of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And a bright cloud conducted<br>
her in her journey.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And after she had arrived at<br>
Seleucia she went-to a place out<br>
of the city, about the distance<br>
of a furlong, being afraid of the<br>
inhabitants, because they were<br>
worshippers of idols.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And she was lead (by the<br>
cloud) into a mountain called<br>
Calamon, or Rodeon. There she<br>
abode many years, and underwent<br>
a great many grievous temptations<br>
of the devil, which she bore in a<br>
becoming manner, by the assistance<br>
which she had from Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>15  At length certain gentle-women<br>
hearing of the virgin Thecla, went<br>
to her, and were instructed by her<br>
in the oracles of God, and many of<br>
them abandoned this world, and led<br>
a monastic life with her.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Hereby a good report was<br>
spread everywhere of Thecla, and<br>
she wrought several (miraculous)<br>
cures, so that all the city and<br>
adjacent countries brought their<br>
sick to that mountain, and before<br>
they came as far as the door of<br>
the cave, they were instantly cured<br>
of whatso'ever distemper they had.</p>
<br>
<p>17  The unclean spirits were cast<br>
out, making a noise; all received<br>
their sick made whole, and glorified<br>
God, who had bestowed such power<br>
on the virgin Thecla;</p>
<br>
<p>18  Insomuch that the physicians<br>
of Seleucia were now of no more<br>
account, and lost all the profit<br>
of their trade, because no one<br>
regarded them; upon which they<br>
were filled with envy, and began<br>
to contrive what methods to take<br>
with this servant of Christ.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Thecla is attempted to be ravished,<br>
     12 escapes by a rock opening,<br>
     17 and closing miraculously.</p>
<br>
<p>THE devil then suggested bad<br>
advice to their minds; and<br>
being on a certain day met together<br>
to consult, they reasoned among<br>
each other thus: The virgin is a<br>
priestess of the great goddess<br>
Diana, and whatsoever she requests<br>
from her, is granted, because she<br>
is a virgin, and so is beloved<br>
by all the gods.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Now then let us procure some<br>
rakish fellows, and after we have<br>
made them sufficiently drunk, and<br>
given them a good sum of money,<br>
let us order them to go and debauch<br>
this virgin, promising them, if<br>
they do it, a larger reward.</p>
<br>
<p>3 (For they thus concluded among<br>
themselves, that if they be able<br>
to debauch her, the gods will no<br>
more regard her nor Diana cure<br>
the sick for her).</p>
<br>
<p>4  They proceeded according to<br>
this resolution, and the fellows<br>
went to the mountain, and as fierce<br>
as lions to the cave, knocking at<br>
the door.</p>
<br>
<p>5  The holy martyr Thecla relying<br>
upon the God in whom she believed,<br>
opened the door, although she was<br>
before apprised of their design,<br>
and said to them, Young men,<br>
what is your business?</p>
<br>
<p>6  They replied, Is there any<br>
one within, whose name is Thecla?<br>
She answered, What would you<br>
have with her? They said, We<br>
have a mind to lie with her.</p>
<br>
<p>7  The blessed Thecla answered,<br>
Though I am a mean old woman,<br>
I am the servant of my Lord Jesus<br>
Christ; and though you have a<br>
vile design against me, ye shall<br>
not be able to accomplish it. They<br>
replied, Is it impossible? but we<br>
must be able to do with you what<br>
we have a mind,</p>
<br>
<p>8  And while they were saying<br>
this, they laid hold on her by main<br>
force, and would have ravished her.<br>
Then she with the (greatest)<br>
mildness said to them: Young men<br>
have patience, and see the glory<br>
of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And while they held her, she<br>
looked up to heaven and said: O<br>
God most reverend, to whom none<br>
can be likened; who makest thyself<br>
glorious over thine enemies; who<br>
didst deliver me from the fire,<br>
didst not give me up to Thamyris,<br>
and didst not give me up to<br>
Alexander: who deliveredst me<br>
from the wild beasts; who didst<br>
preserve me in the deep waters;<br>
who hast everywhere been my<br>
helper, and hast glorified thy<br>
name in me;</p>
<br>
<p>10  Now also deliver me from<br>
the hands of these wicked and<br>
unreasonable men nor suffer them<br>
to debauch my chastity which I<br>
have hitherto preserved for thy<br>
honour; for I love thee, and long<br>
for thee, and worship thee,<br>
O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,<br>
for evermore. Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Then came a voice from<br>
heaven, saying, Fear not Thecla,<br>
my faithful servant, for I am with<br>
thee. Look and see the place<br>
which is opened for thee; there thy<br>
eternal abode shall be; there thou<br>
shalt receive the (beatific) vision.</p>
<br>
<p>12  The blessed Thecla observing,<br>
saw the rock opened to as large<br>
a degree as that a man might enter<br>
in; she did as she was commanded,<br>
bravely fled from the vile crew,<br>
and went into the rock, which<br>
instantly so closed, that there<br>
was not any crack visible where<br>
it had opened.</p>
<br>
<p>13  The men stood perfectly<br>
astonished at so prodigious a<br>
miracle, and had no power to detain<br>
the  servant of God; but only<br>
catching hold of her veil (or hood),<br>
they tore off a piece of it;</p>
<br>
<p>14  And even that was by the<br>
permission of God, for the<br>
confirmation of their faith,<br>
who should come to see this<br>
venerable place; and to convey<br>
blessings to those in succeeding<br>
ages, who should believe on our<br>
Lord Jesus Christ from a pure heart.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Thus suffered that first<br>
martyr and apostle of God, and<br>
virgin, Thecla, who came from<br>
Iconium at eighteen years of age;<br>
afterwards, partly in journeys and<br>
travels, and partly in a monastic<br>
life in the cave, she lived seventy-<br>
two years; so that she was ninety<br>
years old when the Lord translated<br>
her.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Thus ends her life.</p>
<br>
<p>17  The day which is kept sacred<br>
to her memory, is the twenty-fourth<br>
of September, to the glory of the<br>
Father, and the Son, and the Holy<br>
Ghost, now and for evermore. Amen.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>              REFERENCES TO THE ACTS OF ST. PAUL AND THECLA.</p>
<br>
<p>[Tertullian says that this piece was forged by a Presbyter of Asia, who<br>
being  convicted, "confessed that he did it out of respect to Paul," and<br>
Pope Gelasius, in his Decree against apocryphal books, inserted it among<br>
them.  Notwithstanding this, a large part of the history was credited and<br>
looked upon as  genuine among the primitive Christians. Cyprian,<br>
Eusebius, Epiphanius, Austin, Gregory, Nagianzen. Chrysostom, and Severus<br>
Sulpitius, who all lived within the fourth century mention Thecla or<br>
refer to her history.  Basil of Seleucia wrote her acts, sufferings and<br>
victories, in verse; and Euagrius Scholasticus an ecclesiastical<br>
historian, about 590, relates that "after the  Emperor Zeno, had<br>
abdicated his empire, and Basilik had taken possession of it, he had a<br>
vision of the holy and excellent martyr Thecla, who promised him the<br>
restoration of his empire; for which, when it was brought about, he<br>
erected and dedicated a most noble and sumptuous temple to this famous<br>
martyr, Thecla, at Seleucia, a city of Isauria, and bestowed upon it very<br>
noble endowments, which (says the author) are preserved even till this<br>
day." Hist. Ecel. lib. 3 cap. 8.--Cardinal Barenius, Locrinus, Archbishop<br>
Wake, and  others; and also the learned Grabe, who edited the Septuagint,<br>
and revived  the Acts of Paul and Thecla, consider them as having been<br>
written in the Apostolic age; as containing nothing superstitious, or<br>
disagreeing from the opinions and belief of those times; and, in short,<br>
as a genuine and authentic history. Again, it is said, that this is not<br>
the original book of the early  Christians; but however that may be, it<br>
is published from the Greek MS. in the Bodlian Library at Oxford, which<br>
Dr. Mills copied and transmitted to Dr, Grabe.]</p>

                      CLEMENT TO THE CORINTHIANS.</h2></center>
<br><br><br>
<p>
CHAPTER I.</p>
<br>
<p>     Clement commends them for their excellent order<br>
     and piety in Christ, before their schism broke out.</p>
<br>
<p>THE Church of God which is<br>
at Rome, to the Church of God<br>
which is at Corinth, elect,<br>
sanctified by the will of God,<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord:<br>
grace and peace from the Almighty<br>
God, by Jesus Christ, be multiplied<br>
unto you.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Brethren, the sudden and<br>
unexpected dangers and calamities<br>
that have fallen upon us, have, we<br>
fear, made us the more slow in our<br>
consideration of those things which<br>
you inquired of us:</p>
<br>
<p>3  As also of that wicked and<br>
detestable sedition, so unbecoming<br>
the elect of God, which a few<br>
headstrong and self-willed men<br>
have fomented to such a degree of<br>
madness, that your venerable and<br>
renowned name, so worthy of all<br>
men to be beloved, is greatly<br>
blasphemed thereby.</p>
<br>
<p>4  For who that has ever been<br>
among you has not experienced<br>
the firmness of your faith, and<br>
its fruitfulness in all good works;<br>
and admired the temper and<br>
moderation of your religion in<br>
Christ; and published abroad the<br>
magnificence of your hospitality;<br>
and thought you happy in your<br>
perfect and certain knowledge of<br>
the Gospel?</p>
<br>
<p>5  For ye did all things without<br>
respect of persons, and walked<br>
according to the laws of God;<br>
being subject to those who had<br>
the rule over you, and giving the<br>
honour that was fitting to the aged<br>
among you.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Ye commanded the young men<br>
to think those things that were<br>
modest and grave.</p>
<br>
<p>7  The women ye exhorted to do<br>
all things with an unblameable,<br>
and seemly, and pure conscience;<br>
loving their own husbands, as was<br>
fitting: and that keeping themselves<br>
within the bounds of a due obedience,<br>
they should order their houses<br>
gravely, with all discretion.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Ye were all of you humble-<br>
minded, not boasting of anything<br>
desiring rather to be subject than<br>
to govern; to give than to receive;<br>
being a content with the portion<br>
God hath dispensed to you:</p>
<br>
<p>9  And hearkening diligently to<br>
his word, ye were enlarged in<br>
your bowels, having his sufferings<br>
always before your eyes.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Thus a firm, and blessed,<br>
and profitable peace was given<br>
unto you: and an unsatiable desire<br>
of doing good; and a plentiful<br>
effusion of the Holy Ghost was<br>
upon all of you.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And being full of good<br>
designs, ye did with, great<br>
readiness of mind, and with<br>
a religious confidence stretch<br>
forth your hands to God Almighty;<br>
beseeching him to be merciful<br>
unto you, if in anything ye had<br>
unwillingly sinned against him.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Ye contended day and night<br>
for the whole brotherhood; that<br>
with compassion and a good<br>
conscience, the number of his<br>
elect might be saved.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Ye were sincere, and without<br>
offence towards each other; not<br>
mindful of injuries; all sedition<br>
and schism was an abomination<br>
unto you.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Ye bewailed every one his<br>
neighbours' sins, esteeming their<br>
defects your own.</p>
<br>
<p>15 Ye were kind one to another<br>
without grudging; being ready to<br>
every good work. And being<br>
adorned with a conversation<br>
altogether virtuous and religious,<br>
ye did all things in the fear of<br>
God; whose I commandments were<br>
written upon the tables of your<br>
heart.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<br>
<p>     How their divisions began.</p>
<br>
<p>ALL honour and enlargement<br>
was given unto you; and so<br>
was fulfilled that which is written,<br>
my beloved did eat and drink, he<br>
was enlarged and waxed fat, and<br>
he kicked.</p>
<br>
<p>2  From hence came emulation,<br>
and envy, and strife, and sedition;<br>
persecution and disorder, war and<br>
captivity.</p>
<br>
<p>3  So they who were of no renown,<br>
lifted up themselves against<br>
the honourable; those of no<br>
reputation against those who were<br>
in respect; the foolish against the<br>
wise; the young men against the<br>
aged.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Therefore righteousness and<br>
peace are departed from you,<br>
because every one hath forsaken<br>
the fear of God; and is grown blind<br>
in his faith; nor walketh by the<br>
rule of God's commandments nor<br>
liveth as is fitting in Christ:</p>
<br>
<p>5  But every one follows his<br>
own wicked lusts: having taken<br>
up an unjust and wicked envy, by<br>
which death first entered into the<br>
world.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<br>
<p>     Envy and emulation the original of all<br>
     strife and disorder.  Examples of the<br>
     mischiefs they have occasioned.</p>
<br>
<p>FOR thus it is written,<br>
And in process of time it came to<br>
pass, that Cain brought of the fruit<br>
of the ground an offering unto the<br>
Lord. And Abel, he also brought<br>
of the firstlings of his flock,<br>
and of the fat thereof:</p>
<br>
<p>2  And the Lord had respect unto<br>
Abel, and to his offering. But<br>
unto Cain and unto his offering he<br>
had not respect. And Cain was<br>
very sorrowful, and his countenance<br>
fell.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And the Lord said unto Cain,<br>
Why art thou sorrowful? And<br>
why is thy countenance fallen?<br>
If thou shalt offer aright, but not<br>
divide aright, hast thou not sinned?<br>
Hold thy peace: unto thee shall<br>
be his desire, and thou shalt rule<br>
over him.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And Cain said unto Abel his<br>
brother, Let us go down into the<br>
field. And it came to pass, as<br>
they were in the field, that Cain<br>
rose up against Abel his brother,<br>
and slew him.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Ye see, brethren, how envy<br>
and emulation wrought the death<br>
of a brother. For this, our father<br>
Jacob fled from the face of his<br>
brother Esau.</p>
<br>
<p>6  It was this that caused Joseph<br>
to be persecuted even unto death,<br>
and to come into bondage. Envy<br>
forced "Moses to flee from the<br>
face of Pharoah king of Egypt,<br>
when he heard, his own countryman<br>
ask him, "Who made thee a Judge,<br>
and a ruler over us? Wilt thou<br>
kill me as thou didst the<br>
Egyptian yesterday?</p>
<br>
<p>7  Through envy Aaron and Miriam<br>
were shut out of the camp, from<br>
the rest of the congregation<br>
seven days.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Emulation's sent Dathan and<br>
Abiram quick into the grave because<br>
they raised up a sedition against<br>
Moses the servant of God.</p>
<br>
<p>9  For this, David was not<br>
only hated of strangers, but was<br>
persecuted even by Saul the king<br>
of Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>10  But not to insist upon ancient<br>
examples, let us come to those<br>
worthies that have been nearest<br>
to us; and take the brave<br>
examples of our own age.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Through zeal and envy, the<br>
most faithful and righteous pillars<br>
of the church have been persecuted<br>
even to the most grevious deaths.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Let us set before our eyes,<br>
the holy Apostles; Peter by unjust<br>
envy underwent not one or two,<br>
but many sufferings; till at last<br>
being martyred, he went to the<br>
place of glory that was due unto<br>
him.</p>
<br>
<p>13  For the same cause did<br>
Paul in like manner receive the<br>
reward of his patience. Seven<br>
times he was in bonds; he was<br>
whipped, was stoned; he preached<br>
both in the East and in the West;<br>
leaving behind him the glorious<br>
report of his faith:</p>
<br>
<p>14  And so having taught the<br>
whole world righteousness, and<br>
for that end travelled even to<br>
the utmost bounds of the West;<br>
he at last suffered martyrdom<br>
by the command of the governors,</p>
<br>
<p>15  And departed out of the<br>
world, and went unto his holy<br>
place; having become a most<br>
eminent pattern of patience<br>
unto all ages.</p>
<br>
<p>16  To these Holy Apostles<br>
were joined a very great number<br>
of others, who having through<br>
envy undergone in like manner<br>
many pains and torments, have<br>
left a glorious example to us.</p>
<br>
<p>17  For this, not only men but<br>
women have been persecuted;<br>
and having suffered very grievous<br>
and cruel punishments, have<br>
finished the course of their faith<br>
with firmness; and though weak<br>
in body, yet received a glorious<br>
reward.</p>
<br>
<p>18  This has alienated the<br>
minds even of women from their<br>
husbands; and changed what was<br>
once said by our father Adam;<br>
This is now bone of my bones,<br>
and flesh of my flesh.</p>
<br>
<p>19  In a word, envy and strife,<br>
have overturned whole cities, and<br>
rooted out great nations from off<br>
the earth.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<br>
<p>     4 He exhorts them to live by holy rules, and repent<br>
     of their divisions, and they shall be forgiven.</p>
<br>
<p>THESE things, beloved, we<br>
write unto you, not only for<br>
your instruction, but also for our<br>
own remembrance.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For we are all in the same<br>
lists, and the same combat is<br>
prepared for us all.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Wherefore let us lay aside all<br>
vain and empty cares; and let us<br>
come up to the glorious and<br>
venerable rule of our holy calling.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Let us consider what is good,<br>
and acceptable and well-pleasing<br>
in the sight of him that made us.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Let us look steadfastly to the<br>
blood of Christ, and see how<br>
precious his blood is in the sight<br>
of God: which being shed for our<br>
salvation, has obtained the grace<br>
of repentance for all the world.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Let us search into all the<br>
ages that have gone before us;<br>
and learn that our Lord has in<br>
every one of them still given place<br>
for repentance to all such as would<br>
turn to him.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Noah preached repentance;<br>
and as many as hearkened to him<br>
were saved. Jonah denounced<br>
destruction against the Ninevites.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Howbeit they repenting of<br>
their sins, appeased God by their<br>
prayers: and were saved, though<br>
they were strangers to the covenant<br>
of God.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Hence we find how all the<br>
ministers of the grace of God<br>
have spoken by the Holy Spirit of<br>
repentance. And even the Lord of<br>
all, has himself declared with an<br>
oath concerning it;</p>
<br>
<p>10  As I live, saith the Lord,<br>
I desire not the death of a sinner,<br>
but that he should repent. Adding<br>
farther this good sentence, saying<br>
Turn from your iniquity, O house<br>
of Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Say unto the children of<br>
my people, though your sins should<br>
reach from earth to heaven; and<br>
though they shall be redder than<br>
scarlet, and blacker than sackcloth<br>
yet if ye shall turn to me with all<br>
your heart, and shall call me<br>
father, I will hearken to you, as<br>
to a holy people.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And in another place he saith<br>
on this wise: wash ye, make you<br>
clean; put away the evil of your<br>
doings from before mine eyes;<br>
cease to do evil, learn to do well;<br>
seek judgment, relieve the<br>
oppressed, judge the fatherless,<br>
plead for the widow.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Come now and let us reason<br>
together, saith the Lord: though<br>
your sins be as scarlet, they shall<br>
be as white as snow; though they<br>
be as red as crimson, they shall<br>
be as wool.</p>
<br>
<p>14  If ye be willing and obedient<br>
ye shall eat the good of the land<br>
but, if ye refuse and rebel, ye<br>
shall be devoured with the sword;<br>
for the mouth of the Lord hath<br>
spoken it.</p>
<br>
<p>15  These things has God<br>
established by his Almighty will,<br>
desiring that all his beloved<br>
should come to repentance.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER V.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 He sets before them the examples of holy men,<br>
     whose piety is recorded in the Scripture.</p>
<br>
<p>WHEREFORE let us obey his<br>
excellent and glorious will;<br>
and imploring his mercy and<br>
goodness, let us fall down upon<br>
our faces before him, and cast<br>
ourselves upon his mercy; laying<br>
aside all vanity, and contention,<br>
and envy which leads unto death.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Let us look up to those who<br>
have the most perfectly ministered<br>
to his excellent glory. Let us<br>
take Enoch for our example;<br>
who being found righteous in<br>
obedience, was translated, and<br>
his death was not known.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Noah being proved to be<br>
faithful, did by his ministry,<br>
preach regeneration to the world;<br>
and the Lord saved by him all the<br>
living creatures, that went with<br>
one accord into the ark.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Abraham, who was called<br>
God's friend, was in like manner<br>
found faithful; inasmuch as he<br>
obeyed the commands of God.</p>
<br>
<p>5  By obedience he went out of<br>
his own country, and from his<br>
own kindred, and from his father's<br>
house; that so forsaking a small<br>
country, and a weak affinity, and<br>
a little house, he might inherit<br>
the promises of God.</p>
<br>
<p>6  For thus God said unto him;<br>
"get thee out of thy country, and<br>
from thy kindred, and from thy<br>
father's house, unto a land that<br>
I will show thee."</p>
<br>
<p>7  "And, I will make thee a great<br>
nation, and will bless thee, and<br>
make thy name great, and thou<br>
shalt be blessed.   And I will<br>
bless them that bless thee, and<br>
curse them that curse thee; and<br>
in thee shall all families of the<br>
earth be blessed,"</p>
<br>
<p>8  And again when he separated<br>
himself from Lot, God said unto<br>
him; I Lift up now thine eves, and<br>
look from the place where thou<br>
art northward, and southward, and<br>
eastward, and westward, for all<br>
the land which thou seest, to thee<br>
will I give it, and to thy seed for<br>
ever.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And I will make thy seed as<br>
the dust of the earth, so that if a<br>
man can number the dust of the<br>
earth, then shall thy seed also be<br>
numbered.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And again he saith: and<br>
God brought forth Abraham, and<br>
said unto him; look now toward<br>
heaven, and tell the stars, if thou<br>
be able to number them: so shall<br>
thy seed be.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And Abraham believed God,<br>
and it was counted to him for<br>
righteousness.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Through faith and hospitality<br>
he had a son given him in his<br>
old age; and through obedience<br>
he offered him up in sacrifice to<br>
God, upon one of the mountains<br>
which God showed into him.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
<br>
<p>     1  Redemption for such as have been eminent for their<br>
     faith, kindness, and charity to their neighbours.</p>
<br>
<p>BY hospitality and goodliness<br>
was Lot saved out of Sodom,<br>
when all the country round about<br>
was destroyed by fire and brimstone.</p>
<br>
<p>2  The Lord thereby making it<br>
manifest, that he will not forsake<br>
those that trust in him; but will<br>
bring the disobedient to punishment<br>
and correction.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For his wife who went out<br>
with him, being of a different<br>
mind, and not continuing in the<br>
same obedience, was for that reason<br>
set forth for an example, being<br>
turned into a pillar of salt<br>
unto this day.</p>
<br>
<p>4  That so all men may know,<br>
that those who are double minded,<br>
and distrustful of the power of<br>
God, are prepared for condemnation,<br>
and to be a sign to all succeeding<br>
ages.</p>
<br>
<p>5  By faith and hospitality was<br>
Rahab the harlot saved. For when<br>
the spies were sent by Joshua the<br>
son of Nun to search out Jericho,<br>
and the king of Jericho knew that<br>
they were come to spy out his<br>
country, he sent men to take them,<br>
so that they might be put to<br>
death.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Rahab therefore, being hospitable,<br>
received them, and hid them under<br>
the stalks of flax, on the top of<br>
her house.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And when the messengers that<br>
were sent by the king came unto<br>
her, and asked her, saying,<br>
There came men unto thee to spy<br>
out the land, bring them forth, for<br>
so hath the king commanded: She<br>
answered, The two men whom ye<br>
seek came unto me, but presently<br>
they departed, and are gone: Not<br>
discovering them unto them.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Then she said to the spies,<br>
I know that the Lord your God has<br>
given this city into your hands;<br>
for the fear of you is fallen upon<br>
all that dwell therein. When,<br>
therefore, ye shall have taken it,<br>
ye shall save me and my father's<br>
house.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And they answered her, saying,<br>
It shall be as thou hast spoken<br>
unto us, Therefore, when thou<br>
shalt know that we are near, thou<br>
shalt gather all thy family together,<br>
upon the house-top and they shall<br>
be saved: but all that shall be<br>
found without thy house shall<br>
be destroyed.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And they gave her moreover<br>
a sign, that she should hang<br>
out of her house a scarlet rope,<br>
showing thereby, that by the<br>
blood of our Lord, there should be<br>
redemption to all that believe and<br>
hope in God. Ye see, beloved,<br>
how there was not only faith, but<br>
prophesy too in this woman.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 What rules are given for leading a holy life.</p>
<br>
<p>LET us, therefore, humble ourselves,<br>
brethren, laying aside all pride,<br>
and boasting, and foolishness,<br>
and anger: And let us do as it<br>
is written.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For thus saith the Holy Spirit;<br>
Let not the wise man glory in his<br>
wisdom, nor the strong man in<br>
his strength, nor the rich man<br>
in his riches; but let him that<br>
glorieth, glory in the Lord, to seek<br>
him, and to do judgment and justice.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Above all, remembering the<br>
words of the Lord Jesus, which he<br>
spake concerning equity and long<br>
suffering, saying,</p>
<br>
<p>4  Be ye merciful, and ye shall<br>
obtain mercy; forgive, and ye<br>
shall be forgiven; as ye do, so<br>
shall it be done unto you; as ye<br>
give, so shall it be given unto<br>
you; as ye judge, so shall ye be<br>
judged; as ye are kind to others,<br>
so shall God be kind to you; with<br>
what measure ye mete, with the<br>
same shall it be measured to you<br>
again.</p>
<br>
<p>5  By this command, and by<br>
these rules, let us establish<br>
ourselves, that so we may always<br>
walk obediently to his holy words;<br>
being humble minded:</p>
<br>
<p>6  For so says the Holy Scripture;<br>
upon whom shall I look, even upon<br>
him that is poor and of a contrite<br>
spirit, and that trembles at my word.</p>
<br>
<p>7  It is, therefore, just and<br>
righteous, men and brethren, that<br>
we should become obedient unto God,<br>
rather than follow such as through<br>
pride and sedition, have made<br>
themselves the ring-leaders of<br>
a detestable emulation.</p>
<br>
<p>8  For it is not an ordinary harm<br>
that we shall do ourselves, but<br>
rather a very great danger that we<br>
shall run, if we shall rashly give<br>
up ourselves to the wills of men,<br>
who promote strife and seditions,<br>
to turn us aside from that which is<br>
fitting.</p>
<br>
<p>9  But let us be kind to one<br>
another, according to the compassion<br>
and sweetness of him that made us.</p>
<br>
<p>10  For it is written, The merciful<br>
shall inherit the earth; and they<br>
that are without evil shall be left<br>
upon it: but the transgressors shall<br>
perish from off the face of it.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And again be saith, I have<br>
seen the wicked in great power<br>
and spreading himself like the<br>
cedar of Libanus. I passed by,<br>
and lo! he was not; I sought his<br>
place, but it could not be found.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Keep innocently, and do the<br>
thing that is right, for there shall<br>
be a remnant to the peaceable<br>
man.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Let us, therefore, hold fast<br>
to those who religiously follow<br>
peace; and not to such as only<br>
pretend to desire.</p>
<br>
<p>14  For he saith in a certain<br>
place, This people honoureth me<br>
with their lips, but their heart<br>
is far from me.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And again, They bless with<br>
their mouths, but curse in their<br>
hearts.</p>
<br>
<p>16  And again he saith, They<br>
loved him with their mouths, and<br>
with their tongues they lied to<br>
him. For their heart was not right<br>
with him, neither were they<br>
faithful in his covenant.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Let all deceitful lips become<br>
dumb, and the tongue that speaketh<br>
proud things. Who have said, with<br>
our tongue will we prevail; our lips<br>
are our own, who is Lord over us?</p>
<br>
<p>18  For the oppression of the<br>
poor, for the sighing of the needy,<br>
now will I arise saith the Lord;<br>
I will set him in safety, I will<br>
deal confidently with him.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     He advises then, to be humble, and, follow the<br>
     examples of Jesus, and of holy men in all ages.</p>
<br>
<p>FOR Christ is theirs who are<br>
humble, and not who exalt<br>
themselves over his flock. The<br>
sceptre of the majesty of God, our<br>
Lord Jesus Christ, came not in<br>
the show of pride and arrogance,<br>
though he could have done so;<br>
but with humility as the Holy<br>
Ghost had before spoken<br>
concerning him.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For thus he saith, Lord, who<br>
hath believed our report, and to<br>
whom is the arm of the Lord<br>
revealed; For he shall grow up<br>
before him as a tender plant, and<br>
as a root out of a dry ground;</p>
<br>
<p>3  He hath no form or comeliness,<br>
and when we shall see him, there<br>
is no beauty that we should desire<br>
him.</p>
<br>
<p>4  He is despised and rejected of<br>
men; a man of sorrows and acquainted<br>
with grief.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And we hid, as it were, our<br>
faces from him; he was despised,<br>
and we esteemed him not.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Surely he hath borne our<br>
griefs, and carried our sorrows<br>
yet we did esteem him stricken,<br>
smitten of God, and afflicted.</p>
<br>
<p>7  But he was wounded for our<br>
transgressions; he was bruised for<br>
our iniquities; the chastisement<br>
of our peace was upon him; and<br>
with his stripes we are healed.</p>
<br>
<p>8  All we like sheep have gone<br>
astray; we have turned every one<br>
to his own way; and the Lord hath<br>
laid on him the iniquity of us all.</p>
<br>
<p>9  He was oppressed, and he was<br>
afflicted, yet he opened not his<br>
mouth: he is brought as a lamb to<br>
the slaughter; and as a sheep<br>
before her shearers is dumb,<br>
so he openeth not his mouth.</p>
<br>
<p>10  He was taken from prison<br>
and from judgment; and who shall<br>
declare this generation? For he<br>
was cut off out of the land of the<br>
living: for the transgression of my<br>
people was he stricken.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And he made his grave with<br>
the wicked, and with the rich in<br>
his death; because he had done no<br>
violence, neither was any deceit<br>
in his mouth.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Yet it pleased the Lord to<br>
bruise him; he hath put him to<br>
grief: when thou shalt make his<br>
soul an offering for sin, he shall<br>
see his seed, he shall prolong his<br>
days, and the pleasure of the Lord<br>
shall prosper m his hand.</p>
<br>
<p>13  He shall see of the travail<br>
of his soul, and shall be satisfied:<br>
by his knowledge shall my righteous<br>
servant justify many; for he shall<br>
bear their iniquities.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Therefore will I divide him<br>
a portion with the great, and he<br>
shall divide the spoil with the<br>
strong; because he hath poured<br>
out his soul unto death; and he<br>
was numbered with the transgressors,<br>
and he bare the sin of many, and<br>
made intercession for the<br>
transgressors.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And again he himself saith,<br>
I am a worm and no man, a reproach<br>
of men, and despised of the people.<br>
All they that see me laugh me to<br>
scorn; they shoot out their lips,<br>
they shake their heads, saying;<br>
He trusted in the Lord that he<br>
would deliver him, let him<br>
deliver him seeing he delighted<br>
in him.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Ye see, beloved, what the<br>
pattern is that has been given to<br>
us.  For if the Lord thus humbled<br>
himself, what should we do who<br>
are brought by him under the<br>
yoke of his grace?</p>
<br>
<p>17  Let us be followers of those<br>
who went about in goat-skins, and<br>
sheep-skins; preaching the coming<br>
of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Such were Elias, and Eliaxus,<br>
and Ezekiel, the prophets,<br>
And let us add to these, such<br>
others as have received the like<br>
testimony.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Abraham has been greatly<br>
witnessed of; having been called<br>
the friend of God. And yet he<br>
steadfastly beholding the glory of<br>
God, says with all humility, I am<br>
dust and ashes.</p>
<br>
<p>20  Again of Job, it is thus<br>
written, That he was just, and<br>
without blame, true; one that served<br>
God, and abstained from all evil.<br>
Yet he accusing himself, said, No<br>
man is free from pollution, no,<br>
not though he should live but one<br>
day.</p>
<br>
<p>21  Moses was called faithful in<br>
all God's House; and by his conduct<br>
the Lord punished Israel by stripes<br>
and plagues.</p>
<br>
<p>22  And even this man, though<br>
thus greatly honoured, spake not<br>
greatly of himself; but when the<br>
oracle of God was delivered to him<br>
out of the bush, he said, Who<br>
am I, that thou dost send me? I<br>
am of a slender voice, and a slow<br>
tongue.</p>
<br>
<p>23  And again he saith, I am as<br>
the smoke of the pot.</p>
<br>
<p>24  And what shall we say of<br>
David, so highly testified of in the<br>
Holy Scriptures? To whom God said,<br>
I have found a man after my own<br>
heart, David the son of Jesse,<br>
with my holy oil have I anointed<br>
him.</p>
<br>
<p>25  But yet he himself saith unto<br>
God, Have mercy upon me, O God,<br>
according to thy loving kindness;<br>
according unto the multitude of<br>
thy tender mercies, blot out my<br>
transgressions.</p>
<br>
<p>26  Wash me thoroughly from<br>
mine iniquity, and cleanse me<br>
from my sin. For I acknowledge<br>
my transgressions, and my sin is<br>
ever before me.</p>
<br>
<p>27  Against Thee only have I<br>
sinned, and done this evil in<br>
thy sight; that thou mightest<br>
be justified when thou speakest;<br>
and be clear when thou judgest.</p>
<br>
<p>28  Behold I was shapen in<br>
iniquity, and in sin did my mother<br>
conceive me.</p>
<br>
<p>29  Behold, thou desirest truth<br>
in the inward parts; and in the<br>
hidden part thou shalt make me to<br>
know wisdom.</p>
<br>
<p>30  Purge me with hyssop, and<br>
I shall be clean: wash me, and I<br>
shall be whiter than snow.</p>
<br>
<p>31  Make me to hear joy and<br>
gladness, that the bones which<br>
thou hast broken may rejoice.</p>
<br>
<p>32  Hide thy face from my sins,<br>
and blot out all mine iniquities.<br>
Create in me a clean heart O God;<br>
and renew a right spirit<br>
within me.</p>
<br>
<p>34  Cast me not away from thy<br>
presence, and take not thy holy<br>
spirit from me.</p>
<br>
<p>35  Restore unto me the joy of<br>
thy salvation, and uphold me with<br>
thy free spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>36  Then will I teach transgressors<br>
thy ways, and sinners shall be<br>
converted unto thee.</p>
<br>
<p>37  Deliver me from blood-guiltiness,<br>
O God, thou God of my salvation;<br>
and my tongue shall sing aloud<br>
of thy righteousness.</p>
<br>
<p>38  O Lord open thou my lips,<br>
and my mouth shall. show forth<br>
thy praise.</p>
<br>
<p>39  For thou desirest not sacrifice,<br>
else would I give it; thou<br>
delightest not in burnt-offerings.</p>
<br>
<p>40  The sacrifices of God are<br>
a broken spirit; a broken and a<br>
contrite heart, O God, thou wilt<br>
not despise.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>
<br>
<p>     He again persuades them to compose their divisions.</p>
<br>
<p>THUS has the humility and<br>
godly fear of these great<br>
and excellent men recorded in<br>
the Scriptures, through obedience,<br>
made not only us, but also the<br>
generations before us better;<br>
even as many as have received his<br>
holy oracles with fear and truth.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Having therefore so many,<br>
and such great and glorious<br>
examples, let us return to that<br>
peace which was the mark that<br>
from the beginning was set before<br>
us;</p>
<br>
<p>3  Let us look up to the Father<br>
and Creator of the whole world;<br>
and let us hold fast to his glorious<br>
and exceeding gifts and benefits<br>
of peace.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Let us consider and behold<br>
with the eyes of our understanding<br>
his long suffering will; and think<br>
how gentle and patient he is<br>
towards his whole creation.</p>
<br>
<p>5  The heavens moving by his<br>
appointment, are subject to him<br>
in peace.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Day and night accomplish the<br>
courses that he has allotted unto<br>
them, not disturbing one another.</p>
<br>
<p>7  The sun and moon, and all the<br>
several companies and constellations<br>
of the stars, run the courses that<br>
he has appointed to them in concord,<br>
without departing in the least from<br>
them.</p>
<br>
<p>8  The fruitful earth yields its<br>
food plentifully in due season both<br>
to man and beast, and to all animals<br>
that are upon it, according to his<br>
will; not disputing, nor altering<br>
any thing of what was ordered by him.</p>
<br>
<p>9  So also the unfathomable and<br>
unsearchable floods of the deep,<br>
are kept in by his command;</p>
<br>
<p>10  And the conflux of the vast<br>
sea, being brought together by his<br>
order into its several collections,<br>
passes not the bounds that he has<br>
set to it;</p>
<br>
<p>11  But as he appointed it, so it<br>
remains. For he said,  Hitherto<br>
shalt then come, and thy floods<br>
shall be broken within thee.</p>
<br>
<p>12  The ocean impassable to<br>
mankind, and the worlds that are<br>
beyond it are governed by the<br>
same commands of their great<br>
master.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Spring and summer, autumn<br>
and winter, give place peaceably<br>
to each other.</p>
<br>
<p>14  The several quarters of the<br>
winds fulfil their work in their<br>
seasons, without offending one<br>
another.</p>
<br>
<p>15  The ever-flowing fountains,<br>
made both for pleasure and health,<br>
never fail to reach out their breasts<br>
to support the life of men.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Even the smallest creatures<br>
live together in peace and concord<br>
with each other.</p>
<br>
<p>17  All these has the Great Creator<br>
and Lord of all, commanded to<br>
observe peace and concord; being<br>
good to all.</p>
<br>
<p>18  But especially to us who flee<br>
to his mercy through our Lord<br>
Jesus Christ; to whom be glory<br>
and majesty for ever and ever.<br>
Amen.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER X.</p>
<br>
<p>     He exhorts them to obedience, from the consideration<br>
     of the goodness of God, and of his presence in every place.</p>
<br>
<p>TAKE heed, beloved, that his<br>
many blessings be not to our<br>
condemnation; except we shall<br>
walk worthy of him, doing with<br>
one consent what is good and<br>
pleasing in his sight.</p>
<br>
<p>2  The spirit of the Lord is a<br>
candle, searching out the inward<br>
parts of the belly.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Let us therefore consider how<br>
near he is to us; and how that<br>
none of our thoughts, or reasonings<br>
which we frame within ourselves,<br>
are hid from him,</p>
<br>
<p>4  It is therefore just that we<br>
should not forsake our rank, by<br>
doing contrary to his will.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Let us choose to offend a few<br>
foolish and inconsiderate men,<br>
lifted up and glorying in their<br>
own pride, rather than God.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Let us reverence our Lord<br>
Jesus Christ whose blood was<br>
given for us.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Let us honour those who are<br>
set over us; let us respect the<br>
aged that are amongst us; and let<br>
us instruct the younger men, in<br>
the discipline and fear of the<br>
LORD.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Our wives let us direct, to do<br>
that which is good.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Let them show forth a lovely<br>
habit of purity, in all their<br>
conversation; with a sincere<br>
affection of meekness.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Let the government of their<br>
tongues be made manifest by their<br>
silence.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Let their charity be without<br>
respect of persons, alike towards<br>
all such as religiously fear<br>
God.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Let your children be bred<br>
up in the instruction of Christ:</p>
<br>
<p>13  And especially let them learn<br>
how great a power humility has<br>
with God; how much a pure and<br>
holy charity avails with him; how<br>
excellent and great his fear is;<br>
and how it will save all such as<br>
turn to him with holiness in a pure<br>
mind.</p>
<br>
<p>14  For he is the searcher of the<br>
thoughts and counsels of the heart;<br>
whose breath is in us, and when<br>
he pleases he can take it from<br>
us.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>
CHAP. XI.</p>
<br>
<p>     Of faith: and particularly what we are<br>
     to believe as to the Resurrection.</p>
<br>
<p>BUT all these things must be<br>
confirmed by the faith which<br>
is in Christ; for so He himself<br>
bespeaks us by the Holy Ghost;</p>
<br>
<p>2  Comeye children and hearken<br>
unto me, and I will teach you the<br>
fear of the Lord. What man is<br>
there that desireth life, and loveth<br>
to see good days?</p>
<br>
<p>3  Keep thy tongue from evil,<br>
and thy lips that they speak no<br>
guile.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Depart from evil and do good;<br>
seek peace and pursue it.</p>
<br>
<p>5  The eyes of the Lord are upon<br>
the righteous, and his ears are<br>
open unto their prayers.</p>
<br>
<p>6  But the face of the Lord is<br>
against them that do evil, to cut<br>
off the remembrance of them from<br>
the earth.</p>
<br>
<p>7  The righteous cried, and the<br>
Lord heard him, and delivered<br>
him out of all his troubles.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Many are the troubles of the<br>
wicked; but they that trust in the<br>
Lord mercy shall encompass them<br>
about.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Our all-merciful and beneficent<br>
Father hath bowels of compassion<br>
towards them that fear him: and<br>
kindly and lovingly bestows his<br>
graces upon all such as come to<br>
him with a simple mind.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Wherefore let us not waver,<br>
neither let us have any doubt in<br>
our hearts, of his excellent and<br>
glorious gifts.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Let that be far from us<br>
which is written, Miserable are<br>
the double-minded, and those who<br>
are doubtful in their hearts;</p>
<br>
<p>12  Who say these things have<br>
we heard, and our fathers have<br>
told us these things. But behold<br>
we are grown old, and none of<br>
them has happened unto us.</p>
<br>
<p>13 O ye fools consider the trees:<br>
take the vine for an example.<br>
First it sheds its leaves; then it<br>
buds; after that it spreads its<br>
leaves; then it flowers; then come<br>
the sour grapes; and after them<br>
follows the ripe fruit. See how in<br>
a little time the fruit of the trees<br>
comes to maturity.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Of a truth yet a little while<br>
and his will shall suddenly be<br>
accomplished.</p>
<br>
<p>15  The Holy Scripture itself<br>
bearing witness, that He shall<br>
quickly come and not tardy, and<br>
that the Lord shall suddenly come<br>
to his temple, even the 3 holy ones<br>
whom ye look for.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Let us consider, beloved,<br>
how the Lord does continually<br>
show us, that there shall be a<br>
future resurrection; of which he<br>
has made our Lord Jesus Christ<br>
the first fruits, raising him from<br>
the dead.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Let us contemplate, beloved,<br>
the resurrection that is continually<br>
made before our eyes.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Day and night manifest a<br>
resurrection to us. The night lies<br>
down, and the day arises: again<br>
the day departs and the night<br>
comes on.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Let us behold the fruits of<br>
the earth. Every one sees how the<br>
seed is sown. The sower goes<br>
forth, and casts it upon the earth;<br>
and the seed which when it was<br>
sown fell upon the earth dry and<br>
naked, in time dissolves.</p>
<br>
<p>20  And from the dissolution,<br>
the great power of the providence<br>
of the Lord rises it again; and of<br>
one seed many arise, and bring<br>
forth fruit.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>
<br>
<p>     The Resurrection further proved.</p>
<br>
<p>LET us consider that wonderful<br>
type of the resurrection which<br>
is seen in the Eastern countries:<br>
that is to say, in Arabia.</p>
<br>
<p>2  There is a certain bird called<br>
a Phoenix;  of this there is never<br>
but one at a time: and that lives<br>
five hundred years. And when<br>
the time of its dissolution draws<br>
near, that it must die, it makes<br>
itself a nest of frankincense, and<br>
myrrh, and other spices into which<br>
when its time is fulfilled it enters<br>
and dies.</p>
<br>
<p>3  But its flesh putrifying, breeds<br>
a certain worm, which being nourished<br>
with the juice of the dead bird<br>
brings forth feathers; and when<br>
it is grown to a perfect state,<br>
it takes up the nest in which<br>
the bones of its parent lie, and<br>
carries it from Arabia into Egypt,<br>
to a city called Heliopolis:</p>
<br>
<p>4  And flying in open day in the<br>
sight of all men, lays it upon the<br>
altar of the sun, and so returns<br>
from whence it came.</p>
<br>
<p>5  The priests then search into<br>
the records of the time: and find<br>
that it returned precisely at the<br>
end of five hundred years.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And shall we then think it to<br>
be any very great and strange<br>
thing for the Lord of all to raise<br>
up those that religiously serve him<br>
in the assurance of a good faith,<br>
when even by a bird he shows us<br>
the greatness of his power to fulfil<br>
his promise?</p>
<br>
<p>7  For he says in a certain place,<br>
Thou shalt raise me up and I shall<br>
confess unto thee.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And again, I laid me down<br>
and slept, and awaked, because<br>
thou art with me.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And again, Job says, Thou<br>
shalt raise up this flesh of mine,<br>
that has suffered all these<br>
things.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Having therefore this hope,<br>
let us hold fast to him who is<br>
faithful in all his promises, and<br>
righteous in all his judgments;<br>
who has commanded us not to lie,<br>
how much more will he not<br>
himself lie?</p>
<br>
<p>11  For nothing is impossible<br>
with God but to lie.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Let his faith then be stirred<br>
up again in us; and let us consider<br>
that all things are nigh unto him.</p>
<br>
<p>13  By the word of his power he<br>
made all things: and by the same<br>
word he is able, (whenever he<br>
will,) to destroy them.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Who shall say unto him,<br>
what dost thou? or who shall<br>
resist the power of his strength?</p>
<br>
<p>15  When, and as he pleased,<br>
he will do all things; and nothing<br>
shall pass away of all that has been<br>
determined by him.</p>
<br>
<p>16  All things are open before<br>
him; nor can anything be hid<br>
from his counsel.</p>
<br>
<p>17 The heavens declare the<br>
glory of God, and the firmament<br>
showeth his handy work. Day<br>
unto day uttereth speech, and<br>
night unto night showeth<br>
knowledge. There is no speech nor<br>
language where their voice is not<br>
heard.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     It is impossible to escape the vengeance of God,<br>
     if we continue in sin.</p>
<br>
<p>SEEING then all things are seen<br>
and heard by God, let us fear<br>
him, and let us lay aside our<br>
wicked works which proceed from<br>
ill desires; that through his mercy<br>
we may be delivered from the<br>
condemnation to come.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For whither can any of us flee<br>
from his mighty hand? Or what<br>
world shall receive any of those<br>
who run away from him?</p>
<br>
<p>3  For thus saith the Scripture<br>
in a certain place. Whither shall<br>
I flee from thy spirit, or where<br>
shall I hide myself from thy<br>
presence?</p>
<br>
<p>4  If I ascend up into heaven,<br>
thou art there; if I shall go to the<br>
uttermost parts of the earth, there<br>
is thy right hand: if I shall make<br>
my bed in the deep, thy Spirit is<br>
there.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Whither then shall any one<br>
go; or whither shall he run from<br>
him that comprehends all things?</p>
<br>
<p>6  Let us therefore come to him<br>
with holiness of heart, lifting up<br>
chaste and undefiled hands unto<br>
him; loving our gracious and<br>
merciful Father, who has made us<br>
to partake of his election.</p>
<br>
<p>7  For so it is written, When<br>
the Most High divided the nations;<br>
when he separated the sons of<br>
Adam, he set the bounds of the<br>
nations, according to the number<br>
of his angels; his people Jacob<br>
became the portion of the Lord,<br>
and Israel the lot of his<br>
inheritance.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And in another place he saith,<br>
Behold the Lord taketh unto himself<br>
a nation, out of the midst of the<br>
nations, as a man taketh the first-<br>
fruits of his flour; and the Most<br>
Holy shall come out of that nation.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>
<br>
<p>     How we must live that we may please God.</p>
<br>
<p>WHEREFORE we being apart<br>
of the Holy One: let us do<br>
all those things that pertain unto<br>
holiness:</p>
<br>
<p>2  Fleeing all evil-speaking<br>
against one another; all filthy<br>
and impure embraces, together with<br>
all drunkenness, youthful lusts,<br>
abominable concupiscences,<br>
detestable adultery, and<br>
execrable pride.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For God saith, he resisteth<br>
the proud, but giveth grace to the<br>
humble.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Let us therefore hold fast to<br>
those to whom God has given his<br>
grace.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And let us put on concord,<br>
being humble, temperate; free<br>
from all whispering and detraction;<br>
and justified by our actions,<br>
not our words.</p>
<br>
<p>6  For he saith, Doth he that<br>
speaketh and heareth many things,<br>
and is of a ready tongue, suppose<br>
that he is righteous?  Blessed is<br>
he that is born of a woman, that<br>
liveth but a few days: use not<br>
therefore much speech.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Let our praise be of God, not<br>
of ourselves; for God hateth those<br>
that commend themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Let the witness of our good<br>
actions be given to us by others,<br>
as it was given to the holy men<br>
that went before us.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Rashness, and arrogance, and<br>
confidence, belong to them who<br>
are accursed of God: but equity,<br>
and humility, and mildness, to<br>
such as are blessed by him.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Let us then lay hold of his<br>
blessing, and let as consider what<br>
are the ways by which we may<br>
attain unto it.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Let us look back upon those<br>
things that have happened from<br>
the beginning.</p>
<br>
<p>12  For what was our Father<br>
Abraham blessed? Was it not<br>
because that through faith he<br>
wrought righteousness and truth?</p>
<br>
<p>13  Isaac  being fully persuaded<br>
of what he knew was to come,<br>
cheerfully yielded himself up for<br>
a sacrifice. Jacob with humility<br>
departed out of his own country,<br>
fleeing from his brother, and went<br>
unto Laban and served him; and<br>
so the sceptre of the twelve tribes<br>
of Israel was given unto him.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Now what the greatness of<br>
this gift was, will plainly appear,<br>
if we shall take the pains distinctly<br>
to consider all the parts of it.</p>
<br>
<p>15  For, from him came the<br>
priests and Levites; who all<br>
ministered at the altar of God.</p>
<br>
<p>16  From him came our Lord<br>
Jesus Christ, according to the<br>
flesh.</p>
<br>
<p>17  From him came the kings,<br>
and princes, and rulers in Judah.</p>
<br>
<p>18 Nor were the rest of his<br>
tribes in any little glory: God<br>
having promised that their seed<br>
shall be as the stars of heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>19  They were all therefore<br>
greatly glorified, not for their own<br>
sake, or for their own works, or<br>
for the righteousness that they<br>
themselves wrought, but through<br>
his will.</p>
<br>
<p>20  And we also being called by<br>
the same will in Christ Jesus, are<br>
not justified by ourselves, neither<br>
by our own wisdom, or knowledge,<br>
or piety, or the works which we<br>
have done in the holiness of our<br>
hearts.</p>
<br>
<p>21  But by that faith, by which<br>
God Almighty has justified all<br>
men from the beginning; to whom<br>
be glory for ever and ever, Amen.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>
<br>
<p>     We are justified by faith; yet this must not<br>
     lessen our care to live a virtuous life,<br>
     nor our pleasure in it.</p>
<br>
<p>WHAT shall we do therefore,<br>
brethren? Shall we be slothful<br>
in well-doing, and lay aside<br>
our charity?   God forbid that any<br>
such thing should be done by us.</p>
<br>
<p>2  But rather let us hasten with<br>
all earnestness and readiness of<br>
mind, to perfect every good work.<br>
For even the Creator and Lord of<br>
all things himself rejoices in his<br>
own works.</p>
<br>
<p>3  By his Almighty power he<br>
fixed the heavens, and by his<br>
incomprehensible wisdom he<br>
adorned them.</p>
<br>
<p>4  He also divided the earth<br>
from the water, with which it is<br>
encompassed: and fixed it as a<br>
secure tower, upon the foundation<br>
of his own will.</p>
<br>
<p>5  He also by his appointment,<br>
commanded all the living creatures<br>
that are upon it, to exist.</p>
<br>
<p>6  So likewise the sea, and all<br>
the creatures that are in it;<br>
having first created them, he<br>
enclosed them therein by his power.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And above all, he with his<br>
holy and pure hands, formed man,<br>
the most excellent; and, as to his<br>
understanding, truly the greatest<br>
of all other creatures; the character<br>
of his own image.</p>
<br>
<p>8  For thus God says; Let us<br>
make man in our image, after our<br>
own likeness; so God created man,<br>
male and female created he them.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And having thus finished all<br>
these things, he commended all<br>
that he had made, and blessed<br>
them, and said, increase and<br>
multiply.</p>
<br>
<p>10  We see how all righteous men<br>
have been adorned with good works<br>
Wherefore even the Lord himself,<br>
having adorned himself with his<br>
works, rejoiced.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Having therefore such an<br>
example, let us without delay,<br>
fulfil his will; and with all<br>
our strength, work the work of<br>
righteousness.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XVI.</p>
<br>
<p>     A virtuous life enforced from the examples<br>
     of the holy angels, and from the exceeding<br>
     greatness of that reward which God has prepared for us.</p>
<br>
<p>THE good workman with<br>
confidence receives the bread of<br>
his labour; but the sluggish and<br>
lazy cannot look him in the face<br>
that set him on work.</p>
<br>
<p>2  We must therefore be ready<br>
and forward in well-doing: for<br>
from him are all things.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And thus he foretels us,<br>
behold the Lord cometh, and his<br>
reward is with him, even before his<br>
face, to render to everyone according<br>
to his work.</p>
<br>
<p>4  He warns us therefore beforehand,<br>
with all his heart to this end,<br>
that we should not be slothful and<br>
negligent in well-doing.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Let our boasting, therefore,<br>
and our confidence be in God<br>
let us submit ourselves to his will,<br>
Let us consider the whole multitude<br>
of his angels, how ready they<br>
stand to minister unto his will.</p>
<br>
<p>6  As saith the Scripture,<br>
thousands of thousands stood<br>
before him and ten thousand<br>
times ten thousand ministered<br>
unto him. And they cried, saying,<br>
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of<br>
hosts; The whole earth is full<br>
of his glory.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Wherefore let us also, being<br>
conscientiously gathered together<br>
in concord with one another; as<br>
it were with one mouth, cry,<br>
earnestly unto him, that he would<br>
make us partakers of his great and<br>
glorious promises.</p>
<br>
<p>8  For he saith, a Eye hath not<br>
seen, nor ear heard, neither have<br>
entered into the heart of man, the<br>
things which God has prepared for<br>
them that wait for him,</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XVII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 We must attain the gifts of God by faith and obedience,<br>
     which we must carry on in an orderly pursuing of the<br>
     duties of our several stations, without envy or contention.<br>
     24 The necessity of different orders among men.<br>
     33 We have none of us anything but what we received of God:<br>
     whom therefore we ought in every condition thankfully to obey.</p>
<br>
<p>HOW blessed and wonderful,<br>
beloved, are the gifts of God.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Life in immortality! brightness<br>
in righteousness! truth in full<br>
assurance! faith in confidence!<br>
temperance in holiness!</p>
<br>
<p>3  And all this has God subjected<br>
to our understandings:</p>
<br>
<p>4  What therefore shall those<br>
things be which he has prepared<br>
for them that wait for him?</p>
<br>
<p>5  The Creator and Father of<br>
spirits, the Most Holy; he only<br>
knows both the greatness and<br>
beauty of them,</p>
<br>
<p>6 Let us therefore strive with<br>
all earnestness, that we may be<br>
found in the number of those that<br>
wait for him, that so we may<br>
receive the reward which he has<br>
promised.</p>
<br>
<p>7  But how, beloved, shall we do<br>
this? We must fix our minds by<br>
faith towards God, and seek those<br>
things that are pleasing and<br>
acceptable unto him.</p>
<br>
<p>8  We must act conformably to<br>
his holy will; and follow the way<br>
of truth, casting off from us all<br>
unrighteousness and iniquity,<br>
together with all covetousness,<br>
strife, evil manners, deceit,<br>
whispering, detractions; all<br>
hatred of God, pride and boasting;<br>
vain-glory and ambition;</p>
<br>
<p>9  For they that do these things<br>
are odious to God; and not only<br>
they that do them, but also all<br>
such as approve of those that do<br>
them.</p>
<br>
<p>10  For thus saith the Scripture,<br>
But unto the wicked, God said,<br>
What hast thou to do to declare<br>
my statute, or that thou shouldst<br>
take my covenant in thy mouth?<br>
Seeing that thou hatest instruction,<br>
and castest my words behind thee.</p>
<br>
<p>11  When thou sawest a thief,<br>
then thou consentedst with him;<br>
thou hast been partaker with<br>
adulterers, Thou givest thy mouth<br>
to evil, and thy tongue frameth<br>
deceit. Thou sittest and speakest<br>
against thy brother; thou slanderest<br>
thine own mother's son.</p>
<br>
<p>12  These things hast thou done<br>
and I kept silence; thou thoughtest<br>
that I was altogether such a one<br>
as thyself: but I will reprove thee,<br>
and set them in order before thine<br>
eyes.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Now consider this ye that<br>
forget God, lest I tear you in pieces,<br>
and there be none to deliver.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Whose offereth praise,<br>
gloryfieth me; And to him that<br>
disposeth his way aright, will<br>
I show the salvation of God.</p>
<br>
<p>15  This is the way, beloved, in<br>
which we may find our Saviour,<br>
even Jesus Christ, the high-priest<br>
of all our offerings, the defender<br>
and helper of our weakness.</p>
<br>
<p>16  By him we look up to the<br>
highest heavens; and behold, as<br>
in a glass, his spotless and most<br>
excellent visage.</p>
<br>
<p>17  By him are the eyes of our<br>
hearts opened; by him our foolish<br>
and darkened understanding<br>
rejoiceth to behold his wonderful<br>
light.</p>
<br>
<p>18 By him would God have us<br>
to taste the knowledge of<br>
immortality: who being the<br>
brightness of his glory, is by<br>
so much greater than the angels,<br>
as be has by inheritance obtained<br>
a more excellent name than they.</p>
<br>
<p>19  For so it is written, who<br>
maketh his angels spirits, and his<br>
ministers a flame of fire:</p>
<br>
<p>20  But to his son, thus saith the<br>
Lord, Thou art my Son, to-day<br>
have I begotten thee.</p>
<br>
<p>21  Ask of me and I will give<br>
thee the heathen for thy inheritance,<br>
and the utmost parts of the earth<br>
for thy possession.</p>
<br>
<p>22  And again he saith unto him,<br>
Sit thou on my right hand until<br>
I make thine enemies thy<br>
foot-stool.</p>
<br>
<p>23  But who are his enemies?<br>
even the wicked, and such who<br>
oppose their own wills to the<br>
will of God.</p>
<br>
<p>24  Let us therefore march-on,<br>
men and brethren, with all<br>
earnestness in his holy laws.</p>
<br>
<p>25  Let us consider those who<br>
fight under our, earthly governors<br>
How orderly, how readily, and<br>
with what exact obedience they<br>
perform those things that are<br>
commanded them.</p>
<br>
<p>26  All are not generals, nor<br>
colonels, nor captains, nor<br>
inferior officers:</p>
<br>
<p>27  But everyone in his respective<br>
rank does what is commanded him by<br>
the king, and those who have the<br>
authority over him.</p>
<br>
<p>28  They who are great, cannot<br>
subsist without those that are little;<br>
nor the little without the great;</p>
<br>
<p>29  But there must be a mixture<br>
in all things, and then there will<br>
be use and profit too.</p>
<br>
<p>30  Let us, for example, take<br>
our body: the head without the<br>
feet is nothing, neither the feet<br>
without the head.</p>
<br>
<p>31  And even the smallest members<br>
of our body are yet both necessary<br>
and useful to the whole body.</p>
<br>
<p>32  But all conspire together,<br>
and are subject to one common<br>
use, namely, the preservation of<br>
the whole body.</p>
<br>
<p>33 Let therefore our whole body<br>
by saved in Christ Jesus; and let<br>
everyone be subject to his neighbour,<br>
according to the order in which<br>
he is placed by the gift of God.</p>
<br>
<p>34  Let not the strong man despise<br>
the weak; and let the weak see that<br>
he reverence the strong.</p>
<br>
<p>35  Let the rich man distribute<br>
to the necessity of the poor; and<br>
let the poor bless God, that he has<br>
given one unto him, by whom his<br>
want may be supplied.</p>
<br>
<p>36  Let the wise man show forth<br>
his wisdom, not in words, but in<br>
good works.</p>
<br>
<p>37  Let him that is humble, not<br>
bear witness to himself, but let<br>
him leave it to another to bear<br>
witness of him.</p>
<br>
<p>38  Let him that is pure in the<br>
flesh, not grow proud of it, knowing<br>
that it was from another that he<br>
received the gift of continence.</p>
<br>
<p>39  Let us consider therefore,<br>
brethren, whereof we are made;<br>
who, and what kind of men we<br>
came into the world, as it were<br>
out of a sepulchre, and from outer<br>
darkness.</p>
<br>
<p>40  He hath made us, and formed<br>
us, brought us into his own world;<br>
having presented us with his<br>
benefits, even before we were born.</p>
<br>
<p>41  Wherefore, having received<br>
all these things from him, we<br>
ought in everything to give thanks<br>
unto him, to whom be glory for<br>
ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XVIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     Clement therefore exhorts them to do everything<br>
     orderly in the Church, as the only way to please God.</p>
<br>
<p>FOOLISH and unwise men, who<br>
have neither prudence, nor<br>
learning, may mock and deride<br>
us; being willing to setup<br>
themselves in their own conceits.</p>
<br>
<p>2  But what can a mortal man<br>
do? Or what strength is there in<br>
him that is made out of the dust?</p>
<br>
<p>3  For it is written, there was no<br>
shape before mine eyes; only I<br>
heard a sound and a voice.</p>
<br>
<p>4  For what? Shall  man be pure<br>
before the Lord? Shall he be<br>
blameless in his works?</p>
<br>
<p>5  Behold, he trusteth not in<br>
his servants; and his angels he<br>
chargeth with folly.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Yes, the heaven is not clean<br>
in his sight, how much less they<br>
that dwell in houses of clay; of<br>
which also we ourselves were<br>
made?</p>
<br>
<p>7  He smote them as a moth:<br>
and from morning even unto the<br>
evening they endure not. Because<br>
they were not able to help<br>
themselves, they perished;<br>
he breathed upon them and they<br>
died, because they had no wisdom.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Call now if there be any that<br>
will answer thee; and to which of<br>
the angels wilt thou look?</p>
<br>
<p>9  For wrath killeth the foolish<br>
man, and envy slayeth him that is<br>
in error.</p>
<br>
<p>10  I have seen the foolish taking<br>
root, but lo, their habitation was<br>
presently consumed.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Their children were far from<br>
safety, they perished at the gates<br>
of those who were lesser than<br>
themselves: and there was no man<br>
to help them.</p>
<br>
<p>12  For what was prepared for<br>
them, the righteous did eat; and<br>
they shall not be delivered from<br>
evil.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Seeing then these things are<br>
manifest unto us, it will behove<br>
us to take care that looking into<br>
the depths of the divine knowledge,<br>
we do all things in order,<br>
whatsoever our Lord has commanded<br>
us to do.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And particularly that we<br>
perform our offerings and service to<br>
God, at their appointed seasons<br>
for these he has commanded to be<br>
done, not rashly and disorderly,<br>
but at certain determinate times<br>
and hours.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And therefore he has ordained<br>
by his supreme will and authority,<br>
both where, and by what persons,<br>
they are to be performed; that<br>
so all things being piously done<br>
unto all well-pleasing, they<br>
may be acceptable unto him.</p>
<br>
<p>16  They therefore who make<br>
their offerings at the appointed<br>
seasons, are happy and accepted;<br>
because through obeying the<br>
commandments of the Lord,<br>
they are free from sin.</p>
<br>
<p>17  And the same care must be<br>
had of the persons that minister<br>
unto him.</p>
<br>
<p>18  For the chief-priest has his<br>
proper services; and to the priest<br>
their proper place is appointed;<br>
and to the Levites appertain their<br>
proper ministries; and the layman<br>
is confined within the bounds of<br>
what is commanded to laymen.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Let every one of you therefore,<br>
brethren, bless God in his proper<br>
station, with a good conscience,<br>
and with all gravity, not exceeding<br>
the rule of his service that is<br>
appointed to him.</p>
<br>
<p>20  The daily sacrifices are not<br>
offered everywhere; nor the peace-<br>
offerings, nor the sacrifices<br>
appointed for sins and transgressions;<br>
but only at Jerusalem: nor in any<br>
place there, but only at the altar<br>
before the temple; that which is<br>
offered being first diligently<br>
examined by the high-priest and<br>
the other minister we before<br>
mentioned.</p>
<br>
<p>21  They therefore who do any<br>
thing which is not agreeable to his<br>
will, are punished with death.</p>
<br>
<p>22  Consider, brethren, that by<br>
how much the better knowledge<br>
God has vouchsafed unto us, by so<br>
much the greater danger are we<br>
exposed to.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>
<br>
<p>     The orders of Ministers in Christ's Church established<br>
     by the Apostles, according to Christ's command,<br>
     7 after the example of Moses.<br>
     16 Therefore they who have been duly placed in the<br>
     ministry according to their order, cannot without<br>
     great sin be put out of it.</p>
<br>
<p>THE Apostles have preached to<br>
us from the Lord Jesus Christ<br>
Jesus Christ from God.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Christ therefore was sent by<br>
God, the Apostles by Christ; so<br>
both were orderly sent, according<br>
to the will of God.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For having received their<br>
command, and being thoroughly<br>
assured by the resurrection of our<br>
Lord Jesus Christ, and convinced<br>
by the word of God, with the<br>
fulness of the Holy Spirit, they<br>
went abroad, publishing, That the<br>
kingdom of God was at hand.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And thus preaching through<br>
countries and cities, they appointed<br>
the first fruits of their conversion<br>
to be bishops and ministers over<br>
such as should afterwards believe,<br>
having first proved them by the<br>
Spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Nor was this any new thing;<br>
seeing that long before it was<br>
written concerning bishops and<br>
deacons.</p>
<br>
<p>6  For thus saith the Scripture,<br>
in a certain place; I will appoint<br>
their overseers in righteousness,<br>
and their ministers in faith.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And what wonder if they, to<br>
whom such a work was committed<br>
by God in Christ, established such<br>
officers as we before mentioned;<br>
when even that blessed and faithful<br>
servant in all his house, Moses,<br>
set down in the Holy Scriptures<br>
all things that were commanded<br>
him.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Whom also all the rest of the<br>
prophets followed, bearing witness<br>
with one consent to those things<br>
that were appointed by him.</p>
<br>
<p>9  For he, perceiving an emulation<br>
to arise among the tribes concerning<br>
the priesthood, and that there was<br>
a strife about it, which of them<br>
should be adorned with that glorious<br>
name; commanded their twelve captains<br>
to bring to him twelve rods; every<br>
tribe being written upon its rod,<br>
according to its name,</p>
<br>
<p>10  And he took them and bound<br>
them together, and sealed them<br>
with the seals of the twelve princes<br>
of the tribes: and laid them up in<br>
the tabernacle of witness, upon<br>
the table of God.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And when he had shut the<br>
door of the tabernacle, he sealed<br>
up the keys of it, in like manner<br>
as he had done the rods; and said<br>
unto them, Men and brethren,<br>
whichsoever tribe shall have its<br>
rod blossom, that tribe has God<br>
chosen to perform the office of a<br>
priest, and to minister unto him<br>
in holy things.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And when the morning was<br>
come, he called together all Israel,<br>
six hundred thousand men; and<br>
showed to the princes their seals<br>
and opened the tabernacle of<br>
witness; and brought forth the<br>
rods.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And the rod of Aaron was<br>
found not only to have blossomed,<br>
but also to have fruit upon it.</p>
<br>
<p>14  What think you, beloved?<br>
Did not Moses before know what<br>
should happen?</p>
<br>
<p>15  Yes verily: but to the end<br>
there might be no division, nor<br>
tumult in Israel, he did in this<br>
manner, that the name of the true<br>
and only God might be glorified;<br>
to whom be honour for ever and<br>
ever, Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>16  So likewise our Apostles<br>
knew by our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
that there should contentions arise,<br>
upon account of the ministry.</p>
<br>
<p>17  And therefore having a perfect<br>
fore-knowledge of this, they<br>
appointed persons, as we have<br>
before said, and then a gave<br>
direction, how, when they should<br>
die, other chosen and approved men<br>
should succeed in their ministry.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Wherefore we cannot think<br>
that those may justly be thrown<br>
out of their ministry, who were<br>
either appointed by them, or<br>
afterwards chosen by other eminent<br>
men, with the consent of the whole<br>
church; and who have with all<br>
lowliness and innocency ministered<br>
to the flock of Church, in peace,<br>
and without self-interest, and<br>
were for a long time commended<br>
by all.</p>
<br>
<p>19  For it would be no small sin<br>
in us, should we cast off those<br>
from their ministry, who holily<br>
and without blame fulfil the<br>
duties of it.</p>
<br>
<p>20  Blessed are those priests,<br>
who having finished their course<br>
before these times, have obtained<br>
a fruitful and perfect dissolution<br>
for they have no fear, lest any one<br>
should turn them out of the place<br>
which is now appointed for them.</p>
<br>
<p>21  But we see how you have<br>
put out some, who lived reputably<br>
among you, from the ministry,<br>
which by their innocence they had<br>
adorned.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XX.</p>
<br>
<p>     He exerts them to peace from examples out of<br>
     the Holy Scriptures,<br>
     20 particularly from St. Paul's exhortation to them.</p>
<br>
<p>YE are contentious, brethren,<br>
and zealous for things that<br>
pertain not unto salvation.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Look into the Holy Scriptures,<br>
which are the true words of the<br>
Holy Ghost. Ye know that there<br>
is nothing unjust or counterfeit<br>
written in them.</p>
<br>
<p>3  There you shall not find that<br>
righteous men were ever cast off<br>
by such as were good themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>4  They were persecuted, but it<br>
was by the wicked and unjust.</p>
<br>
<p>5  They were cast into prison,<br>
but they were cast in by those that<br>
were unholy.</p>
<br>
<p>6  They were stoned, but it was<br>
by transgressors.</p>
<br>
<p>7  They were killed, but by accursed<br>
men, and such as had taken up an<br>
unjust envy against them.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And all these things they<br>
underwent gloriously.</p>
<br>
<p>9  For what shall we say,<br>
brethren? Was Daniel cast into the<br>
den of lions, by men fearing<br>
God? Shadrach, Meshach, and<br>
Abednego, were they cast into the<br>
fiery furnace by men, professing<br>
the excellent and glorious worship<br>
of the Most High? God forbid.</p>
<br>
<p>10  What kind of persons then<br>
were they that did these things?<br>
They were men abominable, full<br>
of all wickedness; who were<br>
incensed; to so great a degree,<br>
as to bring those into sufferings,<br>
who with a holy and unblameable<br>
purpose of mind worshipped God:<br>
not knowing that the Most High is<br>
the protector and defender of all<br>
such as with a pure conscience<br>
serve his holy name: to whom be<br>
glory for ever and ever, Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>11  But they who with a full<br>
persuasion have endured these<br>
things, are made partakers of glory<br>
and honour: and are exalted and<br>
lifted up by God for a memorial<br>
throughout all ages, Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>12 Wherefore it will behove<br>
us also, brethren, to follow such<br>
examples as these; for it is<br>
written, Hold fast to such as are<br>
holy; for they that do so shall be<br>
sanctified.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And again in another place<br>
he saith, With the pure, thou shalt<br>
be pure (and with the elect thou<br>
shalt be elect,) but with, the<br>
perverse man thou shalt be perverse.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Let us therefore join ourselves<br>
to the innocent and righteous; for<br>
such are the elect of God.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Wherefore are there strifes,<br>
and anger, and divisions, and<br>
schisms, and wars, among us?</p>
<br>
<p>16  Have we not all one God,<br>
and one Christ? Is not one spirit<br>
of grace poured out upon us all?<br>
Have we not one calling in Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Why then do we rent and<br>
tear in pieces the members of<br>
Christ; and raise seditious against<br>
our own body? And are come to such<br>
a height of madness, as to forget<br>
that we were members one of another?</p>
<br>
<p>18  Remember the words of our<br>
Lord Jesus, (how he said, Woe to<br>
that man by whom offences come).<br>
It, were better for him that he<br>
had never been born, than that he<br>
should have offended one of my<br>
elect. It were better for him,<br>
that a mill-stone should be tied<br>
about his neck, and he should be<br>
cast into the sea, than that he<br>
should offend one of my<br>
little ones.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Your schism has perverted<br>
many, has discouraged many: it<br>
has caused diffidence in many, and<br>
grief in us all. And yet your<br>
sedition continues still.</p>
<br>
<p>20  Take the Epistle of the<br>
blessed Paul the Apostle into your<br>
hands; What was It that he wrote<br>
to you at his first preaching the<br>
Gospel among you?</p>
<br>
<p>21  Verily he did by the spirit<br>
admonish you concerning himself,<br>
and Cephas, and Apollos, because<br>
that even then ye had begun to<br>
fall into parties and factions<br>
among yourselves.</p>
<br>
<p>22  Nevertheless your partiality<br>
then led you into a much less sin<br>
forasmuch as ye placed your<br>
affections upon Apostles, men<br>
of eminent reputation in the<br>
church; and upon another, who<br>
was greatly tried and approved<br>
of by them.</p>
<br>
<p>23  But consider, we pray you,<br>
who are they that have now led<br>
you astray; and lessened the<br>
reputation of that brotherly love<br>
that was so eminent among you;</p>
<br>
<p>24  It is a shame, my beloved,<br>
yea, a very great shame, and<br>
unworthy of your Christian<br>
profession, to hear that the<br>
most firm and ancient church<br>
of the Corinthians should,<br>
by one or two persons, be led<br>
into a sedition against its<br>
priests.</p>
<br>
<p>25  And this report is come not<br>
only to us, but to those also that<br>
differ from us.</p>
<br>
<p>26  Insomuch that the name of<br>
the Lord is blasphemed through<br>
your folly; and even ye yourselves<br>
are brought into danger by it.</p>
<br>
<p>27  Let us therefore with all<br>
haste put an end to this sedition;<br>
and let us fall down before the<br>
Lord, and beseech him with tears<br>
that he would be favourably<br>
reconciled to us, and restore us<br>
again to a seemly and holy course<br>
of brotherly love.</p>
<br>
<p>28  For this is the gate of<br>
righteousness, opening unto life:<br>
As it is written, I Open unto me<br>
the gates of righteousness; I will<br>
go into them and will praise the<br>
Lord. This is the gate of the Lord,<br>
the righteous shall enter into it.</p>
<br>
<p>29  Although therefore many<br>
gates are opened, yet this gate of<br>
righteousness is that gate in Christ<br>
at which blessed are they that<br>
enter in, and direct their way in<br>
holiness and righteousness; doing<br>
all things without disorder.</p>
<br>
<p>30  Let a man be faithful, let<br>
him be powerful in the utterance<br>
of knowledge; let him be wise in<br>
making an exact judgment of<br>
words; let him be pure in all<br>
his actions.</p>
<br>
<p>31  But still by how much the<br>
more he seems to be above others,<br>
by reason of these things, by so<br>
much the more will it behove him<br>
to be humble-minded; and to seek<br>
what is profitable to all men, and<br>
not his own advantage.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XXI.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 The value which God, puts upon love and<br>
     unity: the effects of a true charity,<br>
     8 which is the gift of God, and must be obtained by prayer.</p>
<br>
<p>HE that has the love that is in<br>
Christ, let him keep the<br>
commandments of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For who is able to express the<br>
obligation of the love of God?<br>
What man is sufficient to declare,<br>
and is fitting, the excellency of its<br>
beauty?</p>
<br>
<p>3  The height to which charity<br>
leads, is inexpressible.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Charity unites us to God;<br>
charity covers the multitude of<br>
sins: charity endures all things;<br>
is long-suffering in all things.</p>
<br>
<p>5  There is nothing base and<br>
sordid in charity: charity lifts not<br>
itself up above others; admits of<br>
no divisions; is not seditious; but<br>
does all things in peace and concord.</p>
<br>
<p>6  By charity were all the elect of<br>
God made perfect: Without it nothing<br>
is pleasing and acceptable in the<br>
sight of God.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Through charity did the Lord<br>
join us into himself; whilst for<br>
the love that he bore towards us,<br>
our Lord Jesus Christ gave his<br>
own blood for us, by the will of<br>
God; his flesh for our flesh; his<br>
soul for our souls.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Ye see, beloved, how great<br>
and wonderful a thing charity is;<br>
and how that no expressions are<br>
sufficient to declare its perfection.</p>
<br>
<p>9  But who is fit to be found in<br>
it? Even such only as God shall<br>
vouchsafe to make so.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Let us therefore pray to him,<br>
and beseech him, that we may be<br>
worthy of it; that so we may live<br>
in charity; being unblamable,<br>
without human propensities,<br>
without respect of persons.</p>
<br>
<p>11  All the ages of the world,<br>
from Adam, even unto this day,<br>
are passed away; but they who<br>
have been made perfect in love,<br>
have by the grace of God obtained<br>
a place among the righteous; and<br>
shall be made manifest in the<br>
judgment of the kingdom of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>12  For it is written, Enter into<br>
thy chambers for a little space, till<br>
my anger and indignation shall<br>
pass away: And I will remember<br>
the good day, and, will raise you<br>
up out of your graves.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Happy then shall we be,<br>
beloved, if we shall have fulfilled<br>
the commandments of God, in the<br>
unity of love; that so, through<br>
love, our sins may be forgiven us.</p>
<br>
<p>14  For so it is written, Blessed<br>
are they whose iniquities are<br>
forgiven, and whose sins are covered.<br>
Blessed is the man to whom the<br>
Lord imputeth no sin, and in whose<br>
mouth there is no guile.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Now this blessing is fulfilled<br>
in those who are chosen by God<br>
through Jesus Christ our Lord, to<br>
whom be glory for ever and ever,<br>
Amen.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XXII.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 He exhorts such as have been concerned in these divisions to<br>
     repent, and return to their unity, confessing their sin to God,<br>
     7 which he enforces from the example of Moses,<br>
     10 and of many among the heathen,<br>
     23 and of Judith and Esther among the Jews.</p>
<br>
<p>LET us therefore, as many as<br>
have transgressed by any of<br>
the suggestions of the adversary,<br>
beg God's forgiveness.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And as for those who have<br>
been the heads of the sedition and<br>
faction among you, let them look<br>
to the common end of our hope.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For as many as are endued<br>
with fear and charity, would rather<br>
they themselves should fall into<br>
trials than their neighbours: And<br>
choose to be themselves condemned,<br>
rather than that the good and just<br>
charity delivered to us, should<br>
suffer.</p>
<br>
<p>4  For it is seemly for a man<br>
to confess wherein he has<br>
transgressed.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And not to harden his heart,<br>
as the hearts of those were<br>
hardened, who raised up sedition<br>
against Moses the servant of God<br>
whose punishment was manifest<br>
unto all men, for they went down<br>
alive into the grave; death<br>
swallowed them up.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Pharaoh and his host, and<br>
all the rulers of Egypt, their<br>
chariots also and their horsemen,<br>
were for no other cause drowned<br>
in the bottom of the Red Sea,<br>
and perished; but because they<br>
hardened their foolish hearts,<br>
after so many signs done in the<br>
land of Egypt, by Moses the<br>
servant of God.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Beloved, God is not indigent<br>
of anything; nor does he demand<br>
anything of us, but that we<br>
should confess our sins unto him.</p>
<br>
<p>8  For so says the Holy David,<br>
I will confess unto the Lord, and<br>
it shall please him better than a<br>
young bullock that hath horns and<br>
hoof. Let the poor see it and be<br>
glad.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And again he saith, Offer<br>
unto God the sacrifice of praise,<br>
and pay thy vows unto the Most<br>
Highest. And call upon me in the<br>
day of trouble, and I will deliver<br>
thee, and thou shalt glorify me.<br>
The sacrifice of God is a broken<br>
spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Ye know, beloved, ye know<br>
full well, the Holy Scriptures;<br>
and have thoroughly searched into<br>
the oracles of God: call them<br>
therefore to your remembrance.</p>
<br>
<p>11  For when Moses went up into<br>
the mount, and tarried there forty<br>
days and forty nights in fasting<br>
and humiliation; God said unto<br>
him, Arise, Moses, and get thee<br>
down quickly from hence, for thy<br>
people whom thou broughtest out<br>
of the land of Egypt, have<br>
committed wickedness: they have<br>
soon transgressed the way that<br>
I commanded them, and have made<br>
to themselves graven images.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And the Lord said unto him,<br>
I have spoken unto thee several<br>
times, saying, I have seen this<br>
people, and behold it is a stiff-<br>
necked people: let me therefore<br>
destroy them, and put out their<br>
name from under heaven. And I<br>
will make unto thee a great and a<br>
wonderful nation, that shall be<br>
much larger than this.</p>
<br>
<p>13  But Moses said, Not so,<br>
Lord: Forgive now this people<br>
their sin; or if thou wilt not,<br>
blot me also out of the book of<br>
the living. O admirable charity!<br>
O insuperable perfection! The servant<br>
speaks freely to his Lord: He beseeches<br>
him either to forgive the people,<br>
or to destroy him together with them.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Who is there among you<br>
that is generous? Who that is<br>
compassionate? Who that has<br>
any charity?   Let him say, if this<br>
sedition, this contention, and these<br>
schisms, be upon my account,<br>
I am ready to depart; to go away<br>
whithersoever you please; and do<br>
whatsoever ye shall command me:<br>
Only let the flock of Christ be in<br>
peace, with the elders that are set<br>
over it.</p>
<br>
<p>15  He that shall do this, shall<br>
get to himself a very great honour<br>
in the Lord; and there is no place<br>
but what will be ready to receive<br>
him: For the earth is the Lord's,<br>
and the fulness thereof.</p>
<br>
<p>16  These things, they who have<br>
their conversation towards God<br>
not to be repented of, both have<br>
done, and will always be ready to<br>
do.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Nay and even the Gentiles<br>
themselves have given us examples<br>
of this kind.</p>
<br>
<p>18  For we read, How many<br>
kings and princes, in times of<br>
pestilence, being warned by their<br>
oracles, have given up themselves<br>
unto death; that by their own<br>
blood, they might deliver their<br>
country from destruction.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Others have forsaken their<br>
cities, so that they might put an<br>
end to the seditions of them.</p>
<br>
<p>20  We know how many among<br>
ourselves, have given up<br>
themselves unto bonds, that<br>
thereby they might free others<br>
from them.</p>
<br>
<p>21  Others have sold themselves<br>
into bondage, that they might feed<br>
their brethren with the price of<br>
themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>22  And even many women,<br>
being strengthened by the grace<br>
of God, have done many glorious<br>
and manly things on such occasions.</p>
<br>
<p>23  The blessed Judith, when<br>
her city was besieged, desired the<br>
elders, that they would suffer her<br>
to go into the camp of their enemies;<br>
and she went out exposing herself<br>
to danger, for the love she bare<br>
to her country and her people<br>
that were besieged: and the<br>
Lord delivered Holofernes into<br>
the hands of a woman.</p>
<br>
<p>24  Nor did Esther, being perfect<br>
in faith, expose herself to any<br>
less hazard, for the delivery of the<br>
twelve tribes of Israel, in danger<br>
of being destroyed. For by fasting<br>
and humbling herself, she entreated<br>
the Great Maker of all things, the<br>
God of spirits; so that beholding<br>
the humility of her soul, he<br>
delivered the people, for whose<br>
sake she was in peril.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XXIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     The benefit of mutual advice and correction.<br>
     He entreats them to follow that which is here given to them.</p>
<br>
<p>WHEREFORE let us also pray<br>
for such as are fallen into<br>
sin. That being endued with<br>
humility and moderation, they<br>
may submit not unto us, but to<br>
the wish of God.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For by this means they shall<br>
obtain a fruitful and perfect<br>
remembrance, with mercy, both in<br>
our prayers to God, and in our<br>
mention of them before his saints.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Let us receive correction, at<br>
which no man ought to repine.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Beloved, the reproof and the<br>
correction which we exercise<br>
towards one another, is good, and<br>
exceeding profitable: for it unites<br>
us the more closely to the will of<br>
God.</p>
<br>
<p>5  For, so says the Holy Scripture,<br>
The Lord corrected me, but he did<br>
not deliver me over unto death. For<br>
whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth,<br>
and scourgeth every son whom he<br>
receiveth.</p>
<br>
<p>6  The righteous, saith he, shall<br>
instruct me in mercy and reprove<br>
me; but let not oil of sinners<br>
make fat my head.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And again he saith, Happy<br>
is the man whom God correcteth;<br>
therefore despise not thou the<br>
chastening of the Almighty.</p>
<br>
<p>8  For he maketh gore and bindeth<br>
up; he woundeth and his hands<br>
make whole.</p>
<br>
<p>9  He shall deliver thee in six<br>
troubles; yea in seven there shall<br>
no evil touch thee. In famine he<br>
shall redeem thee from death; and<br>
in war from the power of the sword.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Thou shalt be hid from the<br>
scourge of the tongue; neither<br>
shalt thou be afraid of destruction<br>
when it cometh.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Thou shalt laugh at the<br>
wicked and sinners; neither shalt<br>
thou be afraid of the beasts of the<br>
earth. The wild beast shall be at<br>
peace with thee.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Then shalt thou know that<br>
thy house shall be in peace; and<br>
the habitation of thy tabernacle<br>
shall not err. Then shalt know<br>
also that thy seed shall be great<br>
and thy offspring as the grass of<br>
the earth.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Thou shalt come to thy<br>
grave as the ripe corn, that is<br>
taken in due time: like as a shock<br>
of corn cometh in, in its season.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Ye see, beloved, how there<br>
shall be a defence to those that are<br>
corrected of the Lord. For being<br>
a good instructor, he is willing to<br>
admonish us by his holy, diaipline.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Do ye therefore who laid the<br>
first foundation of this sedition,<br>
submit yourselves unto your<br>
priests; and be instructed unto<br>
repentance, bending the knees of<br>
your hearts.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Learn to be subject, laying<br>
aside all proud and arrogant<br>
boasting of your tongues.</p>
<br>
<p>17  For it is better for you to be<br>
found little, and approved, in the<br>
sheepfold of Christ, than to seem<br>
to yourselves better than others,<br>
and be cast out of his fold.</p>
<br>
<p>18  For thus speaks the<br>
excellent and all-virtuous wisdom,<br>
Behold I will pour out the word<br>
of my spirit upon you, I will make<br>
known my speech unto you.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Because I called and ye<br>
would not hear, I stretched out<br>
my hand and ye regarded not.</p>
<br>
<p>20  But ye have set at nought all<br>
my counsel, and would none of<br>
my reproof. I will also laugh at<br>
your calamity, and mock when<br>
your fear cometh.</p>
<br>
<p>21  When your fear cometh as<br>
desolation, and your destruction<br>
as a whirlwind, when distress and<br>
anguish cometh upon you.</p>
<br>
<p>22  Then shall ye call upon me<br>
but I will not hear you: the<br>
wicked shall seek me but they<br>
shall not find me. For that they<br>
hated knowledge, and did not seek<br>
the fear of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>23  They would not hearken<br>
unto my counsel: they despised<br>
all my reproof. Therefore shall<br>
they eat of the fruit of their own<br>
ways; and be filled with their<br>
own wickedness.</p>

CHAPTER XXIV</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Recommends them to God. Desires speedily to hear<br>
     that this Epistle has had a good effect upon them.<br>
     4 Conclusion.</p>
<br>
<p>NOW God, the inspector of all<br>
things, the Father of Spirits,<br>
and the Lord of all flesh, who<br>
hath chosen our Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
and us by him, to be his peculiar<br>
people;</p>
<br>
<p>2  Grant to every soul of man<br>
that calleth upon his glorious and<br>
holy name, faith, fear, peace,<br>
long-suffering, patience, temperance,<br>
holiness and sobriety, unto all<br>
well-pleasing in his sight;<br>
through our High-Priest and<br>
Protector Jesus Christ, by whom<br>
be glory and majesty, and power,<br>
and honour unto him now and for<br>
ever more, Amen.</p>
<br>
<p>3  The messengers whom we<br>
have sent unto you, Claudius,<br>
Ephebus, and Valerios Bito, with<br>
Fortunatus, send back to us again<br>
with all speed, in peace and with<br>
joy, that they may the sooner<br>
acquaint us with your peace and<br>
concord, so much prayed for and<br>
desired by us: and that we may<br>
rejoice in your good order.</p>
<br>
<p>4  The grace of our Lord Jesus<br>
Christ be with you, and with all<br>
that are any where called by God<br>
through him: To whom be honour<br>
and glory, and might and injesty,<br>
and eternal dominion, by Christ<br>
Jesus, from everlasting to<br>
everlasting, Amen.</p>

<br>
<p>        REFERENCES TO CLEMENT'S FIRST EPISTLE TO THE CORINTHIANS.</p>
<br>
<p>[Clement was a disciple of Peter, and afterwards Bishop of Rome. Clemens<br>
Alexandrinus calls him an apostle. Jerome says he was an apostolic man,<br>
and Rafinus that he was almost an apostle.  Eusebius calls this the<br>
wonderful  Epistle of St. Clement, and says that it was publicly read in<br>
the assemblies of the primitive church. It is included in one of the<br>
ancient collections of the Canon Scripture.  Its genuineness has been<br>
much questioned, particularly by  Photius, patriarch of Constantinople in<br>
the ninth century, who objects that  Clement speaks of worlds beyond the<br>
ocean: that he has not written worthily of the divinity of Christ; and<br>
that to prove the possibility of a future resurrection, he introduces the<br>
fabulous story of the phoenix's revival from its own ashes. To the latter<br>
objection, Archbishop Wake replies that the generality  of the ancient<br>
Fathers have made use of the same instance in proof of the same point;<br>
and asks, if St. Clement really believed that there was such a bird, and<br>
that it did revive out of the cinders of the body after burning, where<br>
was the, great harm either in giving credit to such a wonder, or,<br>
believing it, to make rich a use as he here does of it?--The present is<br>
the Archbishop's  translation from the ancient Greek copy of the Epistle,<br>
which is at the end of  the celebrated Alexandrine MS. of the Septuagint<br>
and New Testament, presented by Cyril, patriarch of Alexandria, to King<br>
Charles the First, now in the British Museum. The Archbishop, in<br>
prefacing his translation, esteems it a great blessing that this<br>
"Epistle" was at last so happily found out, for the increase and<br>
confirmation both of our faith and our charity.]</p>

<h2>                         THE SECOND EPISTLE OF<br>
                       CLEMENT TO THE CORINTHIANS</h2></center>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER I.</p>
<br>
<p>     That we ought to value our salvation;<br>
     and to show that we do by a sincere obedience.</p>
<br>
<p>BRETHREN, we ought so to<br>
think of Jesus Christ as of<br>
God: as of the judge of the living,<br>
and the dead; nor should we think<br>
any less of our salvation.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For if we think meanly of<br>
him, we shall hope only to receive<br>
some small things from him.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And if we do so, we shall<br>
sin; not considering from whence<br>
we have been called, and by whom,<br>
and to what place; and how much<br>
Jesus Christ vouchsafed to suffer<br>
for our sakes.</p>
<br>
<p>4  What recompense then shall<br>
we render unto him? Or what<br>
fruit that may be worthy of what<br>
he has given to us?</p>
<br>
<p>5  For indeed how great are<br>
those advantages which we owe to<br>
him in relation to our holiness?<br>
He has illuminated us; as a father,<br>
he has called us his children;<br>
he has saved us who were lost and<br>
undone.</p>
<br>
<p>6  What praise shall we give to<br>
him? Or what reward that may<br>
be answerable to those things<br>
which we have received.</p>
<br>
<p>7  We were defective in our<br>
understandings; worshipping stones,<br>
and wood; gold, and silver, and<br>
brass, the work of men's hands;<br>
and our whole life was nothing<br>
else but death.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Wherefore being encompassed<br>
with darkness, and having such a<br>
mist before our eyes, we have<br>
looked up, and through his will<br>
have laid aside the cloud wherewith<br>
we were surrounded.</p>
<br>
<p>9  For he had compassion upon<br>
us, and being moved in his bowels<br>
towards us, he saved us; having<br>
beheld in us much error, and<br>
destruction; and seeing that we had<br>
no hope of salvation, but only<br>
through him.</p>
<br>
<p>10  For he called us, who were<br>
not; and was pleased from nothing<br>
to give us being.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 That God had before prophesied by Isaiah,<br>
     that the Gentiles should be saved;<br>
     8 And that this ought to engage, such especially<br>
     to live well; without which they will still miscarry.</p>
<br>
<p>REJOICE, thou barren, that<br>
bearest not, break forth and<br>
cry thou that travailest not; for<br>
she that is desolate hath many<br>
more children than she that hath<br>
a husband.</p>
<br>
<p>2  In that saying, Rejoice thou<br>
barren that bearest not, he spake<br>
of us: for our church was barren<br>
before children were given unto it.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And again; when he said,<br>
Cry thou that travailest not:<br>
he implied thus much: That after<br>
the manner of a woman in travail,<br>
we should not cease to put up our<br>
prayers unto God abundantly.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And for what follows, because<br>
she that is desolate hath more<br>
children than she that hath a husband;<br>
it was therefore added, because<br>
our people which seemed to have<br>
been forsaken by God, now believing<br>
in him, are become more than they<br>
who seemed to have God.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And another Scripture saith,<br>
a I came not to call the righteous<br>
but sinners (to repentance). The<br>
meaning of which is this; that<br>
those who were lost must be saved:</p>
<br>
<p>6  For that is, indeed, truly great<br>
and wonderful, not to confirm those<br>
things that are yet standing, but<br>
those which are falling,</p>
<br>
<p>7  Even so did it seem good to<br>
Christ to save what was lost; and<br>
when he came into the world, he<br>
saved many, and called us who<br>
were already lost.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Seeing then he has showed<br>
so great mercy towards us; and<br>
chiefly for that we who are alive,<br>
do now no longer sacrifice to dead<br>
Gods, nor pay any worship to<br>
them, but have by him been<br>
brought to the knowledge of<br>
the Father of truth.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Whereby shall we show that<br>
we do indeed know him, and by<br>
not denying him by whom we<br>
have come to the knowledge of<br>
him.</p>
<br>
<p>10  For even he himself saith,<br>
Whosoever shall confess me before<br>
men, him will I confess before<br>
my Father. This therefore is our<br>
reward, if we shall confess him by<br>
whom we have been saved.</p>
<br>
<p>11  But, wherein must we confess<br>
him?--Namely, in doing those<br>
things which he saith, and not<br>
disobeying his commandments<br>
by worshipping him not with<br>
our lips only, but with all our<br>
heart, and with all our mind. For<br>
he saith in Isaiah; This people<br>
honoureth me with their lips, but<br>
their heart is far from me.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Let us then not only call<br>
him Lord; for that will not save<br>
us. For he saith: Not everyone<br>
that saith unto me Lord, Lord,<br>
shall be saved, but he that doth<br>
righteousness.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Wherefore, brethren,<br>
let us confess him by our works;<br>
by loving one another; in not<br>
committing adultery, not speaking<br>
evil against each other, not envying<br>
one another; but by being temperate,<br>
merciful, good.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Let us also have a mutual<br>
sense of one another's sufferings;<br>
and not be covetous of money; but<br>
let us, by our good works, confess<br>
God, and not by those that are<br>
otherwise.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Also let us not fear men: but<br>
rather God. Wherefore, if we<br>
should do such wicked things, the<br>
Lord hath said; Though ye should<br>
be joined unto me, even in my very<br>
bosom, and not keep my commandments,<br>
I would cast you off, and say unto<br>
you; Depart from me; I know not<br>
whence you are, ye workers of iniquity.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 That, whilst we secure the other world,<br>
     we need not fear what can befall its in this.<br>
     5 That, if we follow the interests of this present world,<br>
     we cannot escape the punishment of the other.<br>
     10 Which ought to bring us to repentance and holiness,<br>
     14 and that presently: because in this world<br>
     is the only time for repentance.</p>
<br>
<p>THEREFORE brethren, leaving<br>
willingly for conscience sake<br>
our sojourning in this world,<br>
let us do the will of him who has<br>
called us, and not fear to depart<br>
out of this world.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For the Lord saith, Ye shall<br>
be as sheep in the midst of wolves.<br>
Peter answered and said, What if<br>
the wolves shall tear in pieces the<br>
sheep? Jesus said unto Peter,<br>
Let not the sheep fear the wolves<br>
after death: And ye also fear not<br>
those that kill you, and after that<br>
have no more than they can do unto<br>
you; but fear him who after you<br>
are dead, has power to cast both<br>
soul and body into hell-fire.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For consider, brethren, that<br>
the sojourning of this flesh in the<br>
present world, is but little, and of<br>
a short continuance, but the promise<br>
of Christ is great and wonderful,<br>
even the rest of the kingdom<br>
that is to come, and of eternal life.</p>
<br>
<p>4  What then must we do that<br>
we may attain unto it?--We must<br>
order our conversation, holy and<br>
righteously, and look upon all the<br>
things of this world as none of<br>
ours, and not desire them. For,<br>
if we desire to possess them we<br>
fall from the way of righteousness.</p>
<br>
<p>5  For thus saith the Lord, No<br>
servant can serve two masters. If<br>
therefore we shall desire to serve<br>
God and Mammon, it will be without<br>
profit to us. For what will it profit,<br>
if one gain the vole world, and lose<br>
his own soul?</p>
<br>
<p>6  Now this world and that<br>
to come are two enemies. This<br>
speaketh of adultery and corruption,<br>
of covetousness and deceit; but that<br>
renounces these things.</p>
<br>
<p>7  We cannot, therefore, be the<br>
friends of both; but we must<br>
resolve by forsaking the one,<br>
to enjoy the other. And we think<br>
it is better to hate the present<br>
things, as little, short-lived,<br>
and corruptible; and to love<br>
those which are to come, which<br>
are truly good and incorruptible.</p>
<br>
<p>8  For, if we do the will of<br>
Christ, we shall find rest:<br>
but if not, nothing shall deliver<br>
us from eternal punishment if we<br>
shall disobey his commands. For<br>
even thus saith the Scripture in<br>
the prophet Ezekiel, If Noah, Job,<br>
and Daniel should rise up, they<br>
shall not deliver their children in<br>
captivity.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Wherefore, if such righteous<br>
men are not able by their<br>
righteousness to deliver their<br>
children; how can we hope to<br>
enter into the kingdom of God,<br>
except we keep our baptism holy<br>
and undefiled? Or who shall be<br>
our advocate, unless we shall<br>
be found to have done what is holy<br>
and just?</p>
<br>
<p>10  Let us, therefore, my brethren,<br>
contend with all earnestness,<br>
knowing that our combat is at<br>
hand; and that many go long<br>
voyages to encounter for a<br>
corruptible reward.</p>
<br>
<p>11 And yet all are not crowned,<br>
but they only that labour much,<br>
and strive gloriously. Let us,<br>
therefore, so contend, that we may<br>
all be crowned. Let us run in the<br>
straight road, the race that is<br>
incorruptible: and let us in great<br>
numbers pass unto it, and strive<br>
that we may receive the crown.<br>
But if we cannot all be crowned,<br>
let us come as near to it as we are<br>
able.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Moreover, we must consider,<br>
that he who contends in a corruptible<br>
combat; if he be found doing anything<br>
that is not fair, is taken away and<br>
scourged, and cast out of the lists.<br>
What think ye then that he shall<br>
suffer, who does anything that is<br>
not fitting in the combat of<br>
immortality?</p>
<br>
<p>13  Thus speaks the prophet<br>
concerning those who keep not<br>
their seal; Their worm shall not<br>
die, and their, fire shall not be<br>
quenched; and they shall be for a<br>
spectacle unto all flesh.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Let us therefore repent, whilst<br>
we are yet upon the earth: for we<br>
are as clay in the hand of the<br>
artificer. For the potter if he<br>
make a vessel, and it be turned<br>
amiss in his hands, or broken,<br>
again forms it anew; but if he has<br>
gone so far as to throw it into the<br>
furnace of fire, he can no more<br>
bring any remedy to it.</p>
<br>
<p>15  So we, whilst we are in this<br>
world should repent with our whole<br>
heart for whatsoever evil we have<br>
done in the flesh; while we have<br>
yet the time of repentance, that<br>
we may be saved by the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>16  For after we shall have<br>
departed out of this world, we<br>
shall no longer be able either<br>
to confess our sins or repent<br>
in the other.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Wherefore, brethren, let us,<br>
doing the will of the Father,<br>
and keeping our flesh pure,<br>
and observing the commandments<br>
of the Lord, lay hold on eternal<br>
life: for the Lord saith in the<br>
Gospel, If ye have not kept that<br>
which was little, who will give<br>
you that which is great?--<br>
For I say unto you, he that is<br>
faithful in that which is<br>
least, is faithful also in much.</p>
<br>
<p>18  This, therefore, is what he<br>
saith; keep your bodies pure, and<br>
your seal without spot, that ye<br>
may receive eternal life.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<br>
<p>     We shall rise, and be judged, in our bodies;<br>
     therefore we must live well in them;<br>
     6 that we ought, for our own interest,<br>
     to live well; though few seem to<br>
     mind what, really is for their advantage;<br>
     10 and we should not deceive ourselves:<br>
     seeing God will certainly judge us,<br>
     and render to all of us according to our works.</p>
<br>
<p>AND let not any one among you<br>
say, that this very flesh is<br>
not judged, neither raised up.<br>
Consider, in what were you saved<br>
in what did you look up, if not<br>
whilst you were in the flesh?</p>
<br>
<p>2  We must, therefore, keep our<br>
flesh as the temple of God. For<br>
in like manner as ye were called<br>
in the flesh, ye shall also come<br>
to judgment in the flesh. Our one<br>
Lord Jesus Christ, who has saved<br>
us, being first a spirit, was made<br>
flesh, and so called us; even so we<br>
also shall in this flesh receive the<br>
reward.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Let us, therefore, love one<br>
another, that we may attain unto<br>
the kingdom of God. Whilst we<br>
have time to be healed, let us<br>
deliver up ourselves to God our<br>
physician, giving our reward unto<br>
him.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And what reward shall we<br>
give?--Repentance out of a pure<br>
heart. For he knows all things<br>
beforehand, and searches out our<br>
very hearts.</p>
<br>
<p>5 Let us, therefore, give praise<br>
unto him: not only with our<br>
mouths, but with all our souls;<br>
that he may receive us as children.<br>
For so the Lord hath said; They<br>
are my brethren, who do the will<br>
of my father.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Wherefore, my brethren,<br>
let us do the will of the Father,<br>
who hath called us, that we may<br>
live. Let us pursue virtue, and<br>
forsake wickedness, which leadeth<br>
us into sins; and let us flee all<br>
ungodliness, that evils overtake<br>
us not.</p>
<br>
<p>7  For, if we shall do our diligence<br>
to live well, peace shall follow us.<br>
And yet how hard is it to find a man<br>
that does this? For almost all are<br>
led by human fears, choosing rather<br>
the present enjoyments, than the<br>
future promise.</p>
<br>
<p>8  For they know not how great<br>
a torment the present enjoyments<br>
bring with them; nor what delights<br>
the future promise.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And if they themselves only<br>
did this, it might the more easily<br>
be endured; but now they go on<br>
to infect innocent souls with their<br>
evil doctrines; not knowing that<br>
both themselves, and those that<br>
hear them, shall receive a double<br>
condemnation.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Let us, therefore, serve<br>
God with a pure heart, and we<br>
shall be righteous: but if we shall<br>
not serve him, because we do not<br>
believe the promise of God, we<br>
shall be miserable.</p>
<br>
<p>11  For thus saith the prophet;<br>
Miserable are the double-minded,<br>
who doubt in their heart, and say,<br>
these things we have heard, even.<br>
in the time of our fathers, but we<br>
have seen none of them, though<br>
we have expected them from day<br>
to day.</p>
<br>
<p>12 O ye fools! compare yourselves<br>
to a tree; take the vine for an<br>
example. First it sheds its leaves,<br>
then it buds, then come the sour<br>
grapes, then the ripe fruit;<br>
even so my people has borne its<br>
disorders and afflictions, but shall<br>
hereafter receive good things.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Wherefore my brethren, let<br>
us not doubt in our minds, but let<br>
us expect with hope, that we may<br>
receive our reward; for he is<br>
faithful, who has promised that<br>
he will render to everyone a<br>
reward according to his works.</p>
<br>
<p>14  If, therefore, we shall do<br>
what is just in the sight of God<br>
we shall enter into his kingdom,<br>
and shall receive the promises;<br>
Which neither eye has seen, nor<br>
ear heard, nor have entered into<br>
the heart of man.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Wherefore let us every<br>
hour expect the kingdom of God<br>
in love and righteousness; because<br>
we know not the day of God's<br>
appearing.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER V.</p>
<br>
<p>A FRAGMENT.</p>
<br>
<p>     Man's immortal nature a type of the Lord's kingdom.</p>
<br>
<p>1    *    *    *    For the Lord<br>
himself, being asked by a certain<br>
person, When his kingdom should<br>
come? answered, When two shall<br>
be one, and that which is without<br>
as that which is within; and the<br>
male with the female, neither male<br>
nor female.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Now two are one, when we<br>
speak the truth to each other, and<br>
there is (without hypocrisy) one<br>
seal in two bodies:</p>
<br>
<p>3  And that which is without as<br>
that which, is within;--He means<br>
this; he calls the soul that which<br>
is within, and the body that which<br>
is without. As therefore thy body<br>
appears, so let thy soul be seen by<br>
its good works.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And the male with, the female,<br>
neither Male nor female;--He<br>
means this; he calls our anger<br>
the male, our concupiscence the<br>
female.</p>
<br>
<p>5  When therefore a man is come<br>
to such a pass that he is subject<br>
neither to the one nor the other of<br>
these (both of which, through the<br>
prevalence of custom, and an evil<br>
education, cloud and darken the<br>
reason,)</p>
<br>
<p>6  But rather, having dispelled<br>
the mist arising from them, and<br>
being full of shame, shall by<br>
repentance have united both his<br>
soul and spirit in the obedience<br>
of reason; then, as Paul says, there is<br>
in us neither male nor female.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>             REFERENCE TO THE SECOND EPISTLE THE CORINTHIANS.</p>
<br>
<p>[Archbishop Wake is the translator of this Second Epistle, which he says<br>
was not of so great reputation among the primitive Fathers as the first.<br>
He defends it notwithstanding; and in answer to those who objected to<br>
Clement's First Epistle, that it did not duly honour the Trinity; the<br>
Archbishop refers to  this as containing proof of the writer's fulness of<br>
belief on that point.]</p>

                     THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF BARNABAS.</h2></center>
<br><br><br>
<p>
CHAPTER I.</p>
<br>
<p>     Preface to the Epistle.</p>
<br>
<p>ALL happiness to you my sons<br>
and daughters, in the name<br>
of our Lord Jesus Christ, who<br>
loved us, in peace.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Having perceived abundance<br>
of knowledge of the great and<br>
excellent laws of God to be in you,<br>
I exceedingly rejoice in your blessed<br>
and admirable souls, because ye<br>
have so worthily received the<br>
grace which was grafted in you.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For which cause I am full of<br>
joy, hoping the rather to be saved;<br>
inasmuch as I truly see a spirit<br>
infused into you, from the pure<br>
fountain of God:</p>
<br>
<p>4  Having this persuasion, and<br>
being fully convinced thereof,<br>
because that since I have begun to<br>
speak unto you, I have had a more<br>
than ordinary good success in the<br>
way of the law of the Lord, which<br>
is in Christ,</p>
<br>
<p>5  For which cause brethren, I<br>
also think verily that I love you<br>
above my own soul; because that<br>
therein dwelleth the greatness of<br>
faith and charity, as also the hope<br>
of that life which is to come.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Wherefore considering this,<br>
that if I shall take care to<br>
communicate to you a part of what<br>
I have received, it shall turn to<br>
my reward, that I have served such<br>
good souls. I gave diligence to<br>
write in a few words unto you;<br>
that together with your faith, your<br>
knowledge also may be perfect.</p>
<br>
<p>7  There are therefore three<br>
things ordained by the Lord; the<br>
hope of life, the beginning, and<br>
the completion of it.</p>
<br>
<p>8  For the Lord hath both<br>
declared unto us, by the prophets,<br>
those things that are past; and<br>
opened to us the beginnings of<br>
those that are to come.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Wherefore, it will behove us,<br>
as he has spoken, to come more<br>
holily, and nearer to his altar.</p>
<br>
<p>10  I therefore, not as a teacher<br>
but as one of you, will endeavour<br>
to lay before you a few things by<br>
which you may, on many accounts,<br>
become the more joyful.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<br>
<p>     That Clod has abolished the legal sacrifices,<br>
     to introduce the spiritual righteousness of the Gospel.</p>
<br>
<p>SEEING then the days are<br>
exceedingly evil, and the<br>
adversary has got the power of this<br>
present world we ought to give the<br>
more diligence to inquire into the<br>
righteous judgments of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Now the assistants of our<br>
faith are fear and patience; our<br>
fellow-combatants, long suffering<br>
and continence.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Whilst these remain pure<br>
in what relates unto the Lord,<br>
wisdom, and understanding, and<br>
science, and knowledge, rejoice<br>
together with them.</p>
<br>
<p>4  For God has manifested to us<br>
by all the prophets, that he has no<br>
occasion for our sacrifices, or<br>
burnt-offerings, or oblations:<br>
saying thus;  To what purpose is<br>
the multitude of your sacrifices<br>
unto me, saith the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>5  I am full of the burnt-offerings<br>
of rams, and the fat of fed beasts;<br>
and I delight not in the blood of<br>
bullocks, or of he-goats.</p>
<br>
<p>6  When ye come to appear<br>
before me, who hath required<br>
this at your hands? Ye shall no<br>
more tread my courts.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Bring no more vain oblations,<br>
incense is an abomination unto me<br>
your new moons and sabbaths,<br>
and the calling of assemblies<br>
I cannot bear with, it is iniquity,<br>
even the solemn meeting; your<br>
new moons and your appointed<br>
feasts my soul hateth.</p>
<br>
<p>8  These things therefore hath<br>
God abolished, that the new law<br>
of our Lord Jesus Christ, which<br>
is without the yoke of any such<br>
necessity, might have the spiritual<br>
offering of, men themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>9  For so the Lord saith again<br>
to those heretofore; Did I at all<br>
command your fathers when they<br>
came out of the land of Egypt<br>
concerning burnt-offerings of<br>
sacrifices?</p>
<br>
<p>10  But this I commanded them,<br>
saying, Let none of you imagine<br>
evil in your hearts against his<br>
neighbour, and love no false oath.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Forasmuch then as we are<br>
not without understanding, we<br>
ought to apprehend the design of<br>
our merciful Father. For he<br>
speaks to us, being willing that<br>
we who have been in the same<br>
error about the sacrifices, should<br>
seek and find how to approach<br>
unto him.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And therefore he thus<br>
bespeaks us, The sacrifice of God<br>
(is a broken spirit,) a broken and<br>
contrite heart--God will not despise.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Wherefore brethren, we ought<br>
the more diligently to inquire<br>
after those things that belong<br>
to our salvation, that the<br>
adversary may not have any<br>
entrance into us, and deprive<br>
us of our spiritual life.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Wherefore he again speaketh<br>
to them, concerning these things;<br>
Ye shall not fast as ye do this day,<br>
to make your voice to be heard on high.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Is it such a fast that I have<br>
chosen? A day for a man to afflict<br>
his soul? Is it to bow down his<br>
head like a bulrush, and to spread<br>
sackcloth and ashes under him?<br>
Wilt thou call this a fast, and an<br>
acceptable day to the Lord?</p>
<br>
<p>16  But to us he saith on this<br>
wise: Is not this the fast that I<br>
have chosen, to loose the bands of<br>
wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens,<br>
and to let the oppressed go free:<br>
and that ye break every yoke?</p>
<br>
<p>17  Is it not to deal thy bread<br>
to the hungry, and that thou bring<br>
the poor that are cast out to thy<br>
house? When thou seest the naked<br>
that thou cover him, and that thou<br>
hide not thyself from thy own<br>
flesh.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Then shall thy light break<br>
forth as the morning, and thy<br>
health shall spring forth speedily;<br>
and thy righteousness shall go<br>
before thee; the glory of the Lord<br>
shall be thy reward.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Then shalt thou call and<br>
the Lord shall answer; thou shalt<br>
cry and he shall say, Here I am;<br>
if thou put away from the midst of<br>
thee the yoke; the putting forth<br>
of the finger, and speaking vanity;<br>
and if thou draw out thy soul to<br>
the hungry; and satisfy the<br>
afflicted soul.</p>
<br>
<p>20  In this, therefore, brethren,<br>
God has manifested his foreknowledge<br>
and love for us; because the<br>
people which he has purchased to<br>
his beloved Son were to believe<br>
in sincerity; and therefore he has<br>
shown these things to all of us,<br>
that we should not run as<br>
proselytes to the Jewish Law.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<br>
<p>     The prophecies of Daniel concerning the ten kings,<br>
     and the coming of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>WHEREFORE it is necessary<br>
that searching diligently into<br>
those things which are soon to<br>
come to pass, we should write to<br>
you what may serve to keep you<br>
whole.</p>
<br>
<p>2  To which end, let us flee from<br>
every evil work and hate the errors<br>
of the present time, that we may<br>
be happy in that which is to come.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Let us not give ourselves the<br>
liberty of disputing with the wicked<br>
and sinners; lest we should chance<br>
in time to become like unto them.</p>
<br>
<p>4  For the consummation of sin<br>
is come, as it is written, as the<br>
prophet Daniel says. And for this<br>
end the Lord hath shortened the<br>
times and the days, that his<br>
beloved might hasten his corning<br>
to his inheritance.</p>
<br>
<p>5  For so the prophet speaks;<br>
There shall ten kings reign in<br>
the heart, and there shall rise last<br>
of all another little one, and he<br>
shall humble three kings.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And again Daniel speaks in<br>
like manner concerning the kingdoms;<br>
and I saw the fourth beast dreadful<br>
and terrible, and strong exceedingly;<br>
and it had ten horns. I considered<br>
the horns, and behold there came up<br>
among them another little horn,<br>
before which were three of the first<br>
horns plucked up by the roots.</p>
<br>
<p>7  We ought therefore to understand<br>
this also: And I beseech you, as one<br>
of your own brethren, loving you all<br>
beyond my own life, that you look<br>
well to yourselves, and be not like<br>
to those who add sin to sin, and say;<br>
That their covenant is ours also.<br>
Nay, but it is ours only: for they<br>
have forever lost that which Moses<br>
received.</p>
<br>
<p>8  For thus saith the Scripture<br>
And Moses continued fasting forty<br>
days and forty nights in the Mount;<br>
and he received the covenant from<br>
the Lord, even the two tables of<br>
stone, written by the hand of God.</p>
<br>
<p>9  But having turned themselves<br>
to idols they lost it; as the Lord<br>
also said to Moses; Moses, go<br>
down quickly, for thy people which<br>
thou hast brought forth out of<br>
Egypt, have corrupted themselves,<br>
and turned aside from the way<br>
which I commanded them. And<br>
Moses cast the two tables out of<br>
his hands; and their covenant was<br>
broken; that the love of Jesus<br>
might be sealed in your hearts,<br>
unto the hope of his faith.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Wherefore let us give heed<br>
unto the last times. For all the<br>
time past of our life and our faith,<br>
will profit us nothing; unless we<br>
continue to hate what is evil, and<br>
to withstand the future temptations.<br>
So the Son of God tells us; Let us<br>
resist all iniquity and hate it.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Wherefore consider the works<br>
of the evil way. Do not withdraw<br>
yourselves from others as if you<br>
were already justified; but coming<br>
altogether into one place, inquire<br>
what is agreeable to and profitable<br>
for the beloved of God.  For the<br>
Scripture saith; Woe unto them<br>
that are wise in their own eyes;<br>
and prudent in their sight.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Let us become spiritually a<br>
perfect temple to God. As much<br>
as in us lies let us meditate upon<br>
the fear of God; and strive to the<br>
utmost of our power to keep his<br>
commandments; that we may rejoice<br>
in his righteous judgments.</p>
<br>
<p>13  For God will judge the world<br>
without respect of persons and<br>
everyone shall receive according<br>
to his works.</p>
<br>
<p>14  If a man shall be good, his<br>
righteousness shall go before him<br>
if wicked, the reward of his<br>
wickedness shall follow him.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Take heed therefore lest<br>
sitting still now, that when we are<br>
called, we fall asleep in our sins;<br>
and the wicked one getting the<br>
dominion over us, stir us up, and<br>
shut us out of the kingdom of the<br>
Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Consider this also: although<br>
you have seen so great signs and<br>
wonders done among the people<br>
of the Jews, yet this notwithstanding<br>
the Lord hath forsaken them.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Beware, therefore, lest it<br>
happen to us; as it is written<br>
There may be many called, but<br>
few chosen.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<br>
<p>     That Christ was to suffer is proved<br>
     from the prophecies concerning him.</p>
<br>
<p>For this cause did our Lord<br>
vouchsafe to give up his body<br>
to destruction, that through the<br>
forgiveness of our sins we might<br>
be sanctified; that is, by the<br>
sprinkling of his blood.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Now for what concerns the<br>
things that are written about him,<br>
some belong to the people of the<br>
Jews, and some to us.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For thus saith the Scripture;<br>
He was wounded for our transgressions,<br>
he was bruised for our iniquities,<br>
and by his blood we are healed.<br>
He was led as a lamb to the<br>
slaughter, and as a sheep before<br>
his shearers is dumb, so he<br>
opened not his mouth.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Wherefore we ought the more<br>
to give thanks unto God, for that<br>
he hath both declared unto us<br>
what is passed, and not suffered<br>
us to be without understanding of<br>
those things that are to come.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But to them he saith; The<br>
nets are not unjustly spread for<br>
the birds.</p>
<br>
<p>6  This he spake, because a man<br>
will justly perish, if having the<br>
knowledge of the way of truth, he<br>
shall nevertheless not refrain<br>
himself from the way of darkness.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And for this cause the Lord<br>
was content to suffer for our souls,<br>
although he be the Lord of the<br>
whole earth; to whom God said<br>
before the beginning of the world,<br>
Let us make man after our own<br>
image and likeness.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Now how he suffered for us,<br>
seeing it was by men that he<br>
underwent it, I will shew you.</p>
<br>
<p>9  The prophets having received<br>
from him the gifts of prophecy,<br>
spake before concerning him:</p>
<br>
<p>10  But he, that he might<br>
abolish death, and make known the<br>
resurrection from the dead, was<br>
content, as it was necessary, to<br>
appear in the flesh, that he might<br>
make good the promise before given<br>
to our fathers, and preparing<br>
himself a new people, might<br>
demonstrate to them whilst he was<br>
upon earth, that after the<br>
resurrection he would judge<br>
the world.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And finally, teaching the<br>
people of Israel, and doing many<br>
wonders and signs among them,<br>
he preached to them, and shewed<br>
the exceeding great love which<br>
he bare towards them.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And when he chose his apostles,<br>
which were afterwards to publish<br>
his Gospel, he took men who had<br>
been very great sinners; that<br>
thereby he might plainly shew<br>
That he came not to call the<br>
righteous but sinners to<br>
repentance.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Then he clearly manifested<br>
himself to be the Son of God.<br>
For had he not come in the flesh,<br>
how should men have been able to<br>
look upon him, that they might be<br>
saved?</p>
<br>
<p>14  Seeing that if they beheld<br>
only the sun, which was the work<br>
of his hands, and shall hereafter<br>
cease to be, they are not able to<br>
endure stedfastly to look against<br>
the rays of it;</p>
<br>
<p>15  Wherefore the Son of God<br>
came in the flesh for this cause,<br>
that he might fill up the measure<br>
of their iniquity, who have<br>
persecuted his prophets unto<br>
death. And for the same reason<br>
also he suffered.</p>
<br>
<p>16  For God hath said of the<br>
stripes of his flesh, that they were<br>
from them. And, I will smite the<br>
shepherd, and the sheep of the<br>
flock shall be scattered.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Thus he would suffer, because<br>
it behoved him to suffer upon the<br>
cross.</p>
<br>
<p>18  For thus one saith,<br>
prophesying concerning him;<br>
Spare my soul from the sword.<br>
And again, My flesh trembleth<br>
for fear.</p>
<br>
<p>19  And again, the congregation<br>
of wicked doers rose up against<br>
me, (They have pierced my<br>
hands and my feet).</p>
<br>
<p>20  And again he saith, I gave<br>
my back to the smiters, and my<br>
face I set as a hard rock.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER V.</p>
<br>
<p>The subject continued.</p>
<br>
<p>And when he had fulfilled the<br>
commandment of God, What<br>
says he? Who will contend with<br>
me? Let him stand against me<br>
or who is he that will implead<br>
me? Let him draw near to the<br>
servant of the Lord. Woe be to<br>
you! Because ye shall all wax<br>
old as a garment, the moth<br>
shall eat you up.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And again adds the prophet,<br>
He is put for a stone of<br>
stumbling. Behold I lay in Zion<br>
for a foundation, a precious<br>
stone a choice corner-stone;<br>
an honourable stone. And what<br>
follows? And he that hopeth<br>
in him shall live for ever.</p>
<br>
<p>3  What then? Is our hope built<br>
upon a stone? God forbid. But<br>
because the Lord hath hardened<br>
his flesh against sufferings, he<br>
saith, I have put me as a firm<br>
rock.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And again the prophet adds;<br>
The stone which the builders<br>
refused has become the head of<br>
the corner. And again he saith<br>
This is the great and wonderful<br>
day which the Lord hath made.<br>
a I write these things the more<br>
plainly to you that ye may<br>
understand: I For indeed I<br>
could be content even to die<br>
for your sakes.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But what saith the prophet<br>
again; The counsel of the wicked<br>
encompassed me about. They<br>
came about me, as bees about the<br>
honey-comb: and, Upon my vesture<br>
they cast lots.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Forasmuch then as our Saviour<br>
was to appear in the flesh and<br>
suffer, his passion was hereby<br>
foretold.</p>
<br>
<p>7  For thus saith the prophet<br>
against Israel: "Woe be to their<br>
soul because they have taken<br>
wicked counsel against themselves,<br>
saying; let us lay snares for the<br>
righteous, because he is<br>
unprofitable to us."</p>
<br>
<p>8  Moses also in like manner<br>
speaketh to them; Behold thus<br>
saith the Lord God; Enter ye<br>
into the good land of which the<br>
Lord path sworn to Abraham, and<br>
Isaac, and Jacob, that he would<br>
give it you, and possess it; a land<br>
flowing with milk and honey.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Now what the spiritual meaning<br>
of this is, learn; It is as if it<br>
had been said, Put your trust in<br>
Jesus, who shall be manifested to<br>
you in the flesh. For man is the<br>
earth which suffers: forasmuch<br>
as out of the substance of the<br>
earth Adam was formed.</p>
<br>
<p>10  What therefore does he mean<br>
when he says, Into a good land<br>
flowing with milk and honey?<br>
Blessed be our Lord, who has<br>
given us wisdom, and a heart to<br>
understand his secrets. For so<br>
says the prophet, "Who shall<br>
understand the hard sayings of the<br>
Lord? But he that is wise, and<br>
intelligent, and that loves his<br>
Lord."</p>
<br>
<p>11  Seeing therefore he has<br>
renewed us by the remission of our<br>
sins, he has put us into another<br>
frame, that we should have souls<br>
like those of children, forming<br>
us again himself by the spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>12  For thus the Scripture saith<br>
concerning us, where it introduceth<br>
the Father speaking to the Son;<br>
Let us make man after our likeness<br>
and similitude; and let them have<br>
dominion over the beasts of the<br>
earth, and over the fowls of the<br>
air, and the fish of the sea.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And when the Lord saw the<br>
man which he had formed, that<br>
behold he was very good; he said,<br>
Increase and multiply, and<br>
replenish the earth. And this<br>
he spake to his son.</p>
<br>
<p>14  I will now show you, how he<br>
made us a new creature, in the<br>
latter days.</p>
<br>
<p>15 The Lord saith; Behold I<br>
will make the last as the first.<br>
Wherefore the prophet thus spake,<br>
Enter into the land flowing with<br>
milk and honey, and have dominion<br>
over it.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Wherefore ye see how we<br>
are again formed anew; as also<br>
he speaks by another prophet;<br>
Behold saith the Lord, I will take<br>
from them; that is, from those<br>
whom the spirit I of the Lord<br>
foresaw, their hearts of stone,<br>
and I will put into them hearts<br>
of flesh.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Because he was about to be<br>
made manifest in the flesh and to<br>
dwell in us.</p>
<br>
<p>18  For, my brethren, the<br>
habitation of our heart is a 'holy<br>
temple unto the Lord. For the prophet<br>
saith again, In what place shall I<br>
appear before the Lord my God,<br>
and be glorified?</p>
<br>
<p>19  He answers I will confess<br>
unto thee in the congregation in<br>
the midst of my brethren; and will<br>
sing unto thee in the church of<br>
the saints:</p>
<br>
<p>20  Wherefore we are they whom<br>
he has brought into that good land.</p>
<br>
<p>21  But what signifies the milk<br>
and honey?  Because as the child<br>
is nourished first with milk, and<br>
then with honey; so we being<br>
kept alive by the belief of his<br>
promises and his word, shall live<br>
and have dominion over the land.</p>
<br>
<p>22  For he foretold before, saying,<br>
increase and multiply, and have<br>
dominion over the beasts, fishes,<br>
and birds.</p>
<br>
<p>23  But who is there that is now<br>
able to have this dominion over<br>
the wild beasts, or fishes, or fowls<br>
of the air? For you know that to<br>
rule, is to have power; that a man<br>
should be set over what he rules.</p>
<br>
<p>24  But forasmuch as this we<br>
have not now, he tells us when we<br>
shall have it; namely, when we<br>
shall become perfect, that we may<br>
be made the inheritors of the<br>
covenant of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
<br>
<p>     The sacrifice of Jesus, and of a goat,<br>
     an evident type of Christ crucified.</p>
<br>
<p>UNDERSTAND then my beloved<br>
children, that the good God hath<br>
before manifested all things unto<br>
us, that we might know to whom<br>
we ought always to give thanks<br>
and praise.</p>
<br>
<p>2  If therefore the Son of God<br>
who is the Lord of all, and shall<br>
come to judge both the quick and<br>
dead, hath suffered, that by his<br>
stripes we might live; let us<br>
believe that the Son of God could<br>
not have suffered but for us. But<br>
being crucified, they gave him<br>
vinegar and gall to drink.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Hear therefore how the priests<br>
of the temple did foreshow this<br>
also: the Lord by his command<br>
which was written, declared that<br>
whosoever did not fast the<br>
appointed fast he should die the<br>
death: because he also was himself<br>
one day to offer up his body for<br>
our sins; that so the type of<br>
what was done in Isaac might be<br>
fulfilled, who was offered upon the<br>
altar.</p>
<br>
<p>4  What therefore is it that he<br>
says by the prophet? And let<br>
them eat of the goat which is<br>
offered in the day of the fast for<br>
all their sins. Hearken diligently,<br>
(my brethren,) and all the priests,<br>
and they only shall eat the inwards<br>
not washed with vinegar.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Why so? because I know<br>
that when I shall hereafter offer<br>
my flesh for the sins of a new<br>
people, ye will give me vinegar to<br>
drink mixed with gall; therefore<br>
do ye only eat, the people fasting<br>
the while, and lamenting in<br>
sackcloth and ashes.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And that he might foreshow<br>
that he was to suffer for them,<br>
hear then how he appointed it.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Take, says he, two goats, fair<br>
and alike, and offer them; and let<br>
the high priest take one of them<br>
for a burnt offering.    And what<br>
shalt be done with the other? Let<br>
it, says he, be accursed.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Consider how exactly this<br>
appears to have been a type of<br>
Jesus. And let all the congregation<br>
spit upon it, and prick it; and<br>
put the scarlet wool about its<br>
head; and thus let it be carried<br>
forth into the wilderness.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And this being done, he that<br>
was appointed to convey the goat,<br>
led it into the wilderness, and<br>
took away the scarlet wool, and<br>
put it upon a thorn bush, whose<br>
young sprouts, when we find<br>
them in the field, we are wont to<br>
eat: so the fruit of that thorn<br>
only is sweet.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And to what end was this<br>
ceremony? Consider; one was<br>
offered upon the altar, the<br>
other was accursed.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And why was that which was<br>
accursed crowned? Because they<br>
shall see Christ on that day having<br>
a scarlet garment about his body;<br>
and shall say: Is not this he whom<br>
we crucified; having despised him,<br>
pierced him, mocked him? Certainly,<br>
this is he, who then said,<br>
that he was the Son of God.</p>
<br>
<p>12  As therefore he shall be<br>
then like to what he was on<br>
earth, so were the Jews heretofore<br>
commanded, to take two goats fair<br>
and equal; that when they shall<br>
see (our Saviour) hereafter coming<br>
(in the clouds of heaven), they may<br>
be amazed at the likeness of the<br>
goats.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Wherefore ye here again<br>
see a type of Jesus who was to<br>
suffer for us.</p>
<br>
<p>14  But what then signifies this,<br>
That the wool was to be put into<br>
the midst of the thorns?</p>
<br>
<p>15  This also is a figure of Jesus,<br>
set out to the church. For as he who<br>
would take away the scarlet wool<br>
must undergo many difficulties,<br>
because that thorn was very sharp,<br>
and with difficulty get it:  So,<br>
says Christ, they that will see me,<br>
and come to my kingdom, must<br>
through many afflictions and<br>
troubles attain unto me.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VII.</p>
<br>
<p>     The red heifer, another type of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>BUT what type do ye suppose<br>
it to have been, where it is<br>
commanded to the people of Israel,<br>
that grown persons in whom sins<br>
are come to perfection, should<br>
offer an heifer, and after they had<br>
killed it should burn the same;</p>
<br>
<p>2  But then young men should<br>
take up the ashes and put them in<br>
vessels; and tie a piece of scarlet<br>
wool and hyssop upon a stick, and<br>
so the young men should sprinkle<br>
every one of the people, and they<br>
should be clear from their sins?</p>
<br>
<p>3  Consider how all these are<br>
delivered in a figure to us.</p>
<br>
<p>4  This heifer is Jesus Christ;<br>
the wicked men that were to offer<br>
it are those sinners who brought<br>
him to death; who afterwards have<br>
no more to do with it: for the<br>
sinners have no more the honour<br>
of handling it:</p>
<br>
<p>5  But the young men that performed<br>
the sprinkling, signified those who<br>
preach to us the forgiveness of<br>
sins, and the purification of the<br>
heart, to whom the Lord gave<br>
authority to preach his Gospel:<br>
being at the beginning twelve,<br>
to signify the tribes, because<br>
there were twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>6  But why were there three<br>
young men appointed to sprinkle?<br>
To denote Abraham, and Isaac,<br>
and Jacob, because they were<br>
great before God.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And why was the wool put<br>
upon a stick? Because the kingdom<br>
of Jesus was founded upon the cross;<br>
and therefore they that put their<br>
trust in him, shall live for ever.</p>
<br>
<p>8  But why was the wool and<br>
hyssop put together? To signify<br>
that in the kingdom of Christ there<br>
shall be evil and filthy days, in<br>
which however, we shall be saved;<br>
and because he that has any disease<br>
in the flesh by some filthy humours,<br>
is cured by hyssop.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Wherefore these things being<br>
thus done, are to us indeed evident,<br>
but to the Jews they are obscure;<br>
because they hearkened not unto<br>
the voice of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER VIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     Of the circumcision of the ears and how in the<br>
     first institution of circumcision Abraham<br>
     mystically foretold Christ by name.</p>
<br>
<p>AND therefore the Scripture<br>
again speaks concerning our<br>
ears, that God has circumcised<br>
them, together with our hearts.<br>
For thus saith the Lord by the<br>
holy prophet: By the hearing of<br>
the ear they obeyed me.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And again, They who are afar<br>
off, shall hear and understand<br>
what things I have done. And<br>
again, Circumcise your hearts,<br>
saith the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And again be saith, Hear O<br>
Israel! For thus saith the Lord<br>
thy God. And again the Spirit of<br>
God prophesieth, saying: Who is<br>
there that would live for ever, let<br>
him hear the voice of my Son.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And again, Hear, O Heavens,<br>
and give ear O Earth! Because<br>
the Lord has spoken these things<br>
for a witness.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And again, he saith, Hear<br>
the word of the Lord, ye princes<br>
of the people. And again, Hear<br>
O children!  The voice of one<br>
crying in the wilderness.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Wherefore he has circumcised<br>
our ears, that we should hear his<br>
word, and believe.  But as for<br>
that circumcision, in which the<br>
Jews trust, it is abolished: for the<br>
circumcision of which God spake,<br>
was not of the flesh.</p>
<br>
<p>7  But they have transgressed<br>
his commands, because the evil<br>
one hath deceived them. For<br>
thus God bespeaks them; Thus<br>
saith the Lord your God, (Here I<br>
find the new law) Sow not among<br>
thorns; but circumcise yourselves<br>
to the Lord your God. And what<br>
doth he mean by this saying?<br>
Hearken unto your Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And again he saith, Circumcise<br>
the hardness of your heart, and<br>
harden not your neck. And again,<br>
Behold, saith the Lord, all the<br>
nations are uncircumcised, (they<br>
have not lost their fore-skin): but<br>
this people is uncircumcised in<br>
heart.</p>
<br>
<p>9  But you will say the Jews<br>
were circumcised for a sign. And<br>
so are all the Syrians and Arabians,<br>
and all the idolatrous priests: but<br>
are they therefore of the covenant<br>
of Israel? And even the Egyptians<br>
themselves are circumcised.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Understand therefore, children,<br>
these things more fully, that<br>
Abraham was the first, that<br>
brought in circumcision, looking<br>
forward in the Spirit, to Jesus;<br>
circumcised, having received the<br>
mystery of three letters.</p>
<br>
<p>11  For the Scripture says that<br>
Abraham circumcised three hundred<br>
and eighteen men of his house.<br>
But what therefore was the mystery<br>
that was made known unto him!</p>
<br>
<p>12  Mark, first the eighteen, and<br>
next the three hundred. For the<br>
numeral letters of ten and eight<br>
are T H.  And these denote Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And because the cross was<br>
that by which we were to find<br>
grace, therefore he adds, three<br>
hundred; the note of which is T<br>
(the figure of his cross).<br>
Wherefore by two letters he<br>
signified Jesus, and by the<br>
third his cross.</p>
<br>
<p>14  He who has put the engrafted<br>
gift of his doctrine within us,<br>
knows that I never taught to<br>
anyone a more certain truth: but I<br>
trust that ye are worthy of it.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IX.</p>
<br>
<p>     That the commands of Moses concerning clean and unclean<br>
     beasts, were all designed for a spiritual signification.</p>
<br>
<p>BUT why did Moses say Ye<br>
shall not eat of the swine,<br>
neither the eagle nor the hawk;<br>
nor the crow; nor any fish that<br>
has not a scale upon him?--I<br>
answer that, in the spiritual sense,<br>
he comprehended three doctrines,<br>
that were to be gathered from<br>
thence.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Besides which he says to them<br>
in the book of Deuteronomy, And<br>
I will give my statutes unto this<br>
people. Wherefore it is not the<br>
command of God that they should<br>
not eat these things; but Moses in<br>
the spirit spake unto them.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Now the sow he forbad them<br>
to eat; meaning thus much: Thou<br>
shalt not join thyself to such<br>
persons as are like unto swine,<br>
who, whilst they live in pleasure,<br>
forget their God; but when any want<br>
pinches them, then they know the<br>
Lord: as the sow when she is full<br>
knows not her master, but when<br>
she is hungry she makes a noise;<br>
and being again fed, is silent.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Neither, says he, shalt thou<br>
eat the eagle, nor the hawk, nor<br>
the kite, nor the crow; that is,<br>
thou shalt not keep company with<br>
such kind of men as know not how<br>
by their labour and sweat to get<br>
themselves food; but injuriously<br>
ravish away the things of others,<br>
and watch how to lay snares for<br>
them; when at the same time they<br>
appear to live in perfect innocence.</p>
<br>
<p>3  So these birds alone (seek not<br>
food for themselves,) but sitting<br>
idle, seek how they may eat of the<br>
flesh others have provided being<br>
destructive through their<br>
wickedness.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Neither, says he, shalt thou<br>
eat the lamprey, nor the polypus,<br>
nor the cuttle-fish; that is thou<br>
shalt not be like such men, by<br>
seeking to converse with them<br>
who are altogether wicked and<br>
adjudged to death. For so those<br>
fishes are alone accursed, that<br>
wallow in the mire, nor swim as other<br>
fishes, but tumble in the dirt at<br>
the bottom of the deep.</p>
<br>
<p>7  But, he adds, neither shalt<br>
thou eat of the hare. To what<br>
end?--To signify this to us;<br>
Thou shalt not be an adulterer,<br>
nor liken thyself to such persons.<br>
For the hare every year multiplies<br>
the places of its conception; and<br>
as many years as it lives, so many<br>
it has.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Neither shalt thou eat of the<br>
hyena: that is, again, be not an<br>
adulterer, nor a corrupter of<br>
others; neither be like to such.<br>
And wherefore so?--Because that<br>
creature every year changes its<br>
kind, which is sometimes male<br>
and sometimes female.</p>
<br>
<p>9  For which cause also he justly<br>
hated the weazel; to the end that<br>
they should not be like such<br>
persons who with their mouths<br>
commit wickedness by reason of<br>
their uncleanness; nor join<br>
themselves with those impure women,<br>
who with their mouths commit<br>
wickedness. Because that animal<br>
conceives with its mouth.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Moses, therefore, speaking<br>
as concerning meats, delivered<br>
indeed three great precepts to<br>
them in the spiritual signification<br>
of those commands. But they<br>
according to the desires of the<br>
flesh, understood him as if he<br>
had only meant it of meats.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And therefore David took<br>
aright the knowledge of his<br>
three-fold command, saying in<br>
like manner:</p>
<br>
<p>12  Blessed is the man that hath<br>
not walked in the counsel of the<br>
ungodly; as the fishes before<br>
mentioned in the bottom of the<br>
deep, in darkness.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Nor stood in the way of<br>
sinners, as they who seem to fear<br>
the Lord, but yet sin, as the sow.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And hath not sat in the seat<br>
of the scorners; as those birds<br>
who sit and watch that they may<br>
devour.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Here you have the law<br>
concerning meat perfectly set<br>
forth and according to the<br>
true knowledge of it.</p>
<br>
<p>16  But, says Moses, ye shall<br>
eat all that divideth the hoof, and<br>
cheweth the cud. Signifying<br>
thereby such an one as having<br>
taken his food, knows him that<br>
nourisheth him; and resting upon<br>
him, rejoiceth in him.</p>
<br>
<p>17  And in this he spake well,<br>
having respect to the commandment.<br>
What, therefore, is it that<br>
he says?--That we should hold<br>
fast to them that fear the Lord;<br>
with those who meditate on the<br>
command of the word which they<br>
have received, in their heart;<br>
with those that declare the<br>
righteous judgments of the Lord,<br>
and keep his commandments;</p>
<br>
<p>18  In short, with those who<br>
know that to meditate is a work<br>
of pleasure, and therefore exercise<br>
themselves in the word of the<br>
Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>19  But why might they eat<br>
those that clave the hoof?<br>
Because the righteous liveth in this<br>
present world; but his expectation<br>
is fixed upon the other. See,<br>
brethren, how admirably Moses<br>
commanded these things.</p>
<br>
<p>20  But how should we thus<br>
know all this, and understand it?<br>
We, therefore, understanding<br>
aright the commandments, speak<br>
as the Lord would have us.<br>
Wherefore he has circumcised our<br>
ears and our hearts, that we might<br>
know these things.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER X.</p>
<br>
<p>     Baptism and the cross of Christ<br>
     foretold in figures under the law.</p>
<br>
<p>LET us now inquire whether<br>
the Lord took care to manifest<br>
anything beforehand concerning water<br>
and the cross.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Now for the former of these,<br>
it is written to the people of<br>
Israel how they shall not receive<br>
that baptism which brings to<br>
forgiveness of sins; but shall<br>
institute another to themselves<br>
that cannot.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For thus saith the prophet:<br>
Be astonished, O Heaven! and<br>
let the earth tremble at it, because<br>
this people have done two great<br>
and wicked things: they have left<br>
me, the fountain of living water,<br>
and have digged for themselves<br>
broken cisterns, that can hold no<br>
water.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Is my holy mountain of Zion,<br>
a desolate wilderness? For ye<br>
shall be as a young bird when its<br>
nest is taken away.</p>
<br>
<p>5 And again the prophet saith,<br>
I will go before thee, and will<br>
make plain the mountains, and<br>
will break the gates of brass, and<br>
will snap in sunder the bars of<br>
iron; and will give thee dark,<br>
and hidden, and invisible<br>
treasures, that they may know<br>
that I am the Lord God.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And again: he shall dwell<br>
in the high den of the strong<br>
rock. And then, what follows in<br>
the same prophet? His water is<br>
faithful; ye shall see the king<br>
with glory, and your soul shall<br>
learn the fear of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And again he saith in another<br>
prophet: He that does these<br>
things;   I shall be like a tree<br>
planted by the currents of water,<br>
which shall give its fruit in its<br>
season. Its leaf also shall not<br>
wither, and whatsoever he doth<br>
it shall prosper.</p>
<br>
<p>8  As for the wicked it is not<br>
so with them; but they are as the<br>
dust which the wind scattereth<br>
away from the face of the earth.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Therefore the ungodly shall<br>
not stand in the judgment, neither<br>
the sinners in the council of the<br>
righteous. For the Lord knoweth<br>
the way of the righteous, and the<br>
way of the ungodly shall perish.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Consider how he has joined<br>
both the cross and the water<br>
together.</p>
<br>
<p>11  For this he saith: Blessed<br>
are they who put their trust in the<br>
cross, and descend into the water;<br>
for they shall have their reward in<br>
due time: then, saith he, will I<br>
give it them.</p>
<br>
<p>12  But as concerning the present<br>
time, he saith, their leaves shall<br>
not fall: meaning thereby, that<br>
every word that shall go out of<br>
your mouth, shall through faith<br>
and charity be to the conversion<br>
and hope of many.</p>
<br>
<p>13  In like manner doth another<br>
prophet speak. And the land of<br>
Jacob was the praise of all the<br>
earth; magnifying thereby the<br>
vessel of his spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And what follows?--And<br>
there was a river running on the<br>
right hand, and beautiful trees<br>
grew up by it; and he that shall<br>
eat of them shall live for ever.<br>
The signification of which is this<br>
that we go down into the water<br>
full of sins and pollutions, but<br>
come up again, bringing forth<br>
fruit; having in our hearts the<br>
fear and hope which is in Jesus,<br>
by the spirit. And whosoever<br>
shall eat of them shall live for<br>
ever.</p>
<br>
<p>15  That is, whosoever shall<br>
hearken to those who call them, and<br>
shall believe, shall live for ever.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XI.</p>
<br>
<p>     The subject continued.</p>
<br>
<p>IN like manner he determines<br>
concerning the cross in another<br>
prophet, saying: And when shall<br>
these things be fulfilled?</p>
<br>
<p>2  The Lord answers: When the<br>
tree that is fallen shall rise, and<br>
when blood shall drop down from<br>
the tree. Here you have again<br>
mention made, both of the cross,<br>
and of him that was to be crucified<br>
upon it.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And yet farther he saith by<br>
Moses; (when Israel was fighting<br>
with, and beaten by, a strange<br>
people; to the end that God might<br>
put them in mind how that for<br>
their sins they were delivered unto<br>
death) yea, the holy spirit put it<br>
into the heart of Moses, to represent<br>
both the sign of the cross, and of<br>
him that was to suffer: that so<br>
they might know that if they did<br>
not believe in him, they should be<br>
overcome for ever.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Moses therefore I piled up<br>
armour upon armour in the middle<br>
of a rising ground, and standing<br>
up high above all of them, stretched<br>
forth his arms, and so Israel again<br>
conquered.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But no sooner did he let down<br>
his hands, but they were again<br>
slain. And why so?--To the end<br>
they might know, that except they<br>
trust in him they cannot be saved.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And in another prophet, he<br>
saith, I have stretched out my<br>
hands all the day long to a people<br>
disobedient, and speaking against<br>
my righteous way.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And again Moses makes a<br>
type of Jesus, to show that he was<br>
to die, and then that he, whom<br>
they thought to be dead, was to<br>
give life to others; in the type<br>
of those that fell in Israel.</p>
<br>
<p>8  For God caused all sorts of<br>
serpents to bite them, and they<br>
died: forasmuch as by a serpent<br>
transgression began in Eve; that<br>
so he might convince them that<br>
for their transgressions they shall<br>
be delivered into the pain of death.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Moses then himself, who had<br>
commanded them, saying, Ye shall<br>
not make to yourselves any graven<br>
or molten image, to be your God<br>
yet now did so himself, that he<br>
might represent to them the figure<br>
of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>10  For he made a brazen<br>
serpent, and set it up on high,<br>
and called the people together<br>
by a proclamation: where being come,<br>
they entreated Moses that he would<br>
make an atonement for them, and<br>
pray that they might be healed.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Then Moses spake unto them,<br>
saying: when any one among you<br>
shall be bitten, let him come unto<br>
the serpent that is set upon the<br>
pole; and let him assuredly trust<br>
in him, that though he be dead,<br>
yet he is able to give life, and<br>
presently he shall be saved; and so<br>
they did. See therefore how here<br>
also you have in this the glory of<br>
Jesus; and that in him and to<br>
him are all things.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Again; What says Moses to<br>
Joshua, the Son of Nun, when he<br>
gave that name unto him, as being<br>
a prophet, that all the people might<br>
hear him alone?  Because the<br>
father did manifest all things<br>
concerning his son Jesus, in Joshua,<br>
the Son of Nun; and gave him<br>
that name when he sent him to spy<br>
out the land of Canaan, saying;<br>
Take a book in thine hands,<br>
and write what the Lord saith.<br>
Forasmuch as Jesus the Son of God<br>
shall in the last days cut off by the<br>
roots all the house of Amalek, see<br>
here again Jesus, not the son of<br>
man, but the Son of God, made<br>
manifest in a type, and in the flesh.</p>
<br>
<p>13  But because it might hereafter<br>
be said that Christ was the<br>
Son of David; therefore David<br>
fearing and well knowing the errors<br>
of the wicked, saith; the Lord<br>
said unto my Lord, sit thou on my<br>
right hand until I make thine<br>
enemies thy footstool.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And again Isaiah speaketh<br>
on this wise, The Lord said unto<br>
Christ my Lord, I have laid hold<br>
on his right hand, that the nations<br>
should obey before him, and I will<br>
break the strength of kings.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Behold, how doth David and<br>
Isaiah call him Lord, and the Son<br>
of God.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XII.</p>
<br>
<p>     The Promise of God not made to the Jews only,<br>
     but to the Gentiles also, and fulfilled to us by Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>BUT let us go yet further, and<br>
inquire whether this people be<br>
the heir, or the former; and<br>
whether the covenant be with us<br>
or with them.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And first, as concerning<br>
the people, hear now what the<br>
Scripture saith:</p>
<br>
<p>3  Isaac prayed for his wife<br>
Rebekah, because she was barren;<br>
and she conceived. Afterwards<br>
Rebekah went forth to inquire<br>
of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And the Lord said unto her;<br>
There are two nations in thy womb,<br>
and two people shall come from<br>
thy body; and the one shall have<br>
power over the other, and the<br>
greater shall serve the lesser.<br>
Understand here who was Isaac;<br>
who Rebekah; and of whom it was<br>
foretold, this people shall be<br>
greater than that.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And in another prophecy Jacob<br>
speaketh more clearly to his<br>
son Joseph, saying; Behold the<br>
Lord hath not derived me of seeing<br>
thy face, bring me thy sons that<br>
I may bless them. And he brought<br>
unto his father Manasseh and<br>
Ephraim, desiring that he should<br>
bless Manasseh, because he was<br>
the elder.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Therefore Joseph brought him<br>
to the right hand of his father<br>
Jacob. But Jacob by the spirit<br>
foresaw the figure of the people<br>
that was to come.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And what saith the Scripture?<br>
And Jacob crossed his hands, and<br>
put his right hand upon Ephraim,<br>
his second, and the younger son,<br>
and blessed him. And Joseph said<br>
unto Jacob; Put thy right hand<br>
upon the head of Manasseh, for he<br>
is my first-born son. And Jacob<br>
said unto Joseph; I know it, my<br>
son, I know it; but the greater<br>
shall serve the lesser; though he<br>
also shall be blessed.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Ye see of whom he appointed<br>
it, that they should be the first<br>
people, and heirs of the covenant.</p>
<br>
<p>9  If therefore God shall have<br>
yet farther taken notice of this,<br>
by Abraham too; our understanding<br>
of it will then be perfectly<br>
established.</p>
<br>
<p>10  What then saith the Scripture<br>
of Abraham, when I he believed,<br>
and it was imputed unto him for<br>
righteousness? Behold I have made<br>
thee a father of the nations,<br>
which without circumcision believe<br>
in the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Let us therefore now inquire<br>
whether God has fulfilled the<br>
covenant, which he sware to our<br>
fathers, that he would give this<br>
people? Yes, verily, he gave it;<br>
but they were not worthy to receive<br>
it by reason of their sins.</p>
<br>
<p>12  For thus saith the prophet<br>
And Moses continued fasting in<br>
mount Sinai, to receive the covenant<br>
of the Lord with the people, forty<br>
days and forty nights.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And he received of the Lord<br>
two tables written with the finger<br>
of the Lord's hand, in the Spirit.<br>
And Moses, when he had received<br>
them, brought them down that he<br>
might deliver them to the people.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And the Lord said unto<br>
Moses; Moses, Moses, get thee<br>
down quickly, for the people which<br>
thou broughtest out of the land of<br>
Egypt have done wickedly.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And Moses understood that<br>
they had again set up a molten<br>
image: and he cast the two tables<br>
out of his hands; and the tables<br>
of the covenant of the Lord were<br>
broken. Moses therefore received<br>
them, but they were not worthy.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Now then learn how we have<br>
received them. Moses, being a<br>
servant, took them; but the Lord<br>
himself has given them unto us,<br>
that we might be the people of his<br>
inheritance; having suffered for<br>
us.</p>
<br>
<p>17  He was therefore made<br>
manifest; that they should fill<br>
up the measure of their sins,<br>
and that we being made heirs by<br>
him, should receive the covenant<br>
of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>18  And again the prophet saith<br>
Behold, I have set thee for a light<br>
unto the Gentiles; to be the saviour<br>
of all the ends of the earth, saith<br>
the Lord; the God who hath re-deemed<br>
thee.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Who for that very end<br>
was prepared, that by his own<br>
appearing he might redeem our<br>
hearts, already devoured by<br>
death, and delivered over to<br>
the irregularity of error,<br>
from darkness; and establish<br>
a covenant with us by his word.</p>
<br>
<p>20  For so it is written that the<br>
father commanded him by delivering<br>
us from darkness, to prepare unto<br>
himself a holy people.</p>
<br>
<p>21  Wherefore the prophet saith<br>
I the Lord thy God have called<br>
thee in righteousness, and I will<br>
take thee by thy hand, and will<br>
strengthen thee, and give thee<br>
for a covenant of the people; for a<br>
light to the Gentiles. To open the<br>
eyes of the blind, to bring out the<br>
prisoners from the prison, and them<br>
that sit in darkness out of the<br>
prison house.</p>
<br>
<p>22  Consider, therefore, from<br>
whence we have been redeemed.<br>
And again the prophet saith<br>
The spirit of the Lord is upon me,<br>
because he hath anointed me: he<br>
hath sent me to preach glad tidings<br>
to the lowly; to heal the broken in<br>
heart; to preach remission to the<br>
captives, and give sight unto the<br>
blind; to proclaim the acceptable<br>
year of the Lord, and the day of<br>
restitution; to comfort all that<br>
mourn.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     That the sabbath of the Jews was but a figure<br>
     of a more glorious sabbath to come, and their<br>
     temple, of the spiritual temples of God.</p>
<br>
<p>FURTHERMORE it is written<br>
concerning the sabbath, in the<br>
Ten Commandments, which God<br>
spake in the mount Sinai to Moses,<br>
face to face: Sanctify the sabbath<br>
of the Lord with pure hands, and<br>
with a clean heart.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And elsewhere he saith;<br>
If thy children shall keep my<br>
Sabbaths, then will I put my<br>
mercy upon them.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And even in the beginning of<br>
the creation he makes mention of<br>
the sabbath. And God made in<br>
six days the works of his hands,<br>
and he finished them on the seventh<br>
day; and he rested the seventh<br>
day, and sanctified it.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Consider, my children, what<br>
that signifies, he finished them<br>
in six days. The meaning of it is<br>
this: that in six thousand years<br>
the Lord God will bring all things<br>
to an end.</p>
<br>
<p>5  For with him one day is<br>
a thousand years; as himself<br>
testifieth, saying, Behold this<br>
day shall be as a thousand years.<br>
Therefore, children, in six days,<br>
that is, in six thousand years,<br>
shall a all things be accomplished.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And what is that he saith,<br>
And he rested the seventh day<br>
he meaneth this: that when<br>
his Son shall come, and abolish<br>
the season of the Wicked One,<br>
and judge the ungodly; and shall<br>
change the sun and the moon, and<br>
the stars; then he shall gloriously<br>
rest on that seventh day,</p>
<br>
<p>7  He adds, lastly: Thou shalt<br>
sanctify it with clean hands and<br>
a pure heart. Wherefore we are<br>
greatly deceived if we imagine<br>
that anyone can now sanctify that<br>
day which God has made holy,<br>
without having a heart pure in<br>
all things.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Behold, therefore, he will then<br>
truly sanctify it with blessed rest,<br>
when we (having received the<br>
righteous promise, when iniquity<br>
shall be no more, all things being<br>
renewed by the Lord) shall be able<br>
to sanctify it, being ourselves first<br>
made holy;</p>
<br>
<p>9  Lastly, he saith unto them<br>
Your new moons and your Sabbaths<br>
I cannot bear them. Consider<br>
what he means by it; the<br>
Sabbaths, says he, which ye now<br>
keep are not acceptable unto me,<br>
but those which I have made;<br>
when resting from all things I<br>
shall begin the eight day, that is,<br>
the beginning of the other world.</p>
<br>
<p>10  For which cause we observe<br>
the eight day with gladness, in<br>
which Jesus rose from the dead;<br>
and having manifested himself to<br>
his disciples, ascended into heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>11  It remains yet that I<br>
speak to you concerning the temple:<br>
how those miserable men being<br>
deceived have put their trust<br>
in the house, and not in God<br>
himself who made them, as if<br>
it were the habitation of God.</p>
<br>
<p>12  For much after the same<br>
manner as the Gentiles, they<br>
consecrated him in the temple.</p>
<br>
<p>13  But learn therefore how<br>
the Lord speaketh, rendering the<br>
temple vain: Who has measured the<br>
heaven with a span, and the earth<br>
with his hand? Is it not I? Thus<br>
with the Lord, Heaven is my<br>
throne, and the earth is my<br>
footstool. What is the house<br>
that ye will build me? Or what<br>
is the place of my rest? Know<br>
therefore that all their hope<br>
is vain.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And again he speaketh after<br>
this manner: Behold they that<br>
destroy this temple, even they<br>
shall again build it up. And so<br>
it came to pass; for through their<br>
wars it is now destroyed by their<br>
enemies; and the servants of their<br>
enemies build it up.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Furthermore it has been<br>
made manifest, how both the city<br>
and the temple, and the people of<br>
Israel should be given up. For<br>
the scripture saith; And it shall<br>
come to pass in the last days, that<br>
the Lord will deliver up the sheep<br>
of his pasture, and their fold, and<br>
their tower unto destruction. And<br>
it is come to pass, as the Lord hath<br>
spoken.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Let us inquire therefore,<br>
whether there be any temple of<br>
God? Yes there is: and there<br>
where himself declares that he<br>
would both make and perfect it.<br>
For it is written: And it shall<br>
be that as soon as the week shall<br>
be completed, the temple of the<br>
Lord shall be gloriously built in<br>
the name of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>17  I find therefore that there<br>
is a temple. But how shall it be<br>
built in the name of the Lord? I<br>
will shew you.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Before that we believed in<br>
God, the habitation of our heart<br>
was corruptible, and feeble, as a<br>
temple truly built with hands.</p>
<br>
<p>19  For it was a house full<br>
of idolatry, a house of devils;<br>
inasmuch as there was done in it<br>
whatsoever was contrary unto God.<br>
But it shall be built in the name<br>
of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>20  Consider, how that the<br>
temple of the Lord shall be very<br>
gloriously built; and by what<br>
means that shall be, learn.</p>
<br>
<p>21  Having received remission<br>
of our sins, and trusting in the<br>
name of the Lord, we are become<br>
renewed, being again created as it<br>
were from the beginning. Wherefore<br>
God truly dwells in our house,<br>
that is, in us.</p>
<br>
<p>22  But how does he dwell in us?<br>
By the word of his faith, the calling<br>
of his promise, the wisdom of his<br>
righteous judgments and the commands<br>
of his doctrine. He himself prophesies<br>
within us, he himself dwelleth in us,<br>
and openeth to us who were in bondage<br>
of death the gate of our temple,<br>
that is, the mouth of wisdom, having<br>
given repentance unto us; and by this<br>
means has brought us to be an<br>
incorruptible temple.</p>
<br>
<p>23  He therefore that desires to<br>
be saved looketh not unto the<br>
man, but unto him that dwelleth<br>
in him, and speaketh by him;<br>
being struck with wonder,<br>
forasmuch as he never either<br>
heard him speaking such words<br>
out of his mouth, nor ever<br>
desired to hear them.</p>
<br>
<p>24  This is that spiritual temple<br>
that is built unto the Lord.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XIV.</p>
<br>
<p>     Of the way of light; being a summary of what<br>
     a Christian is to do, that he maybe happy for ever.</p>
<br>
<p>AND thus I trust, I have<br>
declared to you as much, and<br>
with as great simplicity as I<br>
could, those, things which provide<br>
for your salvation, so as not to<br>
have omitted any thing that might<br>
be requisite thereunto.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For should I speak farther of<br>
the things that now are, and of<br>
those that are to come, you would<br>
not yet understand them, seeing<br>
they lie in parables. This therefore<br>
shall suffice as to these things.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Let us now go on to the other<br>
kind of knowledge and doctrine.<br>
There are two ways of doctrine<br>
and power; the one of light, the<br>
other of darkness.</p>
<br>
<p>4  But there is a great deal of<br>
difference between these two ways<br>
for over one are appointed the<br>
angels of God, the leaders of<br>
the way of light; over the other,<br>
the angels of Satan. And the one<br>
is the Lord from everlasting to<br>
everlasting; the other is the<br>
prince of the time of<br>
unrighteousness.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Now the way of light is this:<br>
If any one desires to attain to the<br>
place that is appointed for him,<br>
and will hasten thither by his<br>
works. And the knowledge that<br>
has been given to us for walking<br>
in it, to this effect: Thou shalt<br>
love him that made thee: thou<br>
shalt glorify him that hath<br>
redeemed thee from death.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Thou shalt be simple in heart,<br>
and rich in the spirit.  Thou shalt<br>
not cleave to those that walk in<br>
the way of death.   Thou shalt hate<br>
to do anything that is not pleasing<br>
unto God. Thou shalt abhor all<br>
dissimulation. Thou shalt not<br>
neglect any of the commands of<br>
the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Thou shalt not exalt thyself,<br>
but shalt be humble. Then shalt<br>
not take honour to thyself. Thou<br>
shalt not enter into any wicked<br>
counsel against thy neighbour.<br>
Thou shalt not be over confident<br>
in thy heart.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Thou shaft not commit<br>
fornication, nor adultery.<br>
Neither shalt thou corrupt<br>
thyself with mankind. Thou<br>
shalt not make use of the<br>
word of God, to any impurity,</p>
<br>
<p>9  Thou shalt not except any<br>
man's person, when thou reprovest<br>
any one's faults. Thou shalt be<br>
gentle. Thou shalt be quiet.<br>
Thou shalt tremble at the words<br>
which thou hast heard. Thou<br>
shalt not keep any hatred in thy<br>
heart against thy brother. Thou<br>
shalt not entertain any doubt<br>
whether it shall be or not.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Thou shalt not take the name<br>
of the Lord in vain. Thou shalt<br>
love thy neighbour above thy own<br>
soul,</p>
<br>
<p>11  Thou shalt not destroy thy<br>
conceptions, before they are<br>
brought forth; nor kill them<br>
after they are born.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Thou shalt not withdraw thy<br>
hand from thy son, or from thy<br>
daughter; but shall teach them<br>
from their youth the fear of the<br>
Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Thou shalt not covet thy<br>
neighbour's goods; neither shalt<br>
thou be an extortioner. Neither<br>
shall thy heart be joined to proud<br>
men; but thou shalt be numbered<br>
among the righteous and the<br>
lowly. Whatever events shall<br>
happen unto thee, thou shalt<br>
receive them as good.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Thou shalt not be double-<br>
minded or double-tongued; for a<br>
double tongue is the snare of death.<br>
Thou shalt be subject unto the<br>
Lord and to inferior masters as to<br>
the representatives of God, in fear<br>
and reverence.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Thou shalt not be bitter in<br>
thy commands towards any of thy<br>
servants that trust in God; lest<br>
thou chance not to fear him who<br>
is over both; because he came not<br>
to call any with respect of persons,<br>
but whomsoever the spirit had<br>
prepared.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Thou shalt communicate to<br>
thy neighbour of all thou hast;<br>
thou shalt not call anything<br>
thine own: for if ye partake of<br>
such things as are incorruptible,<br>
how much more should you do it<br>
in those that are corruptible?</p>
<br>
<p>17  Thou shalt not be forward to<br>
speak; for the mouth is the snare<br>
of death. Strive for thy soul with<br>
all thy might. Reach not out<br>
thine hand to receive, and<br>
withhold it not when thou<br>
shouldest give.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Thou shalt love, as the apple<br>
of thine eye, everyone that speaketh<br>
unto thee the Word of the Lord.<br>
Call to thy remembrance, day and<br>
night, the future judgment.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Thou shalt seek out every<br>
day, the persons of the righteous;<br>
and both consider and go about to<br>
exhort others by the word, and<br>
meditate how thou mayest save a<br>
soul.</p>
<br>
<p>20  Thou shaft also labour with<br>
thy hands to give to the poor,<br>
that thy sins may be forgiven thee,<br>
Thou shalt not deliberate whether<br>
thou shouldst give; nor having<br>
given, murmur at it.</p>
<br>
<p>21  Give to everyone that asks<br>
so shalt thou know who is the good<br>
rewarder of thy gifts.</p>
<br>
<p>22  Keep what thou hast received;<br>
thou shalt neither add to it nor<br>
take from it.</p>
<br>
<p>23  Let the wicked be always<br>
thy aversion. Thou shalt judge<br>
with righteous judgment. Thou<br>
shalt never cause divisions; but<br>
shalt make peace between those<br>
that are at variance, and bring<br>
them together.</p>
<br>
<p>24  Thou shalt confess thy sins;<br>
and not come to thy prayer with<br>
an evil conscience.</p>
<br>
<p>25 This is the way of light.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER XV.</p>
<br>
<p>     Of the way of darkness; that is, what kind of persons<br>
     shall be for ever cast out of the kingdom of God.</p>
<br>
<p>BUT the way of darkness is<br>
crooked, and full of cursing.<br>
For it is the way of eternal death,<br>
with punishment; in which they<br>
that walk meet those things that<br>
destroy their own souls.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Such are; idolatry, confidence,<br>
pride of power, hypocrisy, double-<br>
mindedness, adultery, murder, rapine,<br>
pride, transgression, deceit, malice,<br>
arrogance, witchcraft, covetousness,<br>
and the want of the fear of God.</p>
<br>
<p>3  In this, walk those, who are<br>
the persecutors of them that are<br>
good; haters of truth; lovers of<br>
lies; who know not the reward of<br>
righteousness, nor cleave to any<br>
thing that is good.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Who administer not righteous<br>
judgment to the widow and orphan;<br>
who watch for wickedness, and not<br>
for the fear of the Lord;</p>
<br>
<p>5  From whom gentleness and<br>
patience are far off: who love<br>
vanity, and follow after rewards;<br>
having no compassion upon the<br>
poor; nor take any pains for such<br>
as are heavy laden and oppressed.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Ready to evil speaking,<br>
not knowing him that made them;<br>
murderers of children; corrupters<br>
of the creature of God; that turn<br>
away from the needy; oppress the<br>
afflicted; are the advocates of the<br>
rich, but unjust judges of the poor;<br>
being altogether sinners.</p>
<br>
<p>7  It is therefore fitting<br>
that learning the just commands<br>
of the Lord, which we have before<br>
mentioned, we should walk in them.<br>
For he who does such things shall<br>
be glorified in the kingdom of Hod.</p>
<br>
<p>8  But he that chooses the other<br>
part, shall be destroyed, together<br>
with his works. For this cause<br>
there shall be both a resurrection,<br>
and a retribution.</p>
<br>
<p>9  I beseech those that are in<br>
high estate among you, (if so be<br>
you will take the counsel which<br>
with a good intention I offer to<br>
you,) you have those with you<br>
towards whom you may do good;<br>
do not forsake them.</p>
<br>
<p>10  For the day is at hand in<br>
which all things shall be destroyed,<br>
together with the wicked one.<br>
The Lord is near, and his reward<br>
is with him.</p>
<br>
<p>11  I beseech you, therefore,<br>
again, and again, Be as good<br>
lawgiver's to one Another; continue<br>
faithful counsellors do each other<br>
remove from among you all hypocrisy.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And may God, the Lord<br>
of all the world, give you<br>
wisdom, knowledge, counsel,<br>
and understanding of his<br>
judgments in patience:</p>
<br>
<p>13  Be ye taught of God;<br>
seeking what it is the Lord<br>
requires of you, and doing it;<br>
that ye may be saved in the<br>
day of judgment.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And if there be among you<br>
any remembrance of what is good,<br>
think of me; meditating on these<br>
things, that both my desire and<br>
my watching for you may turn to<br>
a good account.</p>
<br>
<p>15 I beseech you; I ask it as a<br>
favour of you; whilst you are in<br>
this beautiful tabernacle of the<br>
body, be wanting in none of these<br>
things; but without ceasing seek<br>
them, and fulfil every command,<br>
For these things are fitting and<br>
worthy to be done.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Wherefore I have given the<br>
more diligence to write unto you<br>
according to my ability, that you<br>
might rejoice. Farewell, children<br>
of love and peace.</p>
<br>
<p>17  The Lord of glory and of<br>
all grace, be with your spirit,<br>
Amen.</p>

<p>              REFERENCES TO THE GENERAL EPISTLE OF BARNABAS.</p>
<br>
<p>[Barnabas was a companion and fellow-preacher with Paul. This Epistle<br>
lays a greater claim to canonical authority than most others. It has been<br>
cited by  Clemens, Alexandrinus, Origen, Eusebius, and Jerome, and many<br>
ancient Fathers.    Cotelerius affirms that Origen and Jerome esteemed it<br>
genuine and  canonical; but Cotelerius himself did not believe it to be<br>
either one or the  other; on the contrary, he supposes it was written for<br>
the benefit of the  Ebionites, (the christianized Jews,) who were<br>
tenacious of rites and ceremonies.  Bishop Fell feared to own expressly<br>
what he seemed to be persuaded of, that it ought to be treated with the<br>
same respect as several of the books of the present canon.  Dr. Bernard,<br>
Savilian professor at Oxford, not only believed it to be genuine, but<br>
that it was read throughout in the churches of Alexandria, as the<br>
canonical Scriptures were. Dodwell supposed it to have been published<br>
before the Epistle of Jude, and the writings of both the Johns.  Vossius,<br>
Dupuis, Dr. Cane, Dr. Mill, Dr, S. Clark, Whitson, and Archbishop Wake<br>
also esteemed it genuine: Menardus, Archbishop Land, Spanheim, and others<br>
deemed it apocryphal.]</p>

deservedly happy: being blessed<br>

<p>4  For hearing that I came bound<br>
from Syria, for the common name<br>
and hope, trusting through your<br>
prayers to fight with beasts at<br>
home; so that by suffering I may<br>
become indeed the disciple of him<br>
who gave himself to God, an offering<br>
and sacrifice for us; ye hastened<br>
to see me. I received, therefore,<br>
in the name of God, your whole<br>
multitude in Onesimus;</p>
<br>
<p>5  Who by: inexpressible love is<br>
ours, but according to the flesh<br>
is our bishop; whom I beseech you,<br>
pray Jesus Christ, to love: and that<br>
you would all strive to be like unto<br>
him. And blessed be God, who<br>
has granted unto you, who are so<br>
worthy of him, to enjoy such an<br>
excellent bishop.</p>
<br>
<p>6  For what concerns my fellow<br>
servant Burrhus, and your most<br>
blessed deacon in things pertaining<br>
to God; I entreat you that he may<br>
tarry longer, both for yours, and<br>
your bishop's honour.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And Crocus also worthy of<br>
both our God and you, whom I<br>
have received as the pattern<br>
of your love, has in all things<br>
refreshed me, as the Father of<br>
our Lord Jesus Christ shall also<br>
refresh him; together with Onesimus,<br>
and Burrhus, and Euplus, and Fronto,<br>
in whom I have, as to your charity,<br>
seen all of you, And may always,<br>
have joy of you, if I shall be<br>
worthy of it.</p>
<br>
<p>8  It is therefore fitting that you<br>
should by all means glorify Jesus<br>
Christ, who hath glorified you<br>
that by a uniform obedience ye<br>
may be perfectly joined together<br>
in the same mind, and in the same<br>
judgment; and may all speak the<br>
same things concerning everything:</p>
<br>
<p>9  And that being, subject to<br>
your bishop, and the presbytery,<br>
ye may be wholly and thoroughly<br>
sanctified.</p>
<br>
<p>10  These things I prescribe to<br>
you, not as if I were somebody<br>
extraordinary: for though I am<br>
bound for his name, I am not yet<br>
perfect in Christ Jesus. But now<br>
I begin to learn, and I speak to<br>
you as fellow disciples together<br>
with me.</p>
<br>
<p>11  For I ought to have been<br>
stirred up by you, in faith: in<br>
admonition; in patience; in long-<br>
suffering; but forasmuch as<br>
charity suffers me not to be<br>
silent towards you, I have first<br>
taken upon me to exhort you, that<br>
ye would all run together,<br>
according to the will of God.</p>
<br>
<p>12  For even Jesus Christ, our<br>
inseparable life, is sent by the<br>
will of the Father; as the bishops,<br>
appointed unto the utmost bounds of<br>
the earth, are by the will of Jesus<br>
Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Wherefore it will become you<br>
to run together according to the<br>
will of your bishop, as also ye do,</p>
<br>
<p>14  For your famous presbytery,<br>
worthy of God, is fitted as exactly<br>
to the bishop, as the strings are<br>
to the harp.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Therefore in your concord<br>
and agreeing charity, Jesus Christ<br>
is sung; and every single person<br>
among you makes up the chorus:</p>
<br>
<p>16  That so being all consonant<br>
in love, and taking up the song<br>
of God, ye may in a perfect unity<br>
with one voice, sing to the Father<br>
by Jesus Christ; to the end that<br>
he may both hear you, and perceive<br>
by your works, that ye are indeed<br>
the members of his son.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Wherefore it is profitable for<br>
you to live in an unblameable<br>
unity, that so ye may always have<br>
a fellowship with God.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 The benefit of subjection.<br>
     4 The bishop not to be respected the less<br>
     because he is not forward in exacting it:<br>
     8 warns brethren against heretics; bidding<br>
     them cleave to Jesus, whose divine and human<br>
     mature is declared: commends them for their care<br>
     to keep themselves from false teachers:<br>
     and shews them the way to God.</p>
<br>
<p>FOR if I in this little time have<br>
had such a familiarity with<br>
your bishop, I mean not a carnal,<br>
but spiritual acquaintance with<br>
him; how much more must I think<br>
you happy who are so joined to him,<br>
as the church is to Jesus Christ,<br>
and Jesus Christ to the Father;<br>
so that all things may agree in<br>
the same unity.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Let no man deceive himself;<br>
if a man be not within the altar,<br>
he is deprived of the bread of God.<br>
For if the prayer of one or two<br>
be of such force, as we are told;<br>
how much more powerful shall<br>
that of the bishop and the whole<br>
church be?</p>
<br>
<p>3  He therefore that does not<br>
come together in the same place<br>
with it, is proud, and has already<br>
condemned himself; for it is written,<br>
God resisteth the proud. Let us take<br>
heed therefore, that we do not set<br>
ourselves against the bishop,<br>
that we may be subject to God.</p>
<br>
<p>4  The more any one sees his<br>
bishop silent, the more let him<br>
revere him.    For whomsoever the<br>
master of the house sends to be<br>
over his own household, we ought<br>
in like manner to receive him, as<br>
we do him that sent him. It is<br>
therefore evident that we ought<br>
to look upon the bishop, even as<br>
we do upon the Lord himself.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And indeed Onesimus himself<br>
does greatly commend your good<br>
order in God: that you all live<br>
according to the truth, and that<br>
no heresy dwells among you. For<br>
neither do ye hearken to anyone<br>
more than to Jesus Christ<br>
speaking to you in truth.</p>
<br>
<p>6  For some there are who<br>
carry about the name of Christ<br>
in deceitfulness, but do things<br>
unworthy of God; whom ye must<br>
flee, as ye would do so many<br>
wild beasts. For they are raving<br>
dogs, who bite secretly; against<br>
whom ye must guard yourselves,<br>
as men hardly to be cured.</p>
<br>
<p>7  There is one Physician, both<br>
fleshy and spiritual; made and<br>
not made; God incarnate; true<br>
life in death; both of Mary and<br>
of God: first passible, then<br>
impassible; even Jesus Christ our<br>
Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Wherefore let no man deceive<br>
you; as indeed neither are ye<br>
deceived, being wholly the<br>
servants of God. For inasmuch as<br>
there is no contention nor strife<br>
among you, to trouble you, ye<br>
must needs live according to God's<br>
will. My soul be for yours;<br>
and I myself, the expiatory<br>
offering for your church of Ephesus;<br>
so famous throughout the world.</p>
<br>
<p>9  They that are of the flesh<br>
cannot do the works of the spirit;<br>
neither they that are of the spirit<br>
the works of the flesh; as he<br>
that has faith cannot be an infidel;<br>
nor he that is an infidel have<br>
faith. But even those things<br>
which ye do according to the flesh<br>
are spiritual; forasmuch as ye do<br>
all things in Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>10 Nevertheless I have heard<br>
of some who have passed by you,<br>
having perverse doctrine; whom<br>
ye did not suffer to sow among<br>
you; but stopped your ears, that<br>
ye might not receive those things<br>
that were sown by them: because<br>
being the stones of the temple of<br>
the Father, prepared for his<br>
building; and drawn up on high<br>
by the Cross of Christ,<br>
as by an engine;</p>
<br>
<p>11.  Using the Holy Ghost as the<br>
rope: your faith being your support;<br>
and your charity the way that leads<br>
unto God.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Ye are therefore, with all<br>
your companions in the same<br>
journey full of God; his spiritual<br>
temples, full of Christ, and of<br>
holiness: adorned in all things<br>
with the commands of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>13  In whom also I rejoice that<br>
I have been thought worthy by<br>
this present epistle to converse,<br>
and joy together with you; that<br>
with respect to the other life, ye<br>
love nothing but God only.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Exorts them to prayer; to be unblamable.<br>
     5 To be careful of salvation;<br>
     11 frequent in public devotion;<br>
     13 and to live in charity.</p>
<br>
<p>PRAY also without ceasing for<br>
other men; for there is hope<br>
of repentance in them, that they<br>
may attain unto God. Let them<br>
therefore at least be instructed by<br>
your works, if they will be no<br>
other way.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Be ye mild at their anger;<br>
humble at their boasting; to their<br>
blasphemies return your prayers<br>
to their error, your firmness in<br>
the faith; when they are cruel,<br>
be ye gentle; not endeavouring<br>
to imitate their ways.</p>
<br>
<p>(3  Let us be their brethren in<br>
all kindness and moderation, but<br>
let us be followers of the Lord;<br>
for who was ever more unjustly<br>
used? More destitute? More<br>
despised?).</p>
<br>
<p>4  That so no herb of the devil<br>
may be found in you: but ye may<br>
remain in all holiness and sobriety<br>
both of body and spirit, in Christ<br>
Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>5  The last times are come upon<br>
us: let us therefore be very<br>
reverent, and fear the long-<br>
suffering of God, that it be<br>
not to us unto condemnation.</p>
<br>
<p>6  For let us either fear the<br>
wrath that is to come, or let us<br>
love the grace that we at present<br>
enjoy; that by the one or other of<br>
these, we may be found in Christ<br>
Jesus, unto true life.</p>
<br>
<p>7 Besides him, let nothing be<br>
worthy of you; for whom also I<br>
bear about these bonds; those<br>
spiritual jewels, in which I would<br>
to God that I might arise through<br>
your prayers.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Of which I entreat you to<br>
make me always partaker, that I<br>
may be found in the lot of the<br>
Christians of Ephesus, who have<br>
always agreed with the Apostles,<br>
through the power of Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>9 I know both who I am, and<br>
to whom I write: I, a person<br>
condemned; ye, such as have<br>
obtained mercy; I, exposed<br>
to danger; ye confirmed<br>
against danger.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Ye are the passage of<br>
those that are killed for God;<br>
the companions of Paul in the<br>
mysteries of the Gospel; the<br>
holy, the martyr, the deservedly<br>
most happy Paul: at whose feet<br>
may I be found, when I shall have<br>
attained unto God; who throughout<br>
all his epistles, makes mention<br>
of you in Christ Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Let it be your care therefore<br>
to come more fully together, to<br>
the praise and glory of God;<br>
for when ye meet fully together<br>
in the same place, the powers of<br>
the devil are destroyed, and his<br>
mischief is dissolved by the unity<br>
of your faith.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And indeed, nothing is better<br>
than peace, by which all war both<br>
spiritual and earthly is abolished.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Of all which, nothing is hid<br>
from you, if ye have perfect faith<br>
and charity in Christ Jesus, which<br>
are the beginning and end of life.</p>
<br>
<p>14  For the beginning is faith;<br>
the end is charity. And these two<br>
joined together, are of God; but<br>
all other things which concern a<br>
holy life, are the consequences of<br>
these.</p>
<br>
<p>15  No man professing a true<br>
faith, sinneth; neither does he<br>
who has charity hate any.</p>
<br>
<p>16  The tree is made manifest<br>
by its fruit; so they who profess<br>
themselves to be Christians are<br>
known by what they do.</p>
<br>
<p>17  For Christianity is not the<br>
work of an outward profession;<br>
but shows itself in the power of<br>
faith, if a man be found faithful<br>
unto the end.</p>
<br>
<p>18  It is better for a man to hold<br>
his peace, and be; than to say, he<br>
is a Christian, and not to be.</p>
<br>
<p>19  It is good to teach; if what<br>
he says he does likewise.</p>
<br>
<p>20  There is therefore one master<br>
who spake, and it was done; and<br>
even those things which he did<br>
without speaking, are worthy<br>
of the Father.</p>
<br>
<p>21  He that possesses the word<br>
of Jesus, is truly able to bear his<br>
very silence. That he may be perfect,<br>
be will do according to what he<br>
speaks, and be known by those<br>
things of which he is silent.</p>
<br>
<p>22  There is nothing hid from<br>
God, but even our secrets are nigh<br>
unto him.</p>
<br>
<p>23  Let us therefore do all<br>
things, as becomes those who<br>
have God dwelling in them;<br>
that we maybe his temples;<br>
and he may be our God as also<br>
he is, and will manifest himself<br>
before our faces, by those things<br>
for which we justly love him,</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 To have a care for the Gospel.<br>
     9 The virginity of Mary, the incarnation,<br>
     and the death of Christ, were hid from the Devil.<br>
     11 How the birth of Christ was revealed.<br>
     16 Exhorts to unity.</p>
<br>
<p>BE not deceived, my brethren:<br>
those that corrupt families<br>
by adultery, shall not inherit<br>
the kingdom of God.</p>
<br>
<p>2  If therefore they who do this<br>
according to the flesh, have<br>
suffered death; how much more shall<br>
he die, who by his wicked doctrine<br>
corrupts the faith of God, for which<br>
Christ was crucified?</p>
<br>
<p>3  He that is thus defiled, shall<br>
depart into unquenchable fire, and<br>
so also shall he that hearkens to<br>
him.</p>
<br>
<p>4  For this cause did the Lord<br>
suffer the ointment to be poured<br>
on his head; that he might breathe<br>
the breath of immortality unto his<br>
church.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Be not ye therefore anointed<br>
with the evil savour of the doctrine<br>
of the prince of this world: let him<br>
not take you captive from the life<br>
that is set before you.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And why are we not all<br>
wise, seeing we have received<br>
the knowledge of God, which is<br>
Jesus Christ? Why do we suffer<br>
ourselves foolishly to perish;<br>
not considering the gift which<br>
the Lord has truly sent to us?</p>
<br>
<p>7  Let my life be sacrificed<br>
for the doctrine of the cross;<br>
which is indeed a scandal to the<br>
unbelievers, but to us is salvation<br>
and life eternal.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Where is the wise man?<br>
Where is the disputer? Where<br>
is the boasting of those who<br>
are called wise?</p>
<br>
<p>9  For our Lord Jesus Christ was<br>
according to the dispensation of<br>
God, conceived in the womb of<br>
Mary, of the seed of David,<br>
by the Holy Ghost. He was born<br>
and baptized, that through his<br>
passion he might purify water,<br>
to the washing away of sin.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Now the Virginity of Mary,<br>
and he who was born of her, was<br>
kept in secret from the prince of<br>
this world; as was also the death<br>
of our Lord: three of the mysteries<br>
the most spoken of throughout the<br>
world, yet done in secret by God.</p>
<br>
<p>11  How then was our Saviour<br>
manifested to the world? A star<br>
shone in heaven beyond all the<br>
other stars, and its light was<br>
inexpressible, and its novelty<br>
struck terror into men's minds.<br>
All the rest of the stars,<br>
together with the sun and moon,<br>
were the chorus to this star;<br>
but that sent out its light<br>
exceedingly above them all.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And men began to be troubled<br>
to think whence this new star<br>
came so unlike to all the others.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Hence all the power of magic<br>
became dissolved; and every bond<br>
of wickedness was destroyed: men's<br>
ignorance was taken away; and<br>
the old kingdom abolished; God<br>
himself appearing in the form<br>
of a man, for the renewal of<br>
eternal life.</p>
<br>
<p>14  From thence began what<br>
God had prepared: from thence.<br>
forth things were disturbed;<br>
forasmuch as he designed to<br>
abolish death.</p>
<br>
<p>15 But if Jesus Christ shall<br>
give me grace through your prayers,<br>
and if it be his will, I purpose<br>
in a second epistle which I will<br>
suddenly write unto you, to manifest<br>
to you more fully the dispensation<br>
of which I have now begun to speak,<br>
about the new man, which is Jesus<br>
Christ; both in his faith, and<br>
charity; in his suffering, and<br>
in his resurrection.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Especially if the Lord shall<br>
make known unto me, that ye all<br>
by name come together united in<br>
one faith, and in Jesus Christ;<br>
who was of the race of David<br>
according to the flesh; the Son<br>
of man, and son of God; obeying<br>
your bishop and the presbytery<br>
with an entire affection; breaking<br>
one and the same bread, which is<br>
the medicine of immortality;<br>
our antidote that we should not<br>
die, but live for ever in Christ<br>
Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>17 My soul be for yours, and<br>
theirs whom ye have sent, to the<br>
glory of God; even unto Smyrna,<br>
from whence also I write to you;<br>
giving thanks unto the Lord and<br>
loving Polycarp even as I do you.<br>
Remember me, as Jesus Christ does<br>
remember you.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Pray for the church which is<br>
in Syria from whence I am carried<br>
bound to Rome; being the least<br>
of all the faithful which are there,<br>
as I have been thought worthy to<br>
be found, to the glory of God.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Fare ye well in God the<br>
Father, and in Jesus Christ, our<br>
common hope. Amen.</p>

                            THE EPISTLE OF<br>
                       IGNATIUS TO THE MAGNESIANS</h2></center>
<br><br><br>
<p>
CHAPTER I.</p>
<br>
<p>     4 Ignatius mentions the arrival of Damas,<br>
     their bishop, and others,<br>
     6 whom he exhorts them to reverence<br>
     notwithstanding he was a young man.</p>
<br>
<p>IGNATIUS, who is also called<br>
Theophorus, to the blessed<br>
church, by the grace of God the<br>
Father, in Jesus Christ our Saviour;<br>
through whom I salute the church<br>
which is at Magnesia, near the<br>
Maeander: and wish it all joy in<br>
God the Father, and in Jesus<br>
Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>2  When I heard of your well-<br>
ordered love and charity in God,<br>
being full of joy, I desired much<br>
to speak unto you in the faith of<br>
Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For having been thought<br>
worthy to obtain a most excellent<br>
name, in the bonds which I carry<br>
about, I salute the churches;<br>
wishing in them a union both of<br>
the body and spirit of Jesus Christ,<br>
our eternal life: as also of faith<br>
and charity, to which nothing is<br>
preferred: but especially of Jesus<br>
and the Father; in whom if we<br>
undergo all the injuries of the<br>
prince of this present world, and<br>
escape, we shall enjoy God,</p>
<br>
<p>4  Seeing, then, I have been<br>
judged worthy to see you, by<br>
Damas your most excellent bishop;<br>
and by your worthy presbyters,<br>
Bassus and Apollonius; and by my<br>
fellow-servant Sotio, the deacon;</p>
<br>
<p>5  In whom I rejoice, forasmuch<br>
as he is subject unto his bishop as<br>
to the grace of God; and to the<br>
presbytery as to the law of Jesus<br>
Christ; I determined to write<br>
unto you.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Wherefore it will become you<br>
also not to use your bishop too<br>
familiarly upon the account of his<br>
youth; but to yield all reverence<br>
to him according to the power of<br>
God the Father; as also I perceive<br>
that your holy presbyters do: not<br>
considering his age, which indeed<br>
to appearance is young; but as<br>
becomes those who are prudent in<br>
God, submitting to him, or rather<br>
not to him but to the Father of our<br>
Lord Jesus Christ, the bishop of<br>
us all.</p>
<br>
<p>7  It will therefore behove you<br>
with all sincerity, to obey your<br>
bishop; in honour of him whose<br>
pleasure it is that ye should do so.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Because he that does not do<br>
so, deceives not the bishop whom<br>
he sees, but affronts him that is<br>
invisible. For whatsoever of this<br>
kind is done, it reflects not upon<br>
man, but upon God, who knows<br>
the secrets of our hearts.</p>
<br>
<p>9  It is therefore fitting,<br>
that we should not only be called<br>
christians, but be so.</p>
<br>
<p>10  As some call indeed their<br>
governor, bishop; but yet do all<br>
things without him.</p>
<br>
<p>11  But I can never think<br>
that such as these have a good<br>
conscience, seeing that they are<br>
not gathered together thoroughly<br>
according to God's commandment.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<br>
<p>1 That as all must die,<br>
4 he exhorts them to live orderly and in unity.</p>
<br>
<p>
SEEING then all things have<br>
an end, there are these two<br>
indifferently set before us,<br>
death and life: and everyone<br>
shall depart unto his proper place.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For as there are two sorts of<br>
coins, the one of God, the other of<br>
the world, and each of these has<br>
its proper inscription engraven<br>
upon it; so also is it here.</p>
<br>
<p>3  The unbelievers are of this<br>
world; but the faithful, through<br>
charity have the character of God<br>
the Father by Jesus Christ:<br>
by whom if we are not readily<br>
disposed to die after the likeness<br>
of his passion, his life is not in us.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Forasmuch, therefore, as I<br>
have in the persons before mentioned,<br>
seen all of you in faith and charity;<br>
I exhort you that ye study to do all<br>
things in a divine concord:</p>
<br>
<p>5  Your bishop presiding in the<br>
place of God; your presbyters in<br>
the place of the council of the<br>
Apostles; and your deacons most<br>
dear to me, being entrusted with<br>
the ministry of Jesus Christ; who<br>
was the Father before all ages,<br>
and appeared in the end to us.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Wherefore taking the same<br>
holy course, see that ye all<br>
reverence one another, and let no<br>
one look upon his neighbour after<br>
the flesh; but do ye all mutually<br>
love each other in Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Let there be nothing that may<br>
be able to make a division among<br>
you; but be ye united to your<br>
bishop, and those who preside<br>
over you, to be your pattern and<br>
direction in the way to immortality.</p>
<br>
<p>8  As therefore the Lord did<br>
nothing without the Father, being<br>
united to him; neither by himself<br>
nor yet by his Apostles, so neither<br>
do ye do anything without your<br>
bishop and presbyters:</p>
<br>
<p>9  Neither endeavour to let<br>
anything appear rational to<br>
yourselves apart;</p>
<br>
<p>10  But being come together into<br>
the same place, have one common<br>
prayer; one supplication;<br>
one mind; one hope; one in charity,<br>
and in joy undefiled.</p>
<br>
<p>11  There is one Lord Jesus<br>
Christ, than whom nothing is better.<br>
Wherefore come ye all together, as<br>
unto one temple of God; as to one<br>
altar; as to one: Jesus Christ,<br>
who proceeded from one Father,<br>
and exists in one; and is<br>
returned to one.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 He cautions them against false opinions.<br>
     3 Especially those of Ebion and the Judaising Christians.</p>
<br>
<p>BE not deceived with strange<br>
doctrines; nor with old fables<br>
which are unprofitable.  For if<br>
westill continue to live according<br>
to the Jewish law, we do confess<br>
ourselves not to have received grace.<br>
For even the most holy prophets<br>
lived according to Christ Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And for this cause were they<br>
persecuted, being inspired by his<br>
grace to convince the unbelievers<br>
and disobedient that there is one<br>
God who has manifested himself<br>
by Jesus Christ his Son; who is<br>
his eternal word, not coming forth<br>
from silence; who in all things<br>
pleased him that sent him.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Wherefore if they who were<br>
brought up in these ancient laws,<br>
came nevertheless to the newness<br>
of hope; no longer observing<br>
sabbaths, but keeping the Lord's<br>
day in which also our life is<br>
sprung up by him, and through<br>
his death, whom yet some deny:</p>
<br>
<p>4 (By which mystery we have<br>
been brought to believe and<br>
therefore wait that we maybe<br>
found the disciples of Jesus<br>
Christ, our only master:)</p>
<br>
<p>5  How shall we be able to live<br>
different from him; whose disciples<br>
the very prophets themselves<br>
being, did by the spirit expect him<br>
as their master;</p>
<br>
<p>6  And therefore he whom they<br>
justly waited for, being come,<br>
raised, them up from the dead.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Let us not then be insensible<br>
of his goodness; for should he<br>
have dealt with us according to<br>
our works, we had not now had a<br>
being.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Wherefore being become his<br>
disciples, let us learn to live<br>
according to the rules of<br>
Christianity; for whosoever is<br>
called by any other name besides<br>
this, he is not of God.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Lay aside therefore the old and<br>
sour, and evil leaven; and be ye<br>
changed into the new leaven, which<br>
is Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Be ye salted in him, lest any<br>
one  among you should be corrupted;<br>
for by your Savior ye shall<br>
be judged.</p>
<br>
<p>11  It is absurd to name Jesus<br>
Christ, and to Judaize. For the<br>
christian religion did not embrace<br>
the Jewish, but the Jewish the<br>
christian; that so every tongue<br>
that believed might be gathered<br>
together unto God.</p>
<br>
<p>12  These things, my beloved, I<br>
write unto you; not that I know<br>
of any among you that lie under<br>
this error: but as one of the least<br>
among you, I am desirous to forewarn<br>
you, that ye fall not into the<br>
snares of false doctrine.</p>
<br>
<p>13  But that ye be fully instructed<br>
in the birth, and suffering, and<br>
resurrection of Jesus Christ,<br>
our hope; which was accomplished<br>
in the time of the government of<br>
Pontius Pilate, and that most truly<br>
and certainly: and from which God<br>
forbid that any among you should<br>
be turned aside.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Commends their faith and piety; exhorts them<br>
     to persevere;<br>
     10 desires their prayers for himself and the<br>
     church at Antioch.</p>
<br>
<p>MAY I therefore have joy of<br>
you in all things, if I shall<br>
be worthy of it. For though I am<br>
bound, yet am I not worthy to be<br>
compared to one of you that are at<br>
liberty.</p>
<br>
<p>2  I know that ye are not puffed<br>
up; for ye have Jesus Christ in<br>
your hearts.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And especially when I commend<br>
you, I know that ye are ashamed,<br>
as it is written,  The just man<br>
condemneth himself.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Study therefore to be confirmed<br>
in the doctrine of our Lord, and<br>
of his Apostles; that so whatever<br>
ye do, ye may prosper both in body<br>
and spirit, in faith and charity,<br>
in the Son, and in the Father,<br>
and in the Holy Spirit; in the<br>
beginning, and in the end:</p>
<br>
<p>5  Together with your most worthy<br>
bishop, and the well-wrought<br>
spiritual crown of your presbytery,<br>
and your deacons, which are<br>
according to God.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Be subject to your bishop, and<br>
to one another, as Jesus Christ<br>
was to the Father, according to the<br>
flesh; and the Apostles, both to<br>
Christ, and to the Father; and to<br>
the Holy Ghost: that so ye may<br>
be united both in body and spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Knowing you to be full of<br>
God, I have the more briefly<br>
exhorted you.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Be mindful of me in your<br>
prayers, that I may attain unto<br>
God, and of the church that is in<br>
Syria, from which I am not worthy<br>
to be called.</p>
<br>
<p>9  For I stand in need of your<br>
joint prayers in God, and of your<br>
charity, that the church which is<br>
in Syria may he thought worthy<br>
to be nourished by your church.</p>
<br>
<p>10  The Ephesians from Smyrna<br>
salute you, from which place I<br>
write unto you; (being present<br>
here to the glory of God, in like<br>
manner as you are,) who have in<br>
all things refreshed me, together<br>
with Polycarp, the bishop of the<br>
Smyrneans.</p>
<br>
<p>11  The rest of the churches in<br>
the honour of Jesus Christ salute<br>
you.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Farewell, and be ye strengthened<br>
in the concord of God; enjoying<br>
his inseparable spirit, which<br>
is Christ Jesus.</p>

                            THE EPISTLE OF<br>
                       IGNATIUS TO THE TRALLIANS.</h2></center>
<br><br><br>
<p>CHAPTER 1.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Acknowledges the coming of their bishop.<br>
     5 Commends them for their subjection to their bishop,<br>
     priests, and deacons; and exhorts them to continue in it:<br>
     15 is afraid even of his over-great desire to suffer,<br>
     lest it should be prejudicial to him.</p>
<br>
<p>IGNATTUS, who is also called<br>
Theophorus, to the holy church<br>
which is at Tralles in Asia:<br>
beloved of God, the Father of Jesus<br>
Christ; elect and worthy of God,<br>
having peace through the flesh and<br>
blood, and passion of Jesus Christ<br>
our hope; in the resurrection which<br>
is by him: which also I salute in<br>
its fullness, continuing in the<br>
apostolical character, wishing all<br>
joy and happiness unto it.</p>
<br>
<p>2  I have heard of your blameless<br>
and constant disposition through<br>
patience, which not only appears<br>
in your outward conversation, but<br>
is naturally rooted and grounded<br>
in you.</p>
<br>
<p>3  In like manner as Polybius<br>
your bishop has declared unto me,<br>
who came to me to Smyrna, by the<br>
will of God and Jesus Christ, and<br>
so rejoiced together with me in my<br>
bonds for Jesus Christ, that in<br>
effect I saw your whole church in<br>
him.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Having therefore received<br>
testimony of your good will towards<br>
me for God's sake, by him; I seemed<br>
to find you, as also I knew that ye<br>
were the followers of God.</p>
<br>
<p>5  For whereas ye are subject to<br>
your bishop as to Jesus Christ, ye<br>
appear to one to live not after the<br>
manner of men, but according to<br>
Jesus Christ who died for us,<br>
that so believing in his death,<br>
ye might escape death.</p>
<br>
<p>6  It is therefore necessary, that<br>
as ye do, so without your bishop<br>
you should do nothing: also be<br>
ye subject to your presbyters, as<br>
to the Apostles of Jesus Christ our<br>
hope; in whom if we walk, we<br>
shall be found in him.</p>
<br>
<p>7  The deacons also, as being<br>
the ministers of the mysteries of<br>
Jesus Christ, must by all means<br>
please ye. For they are not the<br>
ministers of meat and drink,<br>
but of the church of God. Wherefore<br>
they must avoid all offences,<br>
as they would do fire.</p>
<br>
<p>8  In like manner let us reverence<br>
the deacons as Jesus Christ;<br>
and the bishop as the Father; and<br>
the presbyters as the Sanctuary of<br>
God, and college of the Apostles.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Without these there is no<br>
church; concerning all which, I<br>
am persuaded that ye think after<br>
the very same manner; for I have<br>
received, and even now have with<br>
me, the pattern of your love, in<br>
your bishop.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Whose very look is instructive;<br>
and whose mildness powerful: whom<br>
I am persuaded, the very Atheists<br>
themselves cannot but reverence.</p>
<br>
<p>11  But because I have a love<br>
towards you, I will not write any<br>
more sharply unto you about this<br>
matter, though I very well might<br>
but now I have done so, lest being<br>
a condemned man, I should seem<br>
to prescribe to you as an Apostle.</p>
<br>
<p>12  I have great knowledge in<br>
God; but I refrain myself, lest<br>
I should perish in my boasting.</p>
<br>
<p>13  For now I ought the more<br>
to fear, and not to hearken to<br>
those that would puff me up.</p>
<br>
<p>14  For they that speak to me,<br>
in my praise, chasten me.</p>
<br>
<p>15  For I indeed desire to suffer,<br>
but I cannot tell whether I am<br>
worthy so to do.</p>
<br>
<p>16  And this desire, though to<br>
others it does not appear, yet to<br>
myself it is for that very reason<br>
the more violent. I have, therefore,<br>
need of moderation; by which the<br>
prince of this world is destroyed.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Am I not able to write to<br>
you of heavenly things?--But I<br>
fear lest I should harm you, who<br>
are yet but babes in Christ;<br>
(excuse me this care;) and lest<br>
perchance being not able to<br>
receive them, ye should be<br>
choken with them.</p>
<br>
<p>18  For even I myself, although<br>
I am in bonds, yet am not therefore<br>
able to understand heavenly things;</p>
<br>
<p>19  As the assembly of angels,<br>
and the several companies of them,<br>
under their respective princes;<br>
things visible and invisible: but<br>
in these I am yet a learner.</p>
<br>
<p>20  For many things are wanting to<br>
us, that we come not short of God.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAP. II.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Warns them against heretics,<br>
     4 exhorts them to humility and unity,<br>
     10 and briefly sets before them the true<br>
     doctrine concerning Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>EXHORT you therefore, or<br>
rather not I, but the love of<br>
Jesus Christ; that ye use none but<br>
christian nourishment; abstaining<br>
from pasture which is of another<br>
kind, I mean heresy.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For they that are heretics,<br>
confound together the doctrine of<br>
Jesus Christ, with their own poison:<br>
whilst they seem worthy of belief:</p>
<br>
<p>3  As men give a deadly potion<br>
mixed with sweet wine; which he<br>
who drinks of, does with the<br>
treacherous pleasure sweetly<br>
drink in his own death.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Wherefore guard yourself<br>
against such persons; and that<br>
you will do, if you are not puffed<br>
up; but continue inseparable from<br>
Jesus Christ our God, and from<br>
your bishop, and from the<br>
commands of the Apostles.</p>
<br>
<p>5  He that is within the altar,<br>
is pure; but he that is without,<br>
namely, does anything without the<br>
bishop, the presbyters, and deacons,<br>
is not pure in his conscience.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Not that I know there is any<br>
thing of this nature among you;<br>
but I fore-arm you, as being<br>
greatly beloved by me, foreseeing<br>
the snares of the devil.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Wherefore putting on meekness,<br>
renew yourselves in faith,<br>
which is the flesh of the Lord;<br>
and in charity, which is the blood<br>
of Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Let no man have any grudge<br>
against his neighbour. Give no<br>
occasion to the Gentiles; lest by<br>
means of a few foolish men, the<br>
whole congregation of God be<br>
evil spoken of.</p>
<br>
<p>9  For woe to that man through<br>
whose vanity my name is<br>
blasphemed by any.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Stop your ears therefore,<br>
as often as any one shall speak<br>
contrary to Jesus Christ, who was<br>
of the race of David; by the Virgin<br>
Mary.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Who was truly born, and<br>
did eat and drink; was truly<br>
persecuted under Pontius Pilate;<br>
was truly crucified and dead; both<br>
those in heaven and on earth, and<br>
under the earth, being spectators<br>
of it:</p>
<br>
<p>12  Who, was also truly raised<br>
from the dead by his Father, after<br>
the same manner as HE will also<br>
raise up us who believe in him by<br>
Christ Jesus; without whom we<br>
have no true life.</p>
<br>
<p>13  But if, as some who are<br>
Atheists, that is to say infidels,<br>
pretend, that he seemed to suffer,<br>
(they themselves only seeming to<br>
exist) why then am I bound?--<br>
Why do I desire to fight with<br>
beasts?--Therefore do I die in<br>
vain: therefore I will not speak<br>
falsely against the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Flee therefore these evil<br>
sprouts which bring forth deadly<br>
fruit; of which if any one taste,<br>
he shall presently die.</p>
<br>
<p>15  For these are not the plants<br>
of the Father; seeing if they were,<br>
they would appear to be the<br>
branches of the cross, and their<br>
fruit would be incorruptible; by<br>
which he invites you through his<br>
passion, who are members of him.</p>
<br>
<p>16  For the head cannot be without<br>
its members, God having promised<br>
a union with himself.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAP. III.</p>
<br>
<p>     He again exhorts to unity, and desires their<br>
     prayers for himself, and for his church at Antioch.</p>
<br>
<p>I SALUTE you from Smyrna,<br>
together with the churches of<br>
God that are present with me;<br>
who have refreshed me in all<br>
things, both in the flesh and<br>
in the spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>2 My bonds, which I carry about<br>
me for the sake of Christ,<br>
(beseeching him that I may<br>
attain unto God) exhort you that<br>
you continue in concord among<br>
yourselves, and in prayer with<br>
one another.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For it becomes everyone of<br>
you, especially the presbyters, to<br>
refresh the bishop, to the honour<br>
of the Father of Jesus Christ, and<br>
of the Apostles.</p>
<br>
<p>4  I beseech you, that you hearken<br>
to me in love; that I may not by<br>
those things which I write, rise up<br>
in witness against you.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Pray also for me; who,<br>
through the mercy of God, stand<br>
in need of your prayers, that I<br>
may be worthy of the portion which<br>
I am about to obtain, and that I<br>
be not found a reprobate.</p>
<br>
<p>6  The love of those who are at<br>
Smyrna and Ephesus salute you.<br>
Remember in your prayers the<br>
church of Syria, from which I am<br>
not worthy to be called, being one<br>
of the least of it.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Fare ye well in Jesus Christ;<br>
being subject to your bishop as to<br>
the command of God; and so like.<br>
wise to the presbytery.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Love every one his brother<br>
with an unfeigned heart.  My soul<br>
be your expiation, not only now,<br>
but when I shall have attained<br>
unto God; for I am yet under<br>
danger.</p>
<br>
<p>9  But the Father is faithful in<br>
Jesus Christ, to fulfil both mine<br>
and your petition; in whom may<br>
ye be found unblamable.</p>

<h2>                             THE EPISTLE OF<br>
                        IGNATIUS TO THE ROMANS.</h2></center>
<br><br><br>
<p>
CHAPTER I.</p>
<br>
<p>     Ignatius testifies his desire to see, and his<br>
     hopes of suffering for Christ<br>
     5 which he earnestly entreats them not to prevent,<br>
     10 but to pray for him, that God would strengthen<br>
     him to the combat.</p>
<br>
<p>
IGNATIUS, who is also called<br>
Theophorus, to the church<br>
which has obtained mercy from<br>
the majesty of the Most High<br>
Father, and his only begotten<br>
Son Jesus Christ; beloved, and<br>
illuminated through the will of him<br>
who willeth all things which are<br>
according to the love of Jesus<br>
Christ our God; which also presides<br>
in the place of the region<br>
of the Romans; and which I salute<br>
in the name of Jesus Christ, as<br>
being united both in flesh and<br>
spirit to all his commands, and<br>
filed with the grace of God; with<br>
all joy in Jesus Christ our God.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Forasmuch as I have at last<br>
obtained through my prayers to<br>
God, permission to see your faces,<br>
which I much desired to do; being<br>
bound in Jesus Christ, I hope ere<br>
long to salute you, if it shall be<br>
the will of God to grant me to<br>
attain unto the end I long for.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For the beginning is well<br>
disposed, if I shall but have grace,<br>
without hindrance, to receive what<br>
is appointed for me.</p>
<br>
<p>4  But I fear your love, lest it<br>
do me an injury; for it is easy for<br>
you to do what you please; but it<br>
will be hard for me to attain unto<br>
God, if you spare me.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But I would not that ye<br>
should please men, but God; whom<br>
also ye do, please. For neither<br>
shall I hereafter have such an<br>
opportunity of going unto God; nor<br>
will you, if ye shall now be silent,<br>
ever be entitled to a better work.<br>
For if you, shall be silent in my<br>
behalf, I shall be made partaker of<br>
God.</p>
<br>
<p>6  But if you shall love my body,<br>
I shall have my course again to<br>
run. Wherefore ye cannot do me<br>
a greater kindness, than to suffer<br>
me to be sacrificed unto God, now<br>
that the altar is already prepared:</p>
<br>
<p>7  That when ye shall be gathered<br>
together in love, ye nay give<br>
thanks to the Father through<br>
Christ Jesus, that he has<br>
vouchsafed to bring a bishop<br>
of Syria unto you, being called<br>
from the east unto the west.</p>
<br>
<p>8  For it is good for me to turn<br>
from the world, unto God; that I<br>
may rise again unto him.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Ye have never envied any one;<br>
ye have taught others. I would<br>
therefore that ye should now do<br>
those things yourselves, which<br>
in your instructions you have<br>
prescribed to others.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Only pray for me, that God<br>
would give me both inward and<br>
outward strength, that I may not<br>
only say, but will; nor be only<br>
called a christian, but be found<br>
one.</p>
<br>
<p>11  For if I shall be found a<br>
christian, I may then deservedly<br>
be called one; and be thought<br>
faithful, when I shall no longer<br>
appear to the world.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Nothing is good, that is<br>
seen.</p>
<br>
<p>13  For even our God, Jesus<br>
Christ, now that he is in the<br>
Father, does so much the more<br>
appear.</p>
<br>
<p>14  A christian is not a work of<br>
opinion; but of greatness of mind,<br>
especially when he is hated by the<br>
world.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER. II.</p>
<br>
<p>     Expresses his great desire and determination<br>
     to suffer martyrdom.</p>
<br>
<p>I WRITE to the churches, and<br>
signify to them all, that I am<br>
willing to die for God, unless you<br>
hinder me.</p>
<br>
<p>2  I beseech you that you show<br>
not an unseasonable good will<br>
towards me. Suffer me to be food<br>
to the wild beasts, by whom I shall<br>
attain unto God.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For I am the wheat of God,<br>
and I shall be ground by the teeth<br>
of the wild-beasts, that I may be<br>
found the pure bread of Christ.<br>
Rather encourage the beasts,<br>
that they may became my sepulchre,<br>
and may let live nothing of my<br>
body; that being dead I may not<br>
be troublesome to any.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Then shall I be truly the<br>
disciple of Jesus Christ, when the<br>
world shall not see so much as my<br>
body. Pray therefore unto Christ<br>
for me, that by these instruments<br>
I may be made the sacrifice of<br>
God.</p>
<br>
<p>6  I do not, as Peter and Paul,<br>
command you. They were Apostles,<br>
I a condemned man; they were free,<br>
but I am even to this day a servant:</p>
<br>
<p>7  But if I shall suffer, I shall<br>
then become the freeman of Jesus<br>
Christ, and shall rise free. And<br>
now, being in bonds, I learn not<br>
to desire any thing.</p>
<br>
<p>8  From Syria even unto Rome,<br>
I fight with beasts both by sea and<br>
land; both night and day: being<br>
bound to ten leopards, that is to<br>
say, to such a band of soldiers,<br>
who, though treated with all manner<br>
of kindness, are the worse for<br>
it.</p>
<br>
<p>9  But I am the more instructed<br>
by their injuries; yet am I not<br>
therefore justified.</p>
<br>
<p>10  May I enjoy the wild beasts<br>
that are prepared for me; which<br>
also I wish may exercise all their<br>
fierceness upon me.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And whom for that end I will<br>
encourage, that they may be sure<br>
to devour me, and not serve me as<br>
they have done some, whom out of<br>
fear they have not touched. But<br>
if they will not do it willingly,<br>
I will provoke them to it.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Pardon me in this matter; I<br>
know what is profitable for me,<br>
now I begin to be a disciple.<br>
Not shall any thing move me<br>
whether visible or invisible,<br>
that I may attain to Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Let fire and the cross; let<br>
the companies of wild beasts;<br>
let breakings of bones, and tearing<br>
of members; let the shattering in<br>
pieces of the whole body, and all<br>
the wicked torments of the devil<br>
come upon me; only let me enjoy<br>
Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>14  All the ends of the world,<br>
and the kingdoms of it, will profit<br>
me nothing: I would rather die<br>
for Jesus Christ, than rule to the<br>
utmost ends of the earth. Him<br>
I seek who died for us; him I<br>
desire who rose again for us.<br>
This is the gain that is laid up<br>
for me.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Pardon me, my brethren, ye<br>
shall not hinder me from living;<br>
nor seeing I desire to go to God,<br>
may you separate me from him,<br>
for the sake of this world;--nor<br>
induce me by any of the desires of<br>
it. Suffer me to enter into pure<br>
light, where being come, I shall<br>
be indeed the servant of God.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Permit me to imitate the<br>
passion of my God. If any one has<br>
God within himself, let him consider<br>
what I desire; and let him have<br>
compassion on me, as knowing how<br>
I am straightened.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<br>
<p>     Further expresses his desire to suffer.</p>
<br>
<p>THE prince of this world would<br>
fain carry me away, and corrupt<br>
my resolution towards my God.<br>
Let none of you therefore help<br>
him; rather do ye join with me,<br>
that is, with God.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Do not speak with Jesus<br>
Christ, and yet covet the world.<br>
Let not any envy dwell with you;<br>
no, not though I myself, when I<br>
shall be come unto you, should<br>
exhort you to it, yet do not ye<br>
hearken to me; but rather believe<br>
what I now write to you.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For though I am alive at the<br>
writing of this, yet my desire is<br>
to die. My love is crucified; and<br>
the fire that is within me does<br>
not desire any water; but being<br>
alive and springing within me,<br>
says, Come to the Father.</p>
<br>
<p>4  I take no pleasure in the food<br>
of corruption, nor in the pleasures<br>
of this life.</p>
<br>
<p>5  I desire the bread of God<br>
which is the flesh of Jesus Christ,<br>
of the seed of David; and the<br>
drink that I long for is his blood,<br>
which is incorruptible love.</p>
<br>
<p>6  I have no desire to live any<br>
longer after the manner of men;<br>
neither shall I, if you consent.<br>
Be ye therefore willing, that ye<br>
yourselves also maybe pleasing to<br>
God. I exhort you in a few words;<br>
I pray you believe me.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Jesus Christ will shew you<br>
that I speak truly. My mouth is<br>
without deceit, and the Father<br>
hath truly spoken by it. Pray<br>
therefore for me, that I may<br>
accomplish what I desire.</p>
<br>
<p>8  I have not written to you after<br>
the flesh, but according to the will<br>
of God. If I shall suffer, ye have<br>
loved me: but if I shall be rejected,<br>
ye have hated me.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Remember in your prayers<br>
the church of Syria, which now<br>
enjoys God for its shepherd instead<br>
of me. Let Jesus Christ only  oversee<br>
it, and your charity.</p>
<br>
<p>10  But I am even ashamed to<br>
be reckoned as one of them; for<br>
neither am I worthy, being the<br>
least among them, and as one<br>
born out of due season. But<br>
through mercy I have risen to<br>
be somebody, if I shall get unto<br>
God.</p>
<br>
<p>11  My spirit salutes you; and<br>
the charity of the churches that<br>
have received me in the name of<br>
Jesus Christ; not as a passenger,<br>
for even they that were not near<br>
to me in the way, have gone before<br>
me to the next city to meet me.</p>
<br>
<p>12  These things I write to you<br>
from Smyrna, by the most worthy<br>
of the church of Ephesus.</p>
<br>
<p>13  There is now with me, together<br>
with many others, Crocus, most<br>
beloved of me. As for those which<br>
are come from Syria, and are gone<br>
before me to Rome, to the glory<br>
of God, I suppose you are not<br>
ignorant of them.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Ye shall therefore signify to<br>
them that I draw near, for they,<br>
are all worthy both of God and of<br>
you: Whom it is fit that you<br>
refresh in all things.</p>
<br>
<p>15  This have I written to you,<br>
the day before the ninth of the,<br>
calends of September. Be strong<br>
unto the end, in the patience of<br>
Jesus Christ.</p>

<h2>
                     IGNATIUS TO THE PHILADELPHIANS.</h2></center>
<br><br><br>
<p>
CHAPTER I.</p>
<br>
<p>     Commends their bishop, whom they had sent unto him,<br>
     warns them against division and schism.</p>
<br>
<p>IGNATIUS, who is also called<br>
Theophorus, to the church of<br>
God the Father, and our Lord<br>
Jesus Christ, which is at Philadelphia<br>
in Asia; which has obtained mercy,<br>
being fixed in the concord of God,<br>
and rejoicing evermore in the passion<br>
of our Lord, and being fulfilled in<br>
all mercy through his resurrection:<br>
Which also I salute in the blood of<br>
Jesus Christ, which is our eternal<br>
and undefiled joy; especially if<br>
they are at unity with the bishop,<br>
and presbyters who are with him,<br>
and the deacons appointed according<br>
to the mind of Jesus Christ; whom<br>
he has settled according to his own<br>
will in all firmness by his Holy<br>
Spirit:</p>
<br>
<p>2  Which bishop I know obtained<br>
that great ministry among you,<br>
not of himself, neither by men,<br>
nor out of vain glory; but by the<br>
love of God the Father, and our<br>
Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Whose moderation I admire;<br>
who by his silence is able to do<br>
more than others with all their<br>
vain talk. For he is fitted to the<br>
commands, as the harp to its strings.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Wherefore my soul esteems<br>
his mind towards God most happy,<br>
knowing it to be fruitful in all<br>
virtue, and perfect; full of<br>
constancy, free from passion,<br>
and according to all the<br>
moderation of the living God.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Wherefore as becomes the<br>
children both of the light and of<br>
truth; flee divisions and false<br>
doctrines; but where your shepherd<br>
is, there do ye, as sheep, follow<br>
after.</p>
<br>
<p>6  For there are many wolves<br>
who seem worthy of belief, that<br>
with a false pleasure lead captive<br>
those that run in the course of<br>
God; but in the concord they shall<br>
find no place.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Abstain therefore from those<br>
evil herbs which Jesus Christ does<br>
not dress: because such are not<br>
the plantation of the Father. Not<br>
that I have found any division<br>
among you, but rather all manner<br>
of purity.</p>
<br>
<p>8  For as many as are of God,<br>
and of Jesus Christ, are also with<br>
their bishop. And as many as<br>
shall with repentance return into<br>
the unity of the church, even these<br>
shall also be the servants of God,<br>
that they may live according to<br>
Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Be not deceived brethren;<br>
if any one follows him that makes<br>
a schism in the church, he shall<br>
not inherit the kingdom of God.<br>
If any one walks after any other<br>
opinion, he agrees not with the<br>
passion of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Wherefore let it be your<br>
endeavour to partake all of the<br>
same holy eucharist.</p>
<br>
<p>11  For there is but one flesh of<br>
our Lord Jesus Christ; one cup<br>
in the unity of his blood; and one<br>
altar;</p>
<br>
<p>12  As also there is one bishop,<br>
together with his presbytery, and<br>
the deacons my fellow servants<br>
that so whatsoever ye do, ye may<br>
do it according to the will of God.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<br>
<p>Desires their prayers, and to be<br>
united, but not to Judaize.</p>
<br>
<p>MY brethren, the love I have<br>
towards you makes me the<br>
more large; and having a great<br>
joy in you, I endeavour to secure<br>
you against danger; or rather not<br>
I, but Jesus Christ; in whom<br>
being bound, I the more fear,<br>
as being yet only on the way<br>
to suffering.</p>
<br>
<p>2  But your prayer to God shall<br>
make me perfect, that I may attain<br>
to that portion, which by God's<br>
mercy is allotted to me Fleeing<br>
to the Gospel as to the flesh of<br>
Christ; and to the Apostles as<br>
to the presbytery of the church.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Let us also love the prophets,<br>
forasmuch as they have led us<br>
to the Gospel, and to hope in<br>
Christ, and to expect him.</p>
<br>
<p>4  In whom also believing they<br>
were saved in the unity of Jesus<br>
Christ; being holy men, worthy<br>
to be loved, and had in wonder;</p>
<br>
<p>5  Who have received testimony<br>
from Jesus Christ, and are<br>
numbered in the Gospel of our<br>
common hope.</p>
<br>
<p>6  But if any one shall preach<br>
the Jewish law unto you, hearken<br>
not unto him; for it is better to<br>
receive the doctrine of Christ from<br>
one that has been circumcised, than<br>
Judaism from one that has not.</p>
<br>
<p>7  But if either the one, or other,<br>
do not speak concerning Christ<br>
Jesus; they seem to me to be but<br>
as monuments and sepulchres of<br>
the dead, upon which are written<br>
only the names of men.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Flee therefore the wicked arts<br>
and snares of the prince of this<br>
world; lest at any time being<br>
oppressed by his cunning, ye grow<br>
cold in your charity. But come<br>
altogether into the same place,<br>
with an undivided heart.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And I bless my God that I<br>
have a good conscience towards<br>
you, and that no one among you<br>
has whereof to boast either openly<br>
or privately, that I have been<br>
burthensome to him in much or<br>
little.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And I wish to all, among<br>
whom I have conversed, that<br>
may not turn to a witness again<br>
them.</p>
<br>
<p>11  For although some would<br>
have deceived me according to<br>
the flesh, yet the spirit, being<br>
from God, is not deceived: for it<br>
knows, both whence it comes and<br>
whither it goes, and reproves the<br>
secrets of the heart.</p>
<br>
<p>12  I cried whilst I was among<br>
you; I spake with a loud voice:<br>
attend to the bishop, and to the<br>
presbytery, and to the deacons.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Now some supposed that I spake<br>
this as foreseeing the division<br>
that should come among you.</p>
<br>
<p>14  But he is my witness for<br>
whose sake I am in bonds that<br>
I know nothing from any man.<br>
But the spirit spake, saying<br>
on this wise: Do nothing without<br>
the bishop:</p>
<br>
<p>15  Keep your bodies as the<br>
temples of God: Love unity;<br>
Flee divisions; Be the followers<br>
of Christ, as he was of his Father.</p>
<br>
<p>16  I therefore did as became<br>
me, as a man composed to unity<br>
for where there is division,<br>
and wrath, God dwelleth not.</p>
<br>
<p>17  But the Lord forgives all<br>
that repent, if they return to the<br>
unity of God, and to the council<br>
of the bishop.</p>
<br>
<p>18  For I trust in the grace<br>
Jesus Christ that he will free<br>
you from every bond.</p>
<br>
<p>19 Nevertheless I exhort you<br>
that you do nothing out of strife<br>
but according to the instruction<br>
of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>20 Because I have heard<br>
some who say; unless I find<br>
written in the originals, I will<br>
not believe it to be written in<br>
the Gospel. And when I said,<br>
It is written; they answered<br>
from what lay before them in the<br>
corrupted copies.</p>
<br>
<p>21  But to me Jesus Christ<br>
instead of all the uncorrupted<br>
monuments in the world; together<br>
with those undefiled monuments,<br>
his cross, and death, and<br>
resurrection, and the faith<br>
which is by him; by which I<br>
desire, through your prayers,<br>
to be justified.</p>
<br>
<p>22  The priests indeed are<br>
good; but much better is the High<br>
Priest to whom the Holy of Holies<br>
has been committed; and who<br>
alone has been intrusted with the<br>
secrets of God.</p>
<br>
<p>23  He is the door of the Father;<br>
by which Abraham, and Isaac,<br>
and Jacob, and all the prophets,<br>
enter in; as well as the Apostles,<br>
and the church.</p>
<br>
<p>24  And all these things tend to<br>
the unity which is of God. Howbeit<br>
the Gospel has somewhat in it far<br>
above all other dispensations;<br>
namely, the appearance of our<br>
Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
his passion and resurrection.</p>
<br>
<p>25  For the beloved prophets<br>
referred to him; but the Gospel<br>
is the perfection of incorruption.<br>
All therefore together are good,<br>
if ye believe with charity.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<br>
<p>     Informs them he had heard that the persecution<br>
     was stopped at Antioch: and directs them to send<br>
     a messenger thither to congratulate with the church.</p>
<br>
<p>NOW as concerning the church<br>
of Antioch which is in Syria,<br>
seeing I am told that through<br>
your prayers and the bowels which<br>
ye have towards it in Jesus Christ,<br>
it is in peace; it will become you,<br>
as the church of God, to ordain<br>
some I deacon to go to them thither<br>
as the ambassador of God; that<br>
he may rejoice with them when<br>
they meet together, and glorify<br>
God's name.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Blessed be that man in Jesus,<br>
Christ, who shall be found worthy<br>
of such a ministry; and ye yourselves<br>
also shall be glorified.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Now if you be willing, it is<br>
not impossible for you to do this<br>
for the grace of God; as also the<br>
other neighbouring churches have<br>
sent them some bishops, some<br>
priests and some deacons.</p>
<br>
<p>4  As concerning Philo the deacon<br>
of Cilicia, a most worthy  man,<br>
he still ministers unto me in the<br>
word of God: together with Rheus<br>
of Agathopolis a singular good<br>
person, who has followed me even<br>
from Syria, not regarding his life:<br>
These also bear witness unto you.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And I myself give thanks to<br>
God for you, that you receive them<br>
as the Lord shall receive you.<br>
But for those that dishonoured<br>
them, may they be forgiven<br>
through the grace of Jesus Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>6  The charity of the brethren<br>
that are at Troas salutes you:<br>
from whence also I now write<br>
by Burrhurs, who was sent together<br>
with me by those of Ephesus and<br>
Smyrna, for respect sake.</p>
<br>
<p>7  May our Lord Jesus Christ<br>
honour them; in whom they hope,<br>
both in flesh, and soul, and spirit;<br>
in faith, in love, in unity.<br>
Fare-well in Christ Jesus our<br>
common hope.</p>

<h2>
                        IGNATIUS TO THE SMYRNEANS.</h2></center>
<br><br><br>
<p>CHAPTER I.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Declares his joy for their firmness in the Gospel.<br>
     4 Enlarges on the person of Christ, against such<br>
     as pretend that Christ did not suffer.</p>
<br>
<p>IGNATIUS, who is also called<br>
Theohorus, to the church of<br>
God the Father, and of the beloved<br>
Jesus Christ, which God hath<br>
mercifully blessed with every<br>
good gift; being filled with faith<br>
and charity, so that it is wanting<br>
in no gift; most worthy of God,<br>
and fruitful in saints; the church<br>
which is at Smyrna in Asia; all<br>
through his immaculate spirit,<br>
through word of God.</p>
<br>
<p>2  I glorify God, even Jesus<br>
Christ, who has given you such<br>
wisdom.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For I have observed that you<br>
are settled in an immoveable faith,<br>
as if you were nailed to the cross<br>
of our Lord Jesus Christ, both in<br>
the flesh and in the spirit; and<br>
are confirmed in love through the<br>
blood of Christ; being fully<br>
persuaded of those things which<br>
relate unto our Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Who truly was of the race<br>
of David according to the flesh,<br>
but the Son of God according to<br>
the will and power of God;<br>
truly born of the Virgin, and<br>
baptised of John; that so all<br>
righteousness might be fulfilled<br>
by him.</p>
<br>
<p>5  He was also truly crucified<br>
by Pontius Pilate, and Herod the<br>
Tetrarch, being nailed for us in<br>
the flesh; by the fruits of which<br>
we are, even by his most blessed<br>
Passion;</p>
<br>
<p>6  That he might set up a token<br>
for all ages through his resurrection,<br>
to all his holy and faithful servants,<br>
whether they be Jews or Gentiles,<br>
in one body of his church.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Now all these things he suffered<br>
for us that we might be saved; and<br>
he suffered truly, as he also truly<br>
raised up himself; and not, as some<br>
unbelievers say, that he only seemed<br>
to suffer; they themselves 'only<br>
seeming to be.'</p>
<br>
<p>8  And as they believe so shall it<br>
happen unto them, when being divested<br>
of the body they shall become mere<br>
spirits.</p>
<br>
<p>9  But I know that even after his<br>
resurrection he was in the flesh;<br>
and I believe that he is still so.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And when he came to those<br>
who were with Peter, he said<br>
unto them, Take, handle me, and<br>
see that I am not an incorporeal<br>
daemon. And straightway they<br>
felt and believed; being convinced<br>
both by his flesh and spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>11  For this cause they despised<br>
death, and were bound to be above<br>
it.</p>
<br>
<p>12  But after his resurrection he<br>
did eat and drink with them, as he<br>
was flesh; although as to his<br>
Spirit he was united to the Father.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Exhorts them against heretics.<br>
     8 The danger of their doctrine.</p>
<br>
<p>NOW these things, beloved, I put<br>
you in mind of, not questioning<br>
but that you yourselves also<br>
believe that they are so.</p>
<br>
<p>2  But I arm you before-hand<br>
against certain beasts in the shape<br>
of men, whom you must not only<br>
not receive, but if it be possible<br>
must not meet with.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Only you must pray for them,<br>
that if it be the will of God they<br>
may repent; which yet will be<br>
very hard. But of this our Lord<br>
Jesus Christ has the power, who<br>
is our true life.</p>
<br>
<p>4  For if all these things were<br>
done only in show by our Lord,<br>
then do I also seem only to be<br>
bound:</p>
<br>
<p>5  And why have I given up myself<br>
to death, to the fire, to the<br>
sword, to wild beasts?</p>
<br>
<p>6  But now the nearer I am to<br>
the sword, the nearer I am to<br>
God: when I shall come among<br>
the wild beasts, I shall come to<br>
God.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Only in the name of Jesus<br>
Christ, I undergo all, to suffer<br>
together with him; he who was<br>
made a perfect man strengthening,<br>
me.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Whom some not knowing, do<br>
deny; or rather have been denied<br>
by him, being the advocates of<br>
death, rather than of the truth.<br>
Whom neither the prophecies, nor<br>
the law of Moses have persuaded;<br>
nor the Gospel itself, even to this<br>
day; nor the sufferings of every<br>
one of us.</p>
<br>
<p>9  For they think also the same<br>
things of us. For what does a<br>
man profit me, if he shall praise<br>
me, and blaspheme my Lord; not<br>
confessing that he was truly made<br>
man?</p>
<br>
<p>10  Now he that doth not say<br>
this, does in effect deny him,<br>
and is in death. But for the names<br>
of such as do this, they being<br>
unbelievers, I thought it not<br>
fitting to write them unto you.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Yea, God forbid that I should<br>
make any mention of them, till<br>
they shall repent to a true belief<br>
of Christ's passion, which is our<br>
resurrection.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Let no man deceive himself;<br>
both the things which are in heaven,<br>
and the glorious angels, and princes,<br>
whether visible or invisible, if they<br>
believe not in the blood of Christ,<br>
it shall be to them, unto condemnation.</p>
<br>
<p>13  He that is able to receive<br>
this, let him receive it. Let no<br>
man's place or state in the world<br>
puff him up: that which is worth<br>
all his faith and charity, to it<br>
nothing is to be preferred.</p>
<br>
<p>14  But consider those who are<br>
of a different opinion from us,<br>
as to what concerns the grace of<br>
Jesus Christ which is come unto us,<br>
how contrary they are to the<br>
design of God.</p>
<br>
<p>15  They have no regard to charity,<br>
no care of the widow, the fatherless,<br>
and the oppressed; of the bond or<br>
free, of the hungry or thirsty.</p>
<br>
<p>16  They abstain from the eucharist,<br>
and from the public offices;<br>
because they confess not the eucharist<br>
to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus<br>
Christ which suffered for our sins,<br>
and which the Father of his goodness<br>
raised again from the dead.</p>
<br>
<p>17  And for this cause contradicting<br>
the gift of God, they die in their<br>
disputes; but much better would it<br>
be for them to receive it, that they<br>
might one day rise through it.</p>
<br>
<p>18  It will therefore become you.<br>
to abstain from such persons, and<br>
not to speak with them, neither in<br>
public nor in private.</p>
<br>
<p>19  But to hearken to the prophets,<br>
and especially to the Gospel, in<br>
which both Christ's passion is<br>
manifested unto us, and his<br>
resurrection perfectly declared.</p>
<br>
<p>20  But flee all divisions, as the<br>
beginning of evils.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Exhorts them to follow their bishop and pastors;<br>
     but especially their bishop.<br>
     6 Thanks them for their kindness,<br>
     11 and acquaints them with the ceasing of the<br>
      persecution at Antioch.</p>
<br>
<p>SEE that ye all follow your<br>
bishop, as Jesus Christ, the<br>
Father; and the presbytery, as<br>
the Apostles; and reverence the<br>
deacons, as the command of God.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Let no man do any thing<br>
of what belongs to the church<br>
separately from the bishop.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Let that eucharist be looked<br>
upon as well established, which is<br>
either offered by the bishop, or by<br>
him to whom the bishop has given.<br>
his consent.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Wheresoever the bishop shall<br>
appear, there let the people also<br>
be: as where Jesus Christ is, there<br>
is the Catholic church.</p>
<br>
<p>5  It is not lawful without the<br>
bishop; neither to baptize, nor to<br>
celebrate the Holy Communion<br>
but whatsoever he shall approve<br>
of, that is also pleasing unto God;<br>
that so whatever is done, may be<br>
sure and well done.</p>
<br>
<p>6  For what remains, it is very<br>
reasonable that we should repent<br>
whilst there is yet time to return<br>
unto God.</p>
<br>
<p>7  It is a good thin to have a<br>
due regard both to God, and to<br>
the bishop: he that honours the<br>
bishop, shall be honoured of God;<br>
but he that does any thing without<br>
his knowledge, ministers unto the<br>
devil.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Let all things therefore abound<br>
to you in charity; seeing that ye<br>
are worthy.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Ye have refreshed me in all<br>
things; so shall Jesus Christ you.<br>
Ye have loved me both when I was<br>
present with you, and now being<br>
absent, ye cease not to do so.</p>
<br>
<p>10  May God be your reward,<br>
for whom whilst ye undergo all<br>
things, ye shall attain unto<br>
him.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Ye have done well in that ye<br>
have received Philo, and Rheus<br>
Agathopus, who followed me for<br>
the word of God, as the deacons<br>
of Christ our God.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Who also gave thanks unto<br>
the Lord for you, forasmuch as ye<br>
have refreshed them in all things.<br>
Nor shall any thing that you have<br>
done be lost to you.</p>
<br>
<p>13  My soul be for yours, and<br>
my bonds which ye have not despised,<br>
nor been ashamed of. Wherefore<br>
neither shall. Jesus Christ,<br>
our perfect faith, be ashamed<br>
of you.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Your prayer is come to the<br>
church of Antioch, which is in<br>
Syria. From whence being sent<br>
bound with chains becoming God.<br>
I salute the churches; being not<br>
worthy to be called from thence,<br>
as being the least among them.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Nevertheless by the will of<br>
God I have been thought worthy<br>
of this honour; not for that I<br>
think I have deserved it, but by<br>
the grace of God;</p>
<br>
<p>16  Which I wish may be perfectly<br>
given unto me, that through your<br>
prayers I may attain unto God.</p>
<br>
<p>17  And therefore, that your<br>
work may be fully accomplished,<br>
both upon earth and in heaven;<br>
it will be fitting, and for the<br>
honour of God, that your church<br>
appoint some worthy deldgate,<br>
who being come as far as Syria,<br>
may rejoice together with them<br>
that they are in peace; and that<br>
they are again restored to their<br>
former state, and have again<br>
received their proper body.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Wherefore I should think it<br>
a worthy action, to send some<br>
one from you with an epistle,<br>
to congratulate with them their<br>
peace in God; and that through<br>
your prayers, they have now<br>
gotten to their harbour.</p>
<br>
<p>19  For inasmuch as ye are perfect<br>
yourselves, you ought to think<br>
those things that are perfect. For<br>
when you are desirous to do well,<br>
God is ready to enable you there.<br>
unto.</p>
<br>
<p>20  The love of the brethren that<br>
are at Troas salute you; from whence<br>
I write to you by Burrhus whom ye<br>
sent with me, together with the<br>
Ephesians, your brethren; and who<br>
has in all Things refreshed me.</p>
<br>
<p>21  And I would to God that all<br>
would imitate him, as being a pattern<br>
of the ministry of God. May his grace<br>
fully reward him.</p>
<br>
<p>22  I salute your very worthy<br>
bishop, and your venerable presbytery;<br>
and your deacons, my fellow-servants;<br>
and all of you in general, and every<br>
one in particular, in the name of<br>
Jesus Christ, and in his flesh and<br>
blood; in his passion and resurrection<br>
both fleshly and spiritually; and in<br>
the unity of God with you.</p>
<br>
<p>23  Grace be with you, and mercy,<br>
and peace, and patience, for evermore.</p>
<br>
<p>24  I salute the families of my<br>
brethren, with their wives and<br>
children; and the virgins that are<br>
called widows. Be strong in the<br>
power of the Holy Ghost. Philo,<br>
who is present with me salutes<br>
you.</p>
<br>
<p>25  I salute the house of Tavias,<br>
and pray that it may be strengthened<br>
in faith and charity, both of flesh<br>
and spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>26  I salute Alce my well-beloved,<br>
together with the incomparable<br>
Daphnus, and Eutechnus, and all<br>
by name.</p>
<br>
<p>27 Farewell in the grace of God.</p>

<h2>
                           IGNATIUS TO POLYCARP</h2></center>
<br><br><br>
<p>CHAPTER I.</p>
<br>
<p>Ignatius blesses God for the firm,<br>
establishment of Polycarp in the<br>
faith, and gives him particular<br>
directions for improving it.</p>
<br>
<p>IGNATIUS, who is also called<br>
Theophorus, to Polycarp, bishop<br>
of the church which is at Smyrna;<br>
their overseer, but rather himself<br>
overlooked by God the Father,<br>
and the Lord Jesus Christ;<br>
all happiness.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Having known that thy mind<br>
towards God, is fixed as it were<br>
upon an immoveable rock;<br>
I exceedingly give thanks, that<br>
I have been thought worthy to<br>
behold thy blessed face, in<br>
which may I always rejoice in God.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Wherefore I beseech thee by<br>
the grace of God with which thou<br>
art clothed, to press forward in<br>
thy course, and to exhort all<br>
others that they may be saved.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Maintain thy place with all<br>
care both of flesh and spirit: Make<br>
it thy endeavour to preserve unity,<br>
than which nothing is better.<br>
Bear with all men even as the<br>
Lord with thee.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Support all in love, as also<br>
thou dost. Pray without ceasing<br>
ask more understanding than what<br>
thou already hast. Be watchful,<br>
having thy spirit always awake.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Speak to every one according<br>
as God shall enable thee. Bear<br>
the infirmities of all, as a<br>
perfect combatant; where the<br>
labour is great, the gain is<br>
the more.</p>
<br>
<p>7  If thou shalt love the good<br>
disciples, what thank is it? But<br>
rather do thou subject to thee<br>
those that are mischievous, in<br>
meekness.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Every wound is not healed<br>
with the same plaister: if the<br>
accessions of the disease be<br>
vehement, modify them with soft<br>
remedies: be in all things wise<br>
as a serpent, but harmless as a<br>
dove.</p>
<br>
<p>9  For this cause thou art<br>
composed of flesh and spirit;<br>
that thou mayest modify those<br>
things that appear before thy face.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And as for those that are not<br>
seen, pray to God that he would<br>
reveal them into thee, that so<br>
thou mayest be wanting in nothing,<br>
but mayest abound in every gift.</p>
<br>
<p>11  The times demand thee, as<br>
the pilots the winds; and be that<br>
is tossed in a tempest, the haven<br>
where he would be.</p>
<br>
<p>12  That thou mayest attain unto<br>
God, be sober as the combatant<br>
of God. The crown proposed to<br>
thee is immortality, and eternal<br>
life: concerning which thou art<br>
also fully persuaded. I will be<br>
thy surety in all things, by my<br>
bonds, which thou halt loved.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Let not those that seem<br>
worthy of credit, but teach other<br>
doctrines, disturb thee. Stand<br>
firm and immoveable, as an anvil<br>
when it is beaten upon.</p>
<br>
<p>14  It is the part of a brave<br>
combatant to be wounded, and yet<br>
overcome. But especially we ought<br>
to endure all things for God's<br>
sake, that he may bear with us.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Be every day better than<br>
others; consider the times, and<br>
expect him, who is above all time,<br>
eternal; invisible, though for our<br>
sakes made visible: impalpable,<br>
and impassible, yet for us<br>
subjected to sufferings; enduring<br>
all manner of ways for our salvation.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Continues his advice,<br>
     6 and teaches him how to advise others.<br>
     12 Enforces unity and subjection to the bishop.</p>
<br>
<p>LET not the widows be neglected:<br>
be thou after God, their Guardian.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Let nothing be done without thy<br>
knowledge and consent; neither do<br>
thou anything but according to the<br>
will of God; as also thou dost,<br>
with all constancy.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Let your assemblies be more<br>
full: inquire into all by name.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Overlook not the men and<br>
maid servants; neither let them<br>
be puffed up: but rather let them<br>
be the more subject to the glory<br>
of God, that they may obtain from<br>
him a better liberty.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Let them not desire to be<br>
set free at the public cost, that<br>
they be not slaves to their own<br>
lusts.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Flee evil arts; or rather make<br>
not any mention of them.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Say to my sisters, that they<br>
love the Lord; and be satisfied<br>
with their own husbands, both in<br>
the flesh and spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>8  In like manner, exhort my<br>
brethren in the name of Jesus<br>
Christ, that they love their wives,<br>
even as the Lord the church.</p>
<br>
<p>9  If any man can remain in a<br>
virgin state, to the honour of the<br>
flesh of Christ, let him remain<br>
without boasting; but if he boast,<br>
he is undone. And if he desire to<br>
be more taken notice of than the<br>
bishop he is corrupted.</p>
<br>
<p>10  But it becomes all such as<br>
are married, whether men or women,<br>
to come together with the consent<br>
of the bishop, that so their<br>
marriage may be according to<br>
godliness, and not in lust.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Let all things be done to the<br>
honour of God.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Hearken unto the bishop,<br>
that God also may hearken unto<br>
you. My soul be security for<br>
them that submit to their bishop,<br>
with their presbyters and deacons.<br>
And may my portion be together<br>
with theirs in God.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Labour with one another;<br>
contend together, run together,<br>
suffer together; sleep together,<br>
and rise together; as the stewards,<br>
and assessors, and ministers of<br>
God.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Please him under whom ye<br>
war; and from whom ye receive<br>
your wages. Let none of you be<br>
found a deserter; but let your<br>
baptism remain, as your arms;<br>
your faith, as your helmet; your<br>
charity, as your spear; your<br>
patience, as your whole armour.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Let your works be your<br>
charge, that so you may receive<br>
a suitable reward. Be long<br>
suffering therefore towards each<br>
other in meekness; as God is<br>
towards you.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Let me have joy of you in<br>
all things.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Greets Polycarp on the peace of the church at Antioch:<br>
     2 and desires him to write to that and other churches.</p>
<br>
<p>NOW forasmuch as the church<br>
of Antioch in Lyria is, as<br>
I am told, in peace through your<br>
prayers; I also have been the more<br>
comforted, and without care in<br>
God; if so be that by suffering, I<br>
shall attain unto God; and through<br>
your prayers I may be found a<br>
disciple of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>2  It will be very fit, O most<br>
worthy Polycarp, to call a select<br>
council, and choose some one<br>
whom ye particularly love, and<br>
who is patient of labour: that he<br>
may be the messenger of God;<br>
and that going unto Syria, he may<br>
glorify your incessant love, to the<br>
praise of Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>3  A Christian has not the power<br>
of himself; but must be always<br>
at leisure for God's service.<br>
Now this work is both God's and<br>
our's; when ye shall have<br>
perfected it.</p>
<br>
<p>4  For I trust through the grace<br>
of God that ye are ready to every<br>
good work that is fitting for you<br>
in the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Knowing therefore your<br>
earnest affection for the truth,<br>
I have exhorted you by these short<br>
letters.</p>
<br>
<p>6  But forasmuch as I have not<br>
been able to write to all the<br>
churches, because I must suddenly<br>
sail from Troas to Neapolis;<br>
(for so is the command of those<br>
to whose pleasure I am subject;)<br>
do you write to the churches that<br>
are near you, as being instructed<br>
in the will of God, that they also<br>
may do in like manner.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Let those that are able send<br>
messengers; and let the rest send<br>
their letters by those who shall be<br>
sent by you: that you may be<br>
glorified to all eternity,<br>
of which you are worthy.</p>
<br>
<p>8  I salute all by name; particularly<br>
the wife of Epitropus with all her<br>
house and children. I salute Attalus<br>
my well-beloved.</p>
<br>
<p>9  I salute him who shall be<br>
thought worthy to be sent by you<br>
into Syria. Let grace be ever<br>
with him, and with Polycarp who<br>
sends him.</p>
<br>
<p>10  I wish you all happiness in<br>
our God, Jesus Christ; in whom<br>
continue, in the unity and<br>
protection of God.</p>
<br>
<p>11  I salute Alce my well-<br>
beloved.  Farewell in the Lord.</p>
<br>

<p>
              REFERENCES TO THE SEVEN EPISTLES OF IGNATIUS,</p>
<br>
<p>[The Epistles of Ignatius are translated by Archbishop Wake from the text<br>
of Vossius. He says that there were considerable difference in the<br>
editions; the  best for a long time extant containing fabrications, and<br>
the genuine being altered and corrupted. Archbishop Usher printed old<br>
Latin translations of  them at Oxford, in 1644. At Amsterdam, two years<br>
afterwards, Vossius  printed six of them in their ancient and pure Greek;<br>
and the seventh, greatly  amended from the ancient Latin version, was<br>
Printed at Paris, by Ruinart, in 1689, in the Acts and Martyrdom of<br>
Ignatius, from a Greek uninterpolated copy. These are supposed to form<br>
the collection that Polycarp made of the Epistles of Ignatius, mentioned<br>
by Irenaes, Origen, Eusebius, Jerome, Athanasius, Theodoret, and other<br>
ancients: but many learned men have  imagined all of them to be<br>
apocryphal. This supposition, the piety of Arch-bishop Wake, and his<br>
persuasion of their utility to the faith of the church, will not permit<br>
him to entertain: hence he has taken great pains to render the present<br>
translation acceptable, by adding numerous readings and references to the<br>
Canonical Books.]</p>

<h2>
                             THE EPISTLE OF<br>
                      POLYCARP TO THE PHILIPPIANS.</h2></center>
<br><br><br>
<p>     [The genuineness of this Epistle is controverted, but implicitly<br>
     believed by Arch-bishop Wake, whose translation is below. There is<br>
     also a translation by Dr. Cave attached to his life of Polycarp.]</p>
<br>
<p>
CHAPTER I.</p>
<br>
<p>     Polycarp commends the Philippians for their respect to<br>
     those who suffered for the Gospel; and for their own faith.</p>
<br>
<p>POLYCARP, and the presbyters<br>
that are with him, to the<br>
church of God which is at Philippi;<br>
mercy unto you, and peace from<br>
God Almighty, and the Lord Jesus<br>
Christ our Saviour, be multiplied.</p>
<br>
<p>2  I rejoiced greatly with you<br>
in our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye<br>
received the images of a true love,<br>
and accompanied, as it behoved you,<br>
those who were in bonds, becoming<br>
saints; which are the crowns of<br>
such as are truly chosen by God<br>
and our Lord:</p>
<br>
<p>3  As also that the root of the<br>
faith which was preached from<br>
ancient times, remains firm in you<br>
to this day; and brings forth fruit<br>
to our Lord Jesus Christ, who<br>
suffered himself to be brought<br>
even to the death for our sins:</p>
<br>
<p>4  Whom God hath raised up, having<br>
loosed the pains of death. Whom<br>
having not seen, ye love; in whom<br>
though now ye see him not, yet<br>
believing, ye rejoice with joy<br>
unspeakable and full of glory.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Into which many desire to<br>
enter; I knowing that by grace ye<br>
are saved; not by works, but by<br>
the will of God through Jesus<br>
Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Wherefore girding up the<br>
loins of your minds; I serve<br>
the Lord with fear, and in truth;<br>
laying aside all empty and vain<br>
speech, and the errors of many;<br>
believing in him that raised up<br>
our Lord Jesus Christ from the<br>
dead, and hath given him glory<br>
and a throne at his right hand.</p>
<br>
<p>7  To whom all things are made<br>
subject, both that are in heaven,<br>
and that are in earth; whom every<br>
living creature shall worship;<br>
who shall come to be the judge of<br>
the quick and dead: whose blood<br>
God shall require of them that<br>
believe not in him.</p>
<br>
<p>8  But he that raised up Christ<br>
from the dead, shall also raise up<br>
us in like manner, if we do his<br>
will, and walk according to his<br>
commandments; and love those<br>
things which he loved:</p>
<br>
<p>9  Abstaining from all<br>
unrighteousness; inordinate affection,<br>
and love of money; from evil.<br>
speaking; false witness; not<br>
rendering evil for evil, or<br>
railing for railing, or striking<br>
for striking, or cursing<br>
for cursing:</p>
<br>
<p>10 But remembering what the<br>
Lord has taught us saying, Judge<br>
not, and ye shall not be judged;<br>
forgive and ye shall be forgiven;<br>
be ye merciful, and ye shall obtain<br>
mercy; for with the same measure<br>
that ye meet withal, it shall be<br>
measured to you again.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And again; Blessed are the<br>
poor, and they that are persecuted<br>
for righteousness sake; for theirs<br>
is the kingdom of God.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER II.</p>
<br>
<p>     2 Exhorts to Faith, Hope, and Charity.<br>
     5 Against covetousness, and as to the<br>
     duties of husbands, wives, widows,<br>
     9 deacons, young men, virgins, and presbyters.</p>
<br>
<p>THESE things, my brethren,<br>
I took not the liberty of myself<br>
to write unto you concerning<br>
righteousness, but you yourselves<br>
before encouraged me to it.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For neither can i, nor any<br>
other such as I am, come up to<br>
the wisdom of the blessed and<br>
renowned Paul; who being himself<br>
in person with those who then<br>
lived, did with all exactness and<br>
soundness teach the word of truth;<br>
and being gone from you wrote an<br>
epistle to you.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Into which if you look, you<br>
will be able to edify yourselves in<br>
the faith that has been delivered<br>
unto you, which is the mother of<br>
us all; being followed with hope,<br>
and led on by a general love, both<br>
towards God and towards Christ,<br>
and towards our neighbour.</p>
<br>
<p>4  For if any man has these<br>
things, he has fulfilled the law<br>
of righteousness: for he that has<br>
charity is far from all sin.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But the love of money is the<br>
root of all evil. Knowing therefore<br>
that as we brought nothing into this<br>
world, so neither may we carry any<br>
thing out; let us arm ourselves<br>
with the armour of righteousness.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And teach ourselves first to<br>
walk according to the commandments<br>
of the Lord; and then your wives<br>
to walk likewise according to the<br>
faith that is given to them; in<br>
charity, and in purity; loving<br>
their own husbands, with all<br>
sincerity, and all others alike,<br>
with all temperance; and to bring up<br>
their children in the instruction<br>
and fear of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>7  The widows likewise teach<br>
that they be sober as to what<br>
concerns the faith of the Lord:<br>
praying always for all men; being far<br>
from all detraction, evil speaking,<br>
false witness; from covetousness,<br>
and from all evil.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Knowing that they are the<br>
altars of God, who sees all blemishes,<br>
and from whom nothing is hid; who<br>
searches out the very reasonings,<br>
and thoughts, and secrets of our<br>
hearts.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Knowing therefore that God<br>
is not mocked, we ought to walk<br>
worthy both of his command and<br>
of his glory.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Also the deacons must be<br>
blameless before him, as the<br>
ministers of God in Christ, and<br>
not of men. Not false mousers, not<br>
double tongued, not lovers of money;<br>
but moderate in all things;<br>
compassionate, careful; walking<br>
according to the truth of the Lord,<br>
who was the servant of all.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Whom if we please in this<br>
present world, we shall also be<br>
made partakers of that which is<br>
to come, according as he has<br>
promised to us, that he will raise<br>
us from the dead; and that if we<br>
shall walk worthy of him, we shall<br>
also reign together with him, if<br>
we believe.</p>
<br>
<p>12  In like manner the younger<br>
men must be unblameable in all<br>
things; above all, taking care of<br>
their purity, and to restrain<br>
themselves from all evil. For it is<br>
good to be cut off from the lusts that<br>
are in the world; because every<br>
such lust warreth against the<br>
spirit: and neither fornicators,<br>
nor effeminate, nor abusers of<br>
themselves with mankind, shall<br>
inherit the kingdom of God; nor<br>
they who do such things as are<br>
foolish and unreasonable.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Wherefore ye must needs<br>
abstain from all these things,<br>
being subject to the priests and<br>
deacons, as unto God and Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>14  The virgins admonish to<br>
walk in a spotless and pure<br>
conscience.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And let the elders be<br>
compassionate and merciful towards<br>
all; turning them from their errors;<br>
seeking out those that are weak;<br>
not forgetting the widows, the<br>
fatherless, and the poor; but<br>
always providing what is good<br>
both in the sight of God and man.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Abstaining from all wrath,<br>
respect of persons, and unrighteous<br>
judgment; and especially being<br>
free from all covetousness.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Not easy to believe anything<br>
against any; not severe in judgment;<br>
knowing that we are all debtors<br>
in point of sin.</p>
<br>
<p>18 If therefore we pray to the<br>
Lord that he would forgive us, we<br>
ought also to forgive others; for<br>
we are all in the sight of our Lord<br>
and God; a and must all stand before<br>
the judgment-seat of Christ;<br>
and shall every one give an<br>
account of himself.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Let us therefore serve him in<br>
fear, and with all reverence as<br>
both himself hath commanded;<br>
and as the Apostles who have<br>
preached the Gospel unto us, and<br>
the prophets who have foretold<br>
the coming of our Lord have<br>
taught us:</p>
<br>
<p>20  Being zealous of what is<br>
good; abstaining from all offence,<br>
and from false brethren; and<br>
from those who bear the name of<br>
Christ in hypocrisy; who deceive<br>
vain men.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER III.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 As to faith in our Saviour Christ;<br>
     his nature and sufferings, the resurrection and judgment.<br>
     3 Exhorts to prayer<br>
     5 and steadfastness in the faith, from the examples of Christ,<br>
     7 and Apostles and saints, and exhorts to carefulness<br>
     in all well-doing.</p>
<br>
<p>FOR whosoever does not confess<br>
that Jesus Christ is come in<br>
the flesh, he is Antichrist: and<br>
whoever does not confess his<br>
suffering upon the cross, is<br>
from the devil.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And whosoever perverts the<br>
oracles of the Lord to his own<br>
lusts, and says that there shall.<br>
neither be any resurrection, nor<br>
judgment, he is the first-born of<br>
Satan.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Wherefore leaving the vanity<br>
of many, and their false doctrines;<br>
let us return to the word that was<br>
delivered to us from the beginning:<br>
Watching unto prayer; and<br>
persevering in fasting;</p>
<br>
<p>4  With supplication beseeching<br>
the all seeing God not to lead us<br>
into temptation; as the Lord hath<br>
said, The spirit is truly willing,<br>
but the flesh is weak.</p>
<br>
<p>5 Let us therefore without ceasing<br>
hold steadfastly to him who is our<br>
hope, and the earnest of our<br>
righteousnes, even Jesus Christ;<br>
Who, his own self, bare our sins<br>
in his own body on the tree: who<br>
did no sin, neither was guile found<br>
in his mouth; but suffered all for<br>
us that we might live through<br>
him.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Let us therefore imitate his<br>
patience; and if we suffer for his<br>
name, let us glorify him; for this<br>
example he has given us by himself,<br>
and so have we believed.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Wherefore I exhort all<br>
of you that ye obey the word of<br>
righteousness, and exercise all<br>
patience; which ye have seen set<br>
forth before your eyes, not only<br>
in the blessed Ignatius, and Zozimus,<br>
and Rufus; but in others among<br>
yourselves; and in Paul himself,<br>
and the rest of the Apostles:</p>
<br>
<p>8  Being confident of this, that<br>
all these have not run in vain, but<br>
in faith and righteousness; and<br>
are gone to the place that was due<br>
to them from the Lord; with<br>
whom also they suffered.</p>
<br>
<p>9  For they loved not this<br>
present world; but him who died,<br>
and was raised again by God for<br>
us.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Stand therefore in these<br>
things, and follow the example of<br>
the Lord; being firm and immutable<br>
in the faith, lovers of the<br>
brotherhood, lovers of one<br>
another: companions together<br>
in the truth, being kind and<br>
gentle towards each other,<br>
despising none.</p>
<br>
<p>11  When it is in your power to<br>
do good defer it not, for charity<br>
delivered from death.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Be all of you subject one to<br>
another, having your conversation<br>
honest among the Gentiles; that<br>
by your good works, both ye<br>
yourselves may receive praise, and<br>
the Lord may not be blasphemed<br>
through you.   But woe be to him<br>
by whom the name of the Lord is<br>
blasphemed.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Therefore teach all men<br>
sobriety; in which do ye also<br>
exercise yourselves.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
<br>
<p>     Valens, a presbyter, having fallen into the sin<br>
     of covetousness, he exhorts them against it.</p>
<br>
<p>I am greatly afflicted for Valens,<br>
who was once a presbyter among you;<br>
that he should so little understand<br>
the place that was given to him in<br>
the church, Wherefore I admonish you<br>
that ye abstain from covetousness;<br>
and that ye be chaste, and true of<br>
speech.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Keep yourselves from all evil.<br>
For he that in these things cannot<br>
govern himself, how shall he be<br>
able to prescribe them to another?</p>
<br>
<p>3  If a man does not keep himself<br>
from covetousness, he shall be<br>
polluted with idolatry, and be<br>
judged as if he were a Gentile.</p>
<br>
<p>4  But who of you are ignorant<br>
of the judgment of God?  Do we<br>
not know that the saints shall<br>
judge the world, as Paul teaches?</p>
<br>
<p>5  But I have neither perceived<br>
nor heard anything of this kind<br>
in you, among whom the blessed<br>
Paul laboured; and who are<br>
named in the beginning of his<br>
Epistle.</p>
<br>
<p>6  For he glories of you in all<br>
the churches who then only knew<br>
God; for we did not then know<br>
him. Wherefore, my brethren, I<br>
am exceedingly sorry both for him<br>
and for his wife; to whom God<br>
grant a true repentance.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And be ye also moderate upon<br>
this occasion; and look not upon<br>
such as enemies, but call them<br>
back as suffering and erring<br>
members, that ye may save your<br>
whole body: for by so doing,<br>
ye shall edify your own selves.</p>
<br>
<p>8  For I trust that ye are well<br>
exercised in the Holy Scriptures,<br>
and that nothing is hid from you<br>
but at present it is not granted<br>
unto me to practise that which is<br>
written, Be angry and sin not;<br>
and again, Let not the sun go<br>
down upon your wrath.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Blessed be he that believeth<br>
and remembereth these things;<br>
which also I trust you do.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Now the God and Father of<br>
our Lord Jesus Christ, and he<br>
himself who is our everlasting<br>
high-priest, the Son of God, even<br>
Jesus Christ, build you up in faith<br>
and in truth, and in all meekness<br>
and lenity; in patience and long-<br>
suffering, in forbearance and<br>
chastity:</p>
<br>
<p>11  And grant unto you a lot and<br>
portion among his saints, and us<br>
with you; and to all that are under<br>
the heavens, who shall believe in<br>
our Lord Jesus Christ, and in his<br>
Father who raised him from the dead.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Pray for all the saints:<br>
pray also for kings, and all that<br>
are in authority; and for those who<br>
persecute you, and hate you, and for<br>
the enemies of the cross; that your<br>
fruit may be manifest in all; and<br>
that ye may be perfect in Christ.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Ye wrote to me, both ye, and<br>
also Ignatius, that if any one<br>
went from hence into Syria, he<br>
should bring your letters with<br>
him; which also I will take care<br>
of, as soon as I shall have a<br>
convenient opportunity; either<br>
by myself, or him whom I shall<br>
send upon your account.</p>
<br>
<p>14  The Epistle of Ignatius,<br>
which he wrote unto us, together<br>
with what others of his have come<br>
to our hands, we have sent to you,<br>
according to your order; which<br>
are subjoined to this Epistle:</p>
<br>
<p>15  By which we may be greatly<br>
profited; for they treat of faith<br>
and patience, and of all things that<br>
pertain to edification in the Lord<br>
Jesus.</p>
<br>
<p>16  What you know certainly of<br>
Ignatius, and those that are<br>
with him, signify to us.</p>
<br>
<p>17  These things have I written<br>
unto you by Crescens, whom by<br>
this present Epistle I have<br>
recommended to you, and do now<br>
again commend.</p>
<br>
<p>18  For he has had his conversation<br>
without blame among us; and I suppose<br>
also with you.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Ye will also have regard unto<br>
his sister when she shall come<br>
unto you.</p>
<br>
<p>20 Be ye safe in the Lord Jesus<br>
Christ; and in favour with all<br>
yours. Amen.</p>

<h2>
                         THE FIRST PART OF THE<br>
                   BOOK OF HERMAS CALLED HIS VISION.</h2></center>
<br><br><br>
<p>
VISION I.</p>
<br>
<p>     1 Against filthy and proud thoughts;<br>
     20 also the neglect of Hermas in chastising his children.</p>
<br>
<p>HE who had bred me up sold a<br>
certain young maid at Rome;<br>
whom when I saw many years<br>
after, I remembered her, and<br>
began to love her as a sister.<br>
It happened some time afterwards,<br>
that I saw her washing in the river.<br>
Tyber; and I reached out my hand<br>
unto her, and brought her out of<br>
the river,</p>
<br>
<p>2  And when I saw her I thought<br>
with myself, saying, How happy<br>
should I be if I had such a wife,<br>
both for beauty and manners.<br>
This I thought with myself; nor<br>
did I think any thing more. But<br>
not long after, as I was walking,<br>
and musing on these thoughts, I<br>
began to honour this creature of<br>
God, thinking with myself; how<br>
noble and beautiful she was.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And when I had walked a little,<br>
I fell asleep; and the spirit<br>
caught me away, and carried me<br>
through a certain place towards<br>
the right hand, through which no<br>
man could pass. It was a place<br>
among rocks, very steep, and<br>
unpassable for water.</p>
<br>
<p>4  When I was past this place,<br>
I came into a plain; and there<br>
falling down upon my knees, I<br>
began to pray unto the Lord, and<br>
to confess my sins.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And as I was praying, the<br>
heaven was opened, and I saw the<br>
woman which I had coveted,<br>
saluting me from heaven, and<br>
saying, Hermas, hail! and I looking<br>
upon her, answered, Lady, what<br>
dost thou do here? She answered<br>
me, I am taken up hither to accuse<br>
thee of sin before the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Lady, said I, wilt thou<br>
convince me? No, said she: but<br>
hear the words which I am about<br>
to speak unto thee. God who<br>
dwelleth in heaven, and hath made<br>
all things out of nothing, and<br>
hath multiplied them for his holy<br>
church's sake, is angry with thee<br>
because thou hast sinned against<br>
me.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And I answering said unto<br>
her, Lady, if I have sinned against<br>
thee, tell me where, or in what<br>
place, or when did I ever speak<br>
an unseemly or dishonest word<br>
unto thee?</p>
<br>
<p>8  Have I not always esteemed<br>
thee as a lady? Have I not always<br>
reverenced thee as a sister? Why<br>
then dost thou imagine these<br>
wicked things against me?</p>
<br>
<p>9  Then she, smiling upon me,<br>
said: the desire of naughtiness<br>
has risen up in thy heart. Does<br>
it not seem to thee to be an ill<br>
thing for a righteous man to have<br>
an evil desire rise up in his heart.</p>
<br>
<p>10  It is indeed a sin, and that a<br>
very great sin, to such a one; for<br>
a righteous man thinketh that<br>
which is righteous. And whilst<br>
he does so, and walketh uprightly,<br>
he shall have the Lord in heaven<br>
favourable unto him in all his<br>
business.</p>
<br>
<p>11  But as for those who think<br>
wickedly in their hearts, they take<br>
to themselves death and captivity;<br>
and especially those who love this<br>
present world, and glory in their<br>
riches, and regard not the good<br>
things that are to come; their<br>
souls wander up and down and<br>
know not where to fix.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Now this is the case of such<br>
as are double-minded, who trust<br>
not in the Lord, and despise and<br>
neglect their own life.</p>
<br>
<p>13  But do thou pray unto the<br>
Lord, and he will heal thy sins,<br>
and the sins of thy whole house,<br>
and of all his saints.</p>
<br>
<p>14  As soon as she had spoken<br>
these words the heaven were shut,<br>
and I remained utterly swallowed<br>
up with sadness and fear: and<br>
said within myself, if this be laid<br>
against me for sin, how can I be<br>
saved.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Or how should I ever be able<br>
to entreat the Lord for my many<br>
and great sins? With what words<br>
shall I beseech him to be merciful<br>
unto me?</p>
<br>
<p>16  As I was thinking over these<br>
things, and meditating in myself<br>
upon them, behold a chair was<br>
set over against me of the whitest<br>
wool, as bright as snow.</p>
<br>
<p>17  And there came an old woman<br>
in a bright garment, having<br>
a book in her hand, and sat alone,<br>
and saluted me, saying, Hermas,<br>
hail! and I being full of sorrow<br>
and weeping, answered, Hail Lady!</p>
<br>
<p>18  And she said unto me, Why<br>
art thou sad, Hermas, who wert<br>
wont to be patient, and modest,<br>
and always cheerful? I answered,<br>
and said to her, Lady, a reproach<br>
has been laid to my charge by an<br>
excellent woman, who tells me<br>
that I have sinned against her.</p>
<br>
<p>19  She replied, Far be any such<br>
thing from the servant of God.<br>
But it may be the desire of her<br>
has risen up in thy heart? For<br>
indeed such a thought maketh the<br>
servants of God guilty of sin.</p>
<br>
<p>20  Nor ought such a detestable<br>
thought to be in the servant of<br>
God: nor should he who is approved<br>
by the Spirit desire that which<br>
is evil; but especially Hermas,<br>
who contains himself from all<br>
wicked lusts, and is full of all<br>
simplicity, and of great innocence.</p>
<br>
<p>21  Nevertheless the Lord is<br>
not so much angry with thee for<br>
thine own sake, as upon the<br>
account of thy house, which has<br>
committed wickedness against the<br>
Lord, and against their parents.</p>
<br>
<p>22  And for that out of thy<br>
fondness towards thy sons, thou<br>
hast not admonished thy house,<br>
but hast permitted them to live<br>
wickedly; for this cause the Lord<br>
is angry with thee: but he will heal<br>
all the evils that are done in thy<br>
house. For through their sins<br>
and iniquities, thou art wholly<br>
consumed in secular affairs.</p>
<br>
<p>23  But now the mercy of God<br>
hath taken compassion upon thee,<br>
and upon thine house, and hath<br>
greatly comforted thee. Only<br>
as for thee, do not wander, but be<br>
of an even mind, and comfort thy<br>
house.</p>
<br>
<p>24  As the workman bringing<br>
forth his work, offers it to<br>
whomsoever he pleaseth; so shalt<br>
thou by teaching every day what<br>
is just, cut off a great sin.<br>
Wherefore cease not to admonish thy<br>
sons, for the Lord knows that they<br>
will repent with all their heart,<br>
and they shall be written in the<br>
book of life.</p>
<br>
<p>25  And when she had said this,<br>
she added unto me; Wilt thou<br>
hear me read? I answered her,<br>
Lady, I will.</p>
<br>
<p>26  Hear then, said she;<br>
and opening the book she read,<br>
gloriously, greatly. and wonderfully,<br>
such things as I could not keep in<br>
my memory. For they were terrible<br>
words, such as no man could bear.</p>
<br>
<p>27  How it be I committed her<br>
last words to my remembrance;<br>
for they were but few, and of great<br>
use to us:--</p>
<br>
<p>28  Behold the mighty Lord, who<br>
by his invisible power, and with<br>
his excellent wisdom made the<br>
world, and by his glorious counsel<br>
beautified his creature, and with<br>
the word of his strength fixed the<br>
heaven, and founded the earth<br>
upon the waters; and by his<br>
powerful virtue established the<br>
Holy Church, which he hath<br>
blessed.</p>
<br>
<p>29  Behold he will remove the<br>
heavens, and the mountains, the<br>
hills, and the seas; and all things<br>
shall be made plain for his elect;<br>
that he may render unto them the<br>
promise which he has promised,<br>
with much honour and joy; if so<br>
be that they shall keep the<br>
commandments of God, which they<br>
have received with great faith.</p>
<br>
<p>30  And when she had made an end<br>
of reading, she rose out of the<br>
chair; and behold four young men<br>
came, and carried the chair to<br>
the east.</p>
<br>
<p>31  And she called me unto her,<br>
and touched my breast, and said<br>
unto me, Did my reading please<br>
thee? I answered, Lady, these<br>
last things please me; but what<br>
went before was severe and hard.</p>
<br>
<p>32  She said unto me, these last<br>
things are for the righteous, but<br>
the foregoing for the revolters and<br>
heathen.</p>
<br>
<p>33  And as she was talking with<br>
me, two men appeared, and took<br>
her upon their shoulders, and<br>
went to the east where the chair<br>
was.</p>
<br>
<p>34  And she went cheerfully<br>
away; and as she was going, said<br>
unto me, Hermas, be of good<br>
cheer.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>VISION II.</p>
<br>
<p>     Again, of his neglect in correcting his talkative wife;<br>
     and of his lewd sons.</p>
<br>
<p>AS I was on the way to Cuma,<br>
about the same time that I<br>
went the year before, I began to<br>
call to mind the vision I formerly<br>
had. And again the spirit carried<br>
me away, and brought me into the<br>
same place, in which I had been<br>
the year before.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And when I was come into the<br>
place, I fell down upon my knees,<br>
and began to pray unto the Lord,<br>
and to glorify his name, that he<br>
had esteemed me worthy, and had<br>
manifested unto me my former<br>
sins.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And when I arose from prayer,<br>
behold I saw over against me the<br>
old woman whom I had seen the<br>
last year, walking and reading<br>
in a certain book.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And she said unto me, Canst<br>
thou tell these things to the<br>
elect of God? I answered and said<br>
unto her, Lady, I cannot retain<br>
so many things in my memory, but<br>
give me the book, and I will write<br>
them down.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Take it, says she, and see that<br>
thou restore it again to me.</p>
<br>
<p>6  As soon as I had received it,<br>
I went aside into a certain place<br>
of the field, and transcribe every<br>
letter, for I found no syllables.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And as soon as I had finished<br>
what was written in the book, the<br>
book was suddenly caught out of<br>
my hand, but by whom I saw not.</p>
<br>
<p>8  After fifteen days, when I<br>
had fasted, and entreated the Lord<br>
with all earnestness, the knowledge<br>
of the writing was revealed unto me.<br>
Now the writing was this:--</p>
<br>
<p>9  Thy seed, O Hermas! hath<br>
sinned against the Lord, and have<br>
betrayed their parents, through<br>
their great wickedness. And they<br>
have been called the betrayers of<br>
their parents, and have gone on in<br>
their treachery.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And now have they added<br>
lewdness to their other sins, and<br>
the pollutions of their naughtiness:<br>
thus have they filled up the measure<br>
of their iniquities. But do thou<br>
upbraid thy sons with all these<br>
words; and thy wife, who shall be<br>
as thy sister; and let her learn<br>
to refrain her tongue, with which<br>
she calumniates.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And when she shall hear these<br>
things, she will refrain herself,<br>
and shall obtain mercy.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And they also shall be<br>
instructed, when thou shalt have<br>
reproached them with these words,<br>
which the Lord has commanded to<br>
be revealed unto them.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Then shall their sins be<br>
forgiven, which they have heretofore<br>
committed, and the sins of all the<br>
saints who have sinned even unto<br>
this day; if they shall repent with<br>
all their hearts, and remove all<br>
doubts out of their hearts.</p>
<br>
<p>14  For the Lord hath sworn by<br>
his glory concerning his elect,<br>
having determined this very time,<br>
that if any one shall even now<br>
sin, he shall not be saved.</p>
<br>
<p>15  For the repentance of the<br>
righteous has its end; the days of<br>
repentance are fulfilled to all the<br>
saints; but to the heathen, there<br>
is repentance even unto the last<br>
day.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Thou shalt therefore say to<br>
those who are over the church,<br>
that they order their ways in<br>
righteousness; so that they may<br>
fully receive the promise with<br>
much glory.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Stand fast therefore ye that<br>
work righteousness and continue<br>
to do it, that your departure may<br>
be with the holy angels.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Happy are ye, as many as<br>
shall endure the great trial that is<br>
at hand, and whosoever shall not<br>
deny his life.</p>
<br>
<p>19  For the Lord hath sworn by<br>
his Son, that whoso, denieth his<br>
Son and HIM, being afraid of his<br>
life, he will also deny him in the<br>
world that is to come.</p>
<br>
<p>20  But those who shall never<br>
deny him, he will of his exceeding<br>
great mercy be favourable unto<br>
them.</p>
<br>
<p>21 But thou, O Hermas! remember<br>
not the evils which thy sons have<br>
done, neither neglect thy sister,<br>
but take care that they amend of<br>
their former sins.</p>
<br>
<p>22  For they will be instructed<br>
by this doctrine, if thou shalt not<br>
be mindful of what they have done<br>
wickedly.</p>
<br>
<p>23  For the remembrance of evils<br>
worketh death, but the forgetting<br>
of them eternal life.</p>
<br>
<p>24  But thou, O Hermas! hast<br>
undergone a great many worldly<br>
troubles for the offences of thy<br>
house, because thou hast neglected<br>
them, as things that did not belong<br>
unto thee; and thou art wholly<br>
taken up with thy great business.</p>
<br>
<p>25  Nevertheless, for this cause<br>
shalt thou be saved, that thou hast<br>
not departed from the living God,<br>
and thy simplicity and singular<br>
continency shall preserve thee, if<br>
thou shalt continue in them.</p>
<br>
<p>26  Yes, they shall save all such<br>
as do such things, and walk in<br>
innocence and simplicity.</p>
<br>
<p>27 They who are of this kind<br>
shall prevail against all impiety,<br>
and continue until life eternal.</p>
<br>
<p>28  Happy are all they that do<br>
righteousness, they shall not be<br>
consumed for ever.</p>
<br>
<p>29  But thou wilt say, Behold<br>
there is a great trial coming. If<br>
it seem good to thee, deny him<br>
again.</p>
<br>
<p>30  The Lord is nigh to them that<br>
turn to him, as it is written in<br>
the book of Heldam and Modal,<br>
who prophesied to the people of<br>
Israel in the wilderness.</p>
<br>
<p>31  Moreover, brethren, it was<br>
revealed to me, as I was sleeping,<br>
by a very goodly young man, saying<br>
unto me, What thinkest thou of that<br>
old woman from whom thou receivedst<br>
the book; who is she? I answered,<br>
a Sybil.</p>
<br>
<p>32  Thou art mistaken said he,<br>
she is not. I replied, Who is she<br>
then, sir? He answered me, It is<br>
the church of God.</p>
<br>
<p>33  And I said unto him, Why<br>
then does she appear old? She is<br>
therefore, said he, an old woman,<br>
because she was the first of all<br>
the creation, and the world was<br>
made for her.</p>
<br>
<p>34  After this I saw a vision at<br>
home in my own house, and the<br>
old woman, whom I had seen before,<br>
came to me and asked me whether<br>
I had yet delivered her book to<br>
the elders of the church? And<br>
I answered, that I had not yet.</p>
<br>
<p>35  She replied, Thou hast well<br>
done, for I have certain words<br>
more to tell thee. But when I<br>
shall have finished all the words,<br>
they shall be clearly understood<br>
by the elect.</p>
<br>
<p>36 And thou shalt write two<br>
books, and send one to Clement<br>
and one to Grapte. For Clement<br>
shall send it to the foreign cities,<br>
because it is permitted to him so<br>
to do: but Grapte shall admonish<br>
the widows and orphans.</p>
<br>
<p>37  But thou shalt read in this<br>
city with the elders of the church.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>VISION III.</p>
<br>
<p>     Of the building of the church triumphant,<br>
     and of the several sorts of reprobates.</p>
<br>
<p>THE vision which I saw, brethren,<br>
was this.</p>
<br>
<p>2  When I had often fasted and<br>
prayed unto the Lord, that he<br>
would manifest unto me the<br>
revelation, which he had promised<br>
by the old woman to show unto me;<br>
the same night she appeared unto<br>
me, and said unto me,</p>
<br>
<p>3  Because thou dost thus afflict<br>
thyself, and art so desirous to know<br>
all things, come into the field,<br>
where thou wilt, and about the<br>
sixth hour, I will appear unto thee,<br>
and show thee what thou must<br>
see.</p>
<br>
<p>4  I asked her, saying; Lady,<br>
into what part of the field? She<br>
answered, wherever thou wilt, only<br>
choose a good and a private place.<br>
And before I began to speak and<br>
tell her the place, she said unto<br>
me; I will come where thou wilt.</p>
<br>
<p>5  I was therefore, brethren in<br>
the field and I observed the hours,<br>
and came into the place where I<br>
had appointed her to come.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And I beheld a bench placed;<br>
it was a linen pillow, and over it<br>
spread a covering of fine linen.</p>
<br>
<p>7  When I saw these things ordered<br>
in this manner, and that there was<br>
nobody in the place, I began to be<br>
astonished, and my hair stood on end,<br>
and a, kind of horror seized me;<br>
for I was alone.</p>
<br>
<p>8  But being come to myself,<br>
and calling to mind the glory of<br>
God, and taking courage, I fell<br>
down upon my knees and began<br>
again to confess my sins as before.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And whilst I was doing this,<br>
the old woman came thither with<br>
the six young men whom I had<br>
seen before, and stood behind me<br>
as I was praying, and heard me<br>
praying and confessing my sins<br>
unto the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And touching me, she said;<br>
Leave off praying now only for thy<br>
sins; pray also for righteousness,<br>
that thou mayest receive a part of<br>
it in thy house.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And she lifted me up from<br>
the place, and took me by the<br>
hand, and brought me to the seat;<br>
and said to the young men, go,<br>
and build.</p>
<br>
<p>12  As soon as they were departed,<br>
and we were alone, she said unto me;<br>
sit here. I answered her; Lady,<br>
let those who are elder sit first.<br>
She replied, Sit down as I bid you.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And when I would have sat<br>
on the right side, she suffered me<br>
not, but made a sign to me with<br>
her hand, that I should sit on the<br>
left.</p>
<br>
<p>14  As I was therefore musing,<br>
and full of sorrow, that she would<br>
not suffer me to sit on the right<br>
side, she said unto me, Hermas,<br>
why art thou sad?</p>
<br>
<p>15  The place which is on the<br>
right hand is theirs who have<br>
already attained unto God, and have<br>
suffered for his name-sake. But<br>
there is yet a great deal remaining<br>
unto thee, before thou canst sit<br>
with them.</p>
<br>
<p>16  But continue as thou doest,<br>
in thy sincerity, and thou shalt sit<br>
with them; as all others shall,<br>
who do their works, and shall bear<br>
what they have borne.</p>
<br>
<p>17  I said to her; Lady, I would<br>
know what it is that they have<br>
suffered? Hear then, said she:<br>
wild beasts, scourgings,<br>
imprisonments, and crosses<br>
for his name-sake.</p>
<br>
<p>18  For this cause the right hand<br>
of holiness belongs to them, and<br>
to all others as many as shall<br>
suffer for the name of God; but<br>
the left belongs to the rest.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Howbeit the gifts and the<br>
promises belong to both, to them<br>
on the right, and to those on the<br>
left hand; only that sitting on the<br>
right hand they have some glory<br>
above the others.</p>
<br>
<p>20  But thou art desirous to sit<br>
on the right hand with them, and<br>
yet thy defects are many. But<br>
thou shalt be purged from thy<br>
defects, as also all who doubt not<br>
shall be cleansed from all the sins<br>
which they have committed unto<br>
this day.</p>
<br>
<p>21  And when she had said this<br>
she would have departed.</p>
<br>
<p>22  Wherefore, falling down before<br>
her feet, I began to entreat her,<br>
for the Lord's sake, that she<br>
would show me the vision which<br>
she had promised.</p>
<br>
<p>23  Then she again took me by<br>
the hand, and lifted me up, and<br>
made me sit upon the seat at the<br>
left side; and holding up a certain<br>
bright wand, said unto me, Seest<br>
thou that great thing? I replied,<br>
Lady, I see nothing.</p>
<br>
<p>24  She answered, Dost thou not<br>
see over against thee a great tower,<br>
which is built upon the water with<br>
bright square stones?</p>
<br>
<p>25  For the tower was built upon<br>
a square by these six young men<br>
that came with her.</p>
<br>
<p>26  But many thousand of other<br>
men brought stones; some drew<br>
them out of the deep, others<br>
carried them from the ground,<br>
and gave them to the six young men;<br>
and they took them and built.</p>
<br>
<p>27  As for those stones which<br>
were drawn out of the deep, they<br>
put them all into the building;<br>
for they were polished, and their<br>
squares exactly answered one another,<br>
and so one was joined in such wise<br>
to the other, that there was no<br>
space to be seen where they<br>
joined, insomuch that the whole<br>
tower appeared to be built as it<br>
were of one stone.</p>
<br>
<p>28  But as for the other stones<br>
that were taken off from the<br>
ground, some of them they rejected,<br>
others they fitted into the building.</p>
<br>
<p>29  As for those which were rejected,<br>
some they cut out, and cast them<br>
at a distance from the tower;<br>
but many others of them lay round<br>
about the tower, which they made<br>
no use of in the building.</p>
<br>
<p>30  For some of these were<br>
rough, others had clefts in them,<br>
others were white and round, not<br>
proper for the building of the<br>
tower.</p>
<br>
<p>31  But I saw the other stones<br>
cast afar off from the tower, and<br>
falling into the high-way, and yet<br>
not continuing in the way, but<br>
were rolled from the way into a<br>
desert place.</p>
<br>
<p>32  Others I saw falling into the<br>
fire and burning; others fell near<br>
the water, yet could not roll<br>
themselves into it, though very<br>
desirous to fall into the water.</p>
<br>
<p>33  And when she had showed<br>
me these things she would have<br>
departed; but I said to her, Lady,<br>
what doth it profit me to see these<br>
things, and not understand what<br>
they mean?</p>
<br>
<p>34  She answered and said unto<br>
me; You are very cunning, in<br>
that you are desirous to know<br>
those things which relate to the<br>
tower. Yea, said I, lady, that I<br>
may declare them unto the brethren,<br>
and they may rejoice, and hearing<br>
these things may glorify God<br>
with great glory.</p>
<br>
<p>35  Then she said, Many indeed<br>
shall hear them, and when they<br>
shall have heard them, some shall<br>
rejoice, and others weep. And<br>
yet even these, if they shall<br>
repent, shall rejoice too.</p>
<br>
<p>36  Hear therefore what I shall<br>
say concerning the parable of the<br>
tower, and after this be no longer<br>
importunate with me about the<br>
revelation.</p>
<br>
<p>37  For these revelations have<br>
an end, seeing they are fulfilled.<br>
But thou dost not leave off to<br>
desire revelations, for thou art<br>
very urgent.</p>
<br>
<p>38  As for the tower which thou<br>
seest built, it is myself, namely,<br>
the church, which have appeared<br>
to thee both now and heretofore.<br>
Wherefore ask what thou wilt<br>
concerning the tower, and I will<br>
reveal it unto thee, that thou<br>
mayest rejoice with the saints.</p>
<br>
<p>39  I said unto her, Lady,<br>
because thou hast thought me once<br>
worthy to receive from thee the<br>
revelation of all these things,<br>
declare them unto me.</p>
<br>
<p>40  She answered me, Whatsoever<br>
is fit to be revealed unto thee<br>
shall be revealed: only yet thy<br>
heart be with the Lord, and doubt<br>
not, whatsoever thou shalt see.</p>
<br>
<p>41  I asked her, Lady, why is the<br>
tower built upon the water? She<br>
replied, I said before to thee that<br>
thou wert very wise to inquire<br>
diligently concerning the building,<br>
therefore thou shalt find the truth.</p>
<br>
<p>42  Hear therefore why the tower<br>
is built upon the water: because<br>
your life is and shall be saved by<br>
water. For it is founded by the<br>
word of the almighty and honourable<br>
name, and is supported by the<br>
invisible power and virtue of God.</p>
<br>
<p>43 And I answering, said<br>
unto her, These things are very<br>
admirable; but, lady, who are<br>
those six young men that build?</p>
<br>
<p>44  They are, said she, the angels<br>
of God, who were first appointed,<br>
and to whom the Lord has delivered<br>
all his creatures, to frame and<br>
build them up, and to rule over<br>
them. For by these the building<br>
of the tower shall be finished.</p>
<br>
<p>45  And who are the rest who<br>
bring them stones?</p>
<br>
<p>46  They also are the holy angels<br>
of the Lord; but the others are<br>
more excellent than these. Wherefore<br>
when the whole building of the<br>
tower shall be finished, they<br>
shall all feast together beside<br>
the tower, and shall glorify God,<br>
because the structure of the<br>
tower is finished.</p>
<br>
<p>47  I asked her, saying, I would<br>
know the condition of the stones,<br>
and what the meaning of them<br>
is?</p>
<br>
<p>48  She answering, said unto<br>
me, Art thou better than all others<br>
that this should be revealed unto<br>
thee? For others are both before<br>
thee and better than thou art,<br>
to whom these visions should be<br>
made manifest.</p>
<br>
<p>49  Nevertheless, that the name<br>
of God may be glorified, it has been<br>
shown and shall be revealed unto<br>
thee, for the sake of those who are<br>
doubtful, and think in their hearts<br>
whether these things are so or not.</p>
<br>
<p>50  Tell them that all these<br>
things are true, and that there is<br>
nothing in them that is not true<br>
but all are firm and truly<br>
established.</p>
<br>
<p>51  Hear now then concerning<br>
the stones that are in the building.</p>
<br>
<p>52  The square and white stones<br>
which agree exactly in their joints,<br>
are the apostles, and bishops, and<br>
doctors, and ministers, who<br>
through the mercy of God have<br>
come in, and governed, and taught<br>
and ministered holily and modestly<br>
to the elect of God, both they<br>
that have fallen asleep, and which<br>
yet remain; and have always<br>
agreed with them, and have had<br>
peace within themselves, and have<br>
heard each other.</p>
<br>
<p>53  For which cause their joints<br>
exactly meet together in the building<br>
of the tower.</p>
<br>
<p>54  They which are drawn out<br>
of the deep and put into the<br>
building, and whose joints agree<br>
with the other stones which are<br>
already built, are those which are<br>
already fallen asleep, and have<br>
suffered for the sake of the Lord's<br>
name.</p>
<br>
<p>55  And what are the other<br>
stones, lady, that are brought<br>
from the earth? I would know<br>
what are they.</p>
<br>
<p>56  She answered, They which<br>
lie upon the ground and are not<br>
polished, are those which God has<br>
approved, because they have<br>
walked in I the law of the Lord,<br>
and directed their ways in his<br>
commandments.</p>
<br>
<p>57 They which are brought and<br>
put in the building of the tower,<br>
are the young in faith and the<br>
faithful. And these are admonished<br>
by the angels to do well because<br>
iniquity is not found in them.</p>
<br>
<p>58  But who are those whom they<br>
rejected, and laid beside the tower?</p>
<br>
<p>59  They are such as have sinned<br>
and are willing to repent; for<br>
which cause they are not cast far<br>
from the tower, because they will<br>
be useful for the building, if they<br>
shall repent.</p>
<br>
<p>60  They therefore that are yet<br>
to repent, if they repent they shall<br>
become strong in the faith; that<br>
is, if they repent now, whilst the<br>
tower is building. For if the<br>
building shall be finished there<br>
will then be no place for them to<br>
be put in, but they shall be rejected;<br>
for he only has this privilege who<br>
shall now be put into the tower.</p>
<br>
<p>61   But would you know who<br>
they are that were cut out, and<br>
cast afar off from the tower?<br>
Lady said I, I desire it.</p>
<br>
<p>62  They are the children of iniquity,<br>
who believed only in hypocrisy,<br>
and departed not from  their evil<br>
ways; for this cause they shall not<br>
be saved, because they are not of<br>
any use in the building by reason<br>
of their sins.</p>
<br>
<p>63 Wherefore they are cut out,<br>
and cast afar off, because of the<br>
anger of the Lord, and because<br>
they have provoked him to anger<br>
against them.</p>
<br>
<p>64  As for the great number of<br>
other stones which thou hast seen<br>
placed about the tower, but now<br>
put into the building; those which<br>
are rugged, are they who have<br>
known the truth, but have not<br>
continued in it, nor been joined<br>
to the saints, and therefore are<br>
unprofitable.</p>
<br>
<p>65  Those that have clefts in<br>
them, are they that keep up discord<br>
in their hearts against each other,<br>
and live not in peace; that are<br>
friendly when present with their<br>
brethren, but as soon as they are<br>
departed from one another, their<br>
wickedness still continues in<br>
their hearts: these are the clefts<br>
which are seen in those stones.</p>
<br>
<p>66  Those that are maimed and<br>
short, are they who have believed<br>
indeed, but still are in great<br>
measure full of wickedness; for<br>
this cause they are maimed and<br>
not whole.</p>
<br>
<p>67  But what are the white and<br>
round stones, lady, and which are<br>
not proper for the building of the<br>
tower?</p>
<br>
<p>68  She answering said unto<br>
me: How long wilt thou continue<br>
foolish and without understanding,<br>
asking everything and discerning<br>
nothing?</p>
<br>
<p>69  They are such as have faith<br>
indeed, but have withal the riches<br>
of this present world. When<br>
therefore any troubles arise, for<br>
the sake of their riches and traffic,<br>
they deny the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>70  I answering, said unto her,<br>
When therefore will they be<br>
profitable to the Lord? When their<br>
riches shall be cut away, says she,<br>
in which they take delight, then<br>
they will be profitable unto the<br>
Lord for his building.</p>
<br>
<p>71  For as a round stone, unless<br>
it be cut away and is cast somewhat<br>
of its bulk, cannot be made square,<br>
so they who are rich in this world;<br>
unless their riches be pared off;<br>
cannot be made profitable unto the<br>
Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>72  Learn this from thy own<br>
experience: when thou wert rich,<br>
thou wast unprofitable; but now<br>
thou art profitable, and fit for the<br>
life which thou hast undertaken;<br>
for thou also once was one of<br>
those stones.</p>
<br>
<p>73 As for the rest of the stones<br>
which thou sawest cast afar<br>
off from the tower, and running in<br>
the way, and tumbled out of the<br>
way into desert places; they are<br>
such as have believed indeed,<br>
but through their doubting have<br>
forsaken the true way, thinking that<br>
they could find a better. But they<br>
wander and are miserable, going<br>
into desolate ways.</p>
<br>
<p>74  Then for those stones which<br>
fell into the fire and were burnt,<br>
they are those who have for ever<br>
departed from the living God;<br>
nor doth it ever come into their<br>
hearts to repent, by reason of the<br>
affection which they bear to their<br>
lusts and wickedness which they<br>
commit.</p>
<br>
<p>75  And what are the rest which<br>
fell by the water, and could not<br>
roll into the water?</p>
<br>
<p>76  They are such as have heard<br>
the word, and were willing to be<br>
baptised in the name of the Lord;<br>
but considering the great holiness<br>
which the truth requires, have<br>
withdrawn themselves, an walked<br>
again after wicked lusts.</p>
<br>
<p>77  Thus she finished the<br>
explanation of the tower.</p>
<br>
<p>78 But I being still urgent,<br>
asked her, Is there repentance<br>
allowed to all those stones which<br>
are thus cast away, and were not<br>
suitable to the building of the<br>
tower; and shall they find place<br>
in this tower?</p>
<br>
<p>79  They may repent, said she,<br>
yet they cannot come into this<br>
tower; but, they shall be placed<br>
in a much lower rank, and then<br>
only after they shall have been<br>
afflicted and fulfilled the days of<br>
their sins.</p>
<br>
<p>80  And for this cause they shall<br>
be removed, because they have<br>
received the word of righteousness:<br>
and then they shall be translated<br>
from their afflictions, if they<br>
shall have a true sense in their<br>
hearts of what they have done amiss.</p>
<br>
<p>81  But if they shall not have<br>
this sense in their hearts, they<br>
shall not be saved by reason of<br>
the hardness of their hearts.</p>
<br>
<p>82  When therefore I had done<br>
asking her concerning all these<br>
things, she said unto me, Wilt<br>
thou see something else? And<br>
being desirous of seeing it,<br>
I became very cheerful of<br>
countenances.</p>
<br>
<p>83  She therefore looking back<br>
upon me, and smiling a little, said<br>
unto me, Seest thou seven women<br>
about the tower? Lady, said I,<br>
I see them.</p>
<br>
<p>84  This tower, replied she, is<br>
supported by them, according to<br>
the command of the Lord: hear<br>
therefore the effects of them.</p>
<br>
<p>85  The first of them, which<br>
holds fast with her hand, is called<br>
Faith; The next, which is girt<br>
up, and looks manly, is named<br>
Abstinence: she is the daughter<br>
of Faith.</p>
<br>
<p>86  Whosoever therefore shall<br>
follow her shall be happy in all<br>
his life, because he shall abstain<br>
from all evil works, believing that<br>
if he shall contain himself from<br>
all concupiscence, he shall be<br>
the heir of eternal life. And<br>
what, lady, said I, are the other<br>
five?</p>
<br>
<p>87  They are, replied she, the<br>
daughters of one another. The<br>
first of them is called Simplicity;<br>
the next Innocence; the third<br>
Modesty; then Discipline; and<br>
the last of all is Charity. When<br>
therefore thou shalt have fulfilled<br>
the works of their mother, thou<br>
shalt be able to do all things.</p>
<br>
<p>88  Lady, said I, I would know<br>
what particular virtue every one<br>
of these has.</p>
<br>
<p>89  Hear then, replied she;<br>
they have equal virtues, and their<br>
virtues are knit together, and<br>
follow one another as they were<br>
born.</p>
<br>
<p>90  From Faith proceeds Abstinence;<br>
from Abstinence, Simplicity; from<br>
Simplicity, Innocence; from Innocence,<br>
Modesty; from Modesty, Discipline<br>
and Charity. Therefore the works<br>
of these are holy, and chaste, and<br>
right.</p>
<br>
<p>91  Whoever therefore shall<br>
serve these, and hold fast to their<br>
works, he shall have his dwelling<br>
in the tower with the saints of<br>
God.</p>
<br>
<p>92  Then I asked her concerning<br>
the times, whether the end were<br>
now at hand?</p>
<br>
<p>93  But she cried out with a loud<br>
voice, saying, O foolish man!<br>
Dost thou not see the tower yet a<br>
building? When therefore the<br>
tower shall be finished, and built,<br>
it shall have an end; and indeed<br>
it shall soon be accomplished.</p>
<br>
<p>94  But do not ask me any more<br>
questions. What has been said<br>
may suffice thee and all the saints<br>
for the refreshment of your spirits.<br>
For these things have not been<br>
revealed to thee only, but that<br>
thou mayest make them manifest<br>
unto all.</p>
<br>
<p>95  For therefore, O Hermas,<br>
after three days thou must understand<br>
these words which I begin<br>
to speak unto thee, that thou<br>
mayest speak them in the ears of<br>
the saints; that when thou shall<br>
have heard and done them, they<br>
may be cleansed from their<br>
iniquities, and thou together<br>
with them.</p>
<br>
<p>96  Hear me therefore, O my<br>
sons! I have bred you up in much<br>
simplicity, and innocency, and<br>
modesty, for the love of God,<br>
which has dropped down upon<br>
you in righteousness, that you<br>
should be sanctified and justified<br>
from all sin and wickedness; but<br>
ye will not cease from your evil<br>
doings.</p>
<br>
<p>97  Now therefore hearken unto<br>
me, and have peace one with another,<br>
and visit one another, and receive<br>
one another, and do not enjoy<br>
the creatures of God alone.</p>
<br>
<p>98  Give freely to them that are<br>
in need. For some by too free<br>
feeding contract an infirmity in<br>
their flesh, and do injury to their<br>
bodies; whilst the flesh of others,<br>
who have not food, withers away,<br>
because they want sufficient<br>
nourishment, and the bodies are<br>
consumed.</p>
<br>
<p>99  Wherefore this intemperance<br>
is hurtful to you, who have, and<br>
do not contribute to them that<br>
want. Prepare for the judgment<br>
that is about to come upon you.</p>
<br>
<p>100  Ye that are the more eminent,<br>
search out them that are hungry,<br>
whilst the tower is yet unfinished.<br>
For when the tower shall be finished,<br>
ye shall be willing to do good,<br>
and shall not find any place in it.</p>
<br>
<p>101  Beware, therefore, ye that<br>
glory in your riches, lest perhaps<br>
they groan who are in want, and<br>
their sighing come up unto God,<br>
and ye be shut out with your goods<br>
without the gate of the tower.</p>
<br>
<p>102  Behold I now warn you who<br>
are set over the church, and love<br>
the highest seats, be not ye like<br>
unto those that work mischief.</p>
<br>
<p>103  And they indeed carry about<br>
their poison in boxes, but ye<br>
contain your poison and infection<br>
in your hearts, and will not purge<br>
them, and mix your sense with a<br>
pure heart, that ye might find<br>
mercy with the Great King.</p>
<br>
<p>104  Take heed, my children,<br>
that your dissensions deprive you<br>
not of your lives. How will ye<br>
instruct the elect of God, when<br>
ye yourselves want correction?<br>
Wherefore admonish one another,<br>
and be at peace among yourselves,<br>
that I, standing before your<br>
Father, may give an account<br>
of you unto the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>105  And when she had made<br>
an end of talking with me, the six<br>
young men that built, came and<br>
carried her to the tower; and four<br>
others took up the seat on which<br>
she sat, and they also went away<br>
again to the tower. I saw not the<br>
faces of these, for their backs<br>
were towards me.</p>
<br>
<p>106  As she was going away, I<br>
asked her, that she would reveal<br>
to me what concerned the three<br>
forms, in which she had appeared<br>
unto me.</p>
<br>
<p>107  But she answering said unto<br>
me, concerning these things<br>
thou must ask some other, that<br>
they may be revealed unto thee.</p>
<br>
<p>108  Now, brethren, in the first<br>
vision the last year, she appeared<br>
unto me exceedingly old, and<br>
sitting in a chair.</p>
<br>
<p>109  In another vision, she had<br>
indeed a youthful face, but her<br>
flesh and hair were old; but she<br>
talked with me standing, and was<br>
more cheerful than the first time.</p>
<br>
<p>110  In the third vision, she was<br>
in all respects much younger, and<br>
comely to the eye; only she had<br>
the hair of an aged person: yet<br>
she looked cheerful, and sat upon<br>
a seat.</p>
<br>
<p>111  I was therefore very sad<br>
concerning these things, until I<br>
might understand the vision.</p>
<br>
<p>112  Wherefore I saw the same<br>
old woman in a vision of the night<br>
saying unto me, All prayer needeth<br>
humiliation. Fast, therefore, and<br>
thou shalt learn from the Lord<br>
that which thou dost ask. I fasted<br>
therefore one day.</p>
<br>
<p>113  The same night a young<br>
man appeared to me and said,<br>
Why dost thou thus often desire<br>
Revelations in thy prayers? Take<br>
heed that by asking many things,<br>
thou hurt not the body. Let these<br>
Revelations suffice thee.</p>
<br>
<p>114  Canst thou see more notable<br>
Revelations than those which<br>
thou hast already received?</p>
<br>
<p>115  I answered and said unto<br>
him, Sir, I only ask this one<br>
thing upon the account of the<br>
three figures of the old woman<br>
that appeared to me, that the<br>
Revelation may be complete.</p>
<br>
<p>116  He answered me, You are<br>
not without understanding, but<br>
your doubts make you so; for as<br>
much as you have not your heart<br>
with the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>117  I replied and said, But we<br>
shall learn these things more<br>
carefully from you.</p>
<br>
<p>118  Hear then, says he, concerning<br>
the figures about which you inquire.</p>
<br>
<p>119  To begin; in the first vision<br>
she appeared to thee in the shape<br>
of an old woman sitting in, a chair,<br>
because your old spirit was decayed,<br>
and without strength, by reason<br>
of your infirmities, and the<br>
doubtfulness of your heart.</p>
<br>
<p>120  For as they who are old<br>
have no hope of renewing<br>
themselves, nor expect any thing<br>
but their departure; so you being<br>
weakened through your worldly<br>
affairs gave yourself up to sloth,<br>
and cast not away your solicitude<br>
from yourself upon the Lord: and<br>
your sense was confused, and you<br>
grew old in your sadness.</p>
<br>
<p>121  But, sir, I would know why<br>
she sat upon a chair?</p>
<br>
<p>122  He answered, because every<br>
one that is weak sitteth upon a<br>
chair by reason of his infirmity,<br>
that his weakness may be upheld.<br>
Behold therefore the figure of the<br>
first vision.</p>
<br>
<p>123  In the second vision you<br>
saw her standing, and having a<br>
youthful face, and more cheerful<br>
than her former; but her flesh<br>
and her hair were ancient. Hear,<br>
said he, this parable also.</p>
<br>
<p>124  When any one grows old,<br>
he despairs of himself by reason<br>
of his infirmity and poverty, and<br>
expects nothing but the last day of<br>
his life.</p>
<br>
<p>125  But on a sudden an inheritance<br>
is left to him, and he hears of it,<br>
and rises: and being become<br>
cheerful, be puts on new strength.<br>
And now he no longer sits down,<br>
but stands, and is delivered from<br>
his former sorrow; and sits not,<br>
but acts manfully.</p>
<br>
<p>126  So you, having heard the<br>
Revelation which God revealed<br>
unto you, because God had<br>
compassion upon you, and renewed<br>
your spirit, both laid aside your<br>
infirmities, and strength came to<br>
you, and you grew strong in the<br>
faith; and God, seeing your<br>
strength, rejoiced.</p>
<br>
<p>127  For this cause he showed<br>
you the building of the tower,<br>
and will show other things unto you,<br>
if you shall have peace with all<br>
your heart among each other.</p>
<br>
<p>128  But in the third vision you<br>
saw her yet younger, fair and<br>
cheerful, and of a serene<br>
countenance.</p>
<br>
<p>129  For, as if some good news<br>
comes to him that is sad, he<br>
straightway forgets his sadness,<br>
and regards nothing else but the<br>
good news which he has heard;<br>
and for the rest he is comforted,<br>
and his spirit is renewed through<br>
the joy which he has received<br>
even so you have been refreshed<br>
in your spirit by seeing these good<br>
things.</p>
<br>
<p>130  And for that you saw her<br>
sitting upon a bench, it denotes a<br>
strong position; because a bench<br>
has four feet, and stands strongly.<br>
And even the world itself is upheld<br>
by the four elements.</p>
<br>
<p>131  They therefore that repent<br>
perfectly, shall be young; and<br>
they that turn from their sins<br>
with their whole heart, shall<br>
be established.</p>
<br>
<p>132  And now you have the<br>
Revelation fully, ask no more<br>
to have any thing farther<br>
revealed unto you.</p>
<br>
<p>133  But if any thing is to be<br>
revealed, it shall be made manifest<br>
unto you.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>VISION IV.</p>
<br>
<p>     Of the trial, and tribulation that is about<br>
     to come upon men.</p>
<br>
<p>I SAW a vision brethren, twenty<br>
days after the former vision;<br>
a representation of the tribulation<br>
that is at hand. I was walking in<br>
the field way.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Now from the public way to<br>
the place whither I went is about<br>
ten furlongs; it is a way very<br>
little frequented:</p>
<br>
<p>3  And as I was walking alone, I<br>
entreated the Lord that he would<br>
confirm the Revelations which he<br>
had shown unto me by his Holy<br>
Church.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And would grant repentance<br>
to all his servants who had been<br>
offended, that his great and<br>
honourable name might be glorified,<br>
and because he thought me worthy<br>
to whom he might show his wonders,<br>
and, that I might honour him,<br>
and give thanks unto him.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And behold somewhat like a<br>
voice answered me; Doubt not,<br>
Hermas. Wherefore I began to<br>
think, and say within myself, why<br>
should I doubt, seeing I am thus<br>
settled by the Lord, and have seen<br>
such glorious things?</p>
<br>
<p>6  I had gone but a little farther,<br>
brethren, when behold I saw a<br>
dust rise up to heaven. I began<br>
to say within myself, is there a<br>
drove of cattle coming, that rises<br>
such a dust?</p>
<br>
<p>7  It was about a furlong off from<br>
me. And behold I saw the dust<br>
rise more and more, insomuch that<br>
I began to suspect that there was<br>
somewhat extraordinary in it.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And the sun shone a little;<br>
and behold I saw a great beast, as<br>
it were a whale; and fiery locusts<br>
came out of his mouth. The height<br>
of the beast was about a hundred<br>
feet, and he had a head like a<br>
large earthen vessel.</p>
<br>
<p>9  I began to weep, and to pray<br>
unto the Lord that he would deliver<br>
me from it. Then I called to mind<br>
the word which I had heard;<br>
Doubt not, Hermas.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Wherefore, brethren, putting<br>
on a divine faith, and remembering<br>
who it was that had taught me great<br>
things, I delivered myself bodily<br>
unto the beast.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Now the beast came on in<br>
such a manner, as if it could at<br>
once have devoured a city.</p>
<br>
<p>12  I came near unto it, and the<br>
beast extended its whole bulk upon<br>
the ground, and put forth nothing<br>
but its tongue, nor once moved itself<br>
till I had quite passed by it.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Now the beast had upon its<br>
head four colours; first black,<br>
then a red and bloody colour, then<br>
a golden, and then a white.</p>
<br>
<p>14  After that I had passed by<br>
it, and was gone forward about<br>
thirty feet, behold there met me a<br>
certain virgin, well adorned as if<br>
she had been just come out of her<br>
bride-chamber; all in white, having<br>
on white shoes, and a veil down her<br>
face, and covered with shining hair.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Now I knew by my former<br>
visions that it was the church,<br>
and thereupon grew the more cheerful.<br>
She saluted me, saying, Hail, O Man!<br>
I returned the salutation, saying,<br>
Lady, Hail!</p>
<br>
<p>16  She answering said unto me,<br>
Did nothing meet you, O man!<br>
I replied, Lady, there met me such<br>
a beast, as seemed able to devour<br>
a whole people; but by the power<br>
of God, and through his singular<br>
mercy, I escaped it.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Thou didst escape it well,<br>
said she, because thou didst cast<br>
thy whole care upon God, and<br>
opened thy heart unto him,<br>
believing that thou couldst be safe<br>
by no other than by his great and<br>
honourable name.</p>
<br>
<p>18  For this cause the Lord sent<br>
his angel, who is over the beast,<br>
whose name is Hegrin, and stopped<br>
his mouth, that he should not<br>
devour thee, Thou hast escaped<br>
a great trial through thy faith, and<br>
because thou didst not doubt for<br>
such a terrible beast.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Go, therefore, and relate to<br>
the elect of God the great things<br>
that he hath done for thee. And<br>
thou shalt say unto them, that this<br>
beast is the figure of the trial that<br>
is about to come.</p>
<br>
<p>20  If, therefore, ye shall have<br>
prepared yourselves, ye may escape<br>
it, if your hearts be pure and<br>
without spot; and if ye shall serve<br>
God all the rest of your days<br>
without complaint.</p>
<br>
<p>21  Cast all your care upon the<br>
Lord, and he will direct them.<br>
Believe in God, ye doubtful,<br>
because he can do all things;<br>
he can both turn away his wrath<br>
from you, and send you help and<br>
security.</p>
<br>
<p>22  Woe to the doubtful, to those<br>
who shall hear these words, and<br>
shall despise them: it had been<br>
better for them that they had not<br>
been born.</p>
<br>
<p>23  Then I asked her concerning<br>
the four colours which the beast<br>
had upon its head. But she<br>
answered me saying; Again thou<br>
art curious in that thou asketh<br>
concerning these things. But I<br>
said to her, Lady, chew me what<br>
they are?</p>
<br>
<p>24  Hear, said she; The black<br>
which thou sawest denotes the<br>
world in which you dwell. The<br>
fiery and bloody colour signifies<br>
that this age must be destroyed<br>
by fire and blood.</p>
<br>
<p>25  The golden part are ye, who<br>
have escaped out of it; for as gold<br>
is tried by the fire, and is made<br>
profitable, so are ye also in like<br>
manner tried who dwell among the<br>
men of this world.</p>
<br>
<p>26  They therefore, that shall<br>
endure to the end, and be proved<br>
by them, shall be purged. And as<br>
gold, by this trial, is cleansed<br>
and loses its dross, so shall ye<br>
also cast away all sorrow and<br>
trouble, and be made pure for<br>
the building of the tower.</p>
<br>
<p>27  But the white colour denotes<br>
the time of the world which is to<br>
come, in which the elect of God<br>
shall dwell: because the elect of<br>
God shall be pure and without<br>
spot until life eternal.</p>
<br>
<p>28  Wherefore do not thou cease<br>
to speak these thing in the ears of<br>
the saints. Here ye have the figure<br>
of the great tribulation that is<br>
about to come; which, if you<br>
please, shall be nothing to you.</p>
<br>
<p>29  When she had spoken thus<br>
much, she departed; but I saw<br>
not whither she went. But suddenly<br>
I heard a noise, and I turned<br>
back, being afraid, for I thought<br>
that the beast was coming toward<br>
me.</p>

<h2>
                         THE SECOND PART OF THE<br>
                  BOOK OF HERMAS, CALLED HIS COMMANDS.</h2></center>
<br><br><br>
<p>
Introduction.</p>
<br>
<p>WHEN I had prayed at home,<br>
and was sat down upon the<br>
bed, a certain man came in to me<br>
with a reverend look, in the habit<br>
of a Shepherd, clothed with a white<br>
cloak, having his bag upon his<br>
back, and his staff in his hand, and<br>
saluted me.</p>
<br>
<p>2  I returned his salutation, and<br>
immediately he sat down by me,<br>
and said unto me, I am sent by<br>
that venerable messenger, that<br>
I should dwell with thee all the<br>
remaining days of thy life.</p>
<br>
<p>3  But I thought that he was<br>
come to try me, and said unto him,<br>
Who are you? For I know to<br>
whom I am committed. He said<br>
unto me, Do you not know me?<br>
I answered no. I am, said he,<br>
that shepherd to whose care you<br>
are delivered.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Whilst he was yet speaking,<br>
his shape was changed; and when<br>
I knew that it was he to whom I<br>
was committed, I was ashamed,<br>
and a sudden fear came upon me,<br>
and I was utterly overcome with<br>
sadness, because I had spoken so<br>
foolishly unto him.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But he said unto me, Be not<br>
ashamed, but receive strength in<br>
thy mind, through the commands<br>
which I am about to deliver unto<br>
thee. For, said he, I am sent to<br>
show unto thee all those things<br>
again, which thou hast seen before,<br>
but especially such of them as may<br>
be of most use unto thee.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And first of all write my<br>
Commands and Similitudes, the rest<br>
thou shall so write as I shall show<br>
unto thee. But I therefore bid<br>
thee first of all write my Commands<br>
and Similitudes, that by often<br>
reading of them thou mayest<br>
the more easily keep them in<br>
memory.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Whereupon I wrote his Commands<br>
and Similitudes, as he bade me.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Which things if when you<br>
have heard, ye shall observe to do<br>
them, and shall walk according to<br>
them, and exercise yourselves in<br>
them with a pure mind, ye shall<br>
receive from the Lord those things<br>
which he has promised unto you.</p>
<br>
<p>9  But if having heard them ye<br>
shall not repent, but shall still go<br>
on to add to your sins, ye shall<br>
be punished by him.</p>
<br>
<p>10  All these things that Shepherd,<br>
the angel of repentance, commanded<br>
me to write.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>COMMAND I.</p>
<br>
<p>     Of believing in one God.</p>
<br>
<p>FIRST of all believe that<br>
there is one God who created and<br>
brought all things out of nothing<br>
into existence.</p>
<br>
<p>2  He comprehends all things,<br>
and is only INFINITE, not to be<br>
comprehended by any.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Who can neither be defined<br>
by any words, nor conceived by<br>
the mind.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Therefore believe in him, and<br>
fear him; and fearing him abstain<br>
from all evil.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Keep these things, and cast<br>
all lust and iniquity far from<br>
thee, and put on righteousness,<br>
and thou shalt live to God, if thou<br>
shalt keep his commandment.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>COMMAND II.</p>
<br>
<p>     That we must avoid detraction, and do our<br>
     alms-deeds with simplicity.</p>
<br>
<p>HE said unto me, Be innocent<br>
and without disguise; so shalt<br>
thou be like an infant who knows<br>
no malice which destroys the<br>
life of man.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Especially see that thou speak<br>
evil of none, nor willingly hear<br>
any one speak evil of others.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For if thou observest not this,<br>
thou also who hearest shall be<br>
partaker of the sin of him that<br>
speaketh evil, by believing the<br>
slander, and thou also shalt have<br>
sin, because thou believedst him<br>
that spoke evil of thy brother.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Detraction is a pernicious<br>
thing; an inconstant, evil spirit;<br>
that never continues in peace, but<br>
is always in discord. Wherefore<br>
refrain thyself from it, and keep<br>
peace ever more with thy brother.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Put on an holy constancy,<br>
in which there are no sins, but<br>
all is full of joy; and do good<br>
of thy labours.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Give without distinction to<br>
all that are in want, not doubting<br>
to whom thou givest.</p>
<br>
<p>7  But give to all, for God will<br>
have us give to all, of all his own<br>
gifts. They therefore that receive<br>
shall give an account to God, both<br>
wherefore they received and for<br>
what end.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And they that receive without<br>
real need, shall give an account<br>
for it; but he that gives shall be<br>
innocent.</p>
<br>
<p>9  For he has fulfilled his duty<br>
as he received it from God; not<br>
making any choice to whom he<br>
should give, and to whom not.<br>
And this service he did with<br>
simplicity and to the glory<br>
of God.</p>
<br>
<p>10 Keep therefore this command<br>
according as I have delivered it<br>
into thee: that thy repentance<br>
nay be found to be sincere, and<br>
that good may come to thy house;<br>
and have a pure heart.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>COMMAND III.</p>
<br>
<p>     Of avoiding lying, and the repentance of Hermas<br>
     for his dissimulation.</p>
<br>
<p>MOREOVER he said unto me<br>
love truth; and let all the<br>
speech be true which proceeds out<br>
of thy mouth.</p>
<br>
<p>2  That the spirit which the Lord<br>
hath given to dwell in thy flesh<br>
may be found true towards all<br>
men; and the Lord be glorified,<br>
who hath given such a spirit unto<br>
thee: because God is true in all<br>
his words, and in him there is no<br>
lie.</p>
<br>
<p>3  They therefore that lie, deny<br>
the Lord, and become robbers of<br>
the Lord, not rendering to God<br>
what they received from him.</p>
<br>
<p>4  For they received the spirit<br>
free from lying: If therefore they<br>
make that a liar, they defile what<br>
was committed to them by the<br>
Lord, and become deceivers.</p>
<br>
<p>5  When I heard this, I wept<br>
bitterly; and when he saw me<br>
weeping, he said unto me, Why<br>
weepest thou? And I said, Because,<br>
sir, I doubt whether I can be saved.</p>
<br>
<p>6  He asked me, Wherefore?<br>
I replied, Because, sir, I never<br>
spake a true word in my life; but<br>
always lived in dissimulation, and<br>
affirmed a lie for truth to all men;<br>
and no man contradicted me, but<br>
all gave credit to my words. How<br>
then can I live, seeing I have done<br>
in this manner?</p>
<br>
<p>7  And he said unto me, Thou<br>
thinkest well and truly; for thou<br>
oughtest, as the servant of God,<br>
to have walked in the truth, and<br>
not have joined an evil conscience<br>
with the spirit of truth, nor have<br>
grieved the holy and true Spirit<br>
of God.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And I replied unto him,<br>
Sir, I never before hearkened<br>
so diligently to these things.<br>
He answered, Now thou hearest them<br>
Take care from henceforth, that<br>
even those things which thou hast<br>
formerly spoken falsely for the<br>
sake of thy business, may, by<br>
thy present truth receive pardon.</p>
<br>
<p>9  For even those things may<br>
be forgiven, if for the time to come<br>
thou shalt speak the truth; and<br>
by so doing thou mayest attain<br>
unto life.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And whosoever shall hearken<br>
unto this command, and do it,<br>
and shall depart from all lying,<br>
he shall live unto God.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>COMMAND IV.</p>
<br>
<p>     Of putting away one's wife for adultery.</p>
<br>
<p>FURTHERMORE, said he, I<br>
command thee, that thou keep<br>
thyself chaste; and that thou<br>
suffer not any thought of any<br>
other marriage, or of fornication,<br>
to enter into thy heart; for such<br>
a thought produces great sin.</p>
<br>
<p>2  But be thou at all times mindful<br>
of the Lord, and thou shalt never<br>
sin. For if such an evil thought<br>
should arise in thy heart, then<br>
thou shall be guilty of a great<br>
sin; and they who do such things,<br>
follow the way of death.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Look therefore to thyself, and<br>
keep thyself from such a thought;<br>
for where chastity remains in the<br>
heart of a righteous man, there an<br>
evil thought ought never to arise.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And I said unto him, Sir,<br>
suffer me to speak a little to you.<br>
He bade me say on. And I answered,<br>
Sir, if a man that is faithful<br>
in the Lord shall have a wife,<br>
and shall catch her in adultery;<br>
doth a man sin that continues to<br>
live still with her?</p>
<br>
<p>5  And he said unto me, As long<br>
as he is ignorant of her sin, he<br>
commits no fault in living with<br>
her; but if a man shall know his<br>
wife to, have offended, and she<br>
shall not repent of her sin, but go<br>
on still in her fornication, and a<br>
man shall continue nevertheless<br>
to live with her, he shall become<br>
guilty of her sin, and partake with<br>
her in her adultery.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And I said unto him, What<br>
therefore is to be done, if the<br>
woman continues on in her sin?<br>
He answered, Let her husband put<br>
her away, and let him continue<br>
by himself; but if he shall put<br>
away his wife and marry another,<br>
he also doth commit adultery.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And I said, What, if the<br>
woman that is so put away, should<br>
repent, and be willing to return<br>
to her husband, shall she not be<br>
received by him? He said unto me,<br>
Yes; and if her husband shall<br>
not receive her, he will sin, and<br>
commit a great offence against<br>
himself; for he ought to receive<br>
the offender, if she repents: only<br>
not often.</p>
<br>
<p>8  For, to the servants of God,<br>
there is but one repentance; and<br>
for this cause a man that putteth<br>
away his wife ought not to take<br>
another, because she may repent.</p>
<br>
<p>9  This act is alike both in the<br>
man and in the woman. Now they<br>
commit adultery, not only who<br>
pollute their flesh, but who<br>
also make an image. If therefore<br>
a woman perseveres in any thing<br>
of this kind, and repents not,<br>
depart from her; and live not with<br>
her, otherwise thou also shalt be<br>
partaker of her sin.</p>
<br>
<p>10  But it is therefore commanded<br>
that both the man and the woman<br>
should remain unmarried, because<br>
such persons may repent.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Nor do I in this administer<br>
any occasion for the doing of these<br>
things; but rather that whoso has<br>
offended, should not offend any<br>
more.</p>
<br>
<p>12  But for their former sins,<br>
God who has the power of healing<br>
will give a remedy; for he has<br>
the power of all things.</p>
<br>
<p>13  I asked him again, and<br>
said, Seeing the Lord hath thought<br>
me worthy that thou shouldest<br>
dwell with me continually, speak<br>
a few words unto me, because I<br>
understand nothing, and my heart<br>
is hardened through my former<br>
conversation; and open my<br>
understanding because I am very<br>
dull, and apprehend nothing at all.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And he answering said<br>
unto me, I am the minister of<br>
repentance, and give understanding<br>
to all that repent. Does it not<br>
seem to thee to be a very wise<br>
thing to repent? Because he that<br>
does so gets great understanding.</p>
<br>
<p>15  For he is sensible that he<br>
hath sinned and done wickedly in<br>
the sight of the Lord, and he<br>
remembers within himself that he<br>
has offended, and repents and does<br>
no more wickedly, but does that<br>
which is good, and humbles his<br>
soul and afflicts it, because he has<br>
offended. You see therefore that<br>
repentance is great wisdom.</p>
<br>
<p>16  And I said unto him, For this<br>
cause, sir, I inquire diligently<br>
into all things, because I am a<br>
sinner, that I may know what I<br>
must do that I may live; because<br>
my sins are many.</p>
<br>
<p>17  And he said unto me, Thou<br>
shalt live if thou shalt keep these<br>
my commandments. And whosoever<br>
shall hear and do these commands<br>
shall live unto God.</p>
<br>
<p>18  And I said unto him, I have<br>
even now heard from certain<br>
teachers, that there is no other<br>
repentance beside that of baptism,<br>
when we go down into the water,<br>
and receive the forgiveness of our<br>
sins; and that after that, we must<br>
sin no more, but live in purity.</p>
<br>
<p>19  And he said unto me, Thou<br>
hast been rightly informed. Never-<br>
the-less seeing now thou inquirest<br>
diligently into all things, I will<br>
manifest this also unto thee; yet<br>
not so as to give any occasion of<br>
sinning, either to those who shall<br>
hereafter believe, or to those<br>
who have already believed in the<br>
Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>20  For neither they who have<br>
newly believed, or shall hereafter<br>
believe, have any repentance of sins,<br>
but forgiveness of them.</p>
<br>
<p>21  But as to those who have<br>
been called to the faith, and since<br>
that are fallen into any gross sin,<br>
the Lord hath appointed repentance,<br>
because God knoweth the thoughts<br>
of all men's hearts, and their<br>
infirmities, and the manifold<br>
wickedness of the devil, who is<br>
always contriving something<br>
against the servants of God, and<br>
maliciously lays snares for them.</p>
<br>
<p>22  Therefore our merciful Lord<br>
had compassion towards his creature,<br>
and appointed that repentance, and<br>
gave unto me the power of it. And<br>
therefore I say unto thee, if any<br>
one after that great and holy<br>
calling shall be tempted by the<br>
devil and sin, he has one repentance.<br>
But if he shall often sin and repent,<br>
it shall not profit such a one;<br>
for he shall hardly live unto God.</p>
<br>
<p>23  And I said, Sir, I am restored<br>
again to life since I have thus<br>
diligently hearkened to these<br>
commands. For I perceive that if I<br>
shall not hereafter add any more<br>
of my sins, I shall be saved.</p>
<br>
<p>24  And he said, Thou shalt be<br>
saved: and so shall all others, as<br>
many as shall observe these<br>
commandments.</p>
<br>
<p>25 And again I said unto him,<br>
Sir, seeing thou hearest me<br>
patiently, show me yet one thing<br>
more. Tell me, saith he, what it<br>
is.</p>
<br>
<p>26  And I said, If a husband or<br>
a wife die, and the party which<br>
survives marry again, does he sin<br>
in so doing? He that marries<br>
says he, sins not: howbeit, if<br>
he shall remain single, he shall<br>
thereby gain to himself great<br>
honour before the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>27  Keep therefore thy chastity<br>
and modesty, and thou shalt live<br>
unto God. Observe from henceforth<br>
those things which I speak<br>
with thee, and command thee to<br>
observe, from the time that I<br>
have been delivered unto thee, and<br>
dwell in thy house.</p>
<br>
<p>28  So shall thy former sins be<br>
forgiven, if thou shalt keep these<br>
my commandments. And in like<br>
manner shall all others be forgiven,<br>
who shall observe these my commandments.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>COMMAND V.</p>
<br>
<p>     Of the sadness of the heart, and of patience.</p>
<br>
<p>Be patient, says he, and long-<br>
suffering; so shalt thou have<br>
dominion over all wicked works,<br>
and shall fulfil all righteousness.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For if thou shalt be patient,<br>
the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in<br>
thee shall be pure, and not be<br>
darkened by any evil spirit; but<br>
being full of joy shall be enlarged,<br>
and feast in the body in which it<br>
dwells, and serve the Lord with<br>
joy, and in great peace.</p>
<br>
<p>3  But if any anger shall overtake<br>
thee, presently the Holy Spirit<br>
which is in thee will be straightened<br>
and seek to depart from thee.</p>
<br>
<p>4  For he is choked by the evil<br>
spirit, and has not the liberty of<br>
serving the Lord as he would; for<br>
he is grieved by anger. When,<br>
therefore, both these spirits dwell<br>
together, it is destructive to a<br>
man.</p>
<br>
<p>5  As if one should take a little<br>
wormwood, and put it into a vessel<br>
of honey, the whole honey would<br>
be spoiled; and a great quantity<br>
of honey is corrupted by a very<br>
little wormwood, and loses the<br>
sweetness of honey, and is no<br>
longer acceptable to its Lord<br>
because the whole honey is made<br>
bitter, and loses its use.</p>
<br>
<p>6  But if no wormwood be put<br>
into the honey, it is sweet and<br>
profitable to its Lord. Thus is<br>
forbearance sweeter than honey,<br>
and profitable to the Lord who<br>
dwelleth in it.</p>
<br>
<p>7  But anger is unprofitable.<br>
If therefore anger shall be mixed<br>
with forbearance, the soul is<br>
distressed, and its prayer is<br>
not profitable with God.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And I said unto him, Sir,<br>
I would know the sinfulness of<br>
anger, that I may keep myself from<br>
it. And he said unto me, Thou<br>
shall know it; and if thou shalt<br>
not keep thyself from it, thou shalt<br>
lose thy hope with all thy house.<br>
Wherefore depart from it.</p>
<br>
<p>9  For I the messenger of<br>
righteousness am with thee, and<br>
all that depart from it: as many<br>
as shall repent with all their hearts,<br>
shall live unto God; and I will be with<br>
them, and will keep them all.</p>
<br>
<p>10  For all such as have repented<br>
have been justified by the most<br>
holy messenger, who is a minister<br>
of salvation.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And now, says he, hear<br>
the wickedness of anger; how<br>
evil and hurtful is is, and how it<br>
overthrows the servants of God;<br>
for it cannot hurt those that are<br>
full of faith because the power<br>
of God is with them; but it<br>
overthrows the doubtful, and those<br>
that are destitute of faith.</p>
<br>
<p>12  For as often as it sees such<br>
men, it casts itself into their<br>
hearts; and so a man or woman<br>
is in bitterness for nothing: for<br>
the things of life, or for sustenance,<br>
or for a vain word, if any should<br>
chance to fall in; or by reason<br>
of any friend, or for a debt,<br>
or for any other superfluous<br>
things of the like nature.</p>
<br>
<p>13  For these things are foolish,<br>
and superfluous, and vain to the<br>
servants of God. But equanimity<br>
is strong, and forcible; and of<br>
great power, and sitteth in great<br>
enlargement; is cheerful, rejoicing<br>
in peace; and glorifying God at<br>
all times I with meekness.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And this long-suffering<br>
dwells with those that are full of<br>
faith. But anger is foolish, and<br>
light, and empty. Now bitterness<br>
is bred through folly; by<br>
bitterness, anger; by anger, fury;<br>
and this fury arising from so<br>
many evil principles, worketh a<br>
great and incurable sin.</p>
<br>
<p>15  For when all these things,<br>
are in the same man in which the<br>
Holy Spirit dwells, the vessel<br>
cannot contain them, but runs<br>
over: and because the Spirit being<br>
tender cannot tarry with the evil<br>
one; it departs and dwells with<br>
him that is meek.</p>
<br>
<p>16  When, therefore, it is<br>
departed from the man in whom it<br>
dwelt, that man becomes destitute<br>
of the Holy Spirit, and is afterwards<br>
filled with wicked spirits, and<br>
is blinded with evil thoughts.<br>
Thus doth it happen to all angry<br>
men.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Wherefore depart then from<br>
anger, and put on equanimity, and<br>
resist: wrath; so then shalt be<br>
found with modesty and chastity<br>
by God. Take good heed, therefore,<br>
that thou neglect not this commandment.</p>
<br>
<p>18. For if thou shalt obey this<br>
command, then thou shalt also be<br>
able to observe the other commandments<br>
which I shall command thee.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Wherefore strengthen thyself<br>
now in these commands, that then<br>
mayest live unto God. And whosoever<br>
shall observe these commandments<br>
shall live unto God.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>COMMAND VI.</p>
<br>
<p>     That every man has two angels and of the<br>
     suggestions of both.</p>
<br>
<p>I COMMANDED thee, said he,<br>
in my first commandments,<br>
that thou shouldst keep faith and<br>
fear, and repentance. Yes, sir,<br>
said I.</p>
<br>
<p>2  He continued. But now I<br>
will shew thee the virtues of these<br>
commands, that then mayest know<br>
their effects; how they are<br>
prescribed alike to the just<br>
and unjust.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Do thou therefore believe the<br>
righteous, but give no credit to<br>
the unrighteous. For righteousness<br>
keepeth the right way, but<br>
unrighteousness the wicked way.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Do thou therefore keep the<br>
right way, and leave that which is<br>
evil. For the evil way has not a<br>
good end, but hath many stumbling-<br>
blocks; it is rugged and full<br>
of thorns, and leads to destruction;<br>
and it is hurtful to all such<br>
as walk in it.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But they who go in the right<br>
way walk with evenness, and without<br>
offence; because it is not rough<br>
nor thorny.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Thou seest therefore how it is<br>
best to walk in this way. Thou<br>
shalt therefore go, says he, and all<br>
others, as many as believe in God<br>
with all their heart, shall go<br>
through it.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And now, says he, I understand<br>
first of all what belongs to faith.<br>
There are two angels with man;<br>
one of righteousness, the other<br>
of iniquity.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And I said unto him, Sir,<br>
how shall I know that there are<br>
two such angels with man? Hear,<br>
says he, and understand.</p>
<br>
<p>9  The angel of righteousness,<br>
is mild and modest, and gentle,<br>
and quiet. When, therefore, he<br>
gets into thy heart, immediately<br>
he talks with thee of righteousness,<br>
of modesty, of chastity, of<br>
bountifulness, of forgiveness,<br>
of charity, and piety.</p>
<br>
<p>10  When all these things come<br>
into thy heart, know then that the<br>
angel of righteousness is with thee.<br>
Wherefore hearken to this angel<br>
and to his works.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Learn also the works of the<br>
angel of iniquity. He is first of<br>
all bitter, and angry, and foolish;<br>
and his works are pernicious, and<br>
overthrow the servants of God.<br>
When therefore these things come<br>
into thine heart; thou shalt know<br>
by his works, that this is the angel<br>
of iniquity.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And I said unto him, Sir,<br>
how shall I understand these<br>
things? Hear, says he, and<br>
understand; When anger overtakes<br>
thee, or bitterness, know that he is<br>
in thee:</p>
<br>
<p>13  As also, when the desire of<br>
many things, and of the best meats,<br>
and of drunkenness; when the<br>
love of what belongs to others,<br>
pride, and much speaking, and<br>
ambition; and the like things,<br>
come upon thee.</p>
<br>
<p>14  When therefore these things<br>
arise in thine heart, know that the<br>
angel of iniquity is with thee.<br>
Seeing therefore thou knowest his<br>
works, depart from them all, and<br>
give no credit to him: because his<br>
works are evil, and become not the<br>
servants of God.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Here therefore thou hast<br>
the works of both these angels.<br>
Understand now and believe the<br>
angel of righteousness, because<br>
his instruction is good.</p>
<br>
<p>16  For let a man be never so<br>
happy; yet if the thoughts of the<br>
other angel arise in his heart, that<br>
man or woman must needs sin.</p>
<br>
<p>17  But let man or woman be<br>
never so wicked, if the works of<br>
the angel of righteousness come<br>
into their hearts, that man or<br>
woman must needs do some good.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Thou seest therefore how<br>
it is good to follow the angel of<br>
righteousness. If therefore thou<br>
shall follow him, and submit to<br>
his works, thou shalt live unto God.<br>
And as many as shall submit to<br>
his work shall live also unto God.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>COMMAND VII.</p>
<br>
<p>     That we must fear God but not the Devil.</p>
<br>
<p>FEAR God, says he, and keep<br>
his commandments. For if<br>
thou keepest his commandments<br>
thou shalt be powerful in every<br>
work, and all thy works shall be<br>
excellent. For by fearing God,<br>
thou shalt do everything well.</p>
<br>
<p>2  This is that tear with which<br>
thou must be affected that thou<br>
mayest be saved. But fear not<br>
the Devil: for if thou fearest the<br>
Lord, thou shalt have dominion<br>
over him; because there is no<br>
power in him.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Now if there be no power in<br>
him, then neither is he to be<br>
feared: for every one that has<br>
power, is to be feared. But he<br>
that has no power is despised by<br>
every one.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Fear the works of the Devil,<br>
because they are evil. For by<br>
fearing the Lord, thou wilt fear<br>
and do not the works of the Devil,<br>
but keep thyself from them.</p>
<br>
<p>5  There is therefore a twofold<br>
fear; if thou wilt not do evil, fear<br>
the Lord and thou shalt not do it.<br>
But if thou wilt do good, the fear<br>
of the Lord is strong, and great<br>
and glorious.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Wherefore, fear God and thou<br>
shalt live: and whosoever shall<br>
fear him, and keep his commandments,<br>
their life is with the Lord.<br>
But they who keep them not,<br>
neither is there life in them.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>COMMAND VIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     That we must flee from evil, and do good works.</p>
<br>
<p>I HAVE told thee, said he,<br>
that there are two kinds of<br>
creatures of the Lord, and that<br>
there is a two-fold abstinence.<br>
From some things therefore thou<br>
must abstain, and from others not.</p>
<br>
<p>2  I answered, Declare to me,<br>
sir, from what I must abstain, and<br>
from what not. Hearken, said he,<br>
Keep thyself from evil, and do it<br>
not; yet abstain not from good,<br>
but do it. For if thou shalt abstain<br>
from what is good, and not do it,<br>
thou shalt sin. Abstain therefore<br>
from all evil, and thou shalt know<br>
all righteousness.</p>
<br>
<p>3  I said, What evil things are<br>
they from which I must abstain?<br>
Hearken, said he; from adultery,<br>
from drunkenness, from riots, from<br>
excess of eating, from daintiness<br>
and dishonesty, from pride, from<br>
fraud, from lying, from detraction,<br>
from hypocrisy, from remembrance<br>
of injuries, and from all evil<br>
speaking.</p>
<br>
<p>4  For these are the works of<br>
iniquity, from which the servant<br>
of God must abstain. For he that<br>
cannot keep himself from these<br>
things, cannot live unto God.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But hear, said he, what<br>
follows of these kind of things:<br>
for indeed many more there are<br>
from which the servant of God must<br>
abstain. From theft, and cheating;<br>
from false witness, from covetousness,<br>
from boasting, and all other things<br>
of the like nature.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Do these things seem to thee<br>
to be evil or not? Indeed they<br>
are very evil to the servants of<br>
God, Wherefore the servant of<br>
God must abstain from all these<br>
works.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Keep thyself therefore from<br>
them, that thou mayest live unto<br>
God, and be written among those<br>
that abstain from them. And thus<br>
have I shown thee what things<br>
thou must avoid: now learn from<br>
what thou must not abstain.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Abstain not from any good<br>
works, but do them. Hear, said<br>
he, what the virtue of those good<br>
works is which thou must do, that<br>
thou mayest be saved. The first<br>
of all is faith; the fear of the<br>
Lord; charity; concord; equity;<br>
truth; patience; chastity.</p>
<br>
<p>9  There is nothing better than<br>
these things in the life of men;<br>
who shall keep and do these<br>
things in their life. Hear next<br>
what follow these.</p>
<br>
<p>10  To minister to the widows;<br>
not to despise the fatherless and<br>
poor; to redeem the servants of<br>
God from necessity; to be hospitable<br>
(for in hospitality there is<br>
sometimes great fruit); not to be<br>
contentious, but be quiet.</p>
<br>
<p>11  To be humble above all men;<br>
to reverence the aged; to labour<br>
to be righteous; to respect the<br>
brotherhood; to bear affronts; to<br>
be long-suffering; not to cast<br>
away those that have fallen from<br>
the faith, but to convert them, and<br>
make them be of good cheer: to<br>
admonish sinners; not to oppress<br>
those that are our debtors; and all<br>
other things of a like kind.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Do these things seem to thee<br>
to be good or not? And I said,<br>
What can be better than these<br>
words? Live then, said he, in<br>
these commandments, and do not<br>
depart from them. For if thou<br>
shalt keep all these commandments,<br>
thou shalt live unto God. And all<br>
they that shall keep these<br>
commandments shall live unto God.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>COMMAND IX.</p>
<br>
<p>     That we must ask of God daily;<br>
     and without doubting.</p>
<br>
<p>AGAIN he said unto me; remove from<br>
thee all doubting; and question<br>
nothing at all when thou askest<br>
any thing of the Lord; saying<br>
within thyself, how shall I<br>
be able to ask any thing of the<br>
Lord and receive it, seeing I have<br>
so greatly sinned against him?</p>
<br>
<p>2  Do not think thus, but turn<br>
unto the Lord with all thy heart,<br>
and ask of him without doubting,<br>
and thou shalt know the mercy of<br>
the Lord; bow that he will not<br>
forsake thee, but will fulfil the<br>
request of thy soul.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For God is not as men, mindful<br>
of the injuries he has received;<br>
but he forgets injuries, and has<br>
compassion upon his creature.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Wherefore purify thy heart<br>
from all the vices of this present<br>
world; and observe the commands<br>
I have before delivered unto thee<br>
from God; and thon shall receive<br>
whatsoever good things thou shalt<br>
ask, and nothing shall be wanting<br>
unto thee of all thy petitions; if<br>
thou shalt ask of the Lord without<br>
doubting.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But they that are not such,<br>
shall obtain none of those things<br>
which they ask. For they that are<br>
full of faith, ask all things with<br>
confidence, and receive from the<br>
Lord, because they ask without<br>
doubting. But he that doubts,<br>
shall hardly live unto God, except<br>
he repent.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Wherefore purify thy heart<br>
from doubting, and put on faith,<br>
and trust in God, and thou shall<br>
receive all that thou shalt ask.<br>
But if thou shouldest chance to<br>
ask something, and not immediately<br>
receive it, yet do not therefore<br>
doubt, because thou hast not<br>
presently received the petition<br>
of thy soul.</p>
<br>
<p>7  For it may be thou shalt not<br>
presently receive it for thy trial,<br>
or else for some sin which thou<br>
knowest not. But do not thou<br>
leave off to ask, and then thou<br>
shalt receive. Else if thou shalt<br>
cease to ask, thou must complain<br>
of thyself, and not of God, that he<br>
has not given unto thee what thou<br>
didst desire.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Consider therefore this doubting<br>
how cruel and pernicious it is;<br>
and how it utterly roots out many<br>
from the faith, who were very<br>
faithful and firm. For this doubting<br>
is the daughter of the Devil, and<br>
deals very wickedly with the<br>
servants of God.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Despise it therefore, and thou<br>
shalt rule over it on every occasion.<br>
Put on a firm and powerful faith:<br>
for faith promises all things<br>
and perfects all things. But<br>
doubting will not believe that it<br>
shall obtain any thing by all that<br>
it can do.</p>
<br>
<p>10.  Thou seest therefore, says<br>
he, how faith cometh from above<br>
from God; and hath great power.<br>
But doubting is an earthly spirit,<br>
and proceedeth from the Devil,<br>
and has no strength.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Do thou therefore keep the<br>
virtue of faith, and depart from<br>
doubting, in which is no virtue,<br>
and thou shalt live unto God. And<br>
all shall live unto God, as many<br>
as do these things.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>COMMAND X.</p>
<br>
<p>     Of the sadness of the heart; and that<br>
     we must take, heed not to grieve the<br>
     spirit of God that is in us.</p>
<br>
<p>PUT all sadness far from thee;<br>
for it is the sister of doubting<br>
and of anger.  How, sir, said I<br>
is it the sister of these? For<br>
sadness, and anger, and doubting,<br>
seem to me to be very different<br>
from one another.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And he answered: Art thou<br>
without sense that thou dost not<br>
understand it? For sadness is the<br>
most mischievous of all spirits,<br>
and the worst to the servants of<br>
God: It destroys the spirits of all<br>
men, and torments the Holy Spirit,<br>
and it saves again.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Sir, said I, I am very foolish,<br>
and understand not these things.<br>
I cannot apprehend how it can<br>
torment, and yet save. Hear, said<br>
he, and understand. They who<br>
never sought out the truth, nor<br>
inquired concerning the majesty<br>
of God, but only believed, are<br>
involved in the affairs of the<br>
heathen.</p>
<br>
<p>4  And there is another lying<br>
prophet that destroys the minds<br>
of the servants of God; that is<br>
of those that are doubtful, not of<br>
those that fully trust in the Lord.<br>
Now those doubtful persons come<br>
to him, as to a divine spirit, and<br>
inquire of him what shall befall<br>
them.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And this lying prophet, having<br>
no power in him of the Divine<br>
Spirit, answers them according to<br>
their demands, and fills their souls<br>
with promises according as they<br>
desire. Howbeit that prophet is<br>
vain, and answers vain things to<br>
those who are themselves vain.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And whatsoever is asked of<br>
him by vain men, he answers them<br>
vainly; nevertheless he speaketh<br>
some things truly. For the Devil<br>
fills him with his spirit, that he<br>
may overthrow some of the<br>
righteous.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Whosoever therefore are<br>
strong in the faith of the Lord,<br>
and have put on the truth; they<br>
are not joined to such spirits, but<br>
depart from them. But they that<br>
are doubtful, and often repenting,<br>
like the heathens, consult them,<br>
and heap up to themselves great<br>
sin, serving idols.</p>
<br>
<p>8  As many therefore as are<br>
such, inquire of them upon every<br>
occasion; worship idols, and are<br>
foolish; and void of the truth.<br>
For every spirit that is given<br>
from God needs not to be asked:<br>
but having the power of divinity<br>
speaks all things of itself,<br>
because he comes from above;<br>
from the power of God.</p>
<br>
<p>10  But he, that being asked<br>
speaks according to men's desires<br>
and concerning many other affairs<br>
of this present world, understands<br>
not the tidings which relate unto<br>
God. For these spirits are darkened<br>
through such affairs, and corrupted,<br>
and broken.</p>
<br>
<p>11  As good vines if they are<br>
neglected, are oppressed with weeds<br>
and thorns, and at last killed by<br>
them; so are the men who believe<br>
such spirits.</p>
<br>
<p>12  They fall into many actions<br>
and businesses, and are void of<br>
sense, and when they think of<br>
things pertaining unto God, they<br>
understand nothing at all; but<br>
at any time they chance to hear<br>
any thing concerning the Lord,<br>
their thoughts are upon their<br>
business.</p>
<br>
<p>13  But they that have the fear<br>
of the Lord, and search out the<br>
truth concerning God, having all<br>
their thoughts towards the Lord;<br>
apprehend whatsoever is said to<br>
them, and forthwith understand<br>
it, because they have the fear<br>
of the Lord in them.</p>
<br>
<p>14  For where the spirit of the<br>
Lord dwells, there is also much<br>
understanding added. Wherefore<br>
join thyself to the Lord, and thou<br>
shalt understand all things.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Learn now, O unwise man!<br>
how sadness troubleth the Holy<br>
Spirit, and how it saves. When<br>
a man that is doubtful is engaged<br>
in any affair, and does not<br>
accomplish it by reason of his<br>
doubting; this sadness enters<br>
into him, and grieves the Holy<br>
Spirit, and makes him sad.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Again anger, when it over.<br>
takes any man for any business he<br>
is greatly moved; and then again<br>
sadness entereth into the heart of<br>
him, who was moved with anger,<br>
and he is troubled for what he hath<br>
done, and repenteth, because he<br>
hath done amiss.</p>
<br>
<p>17  This sadness therefore seemeth<br>
to bring salvation, because he<br>
repenteth of his evil deed. But<br>
both the other things, namely,<br>
doubting and sadness, such as<br>
before was mentioned, vex the<br>
spirit: doubting, because his<br>
work did not succeed; and sadness,<br>
because he angered the Holy Spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Remove therefore sadness<br>
from thyself, and afflict not the<br>
Holy Spirit which dwelleth in<br>
thee, lest he entreat God, and<br>
depart from thee. For the spirit<br>
of the Lord which is given to<br>
dwell in the flesh, endureth no<br>
such sadness.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Wherefore clothe thyself<br>
with cheerfulness, which has always<br>
favour with the Lord, and thou shalt<br>
rejoice in it. For every cheerful<br>
man does well; and relishes those<br>
things that are good, and despises<br>
sadness.</p>
<br>
<p>20  But the sad man does always<br>
wickedly. First, he doth wickedly,<br>
because he grieveth the Holy Spirit,<br>
which is given to man being of a<br>
cheerful nature. And again he does<br>
ill, because be prays with sadness<br>
unto the Lord, and maketh not first<br>
a thankful acknowledgment unto him<br>
of former mercies, and obtains not<br>
of God what he asks.</p>
<br>
<p>21  For the prayer of a sad man<br>
has not always efficacy to come up<br>
to the altar of God. And I said<br>
unto him, Sir, why has not the<br>
prayer of a sad man virtue to come<br>
up to the altar of God?  Because,<br>
said he, that sadness remaineth in<br>
his heart.</p>
<br>
<p>22  When therefore a man's<br>
prayer shall be accompanied with<br>
sadness, it will not suffer his<br>
requests to ascend pure to the altar<br>
of God. For as wine when it is<br>
mingled with vinegar, has not the<br>
sweetness it had before; so sadness<br>
being mixed with the Holy Spirit,<br>
suffers not a man's prayer to be<br>
the same as it would be otherwise.</p>
<br>
<p>23  Wherefore cleanse thyself<br>
from sadness, which is evil, and<br>
thou shalt live unto God. And all<br>
others shall live unto God, as many<br>
as shall lay aside sadness, and put<br>
on cheerfulness.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>COMMAND XI.</p>
<br>
<p>     That the spirits and prophets are to be<br>
     tried by their works; and of a twofold, spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>HE showed me certain men<br>
sitting upon benches, and<br>
one sitting in a chair: and he said<br>
unto me; Seest thou those who sit<br>
upon the benches? Sir, said I,<br>
I see them. He answered, They<br>
are the faithful; and he who sits<br>
in the chair is an earthly spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>2  For he cometh not into the<br>
assembly of the faitful, but avoids<br>
it. But he joins himself to the<br>
doubtful and empty; and prophesies<br>
to them in corners and hidden places;<br>
and pleases them by speaking according<br>
to all the desires of their hearts.</p>
<br>
<p>3 For he placing himself among<br>
empty vessels, is not broken, but<br>
the one fitteth the other. But<br>
when he cometh into the company<br>
of just men, who are full of the<br>
spirit of God, and they pray unto<br>
the Lord; that man is emptied,<br>
because that earthly spirit flies<br>
from him, and he is dumb, and<br>
cannot speak anything.</p>
<br>
<p>4  As if in a store-house you<br>
shall stop up wine or oil, and<br>
among those vessels place an<br>
empty jar; and when afterwards<br>
you come to open it, you shall<br>
find it empty as you stopped it up;<br>
so those empty prophets when<br>
they come among the spirits of<br>
the just, are found to be such as<br>
they came.</p>
<br>
<p>5  I said, How then shall a<br>
man be able to discern them?<br>
Consider what I am going to say<br>
concerning both kinds of men;<br>
and as I speak unto thee so shalt<br>
thou prove the prophet of God,<br>
and the false prophet.</p>
<br>
<p>6  And first try the man who<br>
hath the spirit of God, because<br>
the spirit which is from above is<br>
humble, and quiet, and departs<br>
from all wickedness; and from the<br>
vain desires of the present world;<br>
and makes himself more humble<br>
than all men; and answers to none<br>
when he is asked; nor to every<br>
one singly: for the Spirit of God<br>
doth not speak to a man when he<br>
will, but when God pleases.</p>
<br>
<p>7  When therefore a man who hath<br>
the Spirit of God hath come into<br>
the church of the righteous, who<br>
have the faith of God, and they<br>
pray unto the Lord; then the holy<br>
angel of God fills that man with<br>
the blessed Spirit, and he speaks<br>
in the congregation as he is moved<br>
of God.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Thus therefore is the spirit,<br>
of God known, because whosoever<br>
speaketh by the Spirit of God,<br>
speaketh as the Lord will.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Hear now concerning the<br>
earthly spirit, which is empty and<br>
foolish, and without virtue. And<br>
first of all the man who is supposed<br>
to have the Spirit, (whereas he hath<br>
it not in reality), exalteth himself,<br>
and desires to have the first seat,<br>
and is wicked, and full of words.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And spends his time in pleasure,<br>
and in all manner of voluptuousness,<br>
and receives the reward of his<br>
divination; which if he receives<br>
not, he does not divine.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Should the Spirit of God<br>
receive reward, and divine? It doth<br>
not become a prophet of God so to<br>
do.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Thus you seethe life of each<br>
of these kind of prophets. Wherefore<br>
prove that man by his life and works,<br>
who says that he hath the Holy Spirit.<br>
And believe the Spirit which comes<br>
from God, and has power as such.<br>
But believe not the earthly and<br>
empty spirit, which is from the<br>
devil, in whom there is no faith<br>
nor virtue.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Hear now the similitude<br>
which I am about to speak unto<br>
thee. Take a stone, and throw it<br>
up towards heaven; or take a<br>
spout of water, and mount it up<br>
thitherward; and see if thou<br>
canst reach unto heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>14  Sir; said I, how can this be<br>
done? For neither of those things<br>
which you have mentioned, are<br>
possible to be done. And he<br>
answered, Therefore as these things<br>
cannot be done, so is the earthy<br>
spirit without virtue, and without<br>
effect.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Understand yet farther the<br>
power which cometh from above,<br>
in this similitude. The grains of<br>
hail that drop down are exceedingly<br>
small; and yet when they fall upon<br>
the head of a man, how do they<br>
cause pain to it.</p>
<br>
<p>16  And again, consider, the<br>
droppings of a house; how the<br>
little drops falling upon the earth,<br>
work a hollow in the stones.</p>
<br>
<p>17  So in like manner the least<br>
things which come from above,<br>
and fall upon the earth, have great<br>
force. Wherefore join thyself<br>
to this spirit, which has the<br>
power; and depart from the other<br>
which is empty.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>COMMAND XII.</p>
<br>
<p>     Of a two fold  desire: that the commands of God,<br>
     are not impossible: and that the devil is not<br>
     to be feared by them that believe.</p>
<br>
<p>AGAIN he said unto me;<br>
remove from thee all evil<br>
desires, and put on good and<br>
holy desires. For having put on a<br>
good desire, thou shalt hate that<br>
which is evil, and bridle it as thou<br>
wilt. But an evil desire is dreadful,<br>
and hard to be tamed.</p>
<br>
<p>2  It is very horrible and wild;<br>
and by its wildness consumes men.<br>
And especially if a servant of God<br>
shall chance to fall into it, except<br>
he be very wise, he is ruined by<br>
it. For it destroys those who have<br>
not the garment of a good desire<br>
and are engaged in the affairs of<br>
this present world; and delivers<br>
them unto death.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Sir, said I, what are the works<br>
of an evil desire, which bring men<br>
unto death? Shew them to me that<br>
I may depart from them. Hear, said he,<br>
by what works an evil desire bringeth<br>
the servants of God unto death.</p>
<br>
<p>4  First of all, it is an evil desire<br>
to covet another man's wife, or<br>
for a woman to covet another's<br>
husband; as also to desire the<br>
dainties of riches; and multitude<br>
of superfluous meats; and drunkenness;<br>
and many delights.</p>
<br>
<p>5  For in much delicacy there is<br>
folly; and many pleasures are<br>
needless to the servants of God.<br>
Such lusting therefore is evil and<br>
pernicious, which brings to death<br>
the servants of God. For all such<br>
lusting is from the devil.</p>
<br>
<p>6 Whosoever therefore shall<br>
depart from all evil desires,<br>
shall live unto God; but they<br>
that are subject unto them shall<br>
die forever. For this evil lusting<br>
is deadly. Do thou therefore put<br>
on the desire of righteousness,<br>
and being armed with the fear of<br>
the Lord resist all wicked lusting.</p>
<br>
<p>7 For this fear dwelleth in good<br>
desires; and, when evil coveting<br>
shall see thee armed with the fear<br>
of the Lord, and resisting it; it<br>
will fly far from thee, and not<br>
appear before thee, but be afraid<br>
of thy armour.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And thou shall have the victory,<br>
and be crowned for it; and shall<br>
attain to that desire which is<br>
good; and shall give the victory<br>
which thou hast obtained unto<br>
God, and shall serve him in doing<br>
what thou thyself wouldest do.</p>
<br>
<p>9  For if thou shalt serve good<br>
desires, and be subject to them;<br>
then thou shalt be able to get the<br>
dominion over thy wicked lustings;<br>
and they will be subject to thee,<br>
as thou wilt.</p>
<br>
<p>10  And I said, Sir, I would<br>
know how to serve that desire<br>
which is good? Hearken, said he,<br>
Fear God, and put thy trust in<br>
him, and love truth, and<br>
righteousness, and do that<br>
which is good.</p>
<br>
<p>10  If thou shalt do these things,<br>
thou shall be an approved servant<br>
of God, and serve him; and all<br>
others who shall in like manner<br>
serve a good desire, shall live unto<br>
God.</p>
<br>
<p>12  And when he had fulfilled<br>
these twelve commands, he said<br>
unto me, Thou hast now these<br>
commands, walk in them; and exhort<br>
those that hear them, to repent,<br>
and that they keep their<br>
repentance pure all the<br>
remaining days of their life.</p>
<br>
<p>13  And fulfil diligently this<br>
ministry which I commit to thee,<br>
and thou shalt receive great<br>
advantage by it, and find favour<br>
with all such as shall repent<br>
and believe thy words. For I am<br>
with thee, and will force them<br>
to believe.</p>
<br>
<p>14  And I said unto him, Sir,<br>
these commands are great and<br>
excellent, and able to cheer the<br>
heart of that man that shall be<br>
able to keep them. But, Sir,<br>
I cannot tell, whether they can<br>
be observed by any man?</p>
<br>
<p>15  He answered, Thou shalt<br>
easily keep these commands, and<br>
they shall not be hard: howbeit,<br>
if thou shalt suffer it once to<br>
enter into thine heart that they<br>
cannot be kept by any one, thou<br>
shalt not fulfil them.</p>
<br>
<p>16  But now I say unto thee,<br>
if thou shalt not observe these<br>
commands, and shall neglect them,<br>
thou shalt not be saved, nor thy<br>
children, nor thy house: because<br>
thou hast judged that these<br>
commands cannot be kept by man.</p>
<br>
<p>17  These things he spake<br>
very angrily unto me, insomuch<br>
that he greatly affrighted me,<br>
for he changed his countenance<br>
so that a man could not bear his<br>
anger.</p>
<br>
<p>18  And when he saw me altogether<br>
troubled and confounded, he began<br>
to speak more moderately and<br>
cheerfully, saying, O foolish,<br>
and without understanding!</p>
<br>
<p>19  Unconstant, not knowing<br>
the majesty of God how great and<br>
wonderful he is; who created the<br>
world for man, and hath made<br>
every creature subject unto him;<br>
and given him all power, that he<br>
should be able to fulfil all these<br>
commands.</p>
<br>
<p>20  He is able, said he, to fulfil<br>
all these commands, who has the<br>
Lord in his heart; but they who<br>
have the Lord only in their mouths,<br>
their hearts are hardened, and<br>
they are far from the Lord: to<br>
such persons these commands are<br>
hard and difficult.</p>
<br>
<p>21 Therefore, ye that are empty<br>
and light in the faith, put the<br>
Lord your God in your hearts;<br>
and ye shall perceive how that<br>
nothing is more easy than these<br>
commands, nor more pleasant, nor<br>
more gentle and holy.</p>
<br>
<p>22  And turn yourselves to the<br>
Lord your God, and forsake the<br>
devil and his pleasures, because<br>
they are evil, and bitter, and<br>
impure. And fear not the devil,<br>
because he has no power over you.</p>
<br>
<p>23  For I am with you, the<br>
messenger of repentance, who have<br>
the dominion over him. The devil<br>
doth indeed affright men but his<br>
terror is vain. Wherefore fear<br>
him not, and he will flee from you.</p>
<br>
<p>24 And I said unto him; Sir,<br>
hear me speak a few words unto<br>
you. He answered, Say on: A<br>
man indeed desires to keep the<br>
commandments of God, and there<br>
is no one but what prays unto God,<br>
that he may be able to keep his<br>
commandments;</p>
<br>
<p>25  But the devil is hard, and<br>
by his power rules over the servants<br>
of God. And he said; He cannot<br>
rule over the servants of God,<br>
who trust in him with all their<br>
hearts.</p>
<br>
<p>26  The devil may strive, but he<br>
cannot overcome them.</p>
<br>
<p>27  For if ye resist him, he will<br>
flee away with confusion from you.<br>
But they that are not full in the<br>
faith, fear the devil, as if he had<br>
some great power. For the devil<br>
tries the servants of God and if he<br>
finds them empty, he destroys<br>
them.</p>
<br>
<p>28  For as man, when he fills up<br>
vessels with good wine, and among<br>
them puts a few vessels half full,<br>
and comes to try and taste of the<br>
vessels, doth not try those that are<br>
full, because he knows that they<br>
are good, but tastes those that are<br>
half full, lest they should grow<br>
sour; (for vessels half full soon<br>
grow sour, and lose the taste of<br>
wine:) so the devil comes to the<br>
servants of God to try them.</p>
<br>
<p>29  They that are full of faith<br>
resist him stoutly, and he departs<br>
from them, because he finds no<br>
place where to enter into them<br>
then he goes to those that are not<br>
full of faith, and because he has a<br>
place of entrance he goes into<br>
them, and does what he will with<br>
them, and they become his servants.</p>
<br>
<p>30  But I, the messenger of<br>
repentance, say unto you, fear not<br>
the devil, for I am sent unto you,<br>
that I may be with you, as many<br>
as shall repent with your whole<br>
heart, and that I may confirm you<br>
in the faith.</p>
<br>
<p>31  Believe therefore, ye who<br>
by reason of your transgressions<br>
have forgot God. and your own<br>
salvation; and adding to your<br>
sins have made your life very<br>
heavy.</p>
<br>
<p>32  That if ye shall turn to the<br>
Lord with your whole hearts, and<br>
shall serve him according to his<br>
will; he will heal you of your<br>
former sins, and ye shall have<br>
dominion over all the works of the<br>
devil.</p>
<br>
<p>33  Be not then afraid in the<br>
least of his threatenings, for they<br>
are without force, as the nerves of<br>
a dead man. But hearken unto<br>
me, and fear the Lord Almighty,<br>
who is able to save and to destroy<br>
you; and keep his commands, that<br>
ye may live unto God.</p>
<br>
<p>34  And I said unto him; Sir,<br>
I am now confirmed in all the<br>
commands of the Lord whilst you<br>
are with me, and I know that you<br>
will break all the powers of the<br>
devil.</p>
<br>
<p>35  And we also shall overcome<br>
him, if we shall be able, through<br>
the help of the Lord, to keep these<br>
commands which you have delivered.</p>
<br>
<p>36  Thou shalt keep them, said<br>
he, if thou shalt purify thy heart<br>
towards the Lord. And all they<br>
also shall keep them who shall<br>
cleanse their hearts from the vain<br>
desires of the present world, and<br>
shall live unto God.</p>

<h2>
                         THE THIRD PART OF THE<br>
                BOOK OF HERMAS, CALLED HIS SIMILITUDES.</h2></center>
<br><br><br>
<p>
SIMILITUDE I.</p>
<br>
<p>     That seeing we have no abiding city in this world,<br>
     we ought to look after that which is to come.</p>
<br>
<p>AND he said onto me; Ye know<br>
that ye who are the servants<br>
of the Lord, live here as in<br>
a pilgrimage; for your city<br>
is far off from this city.</p>
<br>
<p>2  If, therefore, ye know your<br>
city in which ye are to dwell,<br>
why do ye here buy estates, and<br>
provide yourselves with delicacies,<br>
and stately buildings, and<br>
supurfluous houses? For he that<br>
provides himself these things<br>
in this city, does not think<br>
of returning into his own city.</p>
<br>
<p>3 O foolish, and doubtful, and<br>
wretched man; who understandest<br>
not that all these things belong<br>
to other men, and are under the<br>
power of another. For the Lord<br>
of this city saith unto thee;<br>
Either obey my laws, or depart<br>
out of my city.</p>
<br>
<p>4  What therefore shalt thou do<br>
who art subject to a law in thine<br>
own city? Canst thou for thy<br>
estate, or for any of those things<br>
which thou hast provided, deny<br>
thy law? But if thou shalt deny<br>
it, and wilt afterwards return into<br>
thy own city, thou shalt not be<br>
received, but shall be excluded<br>
thence.</p>
<br>
<p>5  See therefore, that like a man<br>
in another country, thou procure<br>
no more to thyself than what is<br>
necessary, and sufficient for thee;<br>
and be ready, that when the God<br>
or Lord of this city shall drive<br>
thee out of it thou mayest oppose<br>
his law, and go into thine own<br>
city; where thou mayest with all<br>
cheerfulness live according to<br>
thine own law with no wrong.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Take heed therefore ye that<br>
serve God, and have him in your<br>
hearts: work ye the works of<br>
God, being mindful both of his<br>
commands and of his promises,<br>
which he has promised; and be<br>
assured that he will make them<br>
good unto you; if ye shall keep<br>
his commandments.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Instead therefore of the<br>
possessions that ye would otherwise<br>
purchase, redeem those that are<br>
in want from their necessities,<br>
as every one is able; justify the<br>
widows; judge the cause of the<br>
fatherless; and spend your riches<br>
and your wealth in such works as<br>
these.</p>
<br>
<p>8  For this end has God enriched<br>
you, that ye might fulfil these<br>
kind of services. It is much<br>
better to do this, than to buy lands<br>
or houses; because all such things<br>
shall perish with this present time.</p>
<br>
<p>9  But what ye shall do for the<br>
name of the Lord, ye shall find<br>
in your city, and shall have joy<br>
without sadness or fear. Wherefore<br>
covet not the riches of the heathen;<br>
for they are destructive to the<br>
servants of God.</p>
<br>
<p>10  But trade with your own riches<br>
which you possess, by which ye may<br>
attain unto everlasting joy.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And do not commit adultery,<br>
nor touch any other man's wife,<br>
nor desire her; but covet that<br>
which is thy own business, and<br>
thou shalt be saved.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>SIMILITUDE II.</p>
<br>
<p>     As the vine is supported by the elm,<br>
     so is the rich man helped by the prayers of the poor.</p>
<br>
<p>AS I was walking into the field,<br>
and considered the elm and<br>
the vine, and thought with myself<br>
of their fruits, an angel appeared<br>
unto me, and said unto me; What<br>
is it that thou thinkest upon thus<br>
long within thyself?</p>
<br>
<p>2  And I said unto him, Sir, I<br>
think of this vine and this elm<br>
because their fruits are fair.<br>
And he said unto me; These two<br>
trees are set for a pattern to<br>
the servants of God.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And I said unto him, Sir, I<br>
would know in what the pattern<br>
of these trees which thou mentionest,<br>
does consist. Hearken, saith he;<br>
seest thou this vine and this<br>
elm? Sir, said I, I see them.</p>
<br>
<p>4  This vine, saith he, is fruitful,<br>
but the elm is a tree without fruit.<br>
Nevertheless this vine unless it<br>
were set by this elm, and supported<br>
by it, would not bear much<br>
fruit; but lying along upon the<br>
ground, would bear but ill fruit,<br>
because it did not hang upon the<br>
elm; whereas, being supported<br>
upon the elm, it bears fruit both<br>
for itself and for that.</p>
<br>
<p>5  See, therefore, how the elm<br>
gives no less, but rather more<br>
fruit, than the vine. How, Sir,<br>
said I, does it bear more fruit<br>
than the vine? Because, said he,<br>
the vine being supported upon<br>
the elm gives both much and good<br>
fruit; whereas, if it lay along<br>
upon the ground, it would bear<br>
but little, and that very ill too.</p>
<br>
<p>6  This similitude, therefore,<br>
is set forth to the servants of God;<br>
and it represents the rich and poor<br>
man. I answered, Sir, make this<br>
manifest unto me.   Hear, said he;<br>
the rich man has wealth: howbeit<br>
towards the Lord he is poor; for<br>
he is taken up about his riches,<br>
and prays but little to the Lord;<br>
and the prayers which he makes<br>
are lazy and without force.</p>
<br>
<p>7  When therefore, the rich man<br>
reaches out to the poor those<br>
things which he wants, the poor<br>
man prays unto the Lord for the<br>
rich; and God grants unto the<br>
rich man all good things, because<br>
the poor man is rich in prayer;<br>
and his requests have great power<br>
with the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Then the rich man ministers<br>
all thing to the poor, because he<br>
perceives that he is heard by the<br>
Lord; and he the more willingly<br>
and without doubting, affords him<br>
what he wants, and takes care that<br>
nothing be lacking to him.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And the poor man gives<br>
thanks unto the Lord for the rich;<br>
because they both do their work<br>
from the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>10  With men, therefore, the<br>
elm is not thought to give any<br>
fruit; and they know not, neither<br>
understand that its company being<br>
added to the vine, the vine bears a<br>
double increase, both for itself and<br>
for the elm.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Even so the poor praying<br>
unto the Lord for the rich, are<br>
heard by him; and their riches<br>
are increased, because they minister<br>
to the poor of their wealth.<br>
They are, therefore, both made<br>
partakers of each other's good<br>
works.</p>
<br>
<p>12  Whosoever, therefore, shall<br>
do these things, he shall not be<br>
forsaken by the Lord, but shall be<br>
written in the book of life.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Happy are they who are rich,<br>
and perceive themselves to be<br>
increased: for he that is sensible<br>
of this, will be able to minister<br>
somewhat to others.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>SIMILITUDE III.</p>
<br>
<p>     As the greet trees in the winter cannot be<br>
     distinguished from the dry; so neither can the<br>
     righteous from the wicked in this present world.</p>
<br>
<p>AGAIN he showed me many<br>
trees whose leaves were shed,<br>
and which seemed to me to be<br>
withered, for they were all alike.<br>
And he said unto me, Seest thou<br>
these trees?   I said, Sir, I see that<br>
they look like dry trees.</p>
<br>
<p>2  He answering, said unto me;<br>
These trees are like unto the men<br>
who live in the present world. I<br>
replied: Sir, why are they like<br>
unto dried trees? Because, said<br>
he, neither the righteous, nor<br>
unrighteous, are known from one<br>
another; but all are alike in this<br>
present world.</p>
<br>
<p>3  For this world is as the winter<br>
to the righteous men, because<br>
they are not known, but dwell<br>
among sinners.</p>
<br>
<p>4  As in the winter all the trees<br>
having lost their leaves, are like<br>
dry trees; nor can it be discerned<br>
which are dry and which are green:<br>
so in this present world neither<br>
the righteous, nor wicked are<br>
discerned from each other; but they<br>
are all alike.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>SIMILITUDE IV.</p>
<br>
<p>     As in the summer the living trees are distinguished<br>
     from the dry by their fruit and green leaves;<br>
     so in the world to come the righteous shall be<br>
     distinguished from the unrighteous by their happiness.</p>
<br>
<p>AGAIN he showed me many<br>
other trees, of which some<br>
had leaves, and others appeared<br>
dry and withered. And he said<br>
unto me, Seest thou these trees<br>
I answered, Sir, I see them; some<br>
are dry, and others full of leaves.</p>
<br>
<p>2  These trees, saith be, which<br>
are green, are the righteous, who<br>
shall possess the world to come.<br>
For the world to come, is the summer<br>
to the righteous; but to sinners<br>
it is the winter.</p>
<br>
<p>3  When, therefore, the mercy<br>
of the Lord shall shine forth, then<br>
they who serve God shall be made<br>
manifest, and plain unto all. For<br>
as in the summer the fruit of every<br>
tree is shown and made manifest.<br>
so also the works of the righteous<br>
shall be declared and made manifest,<br>
and they shall all be restored<br>
in that world merry and joyful.</p>
<br>
<p>4  For the other kind of men,<br>
namely the wicked, like the trees<br>
which thou rawest dry, shall, as<br>
such, be found dry and without<br>
fruit in that other world; and like<br>
dry wood shall be burnt; and it<br>
shall be made manifest that they<br>
have done evil all the time of their<br>
life;</p>
<br>
<p>5  And they shall be burnt because<br>
they have sinned and have not<br>
repented of their sins. And<br>
also all the other nations shall<br>
be burnt, because they have not<br>
acknowledged God their Creator.</p>
<br>
<p>6  Do then, therefore, bring forth<br>
good fruit, that in the summer thy<br>
fruit may be known; and keep<br>
thyself from much business, and<br>
thou shalt not offend. For they<br>
who are involved in much business,<br>
sin much; because they are taken<br>
up with their affairs, and<br>
serve not God.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And how can a man that does<br>
not serve God, ask anything of<br>
God, and receive it? But they<br>
who serve him, ask and receive<br>
what they desire.</p>
<br>
<p>8  But if a man has only one<br>
thing to follow, he may serve God,<br>
because his mind is not taken off<br>
from God, but he serves him with<br>
a pure mind.</p>
<br>
<p>9  If, therefore, thou shalt do<br>
this, thou mayest have fruit in<br>
the world to come; and as many as<br>
shall do in like manner, shall<br>
bring forth fruit.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>SIMILITUDE V.<br>
     Of a true fast, and the rewards of it:<br>
     also of the cleanliness of the body.</p>
<br>
<p>AS I was fasting, and sitting<br>
down in a certain mountain,<br>
and giving thanks unto God for all<br>
the things that he had done unto<br>
me; behold, I saw the Shepherd,<br>
who was wont to converse with<br>
me, sitting by me, and saying<br>
unto me:  What has brought thee<br>
hither thus early in the morning?<br>
I answered, Sir, to-day I keep a<br>
station.</p>
<br>
<p>2  He answered, What is a station;<br>
I replied, it is a fast. He said,<br>
What is that fast?  I answered,<br>
I fast as I have been wont to<br>
do. Ye know not, said he, what<br>
it is to fast unto God; nor is this<br>
a fast which ye keep, profiting<br>
nothing with God.</p>
<br>
<p>3  Sir, said I, what makes you<br>
speak thus? He replied, I speak<br>
it, because it is not the true fast<br>
which you think that you keep;<br>
but I will show you what that is<br>
which is a complete fast, and<br>
acceptable unto God.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Hearken, said he, The Lord<br>
does not desire such a needless<br>
fast; for by fasting in this manner,<br>
thou advancest nothing in<br>
righteousness.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But the true fast is this: Do<br>
nothing wickedly in thy life, but<br>
serve God with a pure mind; and<br>
keep his commandments, and walk<br>
according to his precepts, nor<br>
suffer any wicked desire to enter<br>
into the mind.</p>
<br>
<p>6  But trust in the Lord, that if<br>
thou dost these things, any fearest<br>
him, and abstaineth from every<br>
evil work, thou shall live unto<br>
God.</p>
<br>
<p>7  If thou shalt do this, thou<br>
shall perfect a great fast, and an<br>
acceptable one unto the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Hearken unto the similitude<br>
which I am about to propose<br>
unto thee, as to this matter.</p>
<br>
<p>9  A certain man having a farm,<br>
and many servants, planted a vineyard<br>
in a certain part of his estate for<br>
his posterity:</p>
<br>
<p>10  And taking a journey into<br>
a far country, chose one of his<br>
servants which he thought the most<br>
faithful and approved, and delivered<br>
the vineyard into his care;<br>
commanding him that he should<br>
stake up the vines. Which if he<br>
did, and fulfilled his command, he<br>
promised to give him his liberty.<br>
Nor did he command him to do<br>
any thing more; and so went into<br>
a far country.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And after that servant had<br>
taken that charge upon him, he<br>
did whatsoever his lord commanded<br>
him. And when he had staked the<br>
vineyard, and found it to be full<br>
of weeds, he began to think within<br>
himself, saying:</p>
<br>
<p>12  I have done what my lord<br>
commanded me, I will now dig<br>
this vineyard, and when it is digged,<br>
it will be more beautiful; and the<br>
weeds being pulled up, it will<br>
bring forth more fruit and not be<br>
choked by the weeds.</p>
<br>
<p>13  So setting about this work<br>
he digged it, and plucked up all<br>
the weeds that were in it; and so<br>
the vineyard became very beautiful<br>
and prosperous, not being choked<br>
with weeds.</p>
<br>
<p>14  After some time the lord of<br>
the vineyard comes and goes into<br>
the vineyard, and when he saw<br>
that it was handsomely staked and<br>
digged, and the weeds plucked up<br>
that were in it, and the vines<br>
flourishing, he rejoiced greatly at<br>
the care of his servant.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And calling his son whom<br>
he loved, and who was to be his<br>
heir, and his friends with whom<br>
he was wont to consult; he tells<br>
them what he had commanded his<br>
servant to do, and what his<br>
servant had done more; and they<br>
immediately congratulated that<br>
servant, that he had received so<br>
full a testimony from his lord.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Then he said to them, I<br>
indeed promised this servant his<br>
liberty, if he observed the command<br>
which I gave him; and he observed it,<br>
and besides has done a good work<br>
to my vineyard, which has exceedingly<br>
pleased me.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Wherefore, for this work<br>
which he hath done, I will make<br>
him my heir together with my<br>
son; because that when he saw<br>
what was good, he neglected it<br>
not, but did it.</p>
<br>
<p>18  This design of the lord both<br>
his son and his friends approved,<br>
namely, that his servant should be<br>
heir together with his son.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Not long after this the master<br>
of the family calling together, his<br>
friends, sent from his supper several<br>
kinds of food to that servant.</p>
<br>
<p>20  Which when he had received,<br>
he took so much of them as was<br>
sufficient for himself, and divided<br>
the rest among his fellow-servants.</p>
<br>
<p>21  Which when they had received,<br>
they rejoiced; and wished that<br>
he might find yet greater favour<br>
with his lord, for what he had<br>
done to them.</p>
<br>
<p>22  When his lord heard all these<br>
things, he was again filled with<br>
great joy: and calling again his<br>
friends and his son together, he<br>
related to them what his servant<br>
had done with the meats which he<br>
had sent unto him.</p>
<br>
<p>23  They therefore so much the<br>
more assented to the master of the<br>
household; and he ought to make<br>
that servant his heir together with<br>
his son.</p>
<br>
<p>24  I said unto him, sir, I know<br>
not these smilitudes, neither can<br>
I understand them, unless you<br>
expound them unto me. I will,<br>
says he, expound, all things unto<br>
thee whatsoever I have talked with<br>
thee, or shown unto thee.</p>
<br>
<p>25  Keep the commandments of<br>
the Lord and thou shalt be approved,<br>
and shall be written in the number<br>
of those that keep his commandments.<br>
But if besides those things which<br>
the Lord hath commanded, thou shalt<br>
add some good thing; thou shall<br>
purchase to thyself a greater dignity,<br>
and be in more favour with the Lord<br>
than thou shouldst otherwise have been.</p>
<br>
<p>26  If therefore thou shalt keep<br>
the commandments of the Lord,<br>
and shalt add to them these stations,<br>
thou shall rejoice; but especially<br>
if thou shalt keep them according<br>
to my commands.</p>
<br>
<p>27  I said unto him, sir, whatsoever<br>
thou shah command me, I will observe;<br>
for I know that thou wilt be with me.<br>
I will, said he, be with thee who hast<br>
taken up such a resolution; and I will<br>
be with all those who purpose in like<br>
manner.</p>
<br>
<p>28  This fast, saith he, whilst<br>
thou dost also observe the<br>
commandments of the Lord, is<br>
exceeding good; therefore thus<br>
shalt thou keep it.</p>
<br>
<p>29  First of all, take heed to<br>
thyself, and keep thyself from every<br>
wicked act, and from every filthy<br>
word, and from every hurtful desire;<br>
and purify thy mind from all the<br>
vanity of this present world. If<br>
thou shalt observe these things,<br>
this fast shall be right.</p>
<br>
<p>30  Thus therefore do.   Having<br>
performed what is before written,<br>
that day on which thou fastest<br>
thou shalt taste nothing at all but<br>
bread and water; and computing<br>
the quantity of food which thou<br>
art want to eat upon other days,<br>
thou shalt lay aside the expense<br>
which thou shouldest have made<br>
that day, and give it unto the<br>
widow, the fatherless, and the<br>
poor.</p>
<br>
<p>31  And thus thou shalt perfect<br>
the humiliation of thy soul; that<br>
he who receives of it may satisfy<br>
his soul, and his prayer come up<br>
to the Lord God for thee.</p>
<br>
<p>32  If therefore thou shalt thus<br>
accomplish thy fast, as I command<br>
thee, thy sacrifice shall be<br>
acceptable unto the Lord, and thy<br>
fast shall be written in his book.</p>
<br>
<p>33  This station, thus performed,<br>
is good and pleasing and acceptable<br>
unto the Lord. These things if thou<br>
shalt observe with thy children and<br>
with all thy house, thou shalt<br>
be happy.</p>
<br>
<p>34  And whosoever, when they<br>
hear these things, shall do them,<br>
they also shall be happy; and<br>
whatsoever they shall ask of the<br>
Lord they shall receive it.</p>
<br>
<p>35  And I prayed him that he<br>
would expound unto me the similitude<br>
of the farm, and the Lord, and of<br>
the vineyard, and of the servant<br>
that had staked the vineyard;<br>
and of the weeds that were<br>
plucked out of the vineyard; and<br>
of his son and his friends which<br>
he took into counsel with him;<br>
for I understand that that was<br>
a similitude.</p>
<br>
<p>36  He said unto me, Thou art<br>
very bold in asking; for thou<br>
oughtest not to ask any thing;<br>
because if it be fitting to show it<br>
unto thee, it shall be showed unto<br>
thee.</p>
<br>
<p>37  I answered him; Sir, whatsoever<br>
thou shalt show me, without explaining<br>
it unto me, I shall in vain see it,<br>
if I do not understand what it is.<br>
And if thou shalt propose any<br>
similitudes, and not expound them,<br>
I shall in vain hear them.</p>
<br>
<p>38  He answered me again, saying:<br>
Whosoever is the servant of God,<br>
and has the Lord in his heart,<br>
he desires understanding of him,<br>
and receives it; and he explains<br>
every similitude, and understands<br>
the words of the Lord which need<br>
an inquiry.</p>
<br>
<p>39  But they that are lazy and<br>
slow to pray, doubt to seek from<br>
the Lord: although the Lord be of<br>
such an extraordinary goodness,<br>
that without ceasing he giveth all<br>
things to them that ask of him.</p>
<br>
<p>40  Thou therefore who art<br>
strengthened by that venerable<br>
messenger, and hast received such<br>
a powerful gift of prayer; seeing<br>
thou art not slothful, why dost<br>
thou not now ask understanding of<br>
the Lord, and receive it?</p>
<br>
<p>41  I said unto him; seeing I<br>
have thee present, it is necessary<br>
that I should seek it of thee, and<br>
ask thee; for thou shewest all<br>
things unto me, and speakest to<br>
me when thou art present.</p>
<br>
<p>42  But if I should see or hear<br>
these things when thou wert not<br>
present, I would then ask the Lord<br>
that he would chew them unto me.</p>
<br>
<p>43  And he replied, I said a<br>
little before that thou wert subtle<br>
and bold, in that thou asketh the<br>
meaning of these similitudes.</p>
<br>
<p>44  But because thou still persistest,<br>
I will unfold to thee this parable<br>
which then desirest, that thou mayest<br>
make it known unto all men.</p>
<br>
<p>45  Hear, therefore, said he,<br>
and understand. The farm before<br>
mentioned denotes the whole earth.<br>
The Lord of the farm is he, who<br>
created and finished all things;<br>
and gave virtue unto them.</p>
<br>
<p>46  His son is the Holy Spirit;<br>
the servant is the Son of God: the<br>
vineyard is the people whom he<br>
saves. The stakes are the messengers<br>
which are set oven them by the Lord,<br>
to support his people. The weeds<br>
that are plucked up out of the<br>
vineyard, are the sins which<br>
the servants of God had<br>
committed.</p>
<br>
<p>47  The food which he sent him<br>
from his supper, are the commands<br>
which he gave to his people by his<br>
Son. The friends whom he called<br>
to counsel with him, are the holy<br>
angels whom he first created. The<br>
absence of the master of the household,<br>
is the time that remains unto<br>
his coming.</p>
<br>
<p>48  I said unto him, Sir, all<br>
these things are very excellent,<br>
and wonderful, and good. But,<br>
continued I, could I or any other<br>
man besides, though never so wise,<br>
have understood these things?</p>
<br>
<p>49  Wherefore now, sir, tell me,<br>
what I ask. He replied, ask me<br>
what thou wilt. Why, said I, is<br>
the Son of God in this parable,<br>
put in the place of a servant.</p>
<br>
<p>50  Hearken, he said: the Son<br>
of God is not put in the condition<br>
of a servant, but in great power<br>
and authority. I said unto him,<br>
how, sir? I understand it not.</p>
<br>
<p>51  Because, said he, the Son set<br>
his messengers over those whom<br>
the Father delivered unto him, to<br>
keep every one of them; but he<br>
himself laboured very much, and<br>
suffered much, that he might blot<br>
out their offences.</p>
<br>
<p>52  For no vineyard can be digged<br>
without much labour and pains.<br>
Wherefore having blotted out the<br>
sins of his people, he showed to<br>
them the paths of life, giving<br>
them the law which he had<br>
received of the Father.</p>
<br>
<p>53  You see, said he, that he is<br>
the Lord of his people, having<br>
received all power from his Father.<br>
But why the lord did take his<br>
son into counsel, about dividing<br>
the inheritance, and the good<br>
angels, hear now.</p>
<br>
<p>54  That Holy Spirit, which was<br>
created first of all, he placed in the<br>
body in which God should dwell;<br>
namely, in a chosen body, as it<br>
seemed good to him. This body<br>
therefore into which the Holy<br>
Spirit was brought, served that<br>
Spirit, walking rightly and purely<br>
in modesty; nor ever defiled that<br>
Spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>55  Seeing therefore the body at<br>
all times obeyed the Holy Spirit,<br>
and laboured rightly and chastely<br>
with him, nor faltered at anytime;<br>
that body being wearied conversed<br>
indeed servilely, but being<br>
mightily approved to God with<br>
the Holy Spirit, was accepted by<br>
him.</p>
<br>
<p>56  For such a stout course<br>
pleased God, because he was not<br>
defiled in the earth, keeping the<br>
Holy Spirit. He called therefore<br>
to counsel his Son, and the good<br>
angels, that there might be some<br>
place of standing given to this<br>
body which had served the Holy<br>
Spirit without blame; lest it<br>
should seem to have lost the<br>
reward of its service.</p>
<br>
<p>57  For every pure body shall<br>
receive its reward; that is found<br>
without spot, in which the Holy<br>
Spirit has been appointed to dwell.<br>
And thus you have now the exposition<br>
of this parable also.</p>
<br>
<p>58  Sir, said I, I now understand<br>
your meaning, since I have heard<br>
this exposition. Hearken farther,<br>
said he: keep this thy body clean<br>
and pure, that the Spirit which<br>
shall dwell in it may bear witness<br>
unto it, and be judged to have<br>
been with thee.</p>
<br>
<p>59  Also take heed that it be not<br>
instilled into thy mind that this<br>
body perishes, and thou abuse it<br>
to any lust. For if thou shalt<br>
defile thy body, thou shalt also at<br>
the same time defile the Holy<br>
Spirit; and if thou shalt defile<br>
the Holy Spirit, thou shall not<br>
live.</p>
<br>
<p>60  And I said, What if through<br>
ignorance this should have been<br>
already committed, before a man<br>
heard these words; How can he<br>
attain into salvation, who has thus<br>
defiled his body?</p>
<br>
<p>61  He replied, As for men's former<br>
actions which through ignorance<br>
they have committed, God only can<br>
afford a remedy unto them; for all<br>
the power belongeth unto him.</p>
<br>
<p>62  But now guard thyself; and<br>
seeing God is almighty and merciful,<br>
he will grant a remedy to what thou<br>
hast formerly done amiss, if for the<br>
time, to come thou shalt not defile<br>
thy body and spirit:</p>
<br>
<p>63  For they are companions together,<br>
and the one cannot be defiled but the<br>
other will be so too. Keep therefore<br>
both of them pure, and thou shalt<br>
live unto God.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>SIMILITUDE VI.</p>
<br>
<p>     Of two sorts of voluptuous men, and of<br>
     their death and defection; and of the<br>
     continuance of their pains.</p>
<br>
<p>AS I was sitting at home, and<br>
praising God for all the things<br>
which I had seen; and was thinking<br>
concerning the commands, that they<br>
were exceedingly good, and great,<br>
and honest, and pleasant, and<br>
such as were able to bring a man<br>
to salvation; I said thus within<br>
myself, I shall be happy if I walk<br>
according to these commands; and<br>
whosoever shall walk in them shall<br>
live unto God.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Whilst I was speaking on this<br>
wise within myself, I saw him<br>
whom I had before been wont to<br>
see, sitting by me; and he spake<br>
thus unto me:</p>
<br>
<p>3  What doubtest thou concerning<br>
my commands which I have delivered<br>
unto thee? They are good, doubt not,<br>
but trust in the Lord, and thou shalt<br>
walk in them; for I will give thee<br>
strength to fulfil them.</p>
<br>
<p>4  These commands are profitable<br>
to those who shall repent of the<br>
sins which they have formerly<br>
committed; if for the time to come<br>
they shall not continue in them.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Whosoever therefore ye be<br>
that repent, cast away from you<br>
the naughtiness of the present<br>
world; and put on all virtue, and<br>
righteousness, and so shall ye be<br>
able to keep these commands;<br>
and not sin from henceforth any<br>
more.</p>
<br>
<p>6  For if ye shall keep yourselves<br>
from sin for the time to come,<br>
ye shall cut off a great deal<br>
of your former sins. Walk in my<br>
commands, and ye shall live unto<br>
God: These things have I spoken<br>
unto you.</p>
<br>
<p>7  And when he, had said this,<br>
he added; let us go into the field,<br>
and I will show thee shepherds of<br>
sheep. I replied, sir, let us go.</p>
<br>
<p>8  And we came into a certain<br>
field, and there he showed me a<br>
young shepherd, finely arrayed,<br>
with his garments of a purple<br>
colour. And he fed large flocks;<br>
and his sheep were full of pleasure,<br>
and in much delight and cheerfulness;<br>
and they skipping, ran here and there.</p>
<br>
<p>9  And the shepherd took very<br>
great satisfaction in his flock; and<br>
the countenance of that shepherd<br>
was cheerful, running up and down<br>
among his flock.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Then the angel said unto<br>
me, Seest then this shepherd?<br>
I answered, sir, I see him.<br>
He said unto me, this is the<br>
messenger of delight and pleasure.<br>
He therefore corrupts the minds<br>
of the servants of God, and turns<br>
them from the truth, delighting them<br>
with many pleasures, and they perish.</p>
<br>
<p>11   For they forget the commands<br>
of the living God, and live in<br>
luxury and in vain pleasures,<br>
and are corrupted by the evil<br>
angel, some of them even unto<br>
death; and others to a falling<br>
away.</p>
<br>
<p>12  I replied; I understand not<br>
what you mean, by saying unto<br>
death, and to a falling away.<br>
Hear, says he; all those sheep<br>
which thou sawest exceeding<br>
joyful, are such as have for ever<br>
departed from God, and given<br>
selves up to the lusts of this<br>
present time.</p>
<br>
<p>13  To these therefore there is<br>
no return, by repentance, unto<br>
life; because, to their other sins<br>
they have added this, that they<br>
have blasphemed the name of the<br>
lord: These kind of men are<br>
ordained unto death.</p>
<br>
<p>14  But those sheep which thou<br>
sawest not leaping, but feeding in<br>
one place; are such as have indeed<br>
given themselves up to pleasure<br>
and delights; but have not spoken<br>
anything wickedly against the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>15  These therefore are only<br>
fallen off from the truth, and so<br>
have yet hope laid up for them in<br>
repentance.  For such a falling off<br>
hath some hope still left of a<br>
renewal; but they that are dead,<br>
are utterly gone for ever.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Again we went a little farther<br>
forward, and he showed me a great<br>
shepherd, who had as it were a rustic<br>
figure; clad with a white goat's skin,<br>
having his bag upon his shoulder,<br>
and in his hand a stick full of knots,<br>
and very hard, and a whip in his other<br>
hand; and his countenance was stern and<br>
sour, enough to affright a man;<br>
such was his look.</p>
<br>
<p>17  He took from that young<br>
shepherd such sheep as lived in<br>
pleasures, but did not skip up and<br>
down; and drove them into a<br>
certain steep craggy place fall of<br>
thorns and briars, insomuch that<br>
they could not get themselves free<br>
from them:</p>
<br>
<p>18  But being entangled in them,<br>
fed upon thorns and briars, and<br>
were grievously tormented with<br>
his whipping. For he still drove<br>
them on, and afforded them not<br>
any place, or time, to stand still.</p>
<br>
<p>19  When therefore I saw them so<br>
cruelly whipped and afflicted,<br>
I was grieved for them; because<br>
they were greatly tormented, nor<br>
had they any rest afforded them.</p>
<br>
<p>20  And I said unto the shepherd<br>
that was with me: Sir, who is this<br>
cruel and implacable shepherd, who<br>
is moved with no compassion towards<br>
these sheep? He answered, This<br>
shepherd is indeed one of the holy<br>
angels, but is appointed for the<br>
punishment of sinners.</p>
<br>
<p>21  To him therefore are delivered<br>
those who have erred from God,<br>
and served the lusts and pleasures<br>
of this world. For this cause he<br>
punishes them every one according<br>
to their deserts, with cruel and<br>
various kinds of pains.</p>
<br>
<p>22  Sir, said I, I would know<br>
what kind of pains they are which<br>
every one undergoes? Hearken,<br>
said he; The several pains and<br>
torments are those which men<br>
every day undergo in their present<br>
lives.    For some  suffer losses;<br>
others poverty; others divers<br>
sicknesses. Some are unsettled; others<br>
suffer injuries from those that are<br>
unworthy; others fall under many<br>
other trials and inconveniences.</p>
<br>
<p>23  For many with an unsettled<br>
design at many things, and it<br>
profiteth them not; and they say<br>
that they have not success in their<br>
undertakings.</p>
<br>
<p>24  They do not call to their<br>
mind what they have done amiss,<br>
and they complain of the Lord.<br>
When therefore they shall have<br>
undergone all kind of vexation<br>
and inconvenience; then they are<br>
delivered over to me for good<br>
instruction, and are confirmed<br>
in the Faith of the Lord, and<br>
serve the Lord all the rest of<br>
their days with a pure mind.</p>
<br>
<p>25 And when they begin to repent<br>
of their sins, then they call to<br>
mind their works which they have<br>
done amiss, and give honour to<br>
God, saying, that he is a just<br>
Judge, and they have deservedly<br>
suffered all things according to<br>
their deeds.</p>
<br>
<p>26 Then for what remains of<br>
their lives, they serve God with a<br>
pure mind; and have success in<br>
all their undertakings, and receive<br>
from the Lord whatever they desire.</p>
<br>
<p>27  And then they give thanks<br>
unto the Lord that they were<br>
delivered unto me; nor do they<br>
suffer any more cruelty.</p>
<br>
<p>28  I said unto him; Sir, I entreat<br>
you still to show me now one thing.<br>
What, said he, dost thou ask?<br>
I said unto him; Are they who<br>
depart from the fear of God,<br>
tormented for the same time that<br>
they enjoyed their false delight<br>
and pleasures? He answered me;<br>
they are tormented for the same<br>
time.</p>
<br>
<p>29  And I said unto him; They<br>
are then tormented but little;<br>
whereas they who enjoy their<br>
pleasures so as to forget God,<br>
ought to endure seven times as<br>
much punishment.</p>
<br>
<p>30  He answered me; Thou art<br>
foolish, neither understandest thou<br>
the efficacy of this punishment.<br>
I said unto him; Sir, if I understood<br>
it, I would not desire you to tell me.</p>
<br>
<p>31  Hearken, said he, and learn<br>
what the force of both is, both of<br>
the pleasure and of the punishment.<br>
An hour of pleasure is terminated<br>
within its own space: but one hour<br>
of punishment has the efficacy of<br>
thirty days.   a Whosoever therefore<br>
enjoys his false pleasure for one day,<br>
and is one day, tormented; that one<br>
day of punishment is equivalent to<br>
a whole year's space.</p>
<br>
<p>32 Thus look how many days<br>
any one pursues his pleasures, so<br>
many years is he punished for it.<br>
You see therefore how that the<br>
time of worldly enjoyments is but<br>
short; but that of pain and torments,<br>
a great deal more.</p>
<br>
<p>33  I replied; Sir, forasmuch as<br>
I do not understand at all these<br>
times of pleasure and pain; I<br>
entreat you that you would explain<br>
yourself more clearly concerning<br>
them. He answered me, saying;<br>
Thy foolishness still sticks unto<br>
thee.</p>
<br>
<p>34.  Shouldst thou not rather<br>
purify thy mind, and serve God?<br>
Take heed, lest when thy time is<br>
fulfilled, thou be found still<br>
unwise. Hear then, as thou desirest,<br>
that thou mayest the more easily<br>
understand.</p>
<br>
<p>35  He that gives himself up one<br>
day to his pleasures and delights,<br>
and does whatsoever his soul desires,<br>
is full of great folly, nor understands<br>
what he does, but the day following<br>
forgets what he did the day before.</p>
<br>
<p>36  For delight and worldly<br>
pleasure are not kept in memory,<br>
by reason of the folly that is rooted<br>
in them.  But when pain and torment<br>
befal a man a day, he is in effect<br>
troubled the whole year after;<br>
because his punishment continues<br>
firm in his memory.</p>
<br>
<p>37  Wherefore he remembers it<br>
with sorrow the whole year; and<br>
then calls to mind his vain pleasure<br>
and delight, and perceives that for<br>
the sake of that he was punished.</p>
<br>
<p>38  Whosoever therefore have<br>
delivered themselves over to such<br>
pleasures, are thus punished; because<br>
that when they had life, they rendered<br>
themselves liable to death.</p>
<br>
<p>39  I said unto him; Sir, what<br>
pleasures are hurtful? He answered;<br>
That is pleasure to every man<br>
which he doth willingly.</p>
<br>
<p>40  For the angry man, gratifying<br>
his passion, perceives pleasure<br>
in it; and so the adulterer, and<br>
drunkard; the slanderer and liar;<br>
the covetous man and the defrauder;<br>
and whosoever commits anything like<br>
unto these, he followeth his evil<br>
disposition, because he receives<br>
a satisfaction in the doing of it.</p>
<br>
<p>41  All these pleasures and delights<br>
are hurtful to the servants of God.<br>
For these therefore they are tormented<br>
and suffer punishment.</p>
<br>
<p>42  There are also pleasures that<br>
bring salvation unto men. For many,<br>
when they do what is good, find<br>
pleasure in it, and are attracted<br>
by the delights of it.</p>
<br>
<p>43  Now this pleasure is profitable<br>
to the servants of God, and brings<br>
life to such men; but those hurtful<br>
pleasures, which were before mentioned,<br>
bring torments and punishment.</p>
<br>
<p>44  And whosoever shall continue<br>
in them, and shall not repent of<br>
what they have done, shall bring<br>
death upon themselves.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>SIMILITUDE VII.</p>
<br>
<p>     That they who repent, must bring forth,<br>
     fruits worthy of repent once.</p>
<br>
<p>AFTER a few days I saw the<br>
same person that before talked<br>
with me, in the same field, in<br>
which I had seen those shepherds,<br>
And he said unto me; What seekest<br>
thou? Sir, said I, I came to entreat<br>
you that You would command the<br>
shepherd, who is the minister of<br>
punishment, to depart out of my<br>
house, because he greatly afflicts<br>
me.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And he answered, It is necessary<br>
for thee to endure inconveniencies<br>
and vexations; for so that good angel<br>
hath commanded concerning thee,<br>
because he would try thee.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Sir, said I; What so great<br>
offence have I committed, that I<br>
should be delivered to this messenger?<br>
Hearken, said he: Thou art indeed<br>
guilty of many sins, yet not so<br>
many that thou shouldest be<br>
delivered to this messenger.</p>
<br>
<p>5  But thy house hath committed<br>
many sins and offences, and therefore<br>
that good messenger being grieved<br>
at their doings commanded that for<br>
some time thou shouldst suffer<br>
affliction; that they may both<br>
repent of what they have done, and<br>
may wash themselves from all the<br>
lusts of this present world.</p>
<br>
<p>6  When therefore they shall have<br>
repented, and be purified, then that<br>
messenger which is appointed over<br>
thy punishment, shall depart from<br>
thee.</p>
<br>
<p>7  I said unto him; Sir, if they<br>
have behaved themselves so as to<br>
anger that good angel, yet what<br>
have I done? He answered: They<br>
cannot otherwise be afflicted,<br>
unless thou, who art the head<br>
of the family, suffer.</p>
<br>
<p>8  For whatsoever thou shalt<br>
suffer, they must needs feel it<br>
but as long as thou shalt stand<br>
well established, they cannot<br>
experience any vexation.</p>
<br>
<p>9  I replied; But, sir, behold<br>
they also now repent with all their<br>
hearts. I know, says he, that they<br>
repent with all their hearts; but<br>
dost thou therefore think that their<br>
offences who repent, are immediately<br>
blotted out.</p>
<br>
<p>10  No, they are not presently;<br>
but he that repents must afflict his<br>
soul and show himself humble in<br>
all his affairs, and undergo many<br>
and divers vexations.</p>
<br>
<p>11  And when he shall have suffered<br>
all things that were appointed for him;<br>
then perhaps HE that made him, and<br>
formed all things besides, will be<br>
moved with compassion towards him,<br>
and afford him some remedy; and<br>
especially if HE shall perceive<br>
his heart who repents, to be free<br>
from every evil work.</p>
<br>
<p>12  But at present it is expedient<br>
for thee, and for thy house, to be<br>
grieved; and it is needful that<br>
thou shoudest endure much vexation,<br>
as the angel of the Lord who committed<br>
thee unto me, has commanded.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Rather give thanks unto the<br>
Lord, that knowing what was to<br>
come he thought thee worthy, to<br>
whom he should foretel that trouble<br>
was coming upon thee, who art able<br>
to bear it.</p>
<br>
<p>14  I said unto him; Sir, but be<br>
thou also with me, and I shall<br>
easily undergo any trouble. I will,<br>
said he, be with thee; and I will<br>
entreat the messenger who is set<br>
over thy punishment, that he<br>
would moderate his afflictions<br>
towards thee.</p>
<br>
<p>15  And moreover thou shalt<br>
suffer adversity but for a little<br>
time; and then thou shalt again<br>
be restored to thy former state;<br>
only continue on in the humility<br>
of thy mind.</p>
<br>
<p>16  Obey the Lord with a pure<br>
heart; thou, and thy house, and<br>
thy children; and. walk in the<br>
commands which I have delivered<br>
unto thee; and then thy repentance<br>
may be firm and pure.</p>
<br>
<p>17  And if thou shalt keep<br>
these things with thy house, thy<br>
inconveniencies shall depart from thee.</p>
<br>
<p>18  And all vexation shall in like<br>
manner depart from those, whosoever<br>
shall walk according to these commands.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>SIMILITUDE VIII.</p>
<br>
<p>     That there are many kinds of elect, and of<br>
     repenting sinners: and how all of theca shall<br>
     receive a reward proportionable to the measure<br>
     of their repentance and good works.</p>
<br>
<p>AGAIN he showed me a willow<br>
which covered the fields and<br>
the mountains, under whose shadow<br>
came all such as were called by<br>
the name of the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And by that willow stood an.<br>
angel of the Lord very excellent<br>
and lofty, and did cut down bows<br>
from the willow with a great<br>
hook; and reached out to the people<br>
that were under the shadow of the<br>
willow, little rods, as it were<br>
about a foot long.</p>
<br>
<p>3  And when all of them had<br>
taken them, he laid aside his hook,<br>
and the tree continued entire, as I<br>
had before seen it; at which I<br>
wondered, and mused within myself.</p>
<br>
<p>4  Then that shepherd said unto<br>
me; Forbear to wonder that the<br>
tree continues whole,<br>
not-with-standing so many boughs have<br>
been cut off from it: but stay a<br>
little, for now it shall be shown<br>
thee, what that angel means, who<br>
gave those rods to the people.</p>
<br>
<p>5  So he again demanded the<br>
rods of them; and in the same<br>
order that every one had received<br>
them, was he called to him, and<br>
restored his rod; which when he<br>
had received, he examined them.</p>
<br>
<p>6  From some he received them<br>
dry and rotten, and as it were<br>
touched with the moth; those he<br>
commanded to be separated from<br>
the rest, and placed by themselves.<br>
Others gave in their rods dry<br>
indeed, but not touched with the<br>
moth: these also he ordered to be<br>
set by themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>7  Others gave in their rods half<br>
dry; these also were set apart,<br>
Others gave in their rods half dry<br>
and cleft; these too were set by<br>
themselves. Others brought in<br>
their rods half dry and half green,<br>
and these were in like manner<br>
placed by themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>8  Others delivered up their rods<br>
two parts green, and the third<br>
dry; and they too were set apart.<br>
Others brought their rods two<br>
parts dry, and the third green;<br>
and were also placed by themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>9  Others delivered up their rods<br>
less dry (for there was but a very<br>
little, to wit, their tops dry), but<br>
they had clefts, and these were set<br>
in like manner by themselves. In<br>
the rods of others there was but a<br>
little green, and the rest dry; and<br>
these were set aside by themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>10  Others came, and brought<br>
their rods green as they had<br>
received them, and the greatest<br>
part of the people brought their<br>
rods thus; and the messenger<br>
greatly rejoiced at these, and they<br>
also were put apart by themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>11  Others brought in their rods<br>
not only green, but full of branches;<br>
and these were set aside, being<br>
also received by the angel<br>
with great joy. Others brought<br>
their rods green with branches,<br>
and those also some fruit upon<br>
them.</p>
<br>
<p>12  They who had such rods,<br>
were very cheerful; and the angel<br>
himself took great joy at them;<br>
nor was the shepherd that stood<br>
with me, less pleased with them.</p>
<br>
<p>13  Then the angel of the Lord<br>
commanded crowns to be brought,<br>
and the crowns were brought made<br>
of palms; and the angel crowned<br>
those men in whose rods he found<br>
the young branches with fruit, and<br>
commanded them to go into the<br>
tower.</p>
<br>
<p>14  He also sent those into the<br>
tower, in whose hands he found<br>
branches without fruit, giving a<br>
seal unto them. For they had the<br>
same garment, that is, one white<br>
as snow; with which he bade them<br>
go into the tower   And so he did<br>
to those who returned their rods<br>
green as they had received them;<br>
giving them a white garment, and<br>
so sent them away to go into the<br>
tower.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Having done this, he said to<br>
the shepherd that was with me,<br>
I go my way; but do thou send<br>
these within the walls, every one<br>
into the place in which he has<br>
deserved to dwell; examining first<br>
their rods, but examine them<br>
diligently that no one deceive thee;<br>
and if any one shall escape thee,<br>
I will try them upon the altar.<br>
Having said this to the shepherd,<br>
he departed.</p>
<br>
<p>16  After he was gone, the shepherd<br>
said unto me; Let us take the rods<br>
from them, and plant them; if<br>
perchance they may grow green again.<br>
I said unto him; Sir, how can those<br>
dry rods ever grow green again?</p>
<br>
<p>17  He answered me; That tree.<br>
is a willow, and always loves to<br>
live. If therefore these rods shall<br>
be planted, and receive a little<br>
moisture, many of them will<br>
recover themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>18  Wherefore I will try, and<br>
will pour water upon them, and if<br>
any of them can live, I will rejoice<br>
with them; but if not, at least by<br>
this means I shall be found not<br>
to have neglected my part.</p>
<br>
<p>19  Then he commanded me to<br>
call them; and they all came<br>
unto him, every one in the rank<br>
in which he stood, and gave him<br>
their rods; which having received<br>
he planted every one of them in<br>
their several orders.</p>
<br>
<p>20  And after he had planted<br>
them all, he poured much water<br>
upon them, insomuch that they<br>
were covered with water, and did<br>
not appear above it. Then when<br>
he had watered them, he said unto<br>
me; Let us depart, and after a<br>
little time we will return and visit<br>
them.</p>
<br>
<p>21  For he who created this tree,<br>
would have all those live that<br>
received rods from it.   And I hope<br>
now that these rods are thus<br>
watered, many of them receiving<br>
in the moisture, will recover:</p>
<br>
<p>22  I said unto him, Sir, tell<br>
me what this tree denotes? For I<br>
am greatly astonished, that after<br>
so many branches have been cut<br>
off, it seems still to be whole:<br>
nor does there any thing the less<br>
of it appear to remain, which<br>
greatly amazes me.</p>
<br>
<p>23  He answered, Hearken. This<br>
great tree which covers the plains<br>
and the mountains, and all the<br>
earth, is the law of God, published<br>
throughout the whole world.</p>
<br>
<p>24  Now this law is the Son of<br>
God, who is preached to all the<br>
ends of the earth. The people<br>
that stand under its shadow, are<br>
those which have heard his preaching,<br>
and believed.</p>
<br>
<p>25  The great and venerable<br>
angel which you saw, was Michael<br>
who had the power over his people,<br>
and governs them. For he has<br>
planted the law in the hearts<br>
of those who have believed: and<br>
therefore he visits them to whom<br>
lie has given the law, to see if<br>
they have kept it.</p>
<br>
<p>26  And he examines every<br>
one's rod; and of those, many that<br>
are weakened: for those rods are<br>
the law of the Lord. Then he discerns<br>
all those who have not kept the law,<br>
knowing the place of every one of them.</p>
<br>
<p>27  I said unto him, Sir, why<br>
did he send away some to the<br>
tower, and left others here to you?<br>
He replied, those who have<br>
transgressed the law, which they<br>
received from him, are left in my<br>
power, that they may repent of<br>
their sins: but they who fulfilled<br>
this law and kept it, are under his<br>
power.</p>
<br>
<p>28 But who then, said I, are<br>
those, who went into the tower<br>
crowned? He replied, all such as<br>
having striven with the devil, have<br>
overcome him, are crowned: and<br>
they are those, who have suffered<br>
hard things, that they might keep<br>
the law.</p>
<br>
<p>29  But they who gave up their<br>
rods green, and with young<br>
branches, but without fruit, have<br>
indeed endured trouble for the<br>
same law, but have not suffered<br>
death; neither have they denied<br>
their holy law.</p>
<br>
<p>30  They who delivered up their<br>
rods green as they received them,<br>
are those who were modest and<br>
just, and have lived with a<br>
very pure mind, and kept the<br>
commandments of God.</p>
<br>
<p>31  The rest thou shalt know,<br>
when I shall have considered those<br>
rods which I have planted and<br>
watered.</p>
<br>
<p>32  After a few days we returned,<br>
and in the same place stood that<br>
glorious angel, and I stood by him.<br>
Then he said unto me; Gird thyself<br>
with a towel, and serve me.</p>
<br>
<p>33  And I girded myself with<br>
a clean towel, which was made of<br>
coarse cloth. And when he saw<br>
me girded, and ready to minister<br>
unto him, he said, Call those men<br>
whose rods have been planted,<br>
every one in his order as he<br>
gave them.</p>
<br>
<p>34  And he brought me into the<br>
field, and I called them all,<br>
and they all stood ready in their<br>
several ranks. Then he said unto<br>
them; let every one pluck up his<br>
rod, and bring it unto me. And<br>
first they delivered theirs, whose<br>
rods had been dry and rotten.</p>
<br>
<p>35  And those whose rods still<br>
continued so, he commanded to<br>
stand apart. Then they came<br>
whose rods had been dry but not<br>
rotten. Some of these delivered.<br>
in their rods green; others dry<br>
and rotten, as if they had been<br>
touched by the moth.</p>
<br>
<p>36  Those who gave them up<br>
green, he commanded to stand<br>
apart: but those whose rods were<br>
dry and rotten, he caused to stand<br>
with the first sort. Then came<br>
they whose rods had been half<br>
dry, and cleft: many of these<br>
gave up their rods green, and<br>
uncleft.</p>
<br>
<p>37  Others delivered them up<br>
green with branches, like unto<br>
theirs who went crowned into the<br>
tower. Others delivered them<br>
up dry, but not rotten; and some<br>
gave them up as they were before,<br>
all dry, and cleft.</p>
<br>
<p>38  Every one of these he ordered<br>
to stand apart; some by themselves,<br>
others in their respective ranks.</p>
<br>
<p>32  Then came they whose rods<br>
had been green, but cleft. These<br>
delivered their rods altogether<br>
green, and stood in their own<br>
order. And the shepherd rejoiced<br>
at these, because they were all<br>
changed, and free from their<br>
clefts.</p>
<br>
<p>40  Then they gave in their rods,<br>
who had them half green and<br>
half dry. Of these some were<br>
found wholly green, others half<br>
dry: others green, with young<br>
shoots.   And all these were sent<br>
away, every one to his proper<br>
rank.</p>
<br>
<p>41  Then they gave up their<br>
rods, who had them before two<br>
parts green, and the third dry.<br>
Many of those gave in their rods<br>
green; many half dry; the rest<br>
dry but not rotten. So these were<br>
sent away, each to his proper<br>
place.</p>
<br>
<p>42  Then came they who before<br>
had their rods two parts dry and<br>
the third green; many of these<br>
delivered up their rods half dry,<br>
others dry and rotten; others half<br>
dry and cleft: but few green. And<br>
all these were set every one in his<br>
own rank.</p>
<br>
<p>43  Then they reached in their<br>
rods, in which there was before<br>
but a little green, and the rest<br>
dry. Their rods were for the<br>
most part found green, having<br>
little boughs, with fruit upon<br>
them; and the rest altogether<br>
green.</p>
<br>
<p>44  And the shepherd upon sight<br>
of these rejoiced exceedingly,<br>
because he had found them thus;<br>
and they also went to their<br>
proper orders.</p>
<br>
<p>45  Now after he had examined<br>
all their rods, he said unto me,<br>
I told thee that this tree loved<br>
life thou seest how many have<br>
repented, and attained unto<br>
salvation. Sir, said I, I see it.</p>
<br>
<p>46  That thou mightest know<br>
saith he, that the goodness and<br>
mercy of the Lord is great, and<br>
to be had in honour; who gave<br>
his spirit to them that were found<br>
worthy of repentance.</p>
<br>
<p>47  I answered, Sir, why then<br>
did not all of them repent? He<br>
replied, Those whose minds the<br>
Lords foresaw would be pure, and<br>
that they would serve him with<br>
all their hearts, to them he gave<br>
repentance.</p>
<br>
<p>48  But for those whose deceit<br>
and wickedness he beheld, and<br>
perceived that they would not<br>
truly return unto him; to them<br>
he denied any return unto<br>
repentance, lest they should again<br>
blaspheme his law with wicked<br>
words.</p>
<br>
<p>49  I said unto him; Now, Sir,<br>
make known unto me, what is the<br>
place of every one of those, who<br>
have given up their rods, and<br>
what their portion; that when<br>
they may have not kept their seal<br>
entire, but have wasted the seal<br>
which they received, shall hear<br>
and believe these thins, and may<br>
acknowledge their evil deeds and<br>
repent;</p>
<br>
<p>50  And receiving again their<br>
seal from you, may give glory to<br>
God, that he was moved with<br>
compassion towards them, and sent<br>
you to renew their spirits.</p>
<br>
<p>51  Hearken, said he; they<br>
whose rods have been found<br>
and rotten, and as it were touch<br>
with the moth; are the deserters<br>
and the betrayers of the church;</p>
<br>
<p>52  Who with the rest of their<br>
crimes, have also blasphemed the<br>
Lord, and denied his name when<br>
he had called upon them. Therefore<br>
all these are dead unto God<br>
and thou seest that none of them<br>
have repented, although they<br>
have heard my commands which<br>
thou bast delivered unto them.<br>
From these men therefore life is<br>
far distant.</p>
<br>
<p>53 They also who have delivered<br>
up their rods dry, but not rotten,<br>
have not been far from them. For<br>
they have been counterfeits,<br>
and brought in evil doctrines,<br>
and have perverted the servants<br>
of God, especially those<br>
who had sinned; not suffering<br>
them to return unto repentance,<br>
but keeping them back by their<br>
false doctrines.</p>
<br>
<p>54  These therefore have hope;<br>
and thou seest that many of them<br>
have repented, since the time<br>
that thou hast laid my commands<br>
before them; and many more<br>
will yet repent. But they, that<br>
shall not repent; shall lose both<br>
repentance and life.</p>
<br>
<p>55  But they that have repented,<br>
their place is begun to be within<br>
the first walls, and some of them<br>
are even gone into the tower.<br>
Thou seest therefore, said he, that<br>
in the repentance of sinners there<br>
is life; but for those who repent<br>
not, death is prepared.</p>
<br>
<p>56  Hear now   concerning<br>
those who gave in their rods half<br>
dry and full of clefts. Those whose<br>
rods were only half dry, are the<br>
doubtful; for they are neither<br>
living nor dead.</p>
<br>
<p>57  But they who delivered in<br>
their rods, not only half dry but<br>
also full of clefts, are both doubtful<br>
and evil speakers; who detract from<br>
those that are absent, and have<br>
never peace among themselves,<br>
and who envy one another.</p>
<br>
<p>58  Howbeit, to those also<br>
repentance is offered; for thou<br>
seest that some of these have<br>
repented.</p>
<br>
<p>59  Now all those of this kind<br>
who have quickly repented, shall<br>
have a place in the tower; and<br>
they who have been more slow in<br>
their repentance, shall dwell within<br>
the walls: but they that shall<br>
not repent, and shall continue on<br>
in their wicked doings, shall die<br>
the death.</p>
<br>
<p>60  As for those who had their<br>
rods green, but yet cleft; they<br>
are such as were always faithful<br>
and good, but they had some envy<br>
and strife among themselves<br>
concerning dignity and pre-eminence.</p>
<br>
<p>61  Now all such as are vain, and<br>
without understanding, contend<br>
with one another about these<br>
things.</p>
<br>
<p>62  Nevertheless, seeing they<br>
are otherwise good, if when they<br>
shall hear these commands they<br>
shall amend themselves, and shall<br>
at my persuasion suddenly repent;<br>
they shall at last dwell in the<br>
tower, like those who have truly<br>
and worthily repented.</p>
<br>
<p>63  But if any one shall again<br>
return to his dissension; he shall<br>
be shut out from the tower, and<br>
shall lose his life. For the life<br>
of those who keep the commandments<br>
of the Lord, consists in doing<br>
what they are commanded; not in<br>
principality, or in any other<br>
dignity.</p>
<br>
<p>64  For by forbearance and humility<br>
of mind, men shall attain unto life;<br>
but by seditions and contempt of the<br>
law, they shall purchase death unto<br>
themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>65  They who in their rods<br>
had half dry and half green, are<br>
those who are engaged in many<br>
affairs of the world, and are not<br>
joined to the saints. For which<br>
cause half of them liveth, and<br>
half is dead.</p>
<br>
<p>66  Wherefore many of these<br>
since the time that they have<br>
heard my commands, have repented,<br>
and begun to dwell in the tower.<br>
But some of them have<br>
wholly fallen away; to these there<br>
is no more place for repentance.</p>
<br>
<p>67  For by reason of their present<br>
interests, they have blasphemed<br>
and denied God: and for this<br>
wickedness they have lost life.<br>
And of these many are still in<br>
doubt, yet these may return; and<br>
if they shall quickly repent, they<br>
shall have a place in the tower;<br>
but if they shall be more slow,<br>
they shall dwell within the walls;<br>
but if they shall not repent, they<br>
shall die.</p>
<br>
<p>68  As for those who had two<br>
parts of their rods green, and the<br>
third dry; they have by manifold<br>
ways denied the Lord. Of these<br>
many have repented, and found<br>
a place in the tower: and many<br>
have altogether departed from<br>
God. These have utterly lost life.</p>
<br>
<p>69  And some being in a doubtful<br>
state, have raise up dissensions:<br>
these may yet return, if they<br>
shall suddenly repent and not<br>
continue in their lusts; but if<br>
they shall continue in their<br>
evil-doing they shall die.</p>
<br>
<p>70  They who gave in their<br>
rods two parts dry, and the other<br>
been, are those who have indeed<br>
been faithful, but withal rich and<br>
full of good things; and thereupon<br>
upon have desired to be famous<br>
among the heathen which are<br>
without, and have thereby fallen<br>
into great pride, and begun to<br>
aim at high matters, and to<br>
forsake the truth.</p>
<br>
<p>71  Nor were they joined to the<br>
saints, but lived with the heathen;<br>
and this life seemed the more pleasant<br>
to them. Howbeit they have not<br>
departed from God, but continued<br>
in the faith; only they have<br>
not wrought the works of faith.</p>
<br>
<p>72  Many therefore of these have<br>
repented; and begun to dwell in<br>
the tower. Yet others still living<br>
among the heathen. people, and<br>
being lifted up with their vanities,<br>
have utterly fallen away from<br>
God, and followed the works and<br>
wickedness of the heathen.<br>
These kind of men therefore are<br>
reckoned among strangers to the<br>
Gospel.</p>
<br>
<p>73 Others of these began to be<br>
doubtful in their minds; despairing<br>
by reason of their wicked doings<br>
ever to attain unto salvation<br>
Others being thus made doubtful,<br>
did moreover stir up dissensions.</p>
<br>
<p>74  To these therefore, and to<br>
those who by reason of their doings<br>
are become doubtful, there is still<br>
hope of return; but they must repent<br>
quickly, that their place may be in<br>
the tower. But they that repent not,<br>
and continue still in their pleasures,<br>
are nigh unto death.</p>
<br>
<p>75   As for those who gave in<br>
their rods green, excepting their<br>
tops, which only were dry, and<br>
had clefts; these were always<br>
good, and faithful, and upright<br>
before God: nevertheless they<br>
sinned a little, by reason of their<br>
empty pleasures and trifling<br>
thoughts which they had within<br>
themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>76  Wherefore many of them<br>
when they heard my words,<br>
repented forthwith, and began to<br>
dwell in the tower. Nevertheless<br>
some grew doubtful, and others<br>
to their doubtful minds added<br>
dissensions. To these therefore<br>
there is still hope of return,<br>
because they were always good;<br>
but they shall not hardly be moved.</p>
<br>
<p>77  As for those, lastly, who<br>
gave in their rods dry, their tops<br>
only excepted, which alone were<br>
green; they are such as have<br>
believed indeed in God, but have<br>
lived in wickedness; yet without<br>
departing from God: having always<br>
willingly borne the name of the<br>
Lord, and readily received into<br>
their houses the servants of God.</p>
<br>
<p>78  Wherefore hearing these<br>
things they returned, and without<br>
delay repented, and lived in all<br>
righteousness. And some of them<br>
suffered death: others readily<br>
underwent many trials, being<br>
mindful of their evil doings.</p>
<br>
<p>79  If And when he had ended<br>
his explications of all the rods,<br>
he said unto me, Go, and say unto<br>
all men that they repent, and they<br>
shall live unto God; because the<br>
Lord being moved with great<br>
clemency hath sent me to preach<br>
repentance unto all:</p>
<br>
<p>80  Even unto those who by<br>
reason of their evil doings, deserve<br>
not to attain unto salvation. But<br>
the Lord will by patient, and keep<br>
the invitation that was made by<br>
his Son.</p>
<br>
<p>81  I said unto him, sir, I hope<br>
that all when they shall hear these<br>
things, will repent. For I trust<br>
that everyone acknowledging his<br>
crimes, and taking up the fear<br>
of the Lord, will return unto<br>
repentance.</p>
<br>
<p>82  He said unto me, Whosoever<br>
shall repent with all their<br>
hearts, and cleanse themselves<br>
from all the evils that I have<br>
before mentioned, and not add<br>
anything more to their sins,<br>
shall receive from the Lord cure<br>
of their former iniquities, if they do<br>
not make any doubt of these commands,<br>
and shall live unto God.</p>
<br>
<p>83  But they that shall continue<br>
to add to their transgressions, and<br>
still converse with the lusts of<br>
the present world, shall condemn<br>
themselves unto death. But do<br>
thou walk in these commands, and<br>
whosoever shall Walk in these, and<br>
exercise them rightly, shall live<br>
unto God.</p>
<br>
<p>84  And having showed me all<br>
these things, he said; I will show<br>
thee the rest in a few days.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>SIMILITUDE IX.</p>
<br>
<p>     The greatest mysteries of the militant and<br>
     triumphant Church which is to be built.</p>
<br>
<p>AFTER I had Written the Commands<br>
and similitudes of the Shepherd,<br>
the Angel of Repentance came unto<br>
me, and said to me, I will show<br>
thee all those things which the<br>
Spirit spake with thee under<br>
the figure of the church. For<br>
that Spirit is the Son of God.</p>
<br>
<p>2  And because thou wert weak<br>
in body, it was not declared unto<br>
thee by the angel, until thou wert<br>
strengthened by the Spirit, and<br>
increased in force, that thou<br>
mightest also see the angel:</p>
<br>
<p>3  For then indeed the building<br>
of the tower was very well and<br>
gloriously shown unto thee by the<br>
church; nevertheless thou sawest<br>
all things shown unto thee as it<br>
were by a virgin.</p>
<br>
<p>4  But now thou art enlightened<br>
by the angel, and yet by the same<br>
Spirit. But thou must consider<br>
all things diligently; for therefore<br>
am I sent into thy house by that<br>
venerable messenger, that when<br>
thou shalt have seen all things<br>
powerfully, thou mayest not be<br>
afraid as before.</p>
<br>
<p>5  And he led me to the height<br>
of a mountain in Arcadia, and we<br>
sat upon its top. And he showed<br>
me a great plain, and about it<br>
twelve mountains in different<br>
figures.</p>
<br>
<p>6  The first was black as soot.<br>
The second was smooth, without<br>
herbs. The third was full of<br>
thorns and thistles. The fourth<br>
had herbs half dried; of which<br>
the upper part was green, but that<br>
next the root was dry; and some<br>
of the herbs, when the sun grew<br>
hot, were dry.</p>
<br>
<p>7  The fifth mountain was very<br>
rugged; but yet had green herbs.<br>
The sixth mountain was full of<br>
clefts, some lesser, and some<br>
greater; and in these clefts grew<br>
grass, not flourishing, but which<br>
seemed to be withering.</p>
<br>
<p>8  The seventh mountain had<br>
delightful pasture, and was wholly<br>
fruitful; and all kinds of cattle,<br>
and of the birds of heaven; fed<br>
upon it; and the more they fed<br>
on it, the more and better did the<br>
grass grow.</p>
<br>
<p>9  The eighth mountain was full<br>
of fountains, and from those<br>
fountains were watered all kinds of<br>
the creatures of Cod. The ninth<br>
mountain had no water at all, but<br>
was wholly destitute of it; and<br>
nourished deadly serpents, very<br>
destructive to men.</p>
<br>
<p>10  The tenth mountain was full<br>
of tall trees, and altogether shady;<br>
and under the shade of them lay<br>
cattle resting and chewing the cud.</p>
<br>
<p>11  The eleventh mountain was<br>
full of the thickest trees, and<br>
those trees seemed to be loaded<br>
with several sorts of fruits; that<br>
whosoever saw them could not choose<br>
but desire to eat of their fruit.</p>
<br>
<p>12  The twelfth mountain was<br>
altogether white, and of a most<br>
pleasant aspect, and itself gave a<br>
most excellent beauty to itself.</p>
<br>
<p>13  In the middle of the plain<br>
he showed me a huge white rock,<br>
which rose out of the plain, and<br>
the rock was higher than those<br>
mountains, and was square; so<br>
that it seemed capable of supporting<br>
the whole world.</p>
<br>
<p>14  It looked to me to be old,<br>
yet it had in it a new gate, which<br>
seemed to have been newly hewn<br>
out of it. Now that gate was<br>
bright beyond the sun itself;<br>
insomuch, that I greatly wondered<br>
at its light.</p>
<br>
<p>15 About the gate stood twelve<br>
virgins; of which four that stood<br>
at the corners of the gate, seemed<br>
to me to be the chiefest, although<br>
the rest were also of worth: and<br>
they stood in the four parts of the<br>
gate.</p>
<br>
<p>16  It added also to the grace of<br>
those virgins, that they stood in<br>
pairs, clothed with linen garments,<br>
and decently girded, their right<br>
arms being at liberty, as if they<br>
were about to lift up some burthen;<br>
for so they were adorned, and were<br>
exceeding cheerful and ready.</p>
<br>
<p>17  When I saw this, I wondered<br>
with myself to see such great<br>
and noble things. And again I<br>
admired upon the account of those<br>
virgins, that they were so handsome<br>
and delicate; and stood with such<br>
firmness and constancy, as if they<br>
would carry the whole heaven.</p>
<br>
<p>18  And as I was thinking thus<br>
within myself, the shepherd said<br>
unto me; What thickest thou within<br>
thyself? Why art thou disquieted,<br>
and fillest thyself with care?</p>
<br>
<p>19  Do not seem to consider, as<br>
if thou wert wise, what thou doest<br>
not understand, but pray unto the<br>
Lord, that thou mayest have ability<br>
to understand it. What is to come<br>
thou canst not understand, but<br>
thou seest that which is before<br>
thee.</p>
<br>
<p>20  Be not therefore disquieted<br>
at those things which thou canst<br>
not see; but get the understanding<br>
of those which thou seest.</p>
<br>
<p>21  Forbear to be curious; and<br>
I will show thee all things that I<br>
ought to declare unto thee: but<br>
first consider what yet remains.</p>
<br>
<p>22  And when he had said this unto<br>
me I looked up, and behold I saw<br>
six tall and venerable men coming;<br>
their countenances were all alike,<br>
and they called a certain multitude<br>
of men; and they who came at their<br>
call were also tall and stout.</p>
<br>
<p>23  And those six commanded<br>
them to build a certain tower over<br>
that gate. And immediately there<br>
began to be a great noise of those<br>
men running here and there about<br>
the gate, who were come together<br>
to build the tower.</p>
<br>
<p>24  But those virgins which stood<br>
about the gate perceived that the<br>
building of the tower was to be<br>
hastened by them. And they<br>
stretched out their hands, as if<br>
they were to receive somewhat<br>
from them to do.</p>
<br>
<p>25  Then those six men commanded,<br>
that they should lift up stones<br>
out of a certain deep place,<br>
and prepare them for the building<br>
of the tower. And there were<br>
lifted up ten white stones, square,<br>
and not cut round.</p>
<br>
<p>26  Then those six men called<br>
the ten virgins to them, and<br>
commanded them to carry all the<br>
stones that were to be put into<br>
the building, and having carried<br>
them through the gate to deliver<br>
them to those that were about to<br>
build the tower.</p>
<br>
<p>27  Immediately the virgins began<br>
all of them together to lift up<br>
those stones, that were before<br>
taken out of the deep.</p>
<br>
<p>28  And they who also stood about<br>
the gate did carry stones in such<br>
a manner, that those stones which<br>
seemed to be the strongest were<br>
laid at the corners, and the rest<br>
were put into the sides;</p>
<br>
<p>29  And thus they carried all the<br>
stones, and bringing them through<br>
the gate delivered them to the<br>
builders, as they had been<br>
commanded: who receiving them<br>
at their hands, built with them.</p>
<br>
<p>30  But this building was made<br>
upon that great rock, and over the<br>
gate; and by these the whole tower<br>
was supported. But the building<br>
of the ten stones filled the whole<br>
gate, which began to be made for<br>
the foundation of that tower.</p>
<br>
<p>31  After those ten stones did<br>
five and twenty others rise up<br>
out of the deep; and these were<br>
placed in the building of the same<br>
tower; being lifted up by those<br>
virgins, as the others had been<br>
before.</p>
<br>
<p>32 After these did fire and thirty<br>
others rise up; and these were also<br>
in like manner fitted into the same<br>
work. Then forty other stones were<br>
brought up, and all these were added<br>
unto the building of that tower.</p>
<br>
<p>33  So there began to be four<br>
ranks in the foundation of that<br>
tower; and the stones ceased to<br>
rise out of the deep; and they<br>
also which built rested a little.</p>
<br>
<p>34  Again, those six men commanded<br>
the multitude, that they should<br>
bring stones out of those twelve<br>
mountains to the building of the<br>
same tower.</p>
<br>
<p>35  So they cut out of all the<br>
mountains stones of divers colours,<br>
and brought them and gave them to<br>
the virgins; which when they had<br>
received they carried them, and<br>
delivered them into the building<br>
of the tower.</p>
<br>
<p>36 In which when they were built<br>
they became white, and different<br>
from what they were before; for<br>
they were all alike, and did<br>
change their former colours.<br>
And some were reached up by the<br>
men themselves, which when they<br>
came into the building, continued<br>
such is they were put in.</p>
<br>
<p>37  These neither became white,<br>
nor different from what they were<br>
before; because they were not<br>
carried by the virgins through<br>
the gate. Wherefore these stones<br>
were disagreeable in the building;<br>
which, when these six men perceived<br>
they commanded them to be removed,<br>
and put again in the place from<br>
which they were brought.</p>
<br>
<p>38  And they said to those who<br>
brought these stones; Do not ye<br>
reach up to us any stones for this<br>
building, but lay them down by<br>
the tower, that these virgins may<br>
carry them and reach them to us.</p>
<br>
<p>39  For unless they shall be<br>
carried by these virgins through<br>
this gate, they cannot change their<br>
colours: therefore do not labour<br>
in vain.</p>
<br>
<p>40  So the building that day<br>
was done; howbeit the tower was<br>
not finished, for it was afterwards<br>
to be built; therefore now also<br>
there was some delay made of it.</p>
<br>
<p>41  And these six men commanded<br>
those that built to depart, and<br>
as it were to rest for some time;<br>
but they ordered those virgins<br>
that they should not depart from<br>
the tower; so now they seemed<br>
to me to be left for the guarding<br>
of it.</p>
<br>
<p>42  When all were departed,<br>
I said unto the shepherd; Sir,<br>
why is not the building of the<br>
tower finished? Because it cannot,<br>
said he, be finished until its Lord<br>
comes, and approves of the building;<br>
that if he shall find any stones<br>
in it that are not good they may<br>
be changed; for this tower is built<br>
according to his will.</p>
<br>
<p>43  Sir, said I, I would know<br>
what the building of this tower<br>
signifies; as also I would be<br>
informed concerning this rock,<br>
and this gate;</p>
<br>
<p>44  And concerning the mountains,<br>
and the virgins, and the stones<br>
that did rise out of the deep,<br>
and were not cut, but put into<br>
the building just as they came<br>
forth; and why the ten stones<br>
were first laid in the foundation;<br>
then the twenty-five, then thirty-<br>
five; then forty?</p>
<br>
<p>45  Also concerning those stones<br>
that were put into the building,<br>
and again taken out, and carried<br>
back into their places? Fulfil, I<br>
pray, the desire of my soul as to<br>
all these things, and manifest all<br>
unto me.</p>
<br>
<p>46  And he said unto me; If thou<br>
shalt not be dull, thou shall<br>
know all, and shall see all the<br>
other things that are about to<br>
happen in this, tower: and shall<br>
understand diligently all these<br>
similitudes.</p>
<br>
<p>47  And after a few days we<br>
came into the same place where<br>
we had sat before; and he said<br>
unto me, Let us go unto the<br>
tower; for the Lord of it will<br>
come and examine it.</p>
<br>
<p>48  So we came thither, and<br>
found none but those virgins there.<br>
And he asked them whether the<br>
Lord of that tower was come<br>
thither? And they replied, that<br>
he would be there presently to<br>
examine the building.</p>
<br>
<p>49  After a very little while I<br>
saw a great multitude of men<br>
coming, and in the middle of them<br>
a man so tall, that he surpassed<br>
the tower in height.</p>
<br>
<p>50  About him were those six,<br>
who before commanded in the<br>
building, and all the rest of<br>
those who had built that tower,<br>
and many others of great dignity:<br>
and the virgins that kept the tower<br>
ran to meet him, and kissed him,<br>
and began to walk near unto him.</p>
<br>
<p>51  But he examined the building<br>
with so much care, that he handled<br>
every stone; and struck every one<br>
with a rod which he held in his hand:</p>
<br>
<p>52  Of which some being so struck<br>
turned black as soot; others were<br>
rough; some looked as if they had<br>
cracks in them; others seemed maimed;<br>
some neither black nor white; some<br>
looked sharp, and agreed not with the<br>
other stones, and others were full<br>
of spots.</p>
<br>
<p>53  These were the several kinds<br>
of those stones which were not<br>
found proper in the building; all<br>
which the Lord commanded to be<br>
taken out of the tower, and laid<br>
near it, and other stones to be<br>
brought and put in their places.</p>
<br>
<p>54  And they that built, asked<br>
him from which of the mountains<br>
he would have stones brought to<br>
put in the place of those that were<br>
laid aside. But he forbad them<br>
to bring any from the mountains,<br>
and commanded that they should<br>
take them out of a certain field<br>
that was near.</p>
<br>
<p>55  So they digged in the field,<br>
and found many bright square<br>
stones, and some also that were<br>
round. Howbeit, all that were<br>
found in that field were taken<br>
away, and carried through the<br>
gate by those virgins; and those<br>
of them that were square were<br>
fitted and put into the places of<br>
those that were pulled out.</p>
<br>
<p>56  But the round ones were not<br>
put into the building, because they<br>
were hard, and it would have<br>
required too much time to cut them<br>
but they were placed about the<br>
tower, as if they should hereafter<br>
be cut square, and put into the<br>
building; for they were very<br>
white.</p>
<br>
<p>57  When he who was chief in<br>
dignity, and lord of the whole<br>
tower saw this, he called to him<br>
the shepherd that was with me,<br>
and gave him the stones that were<br>
rejected and laid about the tower,<br>
and said unto him; cleanse these<br>
stones with all care, and fit them<br>
into the building of the tower, that<br>
they may agree with the rest; but<br>
those that will not suit with the<br>
rest, cast away afar off from the<br>
tower.</p>
<br>
<p>58 When he had thus commanded him,<br>
he departed, with all those that<br>
came with him to the tower but<br>
those virgins still stood about<br>
the tower to keep it.</p>
<br>
<p>59  And I said unto that shepherd;<br>
How can these stones, seeing they<br>
have been rejected, return into<br>
the building of this tower?<br>
He replied; I will cut off the<br>
greatest part from these stones,<br>
and will add them to the building,<br>
and they will agree with the rest.</p>
<br>
<p>60  And I said, Sir, how will<br>
they be able to fill the same place,<br>
when they shall be so much cut<br>
away? He answered; They that<br>
shall be found too little shall be<br>
put into the middle of the building,<br>
and the greater shall be placed<br>
without, and keep them in.</p>
<br>
<p>61  When he had said thus unto<br>
me, he added; Let us go, and after<br>
three days we will return, and<br>
I will put these stones, being<br>
cleansed, into the tower.</p>
<br>
<p>62  For all these that are about<br>
the tower must be cleansed, lest<br>
the master of the house chance to<br>
come upon the sudden, and find<br>
those which are about the tower<br>
unclean; and be so exasperated<br>
that these stones should never be<br>
put into the building of this tower,<br>
and I shall be looked upon to have<br>
been unmindful of my master's<br>
commands.</p>
<br>
<p>63  When therefore we came<br>
after three days to the tower,<br>
he said unto me; Let us examine<br>
all these stones, and let us see<br>
which of them may go into the<br>
building. I answered, Sir,<br>
let us see.</p>
<br>
<p>64  And first of all we began<br>
to consider those which had been<br>
black; for they were found just<br>
such as they were when they were<br>
pulled out of the tower: wherefore<br>
he commanded them to be removed<br>
from the tower and put by themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>65  Then he examined those<br>
which had been rough; and commanded<br>
many of those to be cut round, and<br>
to be fitted by the virgins into<br>
the building of the tower; so they<br>
took them, and fitted them into<br>
the middle of the building and<br>
he commanded the rest to be laid<br>
by with the black ones, for they<br>
also were become black.</p>
<br>
<p>66 Next he considered those<br>
which were full of cracks, and<br>
many of those also he ordered to<br>
be pared away, and so to be added<br>
to the rest of the building, by the<br>
came virgins.</p>
<br>
<p>67  These were placed without<br>
because they were found entire;<br>
but the residue through the<br>
multitude of their cracks could<br>
not be reformed, and therefore<br>
were cast away from the building<br>
of the tower.</p>
<br>
<p>68  Then he considered those<br>
that had been maimed; many of<br>
these had cracks, and were become<br>
black; others had large clefts;<br>
these he commanded to be placed<br>
with those that were reected;</p>
<br>
<p>69  But the rest being cleansed<br>
and reformed, he commanded to<br>
be put into the building. These<br>
therefore those virgins took up,<br>
and fitted into the middle of the<br>
building, because they were but<br>
weak.</p>
<br>
<p>70 After these he examined those<br>
which were found half white and<br>
half black, and many of those<br>
which were now black; these also<br>
he ordered to be laid among<br>
those that were cast away.</p>
<br>
<p>
71 The rest were found altogether<br>
white; those were taken up by the<br>
virgins, and fitted into the same<br>
tower: and they were put in the<br>
outside, because they were found<br>
entire; that so they might keep<br>
in those that were placed in the<br>
middle, for nothing was cut off<br>
from them.</p>
<br>
<p>72  Next he looked upon those<br>
which had been hard and sharp;<br>
but few of these were made use of,<br>
because they could not be cut, for<br>
they were found very hard: but<br>
the rest were formed, and fitted by<br>
the virgins into the middle of the<br>
building, because they were more<br>
weak.</p>
<br>
<p>73  Then he considered those<br>
which had spots; of these a few<br>
were found black, and they were<br>
carried to their fellows. The rest<br>
were white and entire; and they<br>
were fitted by the virgins into the<br>
building, and placed in the outside,<br>
by reason of their strength.</p>
<br>
<p>74  After this he came to<br>
consider those stones which were<br>
white and round: and he said unto<br>
me, What shall we do with these<br>
stones? I answered, Sir, I cannot<br>
tell.</p>
<br>
<p>75  He replied, Canst thou<br>
think of nothing then for these?<br>
I answered, Sir, I understand not<br>
this art; neither am I a stone-cutter,<br>
nor can I tell anything.</p>
<br>
<p>76  And he said, seest thou not<br>
that they are very round? Now<br>
to make them square, I must cut<br>
off a great deal from them; howbeit,<br>
it is necessary that some of these<br>
should go into the building of the<br>
tower.</p>
<br>
<p>77  I answered; If it be necessary,<br>
why do you perplex yourself, and<br>
not rather choose, if you have<br>
any choice among them, and fit<br>
them into the building.</p>
<br>
<p>78  Upon this he chose out the<br>
largest and brightest, and squared<br>
them; which, when he had done<br>
the virgins took them up, and<br>
fitted them into the building.</p>
<br>
<p>79  And the rest that remained<br>
were carried back into the same<br>
field from which they were taken;<br>
howbeit, they were not cast away;<br>
because, said he, there is yet a<br>
little wanting to this tower, which<br>
is to be built; and perhaps the<br>
Lord will have these stones fitted<br>
into this building, because they<br>
are exceeding white.</p>
<br>
<p>80  Then there were called twelve<br>
very stately women, clothed with<br>
a black garment, girded, and their<br>
shoulders free, and their hair<br>
loose. These seemed to me to be<br>
country women.</p>
<br>
<p>81  And the shepherd commanded<br>
them to take up those stones<br>
which were cast out of the building,<br>
and carry them back to the mountains<br>
out of which they were taken.</p>
<br>
<p>82  And they took them all up<br>
joyfully, and carried them back to<br>
their places from whence they had<br>
been taken.</p>
<br>
<p>83  When not one stone remained<br>
about the tower, he said unto<br>
me, Let us go about this tower,<br>
and see whether anything be<br>
wanting to it.</p>
<br>
<p>84  We began therefore to go<br>
round about it; and when he saw<br>
that it was handsomely built, he<br>
began to be very glad; for it was<br>
so beautifully framed, that any one<br>
that had seen it must have been in<br>
love with the building.</p>
<br>
<p>85  For it seemed to be all but<br>
one stone, nor did a joint any<br>
where appear; but it looked as if<br>
it had all been cut out of one rock.</p>
<br>
<p>86  And when I diligently<br>
considered what a tower it was,<br>
I was extremely pleased: and he<br>
said unto me, Bring hither some<br>
lime and little shells, that I may<br>
fill up the spaces of those stones<br>
that were taken out of the building,<br>
and put in again; for all things<br>
about the tower must be made even.</p>
<br>
<p>87  And I did as he commanded<br>
me, and brought them unto him<br>
and he said unto me, Be ready to<br>
help me, and this work will quickly<br>
be finished.</p>
<br>
<p>88  He therefore filled up<br>
the spaces of those stones, and<br>
commanded the place about the tower<br>
to be cleansed.</p>
<br>
<p>89  Then those virgins took besoms,<br>
and cleansed all the place around,<br>
and took away all the rubbish,<br>
and threw water on; which being<br>
done, the palace became delightful,<br>
and the tower beauteous.</p>
<br>
<p>90  Then he said unto me, All<br>
is now clean if the Lord should<br>
come to finish the tower, he will<br>
find nothing whereby to complain<br>
of us.</p>
<br>
<p>91  When he had said this he<br>
would have departed. But I laid<br>
hold on his bag, and began to<br>
entreat him for the Lord's sake, that<br>
he would explain to me all things<br>
that he had shown me.</p>
<br>
<p>92  He said unto me, I have at<br>
present a little business; but I<br>
will suddenly explain all things<br>
unto thee. Tarry here for me till<br>
I come.</p>
<br>
<p>93  I said unto him, Sir, what<br>
shall I do here alone? He answered,<br>
Thou art not alone, seeing all<br>
these virgins are with thee.</p>
<br>
<p>94  I said, Sir, deliver me then<br>
unto them. Then he called them<br>
and said unto them, I commend<br>
this man unto you until I shall<br>
come;</p>
<br>
<p>95  So I remained with those<br>
virgins: now they were cheerful<br>
and courteous unto me; especially<br>
the four, which seemed to be<br>
the chieftest among them.</p>
<br>
<p>96  Then those virgins said<br>
unto me, that shepherd will not<br>
return hither to-day. I said unto<br>
them, What then shall I do? They<br>
answered, Tarry for him till the<br>
evening, if perhaps he may come<br>
and speak with thee; but if not,<br>
yet thou shalt continue with us<br>
till he does come.</p>
<br>
<p>97  I said unto them, I will<br>
tarry for him till evening; but if<br>
he comes not by that time, I will<br>
go home, and return hither again<br>
the next morning.</p>
<br>
<p>98  They answered me, As thou<br>
art delivered unto us, thou mayest<br>
not depart from us. I said, Where<br>
shall I tarry?</p>
<br>
<p>99  They replied, Thou shalt<br>
sleep with us as a brother, not<br>
as a husband; for thou art our<br>
brother, and we are ready from<br>
henceforth to dwell with thee;<br>
for thou art very dear to as.</p>
<br>
<p>100  Howbeit I was ashamed to<br>
continue with them. But she that<br>
seemed to be the chieftest amongst<br>
them, embraced me, and began<br>
to kiss me. And the rest when<br>
they saw that I was kissed by her,<br>
began also to kiss me as a brother;<br>
and led me about the tower, and<br>
played with me.</p>
<br>
<p>101  Some of them also sung<br>
psalms, others made up the chorus<br>
with them. But I walked about<br>
the tower with them, rejoicing<br>
silently, and seeming to myself<br>
to be grown young again.</p>
<br>
<p>102  When the evening came on,<br>
I would forthwith have gone<br>
home, but they withheld me,<br>
and suffered me not to depart.<br>
Wherefore I continued with them<br>
that night near the same tower.</p>
<br>
<p>103  So they spread their linen<br>
garments upon the ground; and<br>
placed me in the middle, nor did<br>
they anything else, only they<br>
prayed.</p>
<br>
<p>104  I also prayed with them<br>
without ceasing, nor less than<br>
they. Who, when they saw me pray<br>
in that manner, rejoiced greatly:<br>
and I continued there with their<br>
till the next day.</p>
<br>
<p>105  And when we had worshipped God,<br>
then the shepherd came and said unto<br>
them: You have done no injury to<br>
this man? They answered, Ask him.<br>
I said unto him, Sir, I have received<br>
a great deal of satisfaction in that<br>
I have remained with them.</p>
<br>
<p>106  And he said unto me, How didst<br>
thou sup? I answered, Sir, I feasted<br>
the whole night upon the words of<br>
the Lord. They received thee well<br>
then, said he? I said, Sir, very well.</p>
<br>
<p>107  He answered, Wilt thou<br>
now learn what thou didst desire?<br>
I replied, Sir, I will: and first I<br>
pray thee that thou shouldest show<br>
me all things in the order that I<br>
asked them.</p>
<br>
<p>108  He answered, I will do all<br>
as thou wouldst have me, nor<br>
will I hide any thing from thee.</p>
<br>
<p>109  First of all, Sir, said I,<br>
tell me, what this rock and this<br>
gate denote? Hearken, said he;<br>
this rock, and this gate, are the<br>
Son of God. I replied, Sir, how<br>
can that be; seeing the rock is<br>
old, but the gate new?</p>
<br>
<p>110  Hear, said he, O foolish<br>
man! and understand. The Son<br>
of God is indeed more ancient<br>
than any creature; insomuch<br>
that he was in council with his<br>
Father at the creation oft all<br>
things.</p>
<br>
<p>111  But the gate is therefore<br>
new, because he appeared in the<br>
last days in the fullness of time;<br>
that they who shall attain unto<br>
salvation, may by it enter into the<br>
kingdom of God.</p>
<br>
<p>112  You have seen, said he,<br>
those stones which were carried<br>
through the gate, how they were<br>
placed in the building of the<br>
tower; but that those which were<br>
not carried through the gate,<br>
were sent away into their own<br>
places?<br>
113 I answered, sir, I saw it.<br>
Thus, said he, no man shall enter<br>
into the kingdom of God, but he<br>
who shall take upon him the name<br>
of the Son of God.</p>
<br>
<p>114  For if you would enter<br>
into any city, and that city should<br>
he encompassed with a wall, and<br>
had only one gate, could you<br>
enter into that city except by that<br>
gate?</p>
<br>
<p>115 I answered, Sir, how could<br>
I do otherwise? As therefore, said<br>
he, there would be no other way<br>
of entering into that city but by<br>
its gate, so neither can any one<br>
enter into the kingdom of God,<br>
but only by the name of his Son,<br>
who is most dear unto him.</p>
<br>
<p>116 And he said unto me,<br>
Didst thou see the multitude of<br>
those that built that tower? Sir,<br>
said I, I saw it. He answered,<br>
All those are the angels, venerable<br>
in their dignity,</p>
<br>
<p>117  With those is the Lord<br>
encompassed as with a wall: but<br>
the gate is the Son of God, who is<br>
the only way of coming unto God.<br>
For no man shall go to God, but<br>
by his Son.</p>
<br>
<p>118  Thou sawest also, said he,<br>
the six men, and in the middle of<br>
them that venerable great man,<br>
who walked about the tower, and<br>
rejected the stones out of the tower?</p>
<br>
<p>119  Sir, said I, I saw them.<br>
He answered, that tall man was<br>
the Son of God; and those six<br>
were his angels of most eminent<br>
dignity, which stand about him<br>
on the right hand and on the left.</p>
<br>
<p>120  Of these excellent angels<br>
none comes in unto God without<br>
him. He added, Whosoever there.<br>
fore shall not take upon him his<br>
name, he shall nor enter into the<br>
kingdom of God.</p>
<br>
<p>121  Then I said, What is this<br>
tower? This, said he, is the church.<br>
And what, Sir, are these virgins?<br>
He said unto me, These are the<br>
holy spirits, for no man can enter<br>
into the kingdom of God, except<br>
these clothe him with their garment,</p>
<br>
<p>122  For it will avail thee nothing<br>
to take up the name of the Son of<br>
God, unless thou shalt also<br>
receive their garment from them.<br>
For these virgins are the powers<br>
of the Son of God. So shall a<br>
man in vain bear his name, unless<br>
he shall be also endued with his<br>
powers.</p>
<br>
<p>123  And he said unto me, sawest<br>
thou those stones that were cast<br>
away? They bore indeed the name,<br>
but put not on their garment.<br>
I said, Sir, what is their<br>
garment? Their very names,<br>
said he, are their garment.</p>
<br>
<p>124  Therefore whosoever beareth<br>
the name of the Son of God,<br>
ought to bear their names also;<br>
for the Son of God also himself<br>
beareth their names.</p>
<br>
<p>125  As for those stones,<br>
continued he, which being delivered<br>
by their hands, thou sawest remain<br>
in the building, they were clothed<br>
with their power; for which cause<br>
thou seest the whole tower of the<br>
same colour with the rock, and made<br>
as it were of one stone.</p>
<br>
<p>126 So also those who have<br>
believed in God by his Son, have<br>
put on his spirit. Behold there<br>
shall be one spirit, and one body,<br>
and one colour of their garments;<br>
and all they shall attain this, who<br>
shall bear the names of these virgins.</p>
<br>
<p>127 And I said, Sir, why then<br>
were those stones cast away which<br>
were rejected, seeing they also<br>
were carried through the gate,<br>
and delivered by the hands of<br>
these virgins into the building<br>
of this tower?</p>
<br>
<p>128 Seeing, said he thou takest<br>
care to inquire diligently into all<br>
things, hear also concerning those<br>
stones which were rejected. All<br>
these received the name of the<br>
Son of God, and with that the<br>
power of these virgins.</p>
<br>
<p>129 Having therefore received<br>
these spirits, they were perfected,<br>
and brought into the number of<br>
the servants of God; and they<br>
began to be one body, and to have<br>
one garment, for they were endued<br>
with the same righteousness,<br>
which they alike exercised.</p>
<br>
<p>130  But after that they beheld<br>
those women which thou sawest<br>
clothed with a black garment,<br>
with their shoulders at liberty and<br>
their hair loose; they fixed their<br>
desires upon them, being tempted<br>
with their beauty; and were<br>
clothed with their power,<br>
and cast off the clothing<br>
of the virgins:</p>
<br>
<p>131  Therefore were they cast<br>
off from the house of God, and<br>
delivered to those women. But<br>
they that were not corrupted with<br>
their beauty, remained in the<br>
house of God. This, said he, is<br>
the signification of those stones<br>
which were rejected.</p>
<br>
<p>132  And I said, sir, what if<br>
any of these men shall repent, and<br>
cast away their desire of those<br>
women, and be converted, and<br>
return to these virgins, and put<br>
on again their virtue; shall they<br>
not enter into the house of God?</p>
<br>
<p>133 They shall enter, said he,<br>
if they shall lay aside all the<br>
works of those women, and shall<br>
resume the power of these virgins,<br>
and shall walk in their works.</p>
<br>
<p>134 And for this cause there is<br>
a stop in the building, that if they<br>
shall repent, they may be added<br>
to the building of this tower; but<br>
if they shall not repent, that others<br>
may be built in their places, and<br>
so they may be utterly cast away.</p>
<br>
<p>135 For all these things I gave<br>
thanks unto the Lord, that being<br>
moved with mercy towards all<br>
those upon whom his name is<br>
carried, he sent to us the angel of<br>
repentance to preside over us who<br>
have sinned against him; and that<br>
he has refreshed our spirits which<br>
were almost gone, and who had<br>
no hope of salvation, but are now<br>
refreshed to the renewal of life.</p>
<br>
<p>136  Then I said, Show me now<br>
sir, why this tower is not built<br>
upon the ground, but upon a rock,<br>
and upon the gate? He replied,<br>
Thou art foolish, and without<br>
understanding, therefore thou<br>
asketh this.</p>
<br>
<p>137 And I said, sir, I must<br>
needs ask all things of you<br>
because I understand nothing at all.<br>
For all your answers are great and<br>
excellent; and which a man can<br>
hardly understand.</p>
<br>
<p>138  Hear, said he: The name<br>
of the Son of God is great and<br>
without bounds, and the whole<br>
world is supported by it. If<br>
therefore, said I, every creature<br>
of God be sustained by his Son,<br>
why should he not support those<br>
also who have been invited by him,<br>
and who carry his name, and walk<br>
in his commandments?</p>
<br>
<p>139  Seest thou not, said he, that<br>
he doth support them, who with<br>
all their heart, bear his name?<br>
He therefore is their foundation,<br>
and gladly supports those who do<br>
not deny his name, but willingly<br>
bear it.</p>
<br>
<p>140 And I said: Sir, tell me<br>
the names of these virgins; and of<br>
those women that were clothed<br>
with the black garment.</p>
<br>
<p>141  Hear, said he, the names of<br>
those virgins which are the more<br>
powerful, and stand at the corners<br>
of the gate. These are their<br>
names:</p>
<br>
<p>142 The first is called Faith;<br>
the second Continence; the third<br>
Power; the fourth Patience; the<br>
rest which stand beneath these<br>
are, Simplicity, Innocence,<br>
Chastity, Cheerfulness, Truth,<br>
Understanding, Concord, Charity.</p>
<br>
<p>143  Whosoever therefore bear<br>
these names, and the name of the<br>
Son of God, shall enter into the<br>
kingdom of God.</p>
<br>
<p>144  Hear now, said he, the<br>
names of those women, which<br>
were clothed with the black garment.<br>
Of these, four are the principal:<br>
the first is Perfidiousness;<br>
the second, Incontinence; the<br>
third, Infidelity; the fourth,<br>
Pleasure.</p>
<br>
<p>145 And the rest which follow<br>
are called thus, Sadness, Malice,<br>
Lust, Anger, Lying, Foolishness,<br>
Pride, and Hatred. The servant<br>
of God, which carries these spirits,<br>
shall see indeed the kingdom of<br>
God, but he shall not enter into it.</p>
<br>
<p>146  But, sir, what are those<br>
stones which were taken out of the<br>
deep and fitted into the building?<br>
The ten, said he, which were<br>
placed at the foundation, are the<br>
first age; the following five-and-<br>
twenty, are the second, of righteous<br>
men.</p>
<br>
<p>147  The next thirty-five, are the<br>
prophets and ministers of the Lord.<br>
And the forty, are the Apostles and<br>
doctors of the preaching of the<br>
Son of God.</p>
<br>
<p>148  And I said, sir, why did the<br>
virgins put even those stones into<br>
the building after they were carried<br>
through the gate? And he said,<br>
Because these first carried those<br>
spirits, and they departed not one<br>
from the other, neither the men<br>
from the spirits, nor the spirits<br>
from the men:</p>
<br>
<p>149  But the spirits were joined<br>
to those men even to the day of<br>
their death; who if they had not<br>
had these spirits with them, they<br>
could not have been useful to the<br>
building of this tower.</p>
<br>
<p>150  And I said, sir, show me<br>
this farther.  He answered, What<br>
dost then ask? Why did these<br>
stones come out of the deep, and<br>
were placed into the building of<br>
this tower, seeing that they long<br>
ago carried those holy spirits?</p>
<br>
<p>151  It was necessary, said he,<br>
for them to ascend by water, that<br>
they might be at rest. For they<br>
could not otherwise enter into the<br>
kingdom of God, but by laying<br>
aside the mortality of their former<br>
life.</p>
<br>
<p>152  They therefore being dead,<br>
were nevertheless sealed with the<br>
seal of the Son of God, and so<br>
entered into the kingdom of God.</p>
<br>
<p>153  For before a man receives<br>
the name of the Son of God, he is<br>
ordained unto death; but when he<br>
receives that seal, he is freed from<br>
death, and assigned unto life.</p>
<br>
<p>154  Now that seal is the water<br>
of baptism, into which men go<br>
down under the obligation unto<br>
death, but come up appointed unto<br>
life.</p>
<br>
<p>155 Wherefore to those also was<br>
this seal preached, and they made<br>
use of it, that they might enter<br>
into the kingdom of God.</p>
<br>
<p>156  And I said, Why then, sir,<br>
did these forty stones also ascend<br>
with them out of the deep, having<br>
already received that seal?</p>
<br>
<p>157  He answered, Because<br>
these Apostles and teachers, who<br>
preached the name of the Son of<br>
God, dying after they had received<br>
his faith and power, preached to<br>
them who were dead before: and<br>
they gave this seal to them.</p>
<br>
<p>158  They went down therefore<br>
into the water with them, and again<br>
came up. But these went down<br>
whilst they were alive, and came<br>
up again alive: whereas those who<br>
were before dead, went down dead,<br>
but came up alive;</p>
<br>
<p>159  Through these therefore<br>
they received life, and knew the<br>
Son of God: for which cause they<br>
came up with them, and were fit<br>
to come into the building of the<br>
tower; and were not cut, but put<br>
in entire; because they died in<br>
righteousness, and in great purity;<br>
only this seal was wanting to<br>
them.</p>
<br>
<p>160  Thus you have the explication<br>
of these things.</p>
<br>
<p>161  I answered: Sir, tell me<br>
now what concerns those mountains;<br>
why are they so different, some<br>
of one form, and some of another?</p>
<br>
<p>162 Hear, said he; These twelve<br>
mountains which thou seest, are<br>
twelve nations, which make up the<br>
whole world. Wherefore the Son<br>
of God is preached to them, by<br>
those whom he sent unto them.</p>
<br>
<p>163  But why, said I, are they<br>
different, and every one of a figure?<br>
He replied, Hearken. Those twelve<br>
nations which possess the whole<br>
world, are twelve people.</p>
<br>
<p>164  And as thou hast beheld<br>
these mountains different, so are<br>
they. I will therefore open to<br>
thee the meaning and actions of<br>
every mountain.</p>
<br>
<p>165  But first, sir, said I, show<br>
me this; Seeing these mountains<br>
are so different, how have they<br>
agreed in the building of this<br>
tower; and been brought to one<br>
colour; and are no less bright<br>
than those that came out of the<br>
deep?</p>
<br>
<p>166  Because, replied he, all the<br>
nations which are under heaven,<br>
have heard and believed in the<br>
same one name of the Son of God<br>
by whom they are called.</p>
<br>
<p>167  Wherefore having received<br>
his seal, they have all been made<br>
partakers of the same understanding<br>
and knowledge; and their faith<br>
and charity have been the same;<br>
and they have carried the spirits<br>
of these virgins together with his<br>
name.</p>
<br>
<p>168  And therefore the building<br>
of this tower appeared to be of the<br>
same colour, and did shine like<br>
the brightness of the sun.</p>
<br>
<p>169  But after that they had thus<br>
agreed in one mind, there began to<br>
be one body of them all; howbeit<br>
some of them polluted themselves,<br>
and were cast off from those of the<br>
righteous, and again returned to<br>
their former state, and became<br>
even worse than they were before.</p>
<br>
<p>170  How, air, said I, were<br>
they worse who knew the Lord?<br>
He answered: If he who knows<br>
not the Lord liveth wickedly,<br>
the punishment of his wickedness<br>
attends him;</p>
<br>
<p>171 But he who has known the<br>
Lord, ought to abstain altogether<br>
from all wickedness, and more and<br>
more to be the servant of<br>
righteousness.</p>
<br>
<p>172 And does not he then seem<br>
to thee to sin more who ought to<br>
follow goodness, if he shall prefer<br>
the part of sin; than he who<br>
offends without knowing the<br>
power of God?</p>
<br>
<p>173 Wherefore these are indeed<br>
ordained unto death; but they who<br>
have known the Lord, and have<br>
seen his wonderful works, if they<br>
shall live wickedly, they shall be<br>
doubly punished, and shall die for<br>
ever.</p>
<br>
<p>174  As therefore thou hast seen<br>
that after the stones were cast out<br>
of the tower, which had been rejected,<br>
they were delivered to wicked and<br>
cruel spirits; and thou beheldest<br>
the tower so cleansed, as if it had<br>
all been made of one stone:</p>
<br>
<p>175  So the church of God, when<br>
it shall be purified: (the wicked<br>
and counterfeits, the mischievous<br>
and doubtful, and all that have<br>
behaved themselves wickedly in it,<br>
and committed divers kinds of sin,<br>
being cast out) shall become one<br>
body, and there shall be one<br>
understanding, one opinion,<br>
one faith, and the same charity.</p>
<br>
<p>176 And then shall the Son of<br>
God rejoice among them, and shall<br>
receive his people with a pure will.</p>
<br>
<p>177 And I said; Sir, all these<br>
things are great and honourable;<br>
but now show unto me the effect<br>
and force of every mountain: that<br>
every soul which trusteth in the<br>
Lord, when it shall hear these<br>
things may honour his great, and<br>
wonderful, and holy name.</p>
<br>
<p>178  Hear, said he, the variety<br>
of these mountains, that is, of the<br>
twelve nations.</p>
<br>
<p>179  They who have believed<br>
of the first mountain, which is<br>
black, are those who have revolted<br>
from the faith, and spoken wicked<br>
things against the Lord; and<br>
betrayed the servants of God.</p>
<br>
<p>180  These are condemned to<br>
death; there is no repentance for<br>
them: and therefore they are<br>
black, because their kind is<br>
wicked.</p>
<br>
<p>181  Of the second mountain<br>
which was smooth, are the<br>
hypocrites, who have believed,<br>
and the teachers of naughtiness:<br>
and these are next to the foregoing,<br>
which have not in them the fruit of<br>
righteousness.</p>
<br>
<p>182  For as their mountain is<br>
barren and without fruit so also<br>
such kind of men have indeed the<br>
name of Christians, but are empty<br>
of faith; nor is there any fruit of<br>
the truth in them.</p>
<br>
<p>183  Nevertheless there is room<br>
left to them of repentance, if they<br>
shall speedily pursue it; but if<br>
they shall delay, they also shall<br>
be partakers of death with the<br>
foregoing kind.</p>
<br>
<p>184  I said, air, why is there<br>
room left to those for repentance,<br>
and not to the foregoing kind,<br>
seeing their sins are well nigh the<br>
same?</p>
<br>
<p>185  There is therefore, said he,<br>
to these a return unto life by<br>
repentance, because they have not<br>
blasphemed against their Lord,<br>
nor betrayed the servants of God:<br>
but by their desire of gain have<br>
deceived men, leading them according<br>
to the lusts of sinners; wherefore<br>
they shall suffer for this thing.</p>
<br>
<p>186  Howbeit there is still left<br>
them room for repentance, because<br>
they have not spoken any thing<br>
wickedly against the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>187  They who are of the<br>
third mountain which had thorns<br>
and brambles, are those who<br>
believed, but were some of them<br>
rich; others taken up with many<br>
affairs: the brambles are their<br>
riches; the thorns, those affairs in<br>
which they were engaged.</p>
<br>
<p>188  Now they who are entangled<br>
in much business, and in diversity<br>
of affairs, join not themselves to<br>
the servants of God, but wander,<br>
being called away by those affairs<br>
with which they are choked.</p>
<br>
<p>189  And so they which are rich,<br>
with difficulty yield themselves to<br>
the conversation of the servants<br>
of God; fearing lest any thing<br>
should be asked of them. These<br>
therefore shall hardly enter the<br>
kingdom of God.</p>
<br>
<p>190  For as men walk with difficulty<br>
bare-foot over thorns, even so<br>
these kind of men shall scarcely<br>
enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<br>
<p>191  Nevertheless there is afforded<br>
to all these a return unto repentance,<br>
if they shall quickly return to it;<br>
because in their for-mer days they<br>
having neglected to work, in the time<br>
that is to come they may do some good.</p>
<br>
<p>192  If therefore having<br>
repented they shall do the works<br>
of righteousness, they shall live;<br>
but if they shall continue in their<br>
evil courses, they shall be delivered<br>
to those women who will take away<br>
their lives.</p>
<br>
<p>193  As for the fourth mountain,<br>
which had many herbs, the upper<br>
part of which is green, but<br>
the roots dry, and some of which<br>
being touched with the heat of the<br>
sun, are withered;</p>
<br>
<p>194  It denotes the doubtful, who<br>
have believed, and some others<br>
who carry the Lord on their tongues,<br>
but have him not in their hearts:<br>
therefore their grass is dry,<br>
and without root; because they<br>
live only in words, but their<br>
works are dead.</p>
<br>
<p>195  These therefore are neither<br>
dead nor living, and withal are<br>
doubtful. For the doubtful are<br>
neither green nor dry; that is<br>
neither dead nor alive.</p>
<br>
<p>196  For as the herbs dry away<br>
at the sight of the sun, so the<br>
doubtful, as soon as they hear of<br>
persecution, and fear inconveniencies,<br>
return to their idols, and again<br>
serve them, and are ashamed<br>
to bear the name of their Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>197  This kind of men then is<br>
neither dead nor alive; nevertheless<br>
these also may live, if they shall<br>
presently repent; but if not,<br>
they shall be delivered to those<br>
women, who shall take away their<br>
lives.</p>
<br>
<p>198  As concerning the fifth<br>
mountain that is craggy, and yet<br>
has green grass; they are of this<br>
kind who have believed, and are<br>
faithful indeed, but believe with<br>
difficulty, and are bold and self-<br>
conceited; and would be thought<br>
to know all things, but really<br>
know nothing.</p>
<br>
<p>199  Wherefore, by reason of<br>
this confidence, knowledge is<br>
departed from them; and a rash<br>
presumption is entered into them.</p>
<br>
<p>200  But they carry themselves<br>
high, and as prudent men; and<br>
though they are fools, yet would<br>
seem to be teachers.</p>
<br>
<p>201  Now by reason of this folly<br>
many of them whilst they magnify<br>
themselves, are become vain and<br>
empty. For boldness and vain<br>
confidence is a very evil spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>202  Wherefore many of these<br>
are cast away; but others<br>
acknowledging their error, have<br>
repented, and submitted themselves<br>
to those who are knowing.</p>
<br>
<p>203  And to all the rest of this<br>
kind, there is repentance allowed;<br>
forasmuch as they were not so<br>
much wicked as foolish, and void<br>
of understanding.</p>
<br>
<p>204  If these therefore shall<br>
repent, they shall live unto God;<br>
but if not, they shall dwell with<br>
those women, who shall exercise<br>
their wickedness upon them.</p>
<br>
<p>205  For what concerns the<br>
sixth mountain having greater and<br>
lesser clefts, they are such as have<br>
believed; but those in which were<br>
lesser clefts are they who have had<br>
controversies among themselves;<br>
and by reason of their quarrels<br>
languish in the faith:</p>
<br>
<p>206  Nevertheless many of these<br>
have repented, and so will the rest<br>
when they shall hear my commands;<br>
for their controversies are but<br>
small, and they will easily<br>
return unto repentance.</p>
<br>
<p>207  But those who have the<br>
greater clefts, will be as stiff<br>
stones, mindful of grudges and<br>
offences, and full of anger among<br>
themselves. These therefore are<br>
cast from the tower, and refused<br>
to be put into its building; for<br>
this kind of men shall hardly<br>
live.</p>
<br>
<p>208  Our God and Lord, who<br>
ruleth over all things, and has<br>
power over all his creatures, will<br>
not remember our offences, but is<br>
easily appeased by those who<br>
confess their sins: but man being<br>
languid, mortal, infirm, and full<br>
of sins, perseveres in his anger<br>
against man; as if it were in his<br>
power to save or destroy him.</p>
<br>
<p>209  But I, as the angel who am<br>
set over your repentance, admonish<br>
you, that whosoever among you has<br>
any such purpose he should lay it<br>
aside, and return unto repentance;<br>
and the Lord will heal your former<br>
sins, if you shall purge yourself<br>
from this evil spirit; but if you<br>
shall not do it, ye shall be<br>
delivered to him unto death.</p>
<br>
<p>210  As for the seventh mountain<br>
in which the grass was green<br>
and flourishing, and the whole<br>
mountain faithful; and all kind of<br>
cattle fed upon the grass of it, and<br>
the more the grass was eaten, so<br>
much the more it flourished;</p>
<br>
<p>211  They are such as believed,<br>
and were always good and upright;<br>
and without any differences among<br>
themselves, but still rejoiced<br>
in the servants of God, having<br>
put on the spirit of these virgins;<br>
and been always forward to show<br>
mercy to all men, readily giving<br>
to all men of their labours<br>
without upbraiding, and without<br>
deliberation.</p>
<br>
<p>212  Wherefore the Lord seeing<br>
their simplicity and innocence,<br>
has increased them in the works of<br>
their hands, and given them grace<br>
in all their works.</p>
<br>
<p>213  But I, who am the angel<br>
appointed over your repentance,<br>
exhort you, that as many as are of<br>
this kind would continue in the<br>
same purpose, that your seed may<br>
not be rooted out for ever.</p>
<br>
<p>214  For the Lord hath tried<br>
you, and written you into our<br>
number; and all your seed shall<br>
dwell with the Son of God; for ye<br>
are all of his spirit.</p>
<br>
<p>215  As concerning the eighth<br>
mountain in which were a great<br>
many springs, by which every<br>
kind of all the creatures of God<br>
was watered; they are such as<br>
have believed the Apostles which<br>
the Lord sent into all the world to<br>
preach;</p>
<br>
<p>216  And some of them being<br>
teachers have preached and taught<br>
purely and sincerely, and have<br>
not in the least yielded to any evil,<br>
desires, but have constantly walked<br>
in righteousness and truth.</p>
<br>
<p>217  These therefore have their<br>
conversations among the angels.</p>
<br>
<p>218  Again; as for what concerns<br>
the ninth mountain which is<br>
a desert, and full of serpents; they<br>
are such as have believed, but had<br>
many stains:</p>
<br>
<p>219  These are such ministers as<br>
discharge their ministry amiss;<br>
ravishing away the goods of the<br>
widows and fatherless; and serve<br>
themselves, not others, out of<br>
those things which they have<br>
received.</p>
<br>
<p>220 These, if they continue in<br>
this covetousness, have delivered<br>
themselves unto death, nor shall<br>
there be any hope of life for them.<br>
But if they shall be converted,<br>
and shall discharge their ministry<br>
sincerely, they may live.</p>
<br>
<p>221  As for those which were<br>
found rough, they are such as<br>
have denied the name of the Lord,<br>
and not returned again to the<br>
Lord, but have become savage<br>
and wild; not applying themelves<br>
to the servants of God; but being<br>
separated from them, have for a<br>
little carelessness lost their lives.</p>
<br>
<p>222  For as a vine that is forsaken<br>
in a hedge, and never dressed,<br>
perishes and is choked by the<br>
weeds, and in time becomes wild,<br>
and ceases to be useful to its lord;<br>
so this kind of men despairing of<br>
themselves, and being soured,<br>
have begun to be unprofitable to<br>
their Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>223  Howbeit, to these there is,<br>
after all, repentance allowed, if<br>
they shall not be found from their<br>
hearts to have denied Christ; but<br>
if any of these shall be found to<br>
have denied him from his heart,<br>
I cannot tell whether such a one<br>
can attain unto life.</p>
<br>
<p>224  I say therefore that if any<br>
one hath denied, he should in<br>
these days return unto repentance;<br>
for it cannot be that anyone<br>
who now denies the Lord, can<br>
afterwards attain unto salvation<br>
nevertheless repentance is promised<br>
unto them who have formerly denied.</p>
<br>
<p>225  But he who will repent<br>
must hasten on his repentance,<br>
before the building of this tower<br>
is finished; otherwise, he shall be<br>
delivered by those women unto<br>
death.</p>
<br>
<p>226  But they that are maimed,<br>
are the deceitful; and those who<br>
mix with one another, are the<br>
serpents that you saw mingled in<br>
that mountain.</p>
<br>
<p>227  For as the poison of serpents<br>
is deadly unto men, so the words<br>
of such persons infect and<br>
destroy men. They are therefore<br>
maimed in their faith, by reason<br>
of that kind of life which they<br>
lead.</p>
<br>
<p>228  Howbeit some of them,<br>
having repented, have been saved;<br>
and so shall others of the same<br>
kind be also saved, if they shall<br>
repent; but if not, they shall die<br>
by those women who power and<br>
force posses,</p>
<br>
<p>229  For what concerns the<br>
tenth mountain, in which were the<br>
trees covering the cattle, they are<br>
such as have believed; and some<br>
of them have been bishops, that is,<br>
governors of the churches.</p>
<br>
<p>230  Others, are such stones as<br>
have not feignedly, but with a<br>
cheerful mind entertained the<br>
servants of God.</p>
<br>
<p>231  Then, such as have been set<br>
over inferior ministries, and have<br>
protected the poor and the widows;<br>
and have always kept a chaste<br>
conversation: therefore they<br>
also are protected by the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>232  Whosoever shall do on this<br>
wise, are honoured with the Lord;<br>
and their place is among the<br>
angels, if they shall continue<br>
to obey the Lord even unto the end.</p>
<br>
<p>233  As to the eleventh mountain<br>
in which were trees loaded<br>
with several sorts of fruit; they<br>
are such as have believed, and<br>
suffered death, for the name of the<br>
Lord; and have endured with a<br>
heavy mind, and have given up<br>
their lives with all their hearts.</p>
<br>
<p>234  And I said, Why then, sir,<br>
have all these fruit indeed, but yet<br>
some fairer than others?</p>
<br>
<p>235 Hearken, said he: Whosoever<br>
have suffered for the name of<br>
the Lord are esteemed honourable<br>
by the Lord; and all their offences<br>
are blotted out, because they have<br>
suffered death for the name of the<br>
Son of God.</p>
<br>
<p>236  Hear now, why their fruits<br>
are different, and some of them<br>
excel others. They who were<br>
brought before magistrates, and<br>
being asked, denied not the Lord,<br>
but suffered with a ready mind;<br>
these are more honourable with<br>
the Lord. The fruits therefore<br>
that are the most fair are these.</p>
<br>
<p>237  But they who were fearful<br>
and doubtful, and have deliberated<br>
with themselves whether they<br>
should confess or deny Christ, and<br>
yet have suffered; their fruits are<br>
smaller, because that this thought<br>
came into their hearts.</p>
<br>
<p>238 For it is a wicked and evil<br>
thought for a servant to deliberate<br>
whether he should deny his master:<br>
Take heed therefore ye who<br>
have such thoughts, that this mind<br>
Pontinrie not in you, and ye die<br>
unto God.</p>
<br>
<p>239 But ye who suffer death for<br>
his name sake, ought to honour<br>
the Lord, that he has esteemed<br>
you worthy to bear his name; and<br>
that you should be delivered from<br>
all your sins.</p>
<br>
<p>240  And why therefore do you<br>
not rather esteem yourselves happy?<br>
Ye think verily that if any<br>
one among you suffer, he performs<br>
a great work! Yet the Lord<br>
giveth you life, and ye understand<br>
it not.   For your offences did<br>
oppress you; and if you had not<br>
suffered for his name sake, ye would<br>
now be dead unto the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>241  Wherefore I speak this unto<br>
you who deliberate whether ye<br>
should confess or deny him. Confess<br>
that ye have the Lord for your<br>
God, lest at any time denying him,<br>
ye be delivered up into bonds.</p>
<br>
<p>242  For if all nations punish<br>
their servants which deny their<br>
masters; what think you that the<br>
Lord will do unto you, who has<br>
the power of all things?</p>
<br>
<p>243  Remove therefore out of<br>
your hearts these doubts, that ye<br>
may live for ever unto God.</p>
<br>
<p>244  As for the twelfth mountain,<br>
which was white, they are<br>
such as have believed like sincere<br>
children, into whose thoughts<br>
there never came any malice, nor<br>
have they ever known what sin<br>
was, but have always continued in<br>
their integrity.</p>
<br>
<p>245  Wherefore this kind of men<br>
shall without all doubt inherit the<br>
kingdom of God; because they<br>
have never in any thing defiled<br>
the commandments of God, but<br>
have continued with sincerity in<br>
the same condition all the days of<br>
their lives.</p>
<br>
<p>246 Whosoever therefore, said<br>
he, shall continue as children<br>
without malice; shall be more<br>
honourable than all those of whom<br>
I have yet spoken: for all such<br>
children are honoured by the<br>
Lord, and esteemed the first of<br>
all.</p>
<br>
<p>247 Happy therefore are ye<br>
who shall remove all malice from<br>
you, and put on innocence; be.<br>
cause ye shall first see the Lord.<br>
248 And after he had thus<br>
ended his explication of all the<br>
mountains, I said unto him, Sir,<br>
show me now also what concerns<br>
the stones that were brought out<br>
of the plain, and put into the<br>
tower in the room of those that<br>
were rejected.</p>
<br>
<p>249  As also concerning those<br>
round stones which were added<br>
into the building of the tower;<br>
and also of those who still<br>
continued round.</p>
<br>
<p>250  Hear now, says he,<br>
concerning those stones which were<br>
brought out of the plain into the<br>
building of the tower, and placed<br>
in the room of those that were<br>
rejected: they are the roots of<br>
that white mountain.</p>
<br>
<p>251  Wherefore because those<br>
who have believed of that mountain,<br>
were very innocent; the lord of<br>
this tower commanded that they<br>
which were of the roots of this<br>
mountain should be placed into<br>
the building.</p>
<br>
<p>252  For he knew that if they<br>
were put into, this building they<br>
would continue bright; nor would<br>
any of them any more be made<br>
black.</p>
<br>
<p>253  But if he had added after<br>
this manner, from the rest of the<br>
mountains, he would almost have<br>
needed again to visit the tower,<br>
and to cleanse it.</p>
<br>
<p>254  Now all these white stones<br>
are the young men who have believed,<br>
or shall believe; for they are all<br>
of the same kind.   Happy is this<br>
kind, because it is innocent.</p>
<br>
<p>255  Hear now also concerning<br>
those round and bright stones; all<br>
these are of this white mountain.<br>
But they are therefore found<br>
round, because their riches have<br>
a little darkened them from the<br>
truth, and dazzled their eyes.</p>
<br>
<p>256  Howbeit they have never<br>
departed from the Lord, nor has<br>
any wicked word proceeded out<br>
of their mouths; but all<br>
righteousness, and virtue,<br>
and truth.</p>
<br>
<p>257 When therefore the Lord<br>
saw their minds, and that they<br>
might adorn the truth; he<br>
commanded that they should continue<br>
good, and that their riches should<br>
be pared away:</p>
<br>
<p>258  For he would not have<br>
them taken wholly away, to the<br>
end they might do some good<br>
with that which was left, and live<br>
unto God; because they also are<br>
of a good kind.</p>
<br>
<p>259  Therefore was there little<br>
cut off from them, and so they<br>
were put into the building of this<br>
tower.</p>
<br>
<p>260  As for the rest which<br>
continued still round, and were<br>
not found fit for the building of<br>
this tower, because they have not<br>
yet received the seal; they were<br>
carried back to their place, be.<br>
cause they were found very<br>
round.</p>
<br>
<p>261  But this present world must<br>
be cut away from them, and the<br>
vanities of their riches; and then<br>
they will be fit for the kingdom of<br>
God. For they must enter into<br>
the kingdom of God, because God<br>
has blessed this innocent kind.</p>
<br>
<p>262 Of this kind therefore none<br>
shall fall away: for though any of<br>
them being tempted by the devil<br>
should offend, he shall soon return<br>
to his Lord God.</p>
<br>
<p>263  I the angel of repentance<br>
esteem you happy, whosoever are<br>
innocent as little children, because<br>
your portion is good and honourable<br>
with the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>264  And I say unto all you<br>
who have received this seal; keep<br>
simplicity, and remember not the<br>
offences which are  committed<br>
against you, nor continue in<br>
malice, or in bitterness, through<br>
the memory of offences.</p>
<br>
<p>265  But become one spirit,<br>
and provide remedies for these<br>
evil rents, and remove them from<br>
you; that the lord of the sheep<br>
may rejoice at it; for he will<br>
rejoice, if he shall find all whole.</p>
<br>
<p>266  But if any of these sheep<br>
shall be found scattered away, Woe<br>
shall be to the shepherds; and<br>
if the shepherds themselves shall<br>
be scattered; what will they answer<br>
to the lord of the sheep-fold?<br>
Will they say that they were<br>
troubled by the sheep? But<br>
they shall not be believed.</p>
<br>
<p>267  For it is an incredible thing<br>
that the shepherd should suffer by<br>
his flock; and he shall be the more<br>
punished for his life.</p>
<br>
<p>268 Now I am the shepherd;<br>
and especially must give an<br>
account of you.</p>
<br>
<p>269  Wherefore take care of<br>
yourselves whilst the tower is,<br>
yet building. The Lord dwells<br>
in those that love peace, for peace<br>
is beloved; but he is far off from<br>
the contentious, and those who are<br>
full of malice.</p>
<br>
<p>270 Wherefore restore unto him<br>
the Spirit entire, as ye received it.<br>
For if thou shalt give unto a<br>
fuller a garment new and whole,<br>
thou wilt expect to receive it whole<br>
again; if therefore the fuller shall<br>
restore it unto thee torn, wouldst<br>
thou receive it?</p>
<br>
<p>271 Wouldst thou not presently<br>
be angry, and reproach him,<br>
saying: I gave my garment to thee<br>
whole, why halt thou rent it, and<br>
made it useless to me? Now it is<br>
of no use to me, by reason of the<br>
rent which thou hast made in it.<br>
Wouldst thou not say all this to a<br>
fuller, for the rent which he made<br>
in thy garment?</p>
<br>
<p>272 If therefore thou wouldst<br>
be concerned for thy garment,<br>
and complain that thou hadst not<br>
received it whole; what thinkest<br>
thou that the Lord will do, who<br>
gave his Spirit to thee entire, and<br>
thou hast rendered him altogether<br>
unprofitable, so that he can be of<br>
no use unto his Lord? For being<br>
corrupted by thee, he is no longer<br>
profitable to him.</p>
<br>
<p>273 Will not therefore the Lord<br>
do the same concerning his Spirit,<br>
by reason of thy deed? Undoubtedly,<br>
said I, he will do the same<br>
to all those whom he shall find to<br>
continue in the remembrance of<br>
injuries.</p>
<br>
<p>274 Tread not then under foot<br>
he said, his mercy; but rather<br>
honour him, because he is so<br>
patient with respect to your offences,<br>
and not like one of you; but repent,<br>
for it will be profitable for you.</p>
<br>
<p>275  All these things which<br>
are above written, I the shepherd<br>
and angel of repentance, have<br>
shown and spoken to the servants<br>
of God.</p>
<br>
<p>276 If therefore ye shall believe<br>
and hearken to these words, and<br>
shall walk in them and correct<br>
your ways, ye shall live. But if<br>
ye shall, continue in malice, and<br>
in the remembrance of injuries,<br>
no such sinners shall live unto<br>
God.</p>
<br>
<p>277 All these things which were<br>
to be spoken by me, I have thus<br>
delivered unto you. Then the<br>
shepherd said unto me, Hast thou<br>
asked all things of me?<br>
I answered, sir, I have.</p>
<br>
<p>278  Why then, said he, hast<br>
thou not asked concerning the<br>
spaces of these stones that were<br>
put in the building, that I may<br>
explain that also unto thee?<br>
I answered, sir, I forgot it.<br>
Hear, then, said he, concerning<br>
these also.</p>
<br>
<p>279  They are those who have<br>
now heard these commands, and<br>
have repented with all their<br>
hearts;</p>
<br>
<p>280 And when the Lord saw<br>
that their repentance was good<br>
and pure, and that they could<br>
continue in it, he commanded<br>
their former sins to be blotted<br>
out. For these spaces were their<br>
sins, and they are therefore made<br>
even that they might not appear.</p>
<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
<br>
<p>SIMILITUDE X.</p>
<br>
<p>Of Repentance and alms-deeds.</p>
<br>
<p>AFTER I had written this<br>
book, the angel which had<br>
delivered me to that shepherd,<br>
came into the house where I was<br>
and sat upon the bed, and that<br>
shepherd stood at his right hand.</p>
<br>
<p>2  Then he called me and said<br>
unto me; I delivered thee and<br>
thy house to this shepherd, that<br>
thou mightest be protected by<br>
him. I said, Yes, Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>3  If therefore, said he, thou<br>
wilt be protected from all<br>
vexations and from all cruelty, and<br>
have success in every good word<br>
and work, and have all virtue and<br>
righteousness; walk in those<br>
commands which he has given thee,<br>
and thou shalt have dominion<br>
over all sin.</p>
<br>
<p>4  For if thou keepest those<br>
commands, all the lust and pleasure<br>
of this present world shall be<br>
subject to thee; and success shall<br>
follow thee in every good undertaking.</p>
<br>
<p>5  Take therefore his gravity<br>
and modesty towards thee, and<br>
say unto all, that he is in great<br>
honour and renown with God, and<br>
is a prince of great authority, and<br>
powerful in his office.</p>
<br>
<p>6  To him only is the power of<br>
repentance committed throughout<br>
the whole world. Does he not<br>
seem to thee to be of great<br>
authority?</p>
<br>
<p>7  But ye despise his goodness,<br>
and the modesty which he shows<br>
towards you.</p>
<br>
<p>8  I said unto him; Sir, ask<br>
him since the time that he came<br>
into my house whether I have<br>
done any thing disorderly, or<br>
have offended him in any thing?</p>
<br>
<p>9  I know, said he, that thou<br>
hast done nothing disorderly,<br>
neither wilt thou hereafter do<br>
any such thing, and therefore I<br>
speak these things with thee that<br>
then mayest persevere; for he<br>
has given me a good account<br>
concerning thee.</p>
<br>
<p>10  But thou shalt speak these<br>
things to others, that they who<br>
either have repented, or shall<br>
repent, may be like-minded with<br>
thee, and he may give me as<br>
good an account of them also;<br>
and that I may do the same unto<br>
the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>11 I answered; Sir, I declare<br>
to all men the wonderful works of<br>
God; and I hope that all who<br>
love them, and have before sinned,<br>
when they shall hear these things,<br>
will repent, and recover life.</p>
<br>
<p>12 Continue therefore, said he,<br>
in this ministry, and fulfil it.<br>
And whosoever shall do according<br>
to the commands of this shepherd,<br>
he shall live; and shall have great<br>
honour both here and with the<br>
Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>13  But they that shall not keep<br>
his commands, flee from their life,<br>
and are adversaries to it. And<br>
they that follow not his commands,<br>
shall deliver themselves<br>
unto death; and shall be every<br>
one guilty of his own blood.</p>
<br>
<p>14  But I say unto thee, keep<br>
these commandments, and thou<br>
shalt find a cure for all thy sins.</p>
<br>
<p>15  Moreover, I have sent<br>
these virgins to dwell with thee;<br>
for I have seen that they are very<br>
kind to thee. Thou shalt therefore<br>
have them for thy helpers,<br>
that thou mayest the better keep<br>
the commands which he hath given<br>
thee; for these commands cannot<br>
be kept without these virgins.</p>
<br>
<p>16  And as I see how they are<br>
willing to be with thee, I will<br>
also command them that they shall<br>
not all depart from thy house.</p>
<br>
<p>17  Only do thou purify thy<br>
house; for they will readily dwell<br>
in a clean house. For they are<br>
clean and chaste, and industrious;<br>
and all of them have grace with<br>
the Lord.</p>
<br>
<p>18  If therefore thou shalt have<br>
thy house pure, they will abide<br>
with thee. But, if it shall be<br>
never so little polluted, they will<br>
immediately depart from thy house;<br>
for these virgins cannot endure any<br>
manner of pollution.</p>
<br>
<p>19  I said unto him; Sir, I hope<br>
that I shall so please them, that<br>
they shall always delight to dwell<br>
in my house. And as be to whom<br>
you have committed me, makes<br>
no complaint of me; so neither<br>
shall they complain.</p>
<br>
<p>20  Then he said to that shepherd:<br>
I see that the servant of God will<br>
live and keep these commandments,<br>
and place these virgins in a pure<br>
habitation.</p>
<br>
<p>21 When he had said this,<br>
he delivered me again to that<br>
shepherd, and called the virgins,<br>
and said unto them; Forasmuch as I<br>
see that ye will readily dwell in<br>
this man's house, I commend him<br>
and his family to you, that ye may<br>
not at all depart from his house.<br>
And they willingly heard these<br>
words.</p>
<br>
<p>22  Then he said unto me,<br>
Go on manfully in thy ministry;<br>
declare to all men the great things<br>
of God, and thou shalt find grace<br>
in this ministry.</p>
<br>
<p>23  And whosover shall walk<br>
in these commands, shall live,<br>
and be happy in his life. But he<br>
that shall neglect them, shall not<br>
live, and shall be unhappy in his<br>
life.</p>
<br>
<p>24  Say unto all that whosoever<br>
can do well, cease not to exercise<br>
themselves in good works, for it<br>
is profitable unto them. For I<br>
would that all men should be<br>
delivered from the inconveniences<br>
they lie under.</p>
<br>
<p>25  For he that wants, and<br>
suffers inconveniences in his<br>
daily life, is in great torment<br>
and necessity. Whosoever therefore<br>
delivers such a soul from necessity,<br>
gets great joy unto himself.</p>
<br>
<p>26  For he that is grieved with<br>
such inconveniencies is equally<br>
tormented, as if he were in chains.<br>
And many upon the account of<br>
such calamities, being not able to<br>
bear them, have chosen even to<br>
destroy themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>27  He therefore that knows the<br>
calamity of such a man, and does<br>
not free him from it, commits a<br>
great sin, and is guilty of his<br>
blood.</p>
<br>
<p>28  Wherefore exercise your.<br>
selves in good works, as many as<br>
have received ability from the<br>
Lord; lest whilst ye delay to do<br>
them, the building of the tower be<br>
finished; because for your sakes<br>
the building is stopped.</p>
<br>
<p>29  Except therefore ye shall<br>
make haste to do well, the tower<br>
shall be finished, and ye shall be<br>
shut out of it.</p>
<br>
<p>30  And after he had thus spoken<br>
with me, he rose up from the bed<br>
and departed, taking the shepherd<br>
and virgins with him.</p>
<br>
<p>31  Howbeit he said unto me,<br>
that he would send back the<br>
shepherd and virgins unto<br>
my house.  Amen.</p>

                       REFERENCES TO THE BOOK OF<br>
                         HERMAS, THE SHEPHERD.</p>
<br>
<p>     [This book, divided into three parts, called his VISIONS, COMMANDS,<br>
     and SIMILITUDES, is thus entitled, because it was composed by<br>
     Hermas, brother to Pius, bishop of Rome; and because the Angel, who<br>
     bears the principal part in it, is represented in the form and habit<br>
     of a shepherd. Irenxus quotes it under the very name of Scripture.<br>
     Origen thought it a most useful writing, and that it was divinely<br>
     inspired; Eusebius says that, though it was not esteemed canonical,<br>
     it was read publicly in the churches, which is corroborated by<br>
     Jerome; and Athanasius cites it, calls it a most useful work, and<br>
     observes, that though it was not strictly canonical, the Fathers<br>
     appointed it to be read for direction and confirmation in faith and<br>
     piety. Jerome, notwithstanding this, and that he applauded it in his<br>
     catalogue of writers, in his comments upon it afterwards, terms it<br>
     apocryphal and foolish.  Turtullian praised it when a Catholic, and<br>
     abused it when a Montanist. Although Gelasius ranks it among the<br>
     apocryphal books, it is found attached to some of the most ancient<br>
     MSS. of the New Testament; and Archbishop Wake, believing it the<br>
     genuine work of an apostolical Father, preserves it to the English<br>
     reader by the foregoing translation, in which he has rendered the<br>
     three parts of it not only more exact, but in greater purity than<br>
     they had before appeared. The archbishop procured Dr. Grabe to<br>
     entirely collate the old Latin version with an ancient MS. in the<br>
     Lambeth library; and the learned prelate himself still further<br>
     improved the whole from a multitude of fragments of the original<br>
     Greek never before used for that purpose.]</p>

****** This file should be named fb10w11h.html or fb10w11h.zip ******

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged

codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
