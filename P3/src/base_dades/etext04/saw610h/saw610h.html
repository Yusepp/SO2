<p>AT last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred&mdash;and
vigorously: the murder trial came on in the court. It became the
absorbing topic of village talk immediately. Tom could not get
away from it. Every reference to the murder sent a shudder to
his heart, for his troubled conscience and fears almost persuaded
him that these remarks were put forth in his hearing as
"feelers"; he did not see how he could be suspected of knowing
anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable
in the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the
time. He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It
would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to
divide his burden of distress with another sufferer. Moreover,
he wanted to assure himself that Huck had remained discreet.</p>

<p>"Huck, have you ever told anybody about&mdash;that?"</p>

<p>"'Bout what?"</p>

<p>"You know what."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;'course I haven't."</p>

<p>"Never a word?"</p>

<p>"Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?"</p>

<p>"Well, I was afeard."</p>

<p>"Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn't be alive two days if that got
found out. YOU know that."</p>

<p>Tom felt more comfortable. After a pause:</p>

<p>"Huck, they couldn't anybody get you to tell, could they?"</p>

<p>"Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to
drownd me they could get me to tell. They ain't no different
way."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right, then. I reckon we're safe as long as
we keep mum. But let's swear again, anyway. It's more
surer."</p>

<p>"I'm agreed."</p>

<p>So they swore again with dread solemnities.</p>

<p>"What is the talk around, Huck? I've heard a power of it."</p>

<p>"Talk? Well, it's just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter
all the time. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so's I want to
hide som'ers."</p>

<p>"That's just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he's a
goner. Don't you feel sorry for him, sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Most always&mdash;most always. He ain't no account; but then
he hain't ever done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a
little, to get money to get drunk on&mdash;and loafs around
considerable; but lord, we all do that&mdash;leastways most of
us&mdash;preachers and such like. But he's kind of good&mdash;he
give me half a fish, once, when there warn't enough for two; and
lots of times he's kind of stood by me when I was out of
luck."</p>

<p>"Well, he's mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to
my line. I wish we could get him out of there."</p>

<p>"My! we couldn't get him out, Tom. And besides, 'twouldn't do
any good; they'd ketch him again."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;so they would. But I hate to hear 'em abuse him so
like the dickens when he never done&mdash;that."</p>

<p>"I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear 'em say he's the bloodiest
looking villain in this country, and they wonder he wasn't ever
hung before."</p>

<p>"Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I've heard 'em say
that if he was to get free they'd lynch him."</p>

<p>"And they'd do it, too."</p>

<p>The boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort.
As the twilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the
neighborhood of the little isolated jail, perhaps with an
undefined hope that something would happen that might clear away
their difficulties. But nothing happened; there seemed to be no
angels or fairies interested in this luckless captive.</p>

<p>The boys did as they had often done before&mdash;went to the
cell grating and gave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on
the ground floor and there were no guards.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="23-184"></a>
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br> 

<p>His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their
consciences before &mdash;it cut deeper than ever, this time.
They felt cowardly and treacherous to the last degree when Potter
said:</p>

<p>"You've been mighty good to me, boys&mdash;better'n anybody
else in this town. And I don't forget it, I don't. Often I says
to myself, says I, 'I used to mend all the boys' kites and
things, and show 'em where the good fishin' places was, and
befriend 'em what I could, and now they've all forgot old Muff
when he's in trouble; but Tom don't, and Huck don't&mdash; THEY
don't forget him, says I, 'and I don't forget them.' Well, boys,
I done an awful thing&mdash;drunk and crazy at the
time&mdash;that's the only way I account for it&mdash;and now I
got to swing for it, and it's right. Right, and BEST, too, I
reckon&mdash;hope so, anyway. Well, we won't talk about that. I
don't want to make YOU feel bad; you've befriended me. But what I
want to say, is, don't YOU ever get drunk&mdash;then you won't
ever get here. Stand a litter furder west&mdash;so&mdash;that's
it; it's a prime comfort to see faces that's friendly when a
body's in such a muck of trouble, and there don't none come here
but yourn. Good friendly faces &mdash;good friendly faces. Git up
on one another's backs and let me touch 'em. That's it. Shake
hands&mdash;yourn'll come through the bars, but mine's too big.
Little hands, and weak&mdash;but they've helped Muff Potter a
power, and they'd help him more if they could."</p>

<p>Tom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full
of horrors. The next day and the day after, he hung about the
courtroom, drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in,
but forcing himself to stay out. Huck was having the same
experience. They studiously avoided each other. Each wandered
away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination always
brought them back presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers
sauntered out of the courtroom, but invariably heard distressing
news&mdash;the toils were closing more and more relentlessly
around poor Potter. At the end of the second day the village talk
was to the effect that Injun Joe's evidence stood firm and
unshaken, and that there was not the slightest question as to
what the jury's verdict would be.</p>

<p>Tom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the
window. He was in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours
before he got to sleep. All the village flocked to the
courthouse the next morning, for this was to be the great day.
Both sexes were about equally represented in the packed audience.
After a long wait the jury filed in and took their places;
shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and hopeless,
was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all the
curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun
Joe, stolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge
arrived and the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The
usual whisperings among the lawyers and gathering together of
papers followed. These details and accompanying delays worked up
an atmosphere of preparation that was as impressive as it was
fascinating.</p>

<p>Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff
Potter washing in the brook, at an early hour of the morning that
the murder was discovered, and that he immediately sneaked away.
After some further questioning, counsel for the prosecution
said:</p>

<p>"Take the witness."</p>

<p>The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them
again when his own counsel said:</p>

<p>"I have no questions to ask him."</p>

<p>The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the
corpse. Counsel for the prosecution said:</p>

<p>"Take the witness."</p>

<p>"I have no questions to ask him," Potter's lawyer replied.</p>

<p>A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter's
possession.</p>

<p>"Take the witness."</p>

<p>Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the
audience began to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to
throw away his client's life without an effort?</p>

<p>Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter's guilty behavior
when brought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to
leave the stand without being cross-questioned.</p>

<p>Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in
the graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so
well was brought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were
cross-examined by Potter's lawyer. The perplexity and
dissatisfaction of the house expressed itself in murmurs and
provoked a reproof from the bench. Counsel for the prosecution
now said:</p>

<p>"By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above
suspicion, we have fastened this awful crime, beyond all
possibility of question, upon the unhappy prisoner at the bar. We
rest our case here."</p>

<p>A groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his
hands and rocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful
silence reigned in the courtroom. Many men were moved, and many
women's compassion testified itself in tears. Counsel for the
defence rose and said:</p>

<p>"Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we
foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this
fearful deed while under the influence of a blind and
irresponsible delirium produced by drink. We have changed our
mind. We shall not offer that plea." [Then to the clerk:] "Call
Thomas Sawyer!"</p>

<p>A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even
excepting Potter's. Every eye fastened itself with wondering
interest upon Tom as he rose and took his place upon the stand.
The boy looked wild enough, for he was badly scared. The oath was
administered.</p>

<p>"Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June,
about the hour of midnight?"</p>

<p>Tom glanced at Injun Joe's iron face and his tongue failed
him. The audience listened breathless, but the words refused to
come. After a few moments, however, the boy got a little of his
strength back, and managed to put enough of it into his voice to
make part of the house hear:</p>

<p>"In the graveyard!"</p>

<p>"A little bit louder, please. Don't be afraid. You
were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In the graveyard."</p>

<p>A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe's face.</p>

<p>"Were you anywhere near Horse Williams' grave?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Speak up&mdash;just a trifle louder. How near were you?"</p>

<p>"Near as I am to you."</p>

<p>"Were you hidden, or not?"</p>

<p>"I was hid."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Behind the elms that's on the edge of the grave."</p>

<p>Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.</p>

<p>"Any one with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I went there with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait&mdash;wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your
companion's name. We will produce him at the proper time. Did you
carry anything there with you."</p>

<p>Tom hesitated and looked confused.</p>

<p>"Speak out, my boy&mdash;don't be diffident. The truth is
always respectable. What did you take there?"</p>

<p>"Only a&mdash;a&mdash;dead cat."</p>

<p>There was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.</p>

<p>"We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell
us everything that occurred&mdash;tell it in your own
way&mdash;don't skip anything, and don't be afraid."</p>

<p>Tom began&mdash;hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his
subject his words flowed more and more easily; in a little while
every sound ceased but his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon
him; with parted lips and bated breath the audience hung upon his
words, taking no note of time, rapt in the ghastly fascinations
of the tale. The strain upon pent emotion reached its climax when
the boy said:</p>

<p>"&mdash;and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff
Potter fell, Injun Joe jumped with the knife and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Crash! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window,
tore his way through all opposers, and was gone!</p>

<img alt="24-189.jpg (165K)" src="24-189.jpg" height="890" width="788">
 

<p>TOM was a glittering hero once more&mdash;the pet of the old,
the envy of the young. His name even went into immortal print,
for the village paper magnified him. There were some that
believed he would be President, yet, if he escaped hanging.</p>

<p>As usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to
its bosom and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him
before. But that sort of conduct is to the world's credit;
therefore it is not well to find fault with it.</p>

<p>Tom's days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but
his nights were seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his
dreams, and always with doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation
could persuade the boy to stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck
was in the same state of wretchedness and terror, for Tom had
told the whole story to the lawyer the night before the great day
of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid that his share in the
business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding Injun Joe's flight
had saved him the suffering of testifying in court. The poor
fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of that?
Since Tom's harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the
lawyer's house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had
been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths,
Huck's confidence in the human race was wellnigh
obliterated.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="24-190"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="24-190.jpg (57K)" src="24-190.jpg" height="493" width="347">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>Daily Muff Potter's gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but
nightly he wished he had sealed up his tongue.</p>

<p>Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be
captured; the other half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure
he never could draw a safe breath again until that man was dead
and he had seen the corpse.</p>

<p>Rewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no
Injun Joe was found. One of those omniscient and aweinspiring
marvels, a detective, came up from St. Louis, moused around,
shook his head, looked wise, and made that sort of astounding
success which members of that craft usually achieve. That is to
say, he "found a clew." But you can't hang a "clew" for murder,
and so after that detective had got through and gone home, Tom
felt just as insecure as he was before.</p>

<p>The slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly
lightened weight of apprehension.</p>

<p>THERE comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy's life
when he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden
treasure. This desire suddenly came upon Tom one day. He
sallied out to find Joe Harper, but failed of success. Next he
sought Ben Rogers; he had gone fishing. Presently he stumbled
upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck would answer. Tom took him to
a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially.
Huck was willing. Huck was always willing to take a hand in any
enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital,
for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time
which is not money. "Where'll we dig?" said Huck.</p>

<p>"Oh, most anywhere."</p>

<p>"Why, is it hid all around?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed it ain't. It's hid in mighty particular places,
Huck&mdash; sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests
under the end of a limb of an old dead tree, just where the
shadow falls at midnight; but mostly under the floor in ha'nted
houses."</p>

<p>"Who hides it?"</p>

<p>"Why, robbers, of course&mdash;who'd you reckon?
Sunday-school sup'rintendents?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. If 'twas mine I wouldn't hide it; I'd spend it
and have a good time."</p>

<p>"So would I. But robbers don't do that way. They always hide
it and leave it there."</p>

<br><br><br><br> 

<p>"Don't they come after it any more?"</p>

<p>"No, they think they will, but they generally forget the
marks, or else they die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and
gets rusty; and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that
tells how to find the marks&mdash; a paper that's got to be
ciphered over about a week because it's mostly signs and
hy'roglyphics."</p>

<p>"HyroQwhich?"</p>

<p>"Hy'roglyphics&mdash;pictures and things, you know, that don't
seem to mean anything."</p>

<p>"Have you got one of them papers, Tom?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well then, how you going to find the marks?"</p>

<p>"I don't want any marks. They always bury it under a ha'nted
house or on an island, or under a dead tree that's got one limb
sticking out. Well, we've tried Jackson's Island a little, and we
can try it again some time; and there's the old ha'nted house up
the Still-House branch, and there's lots of dead-limb
trees&mdash;dead loads of 'em."</p>

<p>"Is it under all of them?"</p>

<p>"How you talk! No!"</p>

<p>"Then how you going to know which one to go for?"</p>

<p>"Go for all of 'em!"</p>

<p>"Why, Tom, it'll take all summer."</p>

<p>"Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a
hundred dollars in it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full
of di'monds. How's that?"</p>

<p>Huck's eyes glowed.</p>

<p>"That's bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the
hundred dollars and I don't want no di'monds."</p>

<p>"All right. But I bet you I ain't going to throw off on
di'monds. Some of 'em's worth twenty dollars apiece&mdash;there
ain't any, hardly, but's worth six bits or a dollar."</p>

<p>"No! Is that so?"</p>

<p>"Cert'nly&mdash;anybody'll tell you so. Hain't you ever seen
one, Huck?"</p>

<p>"Not as I remember."</p>

<p>"Oh, kings have slathers of them."</p>

<p>"Well, I don' know no kings, Tom."</p>

<p>"I reckon you don't. But if you was to go to Europe you'd see
a raft of 'em hopping around."</p>

<p>"Do they hop?"</p>

<p>"Hop?&mdash;your granny! No!"</p>

<p>"Well, what did you say they did, for?"</p>

<p>"Shucks, I only meant you'd SEE 'em&mdash;not hopping, of
course&mdash;what do they want to hop for?&mdash;but I mean you'd
just see 'em&mdash;scattered around, you know, in a kind of a
general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard."</p>

<p>"Richard? What's his other name?"</p>

<p>"He didn't have any other name. Kings don't have any but a
given name."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"But they don't."</p>

<p>"Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don't want to be
a king and have only just a given name, like a nigger. But
say&mdash;where you going to dig first?"</p>

<br><br>

<br><br><br><br> 

<p>"Well, I don't know. S'pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree
on the hill t'other side of Still-House branch?"</p>

<p>"I'm agreed."</p>

<p>So they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their
three-mile tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw
themselves down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and
have a smoke.</p>

<p>"I like this," said Tom.</p>

<p>"So do I."</p>

<p>"Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do
with your share?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I'll
go to every circus that comes along. I bet I'll have a gay
time."</p>

<p>"Well, ain't you going to save any of it?"</p>

<p>"Save it? What for?"</p>

<p>"Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by."</p>

<p>"Oh, that ain't any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town
some day and get his claws on it if I didn't hurry up, and I tell
you he'd clean it out pretty quick. What you going to do with
yourn, Tom?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to buy a new drum, and a sure'nough sword, and a
red necktie and a bull pup, and get married."</p>

<p>"Married!"</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>"Tom, you&mdash;why, you ain't in your right mind."</p>

<p>"Wait&mdash;you'll see."</p>

<p>"Well, that's the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap
and my mother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I
remember, mighty well."</p>

<p>"That ain't anything. The girl I'm going to marry won't
fight."</p>

<p>"Tom, I reckon they're all alike. They'll all comb a body. Now
you better think 'bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What's
the name of the gal?"</p>

<p>"It ain't a gal at all&mdash;it's a girl."</p>

<p>"It's all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says
girl&mdash;both's right, like enough. Anyway, what's her name,
Tom?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you some time&mdash;not now."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;that'll do. Only if you get married I'll be
more lonesomer than ever."</p>

<p>"No you won't. You'll come and live with me. Now stir out of
this and we'll go to digging."</p>

<p>They worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They
toiled another halfhour. Still no result. Huck said:</p>

<p>"Do they always bury it as deep as this?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes&mdash;not always. Not generally. I reckon we
haven't got the right place."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="25-195"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="25-195.jpg (52K)" src="25-195.jpg" height="514" width="352">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>So they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a
little, but still they made progress. They pegged away in silence
for some time. Finally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the
beaded drops from his brow with his sleeve, and said:</p>

<p>"Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?"</p>

<p>"I reckon maybe we'll tackle the old tree that's over yonder
on Cardiff Hill back of the widow's."</p>

<p>"I reckon that'll be a good one. But won't the widow take it
away from us, Tom? It's on her land."</p>

<p>"SHE take it away! Maybe she'd like to try it once. Whoever
finds one of these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don't
make any difference whose land it's on."</p>

<p>That was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck
said:</p>

<p>"Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you
think?"</p>

<p>"It is mighty curious, Huck. I don't understand it. Sometimes
witches interfere. I reckon maybe that's what's the trouble
now."</p>

<p>"Shucks! Witches ain't got no power in the daytime."</p>

<p>"Well, that's so. I didn't think of that. Oh, I know what the
matter is! What a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out
where the shadow of the limb falls at midnight, and that's where
you dig!"</p>

<p>"Then consound it, we've fooled away all this work for
nothing. Now hang it all, we got to come back in the night. It's
an awful long way. Can you get out?"</p>

<p>"I bet I will. We've got to do it tonight, too, because if
somebody sees these holes they'll know in a minute what's here
and they'll go for it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll come around and maow tonight."</p>

<p>"All right. Let's hide the tools in the bushes."</p>

<p>The boys were there that night, about the appointed time.
They sat in the shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an
hour made solemn by old traditions. Spirits whispered in the
rustling leaves, ghosts lurked in the murky nooks, the deep
baying of a hound floated up out of the distance, an owl answered
with his sepulchral note. The boys were subdued by these
solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged that twelve
had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to dig.
Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and
their industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still
deepened, but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick
strike upon something, they only suffered a new disappointment.
It was only a stone or a chunk. At last Tom said:</p>

<p>"It ain't any use, Huck, we're wrong again."</p>

<p>"Well, but we CAN'T be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a
dot."</p>

<p>"I know it, but then there's another thing."</p>

<p>"What's that?".</p>

<p>"Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late
or too early."</p>

<p>Huck dropped his shovel.</p>

<p>"That's it," said he. "That's the very trouble. We got to give
this one up. We can't ever tell the right time, and besides this
kind of thing's too awful, here this time of night with witches
and ghosts a-fluttering around so. I feel as if something's
behind me all the time;  and I'm afeard to turn around, becuz
maybe there's others in front a-waiting for a chance. I been
creeping all over, ever since I got here."</p>

<p>"Well, I've been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always
put in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look
out for it."</p>

<p>"Lordy!"</p>

<p>"Yes, they do. I've always heard that."</p>

<p>"Tom, I don't like to fool around much where there's dead
people. A body's bound to get into trouble with 'em, sure."</p>

<p>"I don't like to stir 'em up, either. S'pose this one here was
to stick his skull out and say something!"</p>

<p>"Don't Tom! It's awful."</p>

<p>"Well, it just is. Huck, I don't feel comfortable a bit."</p>

<p>"Say, Tom, let's give this place up, and try somewheres
else."</p>

<p>"All right, I reckon we better."</p>

<p>"What'll it be?"</p>

<p>Tom considered awhile; and then said:</p>

<p>"The ha'nted house. That's it!"</p>

<p>"Blame it, I don't like ha'nted houses, Tom. Why, they're a
dern sight worse'n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe,
but they don't come sliding around in a shroud, when you ain't
noticing, and peep over your shoulder all of a sudden and grit
their teeth, the way a ghost does. I couldn't stand such a thing
as that, Tom&mdash;nobody could."</p>

<p>"Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don't travel around only at night.
They won't hender us from digging there in the daytime."</p>

<p>"Well, that's so. But you know mighty well people don't go
about that ha'nted house in the day nor the night."</p>

<p>"Well, that's mostly because they don't like to go where a
man's been murdered, anyway&mdash;but nothing's ever been seen
around that house except in the night&mdash;just some blue lights
slipping by the windows&mdash; no regular ghosts."</p>

<p>"Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering
around, Tom, you can bet there's a ghost mighty close behind it.
It stands to reason. Becuz you know that they don't anybody but
ghosts use 'em."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so. But anyway they don't come around in the
daytime, so what's the use of our being afeard?"</p>

<p>"Well, all right. We'll tackle the ha'nted house if you say
so&mdash;but I reckon it's taking chances."</p>

<br><br><br><br> 

<p>They had started down the hill by this time. There in the
middle of the moonlit valley below them stood the "ha'nted"
house, utterly isolated, its fences gone long ago, rank weeds
smothering the very doorsteps, the chimney crumbled to ruin, the
window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof caved in. The boys
gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit past a
window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the
circumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the
haunted house a wide berth, and took their way homeward through
the woods that adorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.</p>

<p>ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree;
they had come for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the
haunted house; Huck was measurably so, also&mdash;but suddenly
said:</p>

<p>"Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?"</p>

<p>Tom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly
lifted his eyes with a startled look in them&mdash;</p>

<p>"My! I never once thought of it, Huck!"</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't neither, but all at once it popped onto me
that it was Friday."</p>

<p>"Blame it, a body can't be too careful, Huck. We might 'a' got
into an awful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday."</p>

<p>"MIGHT! Better say we WOULD! There's some lucky days, maybe,
but Friday ain't."</p>

<p>"Any fool knows that. I don't reckon YOU was the first that
found it out, Huck."</p>

<p>"Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain't all,
neither. I had a rotten bad dream last night&mdash;dreampt about
rats."</p>

<p>"No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, that's good, Huck. When they don't fight it's only a
sign that there's trouble around, you know. All we got to do is
to look mighty sharp and keep out of it. We'll drop this thing
for today, and play. Do you know Robin Hood, Huck?"</p>

<p>"No. Who's Robin Hood?"</p>

<p>"Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in
England&mdash;and the best. He was a robber."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="26-200"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="26-200.jpg (42K)" src="26-200.jpg" height="462" width="338">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>"Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?"</p>

<p>"Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such
like. But he never bothered the poor. He loved 'em. He always
divided up with 'em perfectly square."</p>

<p>"Well, he must 'a' been a brick."</p>

<p>"I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever
was. They ain't any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick
any man in England, with one hand tied behind him; and he could
take his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and
a half."</p>

<p>"What's a YEW bow?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It's some kind of a bow, of course. And if he
hit that dime only on the edge he would set down and
cry&mdash;and curse. But we'll play Robin Hood&mdash;it's nobby
fun. I'll learn you."</p>

<p>"I'm agreed."</p>

<p>So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then
casting a yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a
remark about the morrow's prospects and possibilities there. As
the sun began to sink into the west they took their way homeward
athwart the long shadows of the trees and soon were buried from
sight in the forests of Cardiff Hill.</p>

<p>On Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead
tree again. They had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then
dug a little in their last hole, not with great hope, but merely
because Tom said there were so many cases where people had given
up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it, and
then somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single
thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this time, however, so the
boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had
not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the requirements
that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.</p>

<p>When they reached the haunted house there was something so
weird and grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under
the baking sun, and something so depressing about the loneliness
and desolation of the place, that they were afraid, for a
moment, to venture in. Then they crept to the door and took a
trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown, floorless room,
unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows, a ruinous
staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and
abandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened
pulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest
sound, and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.</p>

<p>In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they
gave the place a critical and interested examination, rather
admiring their own boldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they
wanted to look upstairs. This was something like cutting off
retreat, but they got to daring each other, and of course there
could be but one result&mdash;they threw their tools into a
corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of
decay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery,
but the promise was a fraud&mdash;there was nothing in it. Their
courage was up now and well in hand. They were about to go down
and begin work when&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sh!" said Tom.</p>

<p>"What is it?" whispered Huck, blanching with fright.</p>

<p>"Sh! ... There! ... Hear it?"</p>

<p>"Yes! ... Oh, my! Let's run!"</p>

<p>"Keep still! Don't you budge! They're coming right toward the
door."</p>

<p>The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes
to knotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of
fear.</p>

<p>"They've stopped.... No&mdash;coming.... Here they are. Don't
whisper another word, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of
this!"</p>

<p>Two men entered. Each boy said to himself: "There's the old
deaf and dumb Spaniard that's been about town once or twice
lately&mdash;never saw t'other man before."</p>

<p>"T'other" was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very
pleasant in his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he
had bushy white whiskers; long white hair flowed from under his
sombrero, and he wore green goggles. When they came in, "t'other"
was talking in a low voice; they sat down on the ground, facing
the door, with their backs to the wall, and the speaker continued
his remarks. His manner became less guarded and his words more
distinct as he proceeded:</p>

<p>"No," said he, "I've thought it all over, and I don't like it.
It's dangerous."</p>

<p>"Dangerous!" grunted the "deaf and dumb" Spaniard&mdash;to
the vast surprise of the boys. "Milksop!"</p>

<p>This voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe's!
There was silence for some time. Then Joe said:</p>

<p>"What's any more dangerous than that job up yonder&mdash;but
nothing's come of it."</p>

<p>"That's different. Away up the river so, and not another house
about. 'Twon't ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we
didn't succeed."</p>

<p>"Well, what's more dangerous than coming here in the
daytime!&mdash;anybody would suspicion us that saw us."</p>

<p>"I know that. But there warn't any other place as handy after
that fool of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to
yesterday, only it warn't any use trying to stir out of here,
with those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in
full view."</p>

<p>"Those infernal boys" quaked again under the inspiration of
this remark, and thought how lucky it was that they had
remembered it was Friday and concluded to wait a day. They wished
in their hearts they had waited a year.</p>

<p>The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a
long and thoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:</p>

<p>"Look here, lad&mdash;you go back up the river where you
belong. Wait there till you hear from me. I'll take the chances
on dropping into this town just once more, for a look. We'll do
that 'dangerous' job after I've spied around a little and think
things look well for it. Then for Texas! We'll leg it
together!"</p>

<p>This was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and
Injun Joe said:</p>

<p>"I'm dead for sleep! It's your turn to watch."</p>

<p>He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His
comrade stirred him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently
the watcher began to nod; his head drooped lower and lower, both
men began to snore now.</p>

<p>The boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:</p>

<p>"Now's our chance&mdash;come!"</p>

<p>Huck said:</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;I'd die if they was to wake."</p>

<p>Tom urged&mdash;Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and
softly, and started alone. But the first step he made wrung such
a hideous creak from the crazy floor that he sank down almost
dead with fright. He never made a second attempt. The boys lay
there counting the dragging moments till it seemed to them that
time must be done and eternity growing gray; and then they were
grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.</p>

<p>Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared
around&mdash;smiled grimly upon his comrade, whose head was
drooping upon his knees&mdash;stirred him up with his foot and
said:</p>

<p>"Here! YOU'RE a watchman, ain't you! All right,
though&mdash;nothing's happened."</p>

<p>"My! have I been asleep?"</p>

<p>"Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard.
What'll we do with what little swag we've got left?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;leave it here as we've always done, I
reckon. No use to take it away till we start south. Six hundred
and fifty in silver's something to carry."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;all right&mdash;it won't matter to come here once
more."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but I'd say come in the night as we used to
do&mdash;it's better."</p>

<p>"Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the
right chance at that job; accidents might happen; 'tain't in
such a very good place; we'll just regularly bury it&mdash;and
bury it deep."</p>

<p>"Good idea," said the comrade, who walked across the room,
knelt down, raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out
a bag that jingled pleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or
thirty dollars for himself and as much for Injun Joe, and passed
the bag to the latter, who was on his knees in the corner, now,
digging with his bowie-knife.</p>

<p>The boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an
instant. With gloating eyes they watched every movement.
Luck!&mdash;the splendor of it was beyond all imagination! Six
hundred dollars was money enough to make half a dozen boys rich!
Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest auspices&mdash;there
would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to dig. They
nudged each other every moment&mdash;eloquent nudges and easily
understood, for they simply meant&mdash;"Oh, but ain't you glad
NOW we're here!"</p>

<p>Joe's knife struck upon something.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said he.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said his comrade.</p>

<p>"Half-rotten plank&mdash;no, it's a box, I believe.
Here&mdash;bear a hand and we'll see what it's here for. Never
mind, I've broke a hole."</p>

<p>He reached his hand in and drew it out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Man, it's money!"</p>

<p>The two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The
boys above were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.</p>

<p>Joe's comrade said:</p>

<p>"We'll make quick work of this. There's an old rusty pick over
amongst the weeds in the corner the other side of the
fireplace&mdash;I saw it a minute ago."</p>

<p>He ran and brought the boys' pick and shovel. Injun Joe took
the pick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered
something to himself, and then began to use it. The box was soon
unearthed. It was not very large; it was iron bound and had been
very strong before the slow years had injured it. The men
contemplated the treasure awhile in blissful silence.</p>

<p>"Pard, there's thousands of dollars here," said Injun Joe.</p>

<br><br><br><br> 

<p>"'Twas always said that Murrel's gang used to be around here
one summer," the stranger observed.</p>

<p>"I know it," said Injun Joe; "and this looks like it, I should
say."</p>

<p>"Now you won't need to do that job."</p>

<p>The halfbreed frowned. Said he:</p>

<p>"You don't know me. Least you don't know all about that thing.
'Tain't robbery altogether&mdash;it's REVENGE!" and a wicked
light flamed in his eyes. "I'll need your help in it. When it's
finished&mdash;then Texas. Go home to your Nance and your kids,
and stand by till you hear from me."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;if you say so; what'll we do with this&mdash;bury
it again?"</p>

<p>"Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] NO! by the great Sachem,
no! [Profound distress overhead.] I'd nearly forgot. That pick
had fresh earth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a
moment.] What business has a pick and a shovel here? What
business with fresh earth on them? Who brought them
here&mdash;and where are they gone? Have you heard
anybody?&mdash;seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them
to come and see the ground disturbed? Not exactly&mdash;not
exactly. We'll take it to my den."</p>

<p>"Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean
Number One?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;Number Two&mdash;under the cross. The other place is
bad&mdash;too common."</p>

<p>"All right. It's nearly dark enough to start."</p>

<p>Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window
cautiously peeping out. Presently he said:</p>

<p>"Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they
can be upstairs?"</p>

<p>The boys' breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his
knife, halted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the
stairway. The boys thought of the closet, but their strength was
gone. The steps came creaking up the stairs&mdash;the intolerable
distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the
lads&mdash;they were about to spring for the closet, when there
was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on the ground
amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself up
cursing, and his comrade said:</p>

<p>"Now what's the use of all that? If it's anybody, and they're
up there, let them STAY there&mdash;who cares? If they want to
jump down, now, and get into trouble, who objects? It will be
dark in fifteen minutes&mdash;and then let them follow us if they
want to. I'm willing. In my opinion, whoever hove those things in
here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or devils or
something. I'll bet they're running yet."</p>

<p>Joe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what
daylight was left ought to be economized in getting things ready
for leaving. Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in
the deepening twilight, and moved toward the river with their
precious box.</p>

<p>Tom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared
after them through the chinks between the logs of the house.
Follow? Not they. They were content to reach ground again without
broken necks, and take the townward track over the hill. They did
not talk much. They were too much absorbed in hating
themselves&mdash;hating the ill luck that made them take the
spade and the pick there. But for that, Injun Joe never would
have suspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to
wait there till his "revenge" was satisfied, and then he would
have had the misfortune to find that money turn up missing.
Bitter, bitter luck that the tools were ever brought there!</p>

<p>They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he
should come to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful
job, and follow him to "Number Two," wherever that might be. Then
a ghastly thought occurred to Tom.</p>

<p>"Revenge? What if he means US, Huck!"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't!" said Huck, nearly fainting.</p>

<p>They talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed
to believe that he might possibly mean somebody else&mdash;at
least that he might at least mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom
had testified.</p>

<p>Very, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger!
Company would be a palpable improvement, he thought.</p>

<p>THE adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom's dreams that
night. Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four
times it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook
him and wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his
misfortune. As he lay in the early morning recalling the
incidents of his great adventure, he noticed that they seemed
curiously subdued and far away&mdash;somewhat as if they had
happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it
occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream!
There was one very strong argument in favor of this
idea&mdash;namely, that the quantity of coin he had seen was too
vast to be real. He had never seen as much as fifty dollars in
one mass before, and he was like all boys of his age and station
in life, in that he imagined that all references to "hundreds"
and "thousands" were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that no
such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for
a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be
found in actual money in any one's possession. If his notions of
hidden treasure had been analyzed, they would have been found to
consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague,
splendid, ungraspable dollars.</p>

<p>But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and
clearer under the attrition of thinking them over, and so he
presently found himself leaning to the impression that the thing
might not have been a dream, after all. This uncertainty must be
swept away. He would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and find
Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat, listlessly
dangling his feet in the water and looking very melancholy. Tom
concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If he did not do
it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a
dream.</p>

<p>"Hello, Huck!"</p>

<p>"Hello, yourself."</p>

<p>Silence, for a minute.</p>

<p>"Tom, if we'd 'a' left the blame tools at the dead tree, we'd
'a' got the money. Oh, ain't it awful!"</p>

<p>"'Tain't a dream, then, 'tain't a dream! Somehow I most wish
it was. Dog'd if I don't, Huck."</p>

<p>"What ain't a dream?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was."</p>

<br><br><br><br> 

<p>"Dream! If them stairs hadn't broke down you'd 'a' seen how
much dream it was! I've had dreams enough all night&mdash;with
that patch-eyed Spanish devil going for me all through
'em&mdash;rot him!"</p>

<p>"No, not rot him. FIND him! Track the money!"</p>

<p>"Tom, we'll never find him. A feller don't have only one
chance for such a pile&mdash;and that one's lost. I'd feel mighty
shaky if I was to see him, anyway."</p>

<p>"Well, so'd I; but I'd like to see him, anyway&mdash;and track
him out&mdash;to his Number Two."</p>

<p>"Number Two&mdash;yes, that's it. I been thinking 'bout that.
But I can't make nothing out of it. What do you reckon it
is?"</p>

<p>"I dono. It's too deep. Say, Huck&mdash;maybe it's the number
of a house!"</p>

<p>"Goody! ... No, Tom, that ain't it. If it is, it ain't in this
one-horse town. They ain't no numbers here."</p>

<p>"Well, that's so. Lemme think a minute. Here&mdash;it's the
number of a room &mdash;in a tavern, you know!"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the trick! They ain't only two taverns. We can
find out quick."</p>

<p>"You stay here, Huck, till I come."</p>

<p>Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck's company in
public places. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the
best tavern, No. 2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and
was still so occupied. In the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was
a mystery. The tavern-keeper's young son said it was kept locked
all the time, and he never saw anybody go into it or come out
of it except at night; he did not know any particular reason for
this state of things; had had some little curiosity, but it was
rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery by entertaining
himself with the idea that that room was "ha'nted"; had noticed
that there was a light in there the night before.</p>

<p>"That's what I've found out, Huck. I reckon that's the very
No. 2 we're after."</p>

<p>"I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Lemme think."</p>

<p>Tom thought a long time. Then he said:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that
comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the
old rattle trap of a brick store. Now you get hold of all the
doorkeys you can find, and I'll nip all of auntie's, and the
first dark night we'll go there and try 'em. And mind you, keep a
lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he was going to drop into
town and spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge. If
you see him, you just follow him; and if he don't go to that No.
2, that ain't the place."</p>

<p>"Lordy, I don't want to foller him by myself!"</p>

<p>"Why, it'll be night, sure. He mightn't ever see you&mdash;and
if he did, maybe he'd never think anything."</p>

<p>"Well, if it's pretty dark I reckon I'll track him. I
dono&mdash;I dono. I'll try."</p>

<p>"You bet I'll follow him, if it's dark, Huck. Why, he might
'a' found out he couldn't get his revenge, and be going right
after that money."</p>

<p>"It's so, Tom, it's so. I'll foller him; I will, by
jingoes!"</p>

<p>"Now you're TALKING! Don't you ever weaken, Huck, and I
won't."</p>

***** This file should be named saw611h.html or saw611h.zip ****

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, saw612h.html

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
