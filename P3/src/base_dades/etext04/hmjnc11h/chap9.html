<br>
<p class="first">On the 18th November, we left Mywa Guola, and
continued up the river to the village of Wallanchoon or Walloong,
which was reached in six marches. The snowy peak of Junnoo (alt.
25,312 feet.) forms a magnificent feature from this point, seen up
the narrow gorge of the river, bearing N.N.E. about thirty miles. I
crossed the Mewa, an affluent from the north, by another excellent
suspension bridge. In these bridges, the principal chains are
clamped to rocks on either shore, and the suspended loops occur at
intervals of eight to ten feet; the single sal-plank laid on these
loops swings terrifically, and the handrails not being four feet
high, the sense of insecurity is very great.</p>

<p>The Wallanchoon road follows the west bank, but the bridge above
having been carried away, we crossed by a</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 200">[ 200 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">plank, and proceeded along very steep banks of
decomposed chlorite schist, much contorted, and very soapy,
affording an insecure footing, especially where great landslips had
occurred, which were numerous, exposing acres of a reddish and
white soil of felspathic clay, sloping at an angle of 30&deg;.
Where the angle was less than 15&deg;, rice was cultivated, and
partially irrigated. The lateral streams (of a muddy opal green)
had cut beds 200 feet deep in the soft earth, and were very
troublesome to cross, from the crumbling cliffs on either side, and
their broad swampy channels.</p>

<p>Five or six miles above Mywa, the valley contracts much, and the
Tambur (whose bed is elevated about 3000 feet) becomes a turbulent
river, shooting along its course with immense velocity, torn into
foam as it lashes the spurs of rock that flank it, and the enormous
boulders with which its bed is strewn.* From this elevation to 9000
feet, its sinuous track extends about thirty miles, which gives the
mean fall of 200 feet to the mile, quadruple of what it is for the
lower part of its course. So long as its bed is below 5000 feet, a
tropical vegetation prevails in the gorge, and along the terraces,
consisting of tall bamboo, <i>Bauhinia, Acacia, Melastoma,</i>
etc.; but the steep mountain sides above are either bare and
grassy, or cliffs with scattered shrubs and trees, and their
summits are of splintered slaty gneiss, bristling with pines: those
faces exposed to the south and east are invariably the driest and
most grassy; while the opposite are well wooded. <i>Rhododendron
arboreum</i> becomes plentiful at 5000 to 6000 feet, forming a
large tree on dry clayey slopes; it is accompanied by <i>
Indigofera, Andromeda,</i></p>

<p class="fnote">* In some places torrents of stone were carried
down by landslips, obstructing the rivers; when in the beds of
streams, they were often cemented by felspathic clay into a hard
breccia of angular quartz, gneiss, and felspar nodules.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 201">[ 201 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first"><i>Spir&aelig;a,</i> shrubby <i>
Composit&aelig;,</i> and very many plants absent at similar
elevations on the wet outer Dorjiling ranges.</p>

<p>In the contracted parts of the valley, the mountains often dip
to the river-bed, in precipices of gneiss, under the ledges of
which wild bees build pendulous nests, looking like huge bats
suspended by their wings; they are two or three feet long, and as
broad at the top, whence they taper downwards: the honey is much
sought for, except in spring, when it is said to be poisoned by
Rhododendron flowers, just as that, eaten by the soldiers in the
retreat of the Ten Thousand, was by the flowers of the <i>R.
ponticum.</i></p>

<p>Above these gorges are enormous accumulations of rocks,
especially at the confluence of lateral valleys, where they rest
upon little flats, like the river-terraces of Mywa, but wholly
formed of angular shingle, flanked with beds of river-formed
gravel: some of these boulders were thirty or forty yards across,
and split as if they had fallen from a height; the path passing
between the fragments.* At first I imagined that they had been
precipitated from the mountains around; and I referred the shingle
to land-shoots, which during the rains descend several thousand
feet in devastating avalanches, damming up the rivers, and
destroying houses, cattle, and cultivation; but though I still
refer the materials of many such terraces to this cause, I consider
those at the mouths of valleys to be due to ancient glacial action,
especially when laden with such enormous blocks as are probably
ice-transported.</p>

<p>A change in the population accompanies that in the natural
features of the country, Tibetans replacing the</p>

<p class="fnote">* The split fragments I was wholly unable to
account for, till my attention was directed by Mr. Darwin to the
observations of Charpentier and Agassiz, who refer similar ones met
with in the Alps, to rocks which have fallen through crevasses in
glaciers.&mdash;See &ldquo;Darwin on Glaciers and Transported
Boulders in North Wales.&rdquo; London, &ldquo;Phil. Mag.&rdquo;
xxi. p. 180.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 202">[ 202 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Limboos and Khass-tribes of Nepal, who inhabit the
lower region. We daily passed parties of ten or a dozen Tibetans,
on their way to Mywa Guola, laden with salt; several families of
these wild, black, and uncouth-looking people generally travelling
together. The men are middle-sized, often tall, very square-built
and muscular; they have no beard, moustache, or whiskers, the few
hairs on their faces being carefully removed with tweezers. They
are dressed in loose blanket robes, girt about the waist with a
leather belt, in which they place their iron or brass pipes, and
from which they suspend their long knives, chopsticks,
tobacco-pouch, tweezers, tinder-box, etc. The robe, boots, and cap
are grey, or striped with bright colours, and they wear skull-caps,
and the hair plaited into a pig-tail.</p>

<p>The women are dressed in long flannel petticoats and spencer,
over which is thrown a sleeveless, short, striped cloak, drawn
round the waist by a girdle of broad brass or silver links, to
which hang their knives, scissors, needlecases, etc., and with
which they often strap their children to their backs; the hair is
plaited in two tails, and the neck loaded with strings of coral and
glass beads, and great lumps of amber, glass, and agate. Both sexes
wear silver rings and ear-rings, set with turquoises, and square
amulets upon their necks and arms, which are boxes of gold or
silver, containing small idols, or the nail-parings, teeth, or
other reliques of some sainted Lama, accompanied with musk, written
prayers, and other charms. All are good-humoured and
amiable-looking people, very square and Mongolian in countenance,
with broad mouths, high cheek-bones, narrow, upturned eyes, broad,
flat noses, and low foreheads. White is their natural colour, and
rosy cheeks are common amongst the younger women and children, but
all are begrimed with filth and smoke; added</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 203">[ 203 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">to which, they become so weather-worn from
exposure to the most rigorous climate in the world, that their
natural hues are rarely to be recognised. Their customary mode of
saluting one another is to hold out the tongue, grin, nod, and
scratch their ear; but this method entails so much ridicule in the
low countries, that they do not practise it to Nepalese or
strangers; most of them when meeting me, on the contrary, raised
their hands to their eyes, threw themselves on the ground, and
kotowed most decorously, bumping their foreheads three times on the
ground; even the women did this on several occasions. On rising,
they begged for a bucksheesh, which I gave in tobacco or snuff, of
which they are immoderately fond. Both men and women constantly
spin wool as they travel.</p>

<br>

<p>These motley groups of Tibetans are singularly picturesque, from
the variety in their parti-coloured dresses, and their odd
appearance. First comes a middle-aged man or woman, driving a
little silky black yak, grunting under his load of 260 lb. of salt,
besides pots, pans, and</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 204">[ 204 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">kettles, stools, churn, and bamboo vessels,
keeping up a constant rattle, and perhaps, buried amongst all, a
rosy-cheeked and lipped baby, sucking a lump of cheese-curd. The
main body follow in due order, and you are soon entangled amidst
sheep and goats, each with its two little bags of salt: beside
these, stalks the huge, grave, bull-headed mastiff, loaded like the
rest, his glorious bushy tail thrown over his back in a majestic
sweep, and a thick collar of scarlet wool round his neck and
shoulders, setting off his long silky coat to the best advantage;
he is decidedly the noblest-looking of the party, especially if a
fine and pure black one, for they are often very ragged,
dun-coloured, sorry beasts. He seems rather out of place, neither
guarding nor keeping the party together, but he knows that neither
yaks, sheep, nor goats, require his attention; all are perfectly
tame, so he takes his share of work as salt-carrier by day, and
watches by night as well. The children bring up the rear, laughing
and chatting together; they, too, have their loads, even to the
youngest that can walk alone.</p>

<p>The last village of the Limboos, Taptiatok, is large, and
occupies a remarkable amphitheatre, apparently a lake-bed, in the
course of the Tambur. After proceeding some way through a narrow
gorge, along which the river foamed and roared, the sudden opening
out of this broad, oval expanse, more than a mile long, was very
striking: the mountains rose bare and steep, the west flank
terminating in shivered masses of rock, while that on the right was
more undulating, dry, and grassy: the surface was a flat
gravel-bed, through which meandered the rippling stream, fringed
with alder. It was a beautiful spot, the clear, cool, murmuring
river, with its rapids and shallows, forcibly reminding me of
trout-streams in the highlands of Scotland.</p>

<p>Beyond Taptiatok we again crossed the river, and</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 205">[ 205 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">ascended over dry, grassy, or rocky spurs to
Lelyp, the first Bhoteea village; it stands on a hill fully 1000
feet above the river, and commands a splendid view up the Yalloong
and Kambachen valleys, which open immediately to the east, and
appear as stupendous chasms in the mountains leading to the
perpetual snows of Kinchin-junga. There were about fifty houses in
the village, of wood and thatch, neatly fenced in with wattle, the
ground between being carefully cultivated with radishes, buckwheat,
wheat, and millet. I was surprised to find in one enclosure a fine
healthy plant of <i>Opuntia,</i> in flower, at this latitude and
elevation. A Lama, who is the head man of the place, came out to
greet us, with his family and a whole troop of villagers; they were
the same class of people as I have elsewhere described as
Cis-nivean Tibetans, or Bhoteeas; none had ever before seen an
Englishman, and I fear they formed no flattering opinion from the
specimen now presented to them, as they seemed infinitely amused at
my appearance, and one jolly dame clapped her hands to her sides,
and laughed at my spectacles, till the hills echoed.</p>

<p><i>El&aelig;agnus</i> was common here, with <i>Edgeworthia
Gardneri,</i>* a beautiful shrub, with globes of waxy,
cowslip-coloured, deliciously scented flowers; also a wild apple,
which bears a small austere fruit, like the Siberian crab. In the
bed of the river rice was still cultivated by Limboos, and
subtropical plants continued. I saw, too, a chameleon and a
porcupine, indicating much warmth, and seeming quite foreign to the
heart of these stupendous mountains. From 6000 to 7000 feet, plants
of the temperate regions blend with the tropical; such as
rhododendron, oak, ivy,</p>

<p class="fnote">* A plant allied to <i>Daphne,</i> from whose bark
the Nepal paper is manufactured. It was named after the eminent
Indian botanist, brother of the late Miss Edgeworth.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 206">[ 206 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">geranium, berberry, clematis, and shrubby <i>
Vaccinia,</i> which all made their appearance at Loongtoong,
another Bhoteea village. Here, too, I first saw a praying machine,
turned by water; it was enclosed in a little wooden house, and
consisted of an upright cylinder containing a prayer, and with the
words, &ldquo;Om mani padmi om,&rdquo; (Hail to him of the Lotus
and Jewel) painted on the circumference: it was placed over a
stream, and made to rotate on its axis by a spindle which passed
through the floor of the building into the water, and was
terminated by a wheel.</p>

<p>Above this the road followed the west bank of the river; the
latter was a furious torrent, flowing through a gorge, fringed with
a sombre vegetation, damp, and dripping with moisture, and covered
with long <i>Usnea</i> and pendulous mosses. The road was very
rocky and difficult, sometimes leading along bluff faces of cliffs
by wooden steps and single rotten planks. At 8000 feet I met with
pines, whose trunks I had seen strewing the river for some miles
lower down: the first that occurred was <i>Abies Brunoniana,</i> a
beautiful species, which forms a stately blunt pyramid, with
branches spreading like the cedar, but not so stiff, and drooping
gracefully on all sides. It is unknown on the outer ranges of
Sikkim, and in the interior occupies a belt about 1000 feet lower
than the silver fir (<i>A. Webbiana</i>). Many sub-alpine plants
occur here, as <i>Lecesteria, Thalictrum,</i> rose, thistles,
alder, birch, ferns, bcrberry, holly, anemone, strawberry,
raspberry, <i>Gnaphalium,</i> the alpine bamboo, and oaks. The
scenery is as grand as any pictured by Salvator Rosa; a river
roaring in sheets of foam, sombre woods, crags of gneiss, and tier
upon tier of lofty mountains flanked and crested with groves of
black firs, terminating in snow-sprinkled rocky peaks.</p>

<p>I now found the temperature getting rapidly cooler,</p>

<p class="first">both that of the air, which here at 8,066 feet
fell to 32&deg; in the night, and that of the river, which was
always below 40&deg;. It was in these narrow valleys only, that I
observed the return cold current rushing down the river-courses
during the nights, which were usually brilliant and very cold, with
copious dew: so powerful, indeed, was the radiation, that the upper
blanket of my bed became coated with moisture, from the rapid
abstraction of heat by the frozen tarpaulin of my tent.</p>

<p>The rivers here are often fringed by flats of shingle, on which
grow magnificent yews and pines; some of the latter were from 120
to 150 feet high, and had been blown down, owing to their scanty
hold on the soil. I measured one, <i>Abies Brunoniana,</i> twenty
feet in girth. Many alpine rhododendrons occur at 9000 feet, with
<i>Astragalis</i> and creeping Tamarisk. Three miles below
Wallanchoon the river forks, being met by the Yangma from the
north-east; they are impetuous torrents of about equal volume; the
Tambur especially (here called the Walloong) is often broken into
cascades, and cuts a deep gorge-like channel.</p>

<p>I arrived at the village of Wallanchoon on the 23rd of November.
It is elevated 10,385 feet, and situated in a fine open part of the
Tambur valley, differing from any part lower down in all its
natural features; being broad, with a rapid but not turbulent
stream, very grassy, and both the base and sides of the flanking
mountains covered with luxuriant dense bushes of rhododendron,
rose, berberry and juniper. Red-legged crows, hawks, wild pigeons,
and finches, abounded. There was but little snow on the mountains
around, which are bare and craggy above, but sloping below. Bleak
and forbidding as the situation of any Himalayan village at 10,000
feet elevation must be, that of Wallanchoon is rendered the more so
from the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 210">[ 210 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">comparatively few trees; for though the silver fir
and juniper are both abundant higher up the valley, they have been
felled here for building materials, fuel, and export to Tibet. From
the naked limbs and tall gaunt black trunks of those that remain,
stringy masses of bleached lichen (<i>Usnea</i>) many feet long,
stream in the wind. Both men and women seemed fond of decorating
their hair with wreaths of this lichen, which they dye yellow with
leaves of <i>Symplocos.</i></p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 211">[ 211 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">The village is very large, and occupies a flat on
the east bank of the river, covered with huge boulders: the ascent
to it is extremely steep, probably over an ancient moraine, though
I did not recognise it as such at the time. Cresting this, the
valley at once opens, and I was almost startled with the sudden
change from a gloomy gorge to a broad flat and a populous village
of large and good painted wooden houses, ornamented with hundreds
of long poles and vertical flags, looking like the fleet of some
foreign port; while a swarm of good-natured, intolerably dirty
Tibetans, were kotowing to me as I advanced.</p>

<p>The houses crept up the base of the mountain, on the flank of
which was a very large, long convent; two-storied, and painted
scarlet, with a low black roof, and backed by a grove of dark
junipers; while the hill-sides around were thickly studded with
bushes of deep green rhododendron, scarlet berberry, and withered
yellow rose. The village contained about one hundred houses,
irregularly crowded together, from twenty to forty feet high, and
forty to eighty feet long; each accommodating several families. All
were built of upright strong pine-planks, the interstices of which
were filled with yak-dung; and they sometimes rest on a low
foundation wall: the door was generally at the gable end; it opened
with a latch and string; and turned on a wooden pivot; the only
window was a slit closed by a shutter; and the roofs were very
low-pitched, covered with shingles kept down by stones. The paths
were narrow and filthy; and the only public buildings besides the
convents were Manis and Mendongs; of these the former are
square-roofed temples, containing rows of praying-cylinders placed
close together, from four to six feet high, and gaudily painted;
some are turned by hand, and others by water: the latter are walls
ornamented with slabs of clay and mica slate,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 212">[ 212 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">with &ldquo;Om Mani Padmi om&rdquo; well carved on
them in two characters, and repeated <i>ad infinitum.</i></p>

<p>A Tibetan household is very slovenly; the family live
higgledy-piggledy in two or more apartments, the largest of which
has an open fire on the earth, or on a stone if the floor be of
wood. The pots and tea-pot are earthen and copper; and these, with
the bamboo churn for the brick tea, some wooden and metal spoons,
bowls, and platters, comprise all the kitchen utensils.</p>

<p>Every one carries in the breast of his robe a little wooden cup
for daily use; neatly turned from the knotted roots of maple (see
<a href="chap5.html#page 133">p. 133</a>). The Tibetan chiefly
consumes barley, wheat, or buckwheat meal&mdash;the latter is
confined to the poorer classes&mdash;with milk, butter, curd, and
parched wheat; fowls, eggs, pork, and yak flesh when he can afford
it, and radishes, a few potatos, legumes, and turnips in their
short season. His drink is a sort of soup made from brick tea, of
which a handful of leaves is churned up with salt, butter, and
soda, then boiled and transferred to the tea-pot, whence it is
poured scalding hot into each cup, which the good woman of the
house keeps incessantly replenishing, and urging you to drain.
Sometimes, but more rarely, the Tibetans make a drink by pouring
boiling water over malt, as the Lepchas do over millet. A pipe of
yellow mild Chinese tobacco generally follows the meal; more often,
however, their tobacco is brought from the plains of India, when it
is of a very inferior description. The pipe carried in the girdle,
is of brass or iron, often with an agate, amber, or bamboo
mouth-piece.</p>

<p>Many herds of fine yaks were grazing about Wallanchoon: there
were a few ponies, sheep, goats, fowls, and pigs, but very little
cultivation except turnips, radishes, and potatos. The yak is a
very tame, domestic animal, often handsome,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 213">[ 213 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and a true bison in appearance; it is invaluable
to these mountaineers from its strength and hardiness,
accomplishing, at a slow pace, twenty miles a day, bearing either
two bags of salt or rice, or four to six planks of pinewood slung
in pairs along either flank. Their ears are generally pierced, and
ornamented with a tuft of scarlet worsted; they have large and
beautiful eyes, spreading horns, long silky black hair, and grand
bushy tails: black is their prevailing colour, but red, dun,
parti-coloured, and white are common. In winter, the flocks graze
below 8000 feet, on account of the great quantity of snow above
that height; in summer they find pasturage as high as 17,000 feet,
consisting of grass and small tufted <i>Carices,</i> on which they
browse with avidity.</p>

<p>The zobo, or cross between the yak and hill cow (much resembling
the English cow), is but rarely seen in these mountains, though
common in the North West Himalaya. The yak is used as a beast of
burden; and much of the wealth of the people consists in its rich
milk and curd, eaten either fresh or dried, or powdered into a kind
of meal. The hair is spun into ropes, and woven into a covering for
their tents, which is quite pervious to wind and rain;* from the
same material are made the gauze shades for the eyes used in
crossing snowy passes. The bushy tail forms the well-known
&ldquo;chowry&rdquo; or fly-flapper of the plains of India; the
bones and dung serve for fuel. The female drops one calf in April;
and the young yaks are very full of gambols, tearing up and down
the steep grassy and rocky slopes: their flesh is delicious, much
richer and more juicy than common veal; that of the old yak is
sliced and dried in the sun, forming jerked meat, which is eaten
raw, the scanty proportion of fat preventing</p>

<p class="fnote">* The latter is, however, of little consequence in
the dry climate of Tibet.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 214">[ 214 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">its becoming very rancid, so that I found it
palatable food: it is called <i>schat-tcheu</i> (dried meat). I
never observed the yak to be annoyed by any insects; indeed at the
elevation it inhabits, there are no large diptera, bots, or
gadflies to infest it. It loves steep places, delighting to
scramble among rocks, and to sun its black hide perched on the
glacial boulders which strew the Wallanchoon flat, and on which
these beasts always sleep. Their average value is from two to three
pounds, but the price varies with the season. In autumn, when her
calf is killed for food, the mother will yield no milk, unless the
herdsman gives it the calf's foot to lick, or lays a stuffed skin
before it, to fondle, which it does with eagerness, expressing its
satisfaction by short grunts, exactly like those of a pig, a sound
which replaces the low uttered by ordinary cattle. The yak, though
indifferent to ice and snow and to changes of temperature, cannot
endure hunger so long as the sheep, nor pick its way so well upon
stony ground. Neither can it bear damp heat, for which reason it
will not live in summer below 7000 feet, where liver disease
carries it off after a very few years.* Lastly, the yak is ridden,
especially by the fat Lamas, who find its shaggy coat warm, and its
paces easy; under these circumstances it is always led. The wild
yak or bison (D'hong) of central Asia, the superb progenitor of
this animal, is the largest native animal of Tibet,</p>

<p class="fnote">* Nevertheless, the yak seems to have survived the
voyage to England. I find in Turner's &ldquo;Tibet&rdquo; (p. 189),
that a bull sent by that traveller to Mr. Hastings, reached England
alive, and after suffering from languor, so far recovered its
health and vigour as to become the father of many calves. Turner
does not state by what mother these calves were born, an important
omission, as he adds that all these died but one cow, which bore a
calf by an Indian bull. A painting of the yak (copied into Turner's
book) by Stubbs, the animal painter, may be seen in the Museum of
the Royal College of Surgeons, London. The artist is probably a
little indebted to description for the appearance of its hair in a
native state, for it is represented much too even in length, and
reaching to too uniform a depth from the flanks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">in various parts of which country it is found; and
the Tibetans say, in reference to its size, that the liver is a
load for a tame yak. The Sikkim Dewan gave Dr. Campbell and myself
an animated account of the chase of this animal, which is hunted by
large dogs, and shot with a blunderbuss: it is untameable and
horridly fierce, falling upon you with horns and chest, and if he
rasps you with his tongue, it is so rough as to scrape the flesh
from the bones. The horn is used as a drinking-cup in marriage
feasts, and on other grand occasions. My readers are probably
familiar with Messrs. Huc and Gabet's account of a herd of these
animals being frozen fast in the head-waters of the Yangtsekiang
river. There is a noble specimen in the British Museum not yet set
up, and another is preparing for exhibition in the Crystal Palace
at Sydenham.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of these frontier districts belong to two very
different tribes, but all are alike called Bhoteeas (from Bhote,
the proper name of Tibet), and have for many centuries been located
in what is&mdash;in climate and natural features&mdash;a neutral
ground between dry Tibet Proper, and the wet Himalayan gorges. They
inhabit a climate too cold for either the Lepcha or Nepalese,
migrating between 6000 and 15,000 feet with the seasons, always
accompanied by their herds. In all respects of appearance,
religion, manners, customs, and language, they are Tibetans and
Lama Booddhists, but they pay tax to the Nepal and Sikkim Rajahs,
to whom they render immense service by keeping up and facilitating
the trade in salt, wool, musk, etc., which could hardly be
conducted without their co-operation. They levy a small tax on all
imports, and trade a little on their own account, but are generally
poor and very indolent. In their alpine summer quarters they grow
scanty crops of wheat, barley, turnips, and radishes; and</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 216">[ 216 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">at their winter quarters, as at Loongtoong, the
better classes cultivate fine crops of buck-wheat, millet, spinach,
etc.; though seldom enough for their support, as in spring they are
obliged to buy rice from the inhabitants of the lower regions.
Equally dependent on Nepal and Tibet, they very naturally hold
themselves independent of both; and I found that my roving
commission from the Nepal Rajah was not respected, and the guard of
Ghorkas held very cheap.</p>

<p>On my arrival at Wallanchoon, I was conducted to two tents, each
about eight feet long, of yak's hair, striped blue and white, which
had been pitched close to the village for my accommodation. Though
the best that could be provided, and larger than my own, they were
wretched in the extreme, being of so loose a texture that the wind
blew through them: each was formed of two cloths with a long slit
between them, that ran across the top, giving egress to the smoke,
and ingress to the weather: they were supported on two short poles,
kept to the ground by large stones, and fastened by yak's hair
ropes. A fire was smoking vigorously in the centre of one, and some
planks were laid at the end for my bed. A crowd of people soon came
to stare and loll out their tongues at me, my party, and travelling
equipage; though very civil, and only offensive in smell, they were
troublesome, from their eager curiosity to see and handle
everything; so that I had to place a circle of stones round the
tents, whilst a soldier stood by, on the alert to keep them off. A
more idle people are not to be found, except with regard to
spinning, which is their constant occupation, every man and woman
carrying a bundle of wool in the breast of their garments, which is
spun by hand with a spindle, and wound off on two cross-pieces at
its lower end. Spinning, smoking, and tea-drinking are their chief
pursuits; and the women take</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 217">[ 217 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">all the active duties of the dairy and house. They
live very happily together, fighting being almost unknown.</p>

<p>Soon after my arrival I was waited on by the Guobah (or
head-man), a tall, good-looking person, dressed in a purple woollen
robe, with good pearl and coral ear and finger-rings, and a broad
ivory ring over the left thumb,* as a guard when using the bow; he
wore a neat thick white felt cap, with the border turned up, and a
silk tassel on the top; this he removed with both hands and held
before him, bowing three times on entering. He was followed by a
crowd, some of whom were his own people, and brought a present of a
kid, fowls, rice, and eggs, and some spikenard roots
(<i>Nardostachys Jatamansi,</i> a species of valerian smelling
strongly of patchouli), which is a very favourite perfume. After
paying some compliments, he showed me round the village. During my
walk, I found that I had a good many objections to overrule before
I could proceed to the Wallanchoon pass, nearly two days' journey
to the northward. In the first place, the Guobah disputed the Nepal
rajah's authority to pass me through his dominions; and besides the
natural jealousy of these people when intruded upon, they have very
good reasons for concealing the amount of revenue they raise from
their position, and for keeping up the delusion that they alone can
endure the excessive climate of these regions, or undergo the
hardships and toil of the salt trade. My passport said nothing
about the passes; my people, and especially the Ghorkas, detested
the keen, cold, and cutting wind; at Mywa Guola, I had been
persuaded by the Havildar to put off providing snow-boots and
blankets, on the assurance that I should easily get them at
Walloong, which I now</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 218">[ 218 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">found all but impossible, owing to there being no
bazaar. My provisions were running short, and for the same reason I
had no present hope of replenishing them. All my party had, I
found, reckoned with certainty that I should have had enough of
this elevation and weather by the time I reached Walloong. Some of
them fell sick; the Guobah swore that the passes were full of snow,
and had been impracticable since October; and the Ghorka Havildar
respectfully deposed that he had no orders relative to the pass.
Prompt measures were requisite, so I told all my people that I
should stop the next day at Walloong, and proceed on the following
on a three days' journey to the pass, with or without the Guobah's
permission. To the Ghorka soldiers I said that the present they
would receive, and the character they would take to their
commandant, depended on their carrying out this point, which had
been fully explained before starting. My servants I told that their
pay and reward also depended on their implicit obedience. I took
the Guobah aside and showed him troops of yaks (tethered by halters
and toggles to a long rope stretched between two rocks), which had
that morning arrived laden with salt from the north; I told him it
was vain to try and deceive me; that my passport was ample, and
that I should expect a guide, provisions, and snow-boots the next
day; and that every impediment and every facility should be
reported to the rajah.</p>

<p>During my two days' stay at Walloong, the weather was bitterly
cold: as heretofore, the nights and mornings were cloudless, but by
noon the whole sky became murky, the highest temperature (50&deg;)
occurring at 10 a.m. At this season the prospect from this
elevation (10,385 feet), was dreary in the extreme; and the
quantity of snow on the mountains, which was continually
increasing, held out a</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 219">[ 219 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">dismal promise for my chance of exploring lofty
uninhabited regions. All annual and deciduous vegetation had long
past, and the lofty Himalayas are very poor in mosses and lichens,
as compared with the European Alps, and arctic regions in general.
The temperature fluctuated from 22&deg; at sunrise, to 50&deg; at
10 a.m.; the mean being 35&deg;;* one night it fell to 64&deg;.
Throughout the day, a south wind blew strong and cold up the
valley, and at sunset was replaced by a keen north blast, searching
every corner, and piercing through tent and blankets. Though the
sun's rays were hot for an hour or two in the morning, its genial
influence was never felt in the wind. The air was never very dry,
the wet-bulb thermometer standing during the day 3&middot;75&deg;
below the dry, thus giving a mean dew-point of 30&middot;25&deg;. A
thermometer sunk two feet stood at 44&deg;, fully 9&deg; above the
mean temperature of the air; one exposed to the clear sky, stood,
during the day, several degrees below the air in shade, and, at
night, from 9&deg; to 14&middot;75&deg; lower. The black-bulb
thermometer, in the sun, rose to 65&middot;75&deg; above the air,
indicating upwards of 90&deg; difference at nearly the warmest part
of the day, between contiguous shaded and sunny exposures. The sky,
when cloudless, was generally a cold blue or steel-grey colour, but
at night the stars were large, and twinkled gloriously. The
black-glass photometer indicated 10&middot;521 inches&dagger; as
the maximum intensity of sunlight; the temperature of the river
close by fell to 32&deg; during the night, and rose to 37&deg; in
the day. In my tent, the temperature</p>

<p class="fnote">* This gives 1&deg; Fahr. for every 309 feet of

&dagger; On three mornings the maxima occurred at between 9 and 10
a.m. They were, Nov. 24th, 10&middot;509, Nov. 25th, 10&middot;521.
On the 25th, at Tuquoroma, I recorded 10&middot;510. The maximum
effect observed at Dorjiling (7,340 feet) was 10&middot;328, and on
the plains of India 10&middot;350. The maximum I ever recorded was
in Yangma valley (15,186 feet), 10&middot;572 at 1 p.m.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 220">[ 220 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">fluctuated with the state of the fire, from
26&deg; at night to 58&deg; when the sun beat on it; but the only
choice was between cold and suffocating smoke.</p>

<p>After a good many conferences with the Guobah, some bullying,
douce violence, persuasions, and the prescribing of pills, prayers,
and charms in the shape of warm water, for the sick of the village,
whereby I gained some favour, I was, on the 25th Nov., grudgingly
prepared for the trip to Wallanchoon, with a guide, and some
snow-boots for those of my party whom I took with me.</p>

<p>The path lay north-west up the valley, which became thickly
wooded with silver-fir and juniper; we gradually ascended, crossing
many streams from lateral gulleys, and huge masses of boulders.
Evergreen rhododendrons soon replaced the firs, growing in
inconceivable profusion, especially on the slopes facing the south:
east, and with no other shrubs or tree-vegetation, but scattered
bushes of rose, <i>Spir&aelig;a,</i> dwarf juniper, stunted birch,
willow, honey-suckle, berberry, and a mountain-ash (<i>Pyrus</i>).
What surprised me more than the prevalence of rhododendron bushes,
was the number of species of this genus, easily recognised by the
shape of their capsules, the form and woolly covering of the
leaves; none were in flower, but I reaped a rich harvest of seed.
At 12,000 feet the valley was wild, open, and broad, with sloping
mountains clothed for 1000 feet with dark-green rhododendron
bushes; the river ran rapidly, and was broken into falls here and
there. Huge angular and detached masses of rock were scattered
about, and to the right and left snowy peaks towered over the
surrounding mountains, while amongst the latter narrow gulleys led
up to blue patches of glacial ice, with trickling streams and
shoots of stones. Dwarf rhododendrons with strongly-scented leaves
(<i>R. anthopogon</i> and <i>setosum</i>), and</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 221">[ 221 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">abundance of a little <i>Andromeda,</i> exactly
like ling, with woody stems and tufted branches, gave a heathery
appearance to the hill-sides. The prevalence of lichens, common to
this country and to Scotland (especially <i>L. geographicus</i>),
which coloured the rocks, added an additional feature to the
resemblance to Scotch Highland scenery. Along the narrow path I
found the two commonest of all British weeds, a grass (<i>Poa
annua</i>), and the shepherd's purse! They had evidently been
imported by man and yaks, and as they do not occur in India, I
could not but regard these little wanderers from the north with the
deepest interest.</p>

<p>Such incidents as these give rise to trains of reflection in the
mind of the naturalist traveller; and the farther he may be from
home and friends, the more wild and desolate the country he is
exploring, the greater the difficulties and dangers under which he
encounters these subjects of his earliest studies in science; so
much keener is the delight with which he recognises them, and the
more lasting is the impression which they leave. At this moment
these common weeds more vividly recall to me that wild scene than
does all my journal, and remind me how I went on my way, taxing my
memory for all it ever knew of the geographical distribution of the
shepherd's purse, and musing on the probability of the plant having
found its way thither over all Central Asia, and the ages that may
have been occupied in its march.</p>

<p>On reaching 13,000 feet, the ground was everywhere hard and
frozen, and I experienced the first symptoms of lassitude,
headache, and giddiness; which however, were but slight, and only
came on with severe exertion.</p>

<p>We encountered a group of Tibetans, encamped to leeward of an
immense boulder of gneiss, against which they had raised a shelter
with their salt-bags, removed from their</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 222">[ 222 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">herd of yaks, which were grazing close by. They
looked miserably cold and haggard, and their little upturned eyes,
much inflamed and bloodshot, testified to the hardships they had
endured in their march from the salt regions: they were crouched
round a small fire of juniper wood, smoking iron pipes with agate
mouthpieces. A resting-house was in sight across the stream&mdash;a
loose stone hut, to which we repaired. I wondered why these
Tibetans had not taken possession of it, not being aware of the
value they attach to a rock, on account of the great warmth which
it imbibes from the sun's rays during the day, and retains at
night. This invaluable property of otherwise inhospitable gneiss
and granite I had afterwards many opportunities of proving; and
when driven for a night's shelter to such as rude nature might
afford on the bleak mountain, I have had my blankets laid beneath
&ldquo;the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The name of Dhamersala is applied, in the mountains as in the
plains of India, to a house provided for the accommodation of
travellers, whether it be one of the beautiful caravanserais built
to gratify the piety, ostentation, or benevolence of a rajah, or
such a miserable shieling of rough stone and plank as that of
Tuquoroma, in which we took up our quarters, at 13,000 feet
elevation. A cheerful fire soon blazed on the earthen floor,
filling the room with the pungent odour of juniper, which made our
eyes smart and water. The Ghorkas withdrew to one corner, and my
Lepchas to a second, while one end was screened off for my couch;
unluckily, the wall faced the north-east, and in that direction
there was a gulley in the snowy mountains, down which the wind
swept with violence, penetrating to my bed. I had calculated upon a
good night's rest here, which I much needed, having been worried
and unwell at Wallanchoon, owing to the Guobah's obstinacy. I had
not</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 223">[ 223 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">then learnt how to treat such conduct, and just
before retiring to rest had further been informed by the Havildar
that the Guobah declared we should find no food on our return. To
remain in these mountains without a supply was impossible, and the
delay, of sending to Mywa Guola would not have answered; so I long
lay awake, occupied in arranging measures. The night was clear and
very cold; the thermometer falling to 19&deg; at 9 p.m., and to
12&deg; in the night, and that by my bedside to 20&deg;.</p>

<p>On the following morning (Nov. 26th) I started with a small
party to visit the pass, continuing up the broad, grassy valley;
much snow lay on the ground at 13,500 feet, which had fallen the
previous month; and several glaciers were seen in lateral ravines
at about the same elevation. After a couple of miles, we left the
broad valley, which continued north-west, and struck northward up a
narrow, stony, and steep gorge, crossing an immense ancient moraine
at its mouth. This path, which we followed for seven or eight
miles, led up to the pass, winding considerably, and keeping along
the south-east exposures, which, being the most sunny, are the
freest from snow. The morning was splendid, the atmosphere over the
dry rocks and earth, at 14,000 feet, vibrating from the power of
the sun's rays, whilst vast masses of blue glacier and fields of
snow choked every galley, and were spread over all shady places.
Although, owing to the steepness and narrowness of the gorge, no
view was obtained, the scenery was wild and very grand. Just below
where perpetual snow descends to the path, an ugly carved head of a
demon, with blood-stained cheeks and goggle-eyes, was placed in a
niche of rock, and protected by a glass.</p>

<p>At 15,000 feet, the snow closed in on the path from all sides,
whether perpetual, glacial, or only the October fall,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 224">[ 224 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">I could not tell; the guide declared it to be
perpetual henceforward, though now deepened by the very heavy
October fall; the path was cut some three feet through it. Enormous
boulders of gneiss cumbered the bottom of the gorge, which
gradually widened as we approached its summit; and rugged masses of
black and red gneiss and mica schist pierced the snow, and stood
out in dismal relief. For four miles continuously we proceeded over
snow; which was much honey-combed on the surface, and treacherous
from the icy streams it covered, into which we every now and then
stumbled; there was scarcely a trace of vegetation, and the cold
was excessive, except in the sun.</p>

<p>Towards the summit of the pass the snow lay very deep, and we
followed the course of a small stream which cut through it, the
walls of snow being breast-high on each side; the path was still
frequented by yaks, of which we overtook a small party going to
Tibet, laden with planks. All the party appeared alike overcome by
lassitude, shortness and difficulty of breathing, a sense of weight
on the stomach, giddiness and headache, with tightness across the
temples.</p>

<p>Just below the summit was a complete bay of snow, girdled with
two sharp peaks of red baked schists and gneiss, strangely
contorted, and thrown up at all angles with no prevalent dip or
strike, and permeated with veins of granite. The top itself, or
boundary between Nepal and Tibet, is a low saddle between two
rugged ridges of rock, with a cairn built on it, adorned with bits
of stick and rag covered with Tibetan inscriptions. The view into
Tibet was not at all distant, and was entirely of snowy mountains,
piled ridge over ridge; three of these spurs must, it is said, be
crossed before any descent can be made to the Chomachoo river (as
the Arun is called in Tibet), on which is the frontier fort of the
Tibetans, and</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 225">[ 225 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">which is reached in two or three days. There is no
plain or level ground of any kind before reaching that river, of
which the valley is said to be wide and flat.</p>

<p>Starting at 10 a.m., we did not reach the top till 3.30 p.m.; we
had halted nowhere, but the last few miles had been most laborious,
and the three of us who gained the summit were utterly knocked up.
Fortunately I carried my own barometer; it indicated 16&middot;206
inches, giving by comparative observations with Calcutta 16,764
feet, and with Dorjiling, 16,748 feet, as the height of the pass.
The thermometer stood at 18&deg;, and the sun being now hidden
behind rocks, the south-east wind was bitterly cold. Hitherto the
sun had appeared as a clearly defined sparkling globe, against a
dark-blue sky; but the depth of the azure blue was not so striking
as I had been led to suppose, by the accounts of previous
travellers, in very lofty regions. The plants gathered near the top
of the pass were species of <i>Composit&aelig;,</i> grass, and <i>
Arenaria</i>; the most curious was <i>Saussurea gossypina,</i>
which forms great clubs of the softest white wool, six inches to a
foot high, its flowers and leaves seeming uniformly clothed with
the warmest fur that nature can devise. Generally speaking, the
alpine plants of the Himalaya are quite unprovided with any special
protection of this kind; it is the prevalence and conspicuous
nature of the exceptions that mislead, and induce the careless
observer to generalise hastily from solitary instances; for the
prevailing alpine genera of the Himalaya, <i>Arenarias,</i>
primroses, saxifrages, fumitories, <i>Ranunculi,</i> gentians,
grasses, sedges, etc., have almost uniformly naked foliage.</p>

<p>We descended to the foot of the pass in about two hours,
darkness overtaking us by the way; the twilight, however, being
prolonged by the glare of the snow. Fearing the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 226">[ 226 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">distance to Tuquoroma might be too great to permit
of our returning thither the same night; I had had a few things
brought hither during the day, and finding they had arrived, we
encamped under the shelter of some enormous boulders (at 13,500
feet), part of an ancient moraine, which extended some distance
along the bed of the narrow valley. Except an excruciating
headache, I felt no ill effects from my ascent; and after a supper
of tea and biscuit, I slept soundly.</p>

<p>On the following morning the temperature was 28&deg; at 6.30
a.m., and rose to 30&deg; when the sun appeared over the mountains
at 8.15, at which time the black bulb thermometer suddenly mounted
to 112&deg;, upwards of 80&deg; above the temperature of the air.
The sky was brilliantly clear, with a very dry, cold, north wind
blowing down the snowy valley of the pass.</p>
