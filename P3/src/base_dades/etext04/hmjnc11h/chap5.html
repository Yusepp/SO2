<p class="first">The summer, or rainy season of 1848, was passed at
or near Dorjiling, during which period I chiefly occupied myself in
forming collections, and in taking meteorological observations. I
resided at Mr Hodgson&rsquo;s for the greater part of the time, in
consequence of his having given me a hospitable invitation to
consider his house my home. The view from his windows is one quite
unparalleled for the scenery it embraces, commanding confessedly
the grandest known landscape of snowy mountains in the Himalaya,
and hence in the world.* Kinchinjunga (forty-five miles distant) is
the prominent object, rising 21,000 feet above the level of the
observer out of a sea of intervening wooded hills; whilst, on a
line with its snows, the eye descends below the horizon, to a
narrow gulf 7000 feet deep in the mountains, where the Great
Rungeet, white with foam, threads a tropical forest with a silver
line.</p>

<p class="fnote">* For an account of the geography of these
regions, and the relation of the Sikkim Himalaya to Tibet, etc.,

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 123">[ 123 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To the north-west towards Nepal, the snowy peaks
of Kubra and Junnoo (respectively 24,005 feet and 25,312 feet) rise
over the shoulder of Singalelah; whilst eastward the snowy
mountains appear to form an unbroken range, trending north-east to
the great mass of Donkia (23,176 feet) and thence south-east by the
fingered peaks of Tunkola and the silver cone of Chola, (17,320
feet) gradually sinking into the Bhotan mountains at Gipmoochi
(14,509 feet). The most eloquent descriptions I have read fail to
convey to my mind&rsquo;s eye the forms and colours of snowy
mountains, or to my imagination the sensations and impressions that
rivet my attention to these sublime phenomena when they are present
in reality; and I shall not therefore obtrude any attempt of the
kind upon my reader. The latter has probably seen the Swiss Alps,
which, though barely possessing half the sublimity, extent, or
height of the Himalaya, are yet far more beautiful. In either case
he is struck with the precision and sharpness of their outlines,
and still more with the wonderful play of colours on their snowy
flanks, from the glowing hues reflected in orange, gold and ruby,
from clouds illumined by the sinking or rising sun, to the ghastly
pallor that succeeds with twilight, when the red seems to give
place to its complementary colour green. Such dissolving-views
elude all attempts at description, they are far too aerial to be
chained to the memory, and fade from it so fast as to be gazed upon
day after day, with undiminished admiration and pleasure, long
after the mountains themselves have lost their sublimity and
apparent height.</p>

<p>The actual extent of the snowy range seen from Mr.
Hodgson&rsquo;s windows is comprised within an arc of 80&deg; (from
north 30&deg; west to north 50&deg; east), or nearly a quarter</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 124">[ 124 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">of the horizon, along which the perpetual snow
forms an unbroken girdle or crest of frosted silver; and in winter,
when the mountains are covered down to 8000 feet, this white ridge
stretches uninterruptedly for more than 160&deg;. No known view is
to be compared with this in extent, when the proximity and height
of the mountains are considered; for within the 80&deg; above
mentioned more than twelve peaks rise above 20,000 feet, and there
are none below 15,000 feet, while Kinchin is 28,178, and seven
others above 22,000. The nearest perpetual snow is on Nursing, a
beautifully sharp conical peak 19,139 feet high, and thirty-two
miles distant; the most remote mountain seen is Donkia, 23,176 feet
high, and seventy-three miles distant; whilst Kinchin, which forms
the principal mass both for height and bulk, is exactly forty-five
miles distant.</p>

<p>On first viewing this glorious panorama, the impression produced
on the imagination by their prodigious elevation is, that the peaks
tower in the air and pierce the clouds, and such are the terms
generally used in descriptions of similar alpine scenery; but the
observer, if he look again, will find that even the most stupendous
occupy a very low position on the horizon, the top of Kinchin
itself measuring only 4&deg; 31" above the level of the observer!
Donkia again, which is 23,176 feet above the sea, or about 15,700
above Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s, rises only 1&deg; 55" above the horizon;
an angle which is quite inappreciable to the eye, when unaided by
instruments.*</p>

<p>This view may be extended a little by ascending Sinchul, which
rises a thousand feet above the elevation of Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s
house, and is a few miles south-east of</p>

<p class="fnote">* These are the apparent angles which I took from
Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s house (alt. 7300 feet) with an excellent
theodolite, no deduction being made for refraction.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 125">[ 125 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Dorjiling: from its summit Chumulari (23,929 feet)
is seen to the north-east, at eighty-four miles distance, rearing
its head as a great rounded mass over the snowy Chola range, out of
which it appears to rise, although in reality lying forty miles
beyond;&mdash;so deceptive is the perspective of snowy~mountains.
To the north-west again, at upwards of 100 miles distance, a
beautiful group of snowy mountains rises above the black Singalelah
range, the chief being, perhaps, as high as Kinchinjunga, from
which it is fully eighty miles distant to the westward; and between
them no mountain of considerable altitude intervenes; the Nepalese
Himalaya in that direction sinking remarkably towards the Arun
river, which there enters Nepal from Tibet.</p>

<p>The top of Sinchul is a favourite excursion from Dorjiling,
being very easy of access, and the path abounding in rare and
beautiful plants, and passing through magnificent forests of oak,
magnolia, and rhododendron; while the summit, besides embracing
this splendid view of the snowy range over the Dorjiling spur in
the foreground, commands also the plains of India, with the courses
of the Teesta, Mahanuddee, Balasun and Mechi rivers. In the months
of April and May, when the magnolias and rhododendrons are in
blossom, the gorgeous vegetation is, in some respects, not to be
surpassed by anything in the tropics; but the effect is much marred
by the prevailing gloom of the weather. The white-flowered magnolia
(<i>M. excelsa,</i> Wall,) forms a predominant tree at 7000 to 8000
feet; and in 1848 it blossomed so profusely, that the forests on
the broad flanks of Sinchul, and other mountains of that elevation,
appeared as if sprinkled with snow. The purple-flowered kind again
(<i>M. Campbellii</i>) hardly occurs below 8000 feet, and forms an
immense, but very ugly, black-barked, sparingly branched</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 126">[ 126 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">tree, leafless in winter and also during the
flowering season, when it puts forth from the ends of its branches
great rose-purple cup-shaped flowers, whose fleshy petals strew the
ground. On its branches, and on those of oaks and laurels, <i>
Rhododendron Dalhousi&aelig;</i> grows epiphytically, a slender
shrub, bearing from three to six white lemon-scented bells, four
and a half inches long and as many broad, at the end of each
branch. In the same woods the scarlet rhododendron (<i>R.
arboreum</i>) is very scarce, and is outvied by the great <i>R.
argenteum,</i> which grows as a tree forty feet high, with
magnificent leaves twelve to fifteen inches long, deep green,
wrinkled above and silvery below, while the flowers are as large as
those of <i>R. Dalhousi&aelig;,</i> and grow more in a cluster. I
know nothing of the kind that exceeds in beauty the flowering
branch of <i>R. argenteum,</i> with its wide spreading foliage and
glorious mass of flowers. Oaks, laurels, maples, birch, chesnut,
hydrangea, a species of fig (which is found on the very summit),
and three Chinese and Japanese genera, are the principal features
of the forest; the common bushes being <i>Aucuba, Skimmia,</i> and
the curious <i>Helwingia,</i> which bears little clusters of
flowers on the centre of the leaf, like butcher&rsquo;s-broom. In
spring immense broad-leaved arums spring up, with green or
purple-striped hoods, that end in tail-like threads, eighteen
inches long, which lie along the ground; and there are various
kinds of <i>Convallaria, Paris, Begonia,</i> and other beautiful
flowering herbs. Nearly thirty ferns may be gathered on this
excursion, including many of great beauty and rarity, but the
tree-fern does not ascend so high. Grasses are very rare in these
woods, excepting the dwarf bamboo, now cultivated in the open air
in England.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to narrate my different expeditions into</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 127">[ 127 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Sikkim and Nepal from Dorjiling, I shall give a
sketch of the different peoples and races composing the
heterogeneous population of Sikkim and the neighbouring
mountains.</p>

<p>The Lepcha is the aboriginal inhabitant of Sikkim, and the
prominent character in Dorjiling, where he undertakes all sorts of
out-door employment. The race to which he belongs is a very
singular one; markedly Mongolian in features, and a good deal too,
by imitation, in habit; still he differs from his Tibetan
prototype, though not so decidedly as from the Nepalese and
Bhotanese, between whom he is hemmed into a narrow tract of
mountain country, barely 60 miles in breadth. The Lepchas possess a
tradition of the flood, during which a couple escaped to the top of
a mountain (Tendong) near Dorjiling. The earliest traditions which
they have of their history date no further back than some three
hundred years, when they describe themselves as having been
long-haired, half-clad savages. At about that period they were
visited by Tibetans, who introduced Boodh worship, the platting of
their hair into pig-tails, and very many of their own customs.
Their physiognomy is however so Tibetan in its character, that it
cannot be supposed that this was their earliest intercourse with
the trans-nivean races: whether they may have wandered from beyond
the snows before the spread of Boodhism and its civilisation, or
whether they are a cross between the Tamulian of India and the
Tibetan, has not been decided. Their language, though radically
identical with Tibetan, differs from it in many important
particulars. They, or at least some of their tribes, call
themselves Rong, and Arratt, and their country Dijong: they once
possessed a great part of East Nepal, as far west as the Tambur
river, and at a still earlier period they penetrated as far west as
the Arun river.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 128">[ 128 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">An attentive examination of the Lepcha in one
respect entirely contradicts our preconceived notions of a
mountaineer, as he is timid, peaceful, and no brawler; qualities
which are all the more remarkable from contrasting so strongly with
those of his neighbours to the east and west: of whom the Ghorkas
are brave and warlike to a proverb, and the Bhotanese quarrelsome,
cowardly, and cruel. A group of Lepchas is exceedingly picturesque.
They are of short stature&mdash;four feet eight inches to five
feet&mdash;rather broad in the chest, and with muscular arms, but
small hands and slender wrists.* The face is broad, flat, and of
eminently Tartar character, flat-nosed and oblique-eyed, with no
beard, and little moustache; the complexion is sallow, or often a
clear olive; the hair is collected into an immense tail, plaited
flat or round. The lower limbs are powerfully developed, befitting
genuine mountaineers: the feet are small. Though never really
handsome, and very womanish in the cast of countenance, they have
invariably a mild, frank, and even engaging expression, which I
have in vain sought to analyse, and which is perhaps due more to
the absence of anything unpleasing, than to the presence of direct
grace or beauty. In like manner, the girls are often very engaging
to look upon, though without one good feature they are all smiles
and good-nature; and the children are frank, lively, laughing
urchins. The old women are thorough hags. Indolence, when left to
themselves, is their besetting sin; they detest any fixed
employment, and their foulness of person and garments renders them
disagreeable inmates: in this rainy climate they are supportable
out of doors. Though fond of bathing when</p>

<p class="fnote">* I have seldom been able to insert my own wrist
(which is smaller than the average) into the wooden guard which the
Lepcha wears on his left, as a protection against the bow-string:
it is a curved ring of wood with an opening at one side, through
which, by a little stretching, the wrist is inserted.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 129">[ 129 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><img src="images/fig8.jpg" width="256" height="332" alt=
"Lepcha girl and Bhoodist Lama"></center>

<p class="first">they come to a stream in hot weather, and expert,
even admirable swimmers, these people never take to the water for
the purpose of ablution. In disposition they are amiable and
obliging, frank, humorous, and polite, without the servility of the
Hindoos; and their address is free and unrestrained. Their
intercourse with one another and with Europeans is scrupulously
honest; a present is divided equally amongst many, without a
syllable of discontent or grudging look or word: each, on
receiving</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 130">[ 130 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">his share, coming up and giving the donor a
brusque bow and thanks. They have learnt to overcharge already, and
use extortion in dealing, as is the custom with the people of the
plains; but it is clumsily done, and never accompanied with the
grasping air and insufferable whine of the latter. They are
constantly armed with a long, heavy, straight knife,* but never
draw it on one another: family and political feuds are alike
unheard of amongst them.</p>

<p>The Lepcha is in morals far superior to his Tibet and Bhotan
neighbours, polyandry being unknown, and polygamy rare. This is no
doubt greatly due to the conventual system not being carried to
such an excess as in Bhotan, where the ties of relationship even
are disregarded.</p>

<p>Like the New Zealander, Tasmanian, Fuegian, and natives of other
climates, which, though cold, are moist and equable, the
Lepcha&rsquo;s dress is very scanty, and when we are wearing
woollen under-garments and hose, he is content with one cotton
vesture, which is loosely thrown round the body, leaving one or
both arms free; it reaches to the knee, and is gathered round the
waist: its fabric is close, the ground colour white, ornamented
with longitudinal blue stripes, two or three fingers broad,
prettily worked with red and white. When new and clean, this garb
is remarkably handsome and gay, but not showy. In cold weather an
upper garment with loose sleeves is added. A long knife, with a
common wooden handle, hangs by the side, stuck in a sheath; he has
often also a quiver of poisoned arrows and a bamboo&dagger; bow
across his back. On his right wrist is a curious wooden guard for
the</p>

<p class="fnote">* It is called &ldquo;Ban,&rdquo; and serves
equally for plough, toothpick, table-knife, hatchet, hammer, and
sword.<br>
&dagger; The bamboo, of which the quiver is made, is thin and
light: it is brought from Assam, and called Tulda, or Dulwa, by the
Bengalees.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 131">[ 131 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">bowstring; and a little pouch, containing aconite
poison and a few common implements, is suspended to his girdle. A
hat he seldom wears, and when he does, it is often extravagantly
broad and flat-brimmed, with a small hemispherical crown. It is
made of leaves of <i>Scitamine&aelig;,</i> between two thin plates
of bamboo-work, clumsy and heavy; this is generally used in the
rainy weather, while in the dry a conical one is worn, also of
platted slips of bamboo, with broad flakes of talc between the
layers, and a peacock&rsquo;s feather at the side. The umbrella
consists of a large hood, much like the ancient boat called a
coracle, which being placed over the head reaches to the thighs
behind. It is made of platted bamboo, enclosing broad leaves of <i>
Phrynium.</i> A group of Lepchas with these on, running along in
the pelting rain, are very droll figures; they look like snails
with their shells on their backs. All the Lepchas are fond of
ornaments, wearing silver hoops in their ears, necklaces made of
cornelian, amber, and turquoise, brought from Tibet, and pearls and
corals from the south, with curious silver and golden charm-boxes
or amulets attached to their necks or arms. These are of Tibetan
workmanship, and often of great value: they contain little idols,
charms and written prayers, or the bones, hair, or nail-parings of
a Lama: some are of great beauty, and highly ornamented. In these
decorations, and in their hair, they take some pride, the ladies
frequently dressing the latter for the gentlemen: thus one may
often see, the last thing at night, a damsel of discreet port,
demurely go behind a young man, unplait his pig-tail, teaze the
hair, thin it of some of its lively inmates, braid it up for him,
and retire. The women always wear two braided pig-tails, and it is
by this they are most readily distinguished from their
effeminate-looking</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 132">[ 132 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">partners, who wear only one.* When in full dress,
the woman&rsquo;s costume is extremely ornamental and picturesque;
besides the shirt and petticoat she wears a small sleeveless
woollen cloak, of gay pattern, usually covered with crosses, and
fastened in front by a girdle of silver chains. Her neck is loaded
with silver chains, amber necklaces, etc., and her head adorned
with a coronet of scarlet cloth, studded with seed-pearls, jewels,
glass beads, etc. The common dress is a long robe of indi, a cloth
of coarse silk, spun from the cocoon of a large caterpillar that is
found wild at the foot of the hills, and is also cultivated: it
feeds on many different leaves, Sal (<i>Shorea</i>), castor-oil,
etc.</p>

<p>In diet, they are gross feeders;&dagger; rice, however, forming
their chief sustenance; it is grown without irrigation, and
produces a large, flat, coarse grain, which becomes gelatinous, and
often pink, when cooked. Pork is a staple dish: and they also eat
elephant, and all kinds of animal food. When travelling, they live
on whatever they can find, whether animal or vegetable. Fern-tops,
roots of <i>Scitamine&aelig;,</i> and their flower-buds, various
leaves (it is difficult to say what not), and fungi, are chopped
up, fried with a little oil, and eaten. Their cooking is coarse and
dirty. Salt is costly, but prized; pawn (Betel pepper) is never
eaten. Tobacco they are too poor to buy, and too indolent to grow
and cure. Spices, oil, etc. are relished.</p>

<p>They drink out of little wooden cups, turned from knots of
maple, or other woods; these are very curious on several accounts;
they are very pretty, often polished, and mounted with silver. Some
are supposed to be antidotes against</p>

<p class="fnote">* Ermann (Travels in Siberia, ii. p. 204) mentions
the Buraet women as wearing two tails, and fillets with jewels, and
the men as having one queue only.<br>
&dagger; Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s definition of the Lepcha&rsquo;s <i>
Flora cibaria,</i> is, that he eats, or must have eaten, everything
soft enough to chew; for, as he knows whatever is poisonous, he
must have tried all; his knowledge being wholly empirical.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 133">[ 133 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">poison, and hence fetch an enormous price; they
are of a peculiar wood, rarer and paler-coloured. I have paid a
guinea for one such, hardly different from the common sort, which
cost but 4<i>d.</i> or 6<i>d.</i> MM. Huc and Gabet graphically
allude to this circumstance, when wishing to purchase cups at
Lhassa, where their price is higher, as they are all imported from
the Himalaya. The knots from which they are formed, are produced on
the roots of oaks, maples, and other mountain forest trees, by a
parasitical plant, known to botanists, as <i>Balanophora.</i></p>

<p>Their intoxicating drink, which seems more to excite than to
debauch the mind, is partially fermented. Murwa grain (<i>Eleusine
Coracana</i>). Spirits are rather too strong to be relished raw,
and when a glass of wine is given to one of a party, he sips it,
and hands it round to all the rest. A long bamboo flute, with four
or six burnt holes far below the month-hole, is the only musical
instrument I have seen in use among them. When travelling, and the
fatigues of the day are over, the Lepchas will sit for hours
chatting, telling stories, singing in a monotonous tone, or blowing
this flute. I have often listened with real pleasure to the simple
music of this rude instrument; its low and sweet tones are
singularly &AElig;olian, as are the airs usually played, which fall
by octaves: it seems to harmonize with the solitude of their
prim&aelig;val forests, and he must have a dull ear who cannot draw
from it the indication of a contented mind, whether he may relish
its soft musical notes or not. Though always equipped for the
chase, I fancy the Lepcha is no great sportsman; there is little to
be pursued in this region, and he is not driven by necessity to
follow what there is.</p>

<p>Their marriages are contracted in childhood, and the wife
purchased by money, or by service rendered to the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 134">[ 134 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">future father-in-law, the parties being often
united before the woman leaves her parents&rsquo; roof, in cases
where the payment is not forthcoming, and the bridegroom prefers
giving his and his wife&rsquo;s labour to the father for a stated
period in lieu. On the time of service expiring, or the money being
paid up, the marriage is publicly celebrated by feasting and riot.
The females are generally chaste, and the marriage-tie is strictly
kept, its violation being heavily punished by divorce, beating,
slavery, etc. In cases of intermarriage with foreigners, the
children belong to the father&rsquo;s country. All the labours of
the house, the field, and march, devolve on the women and children,
or slaves if they have them.</p>

<p>Small-pox is dreaded, and infected persons often cruelly
shunned: a suspicion of this or of cholera frequently emptying a
village or town in a night. Vaccination has been introduced by Dr.
Pearson, and it is much practised by Dr. Campbell; it being eagerly
sought. Cholera is scarcely known at Dorjiling, and when it has
been imported thither has never spread. Disease is very rare
amongst the Lepchas; and ophthalmic, elephantiasis, and leprosy,
the scourges of hot climates, are rarely known. Goitre prevails,*
though not so conspicuously as amongst. Bhoteeas,</p>

<p class="fnote">* May not the use of the head instead of the
shoulder-strap in carrying loads be a predisposing cause of goitre,
by inducing congestion of the laryngeal vessels? The Lepcha is
certainly far more free from this disease than any of the tribes of
E. Nepal I have mixed with, and he is both more idle and less
addicted to the head-strap as a porter. I have seen it to be almost
universal in some villages of Bhoteeas, where the head-strap alone
is used in carrying in both summer and winter crops; as also
amongst the salt-traders, or rather those families who carry the
salt from the passes to the Nepalese villages, and who very
frequently have no shoulder-straps, but invariably head-bands. I am
far from attributing all goitre, even in the mountains, to this
practice, but I think it is proved, that the disease is most
prevalent in the mountainous regions of both the old and new world,
and that in these the practice of supporting enormous loads by the
cervical muscles is frequent. It is also found in the Himalayan
sheep and goats which accompany the salt-traders, and whose loads
are supported in ascending, by a band passing under the throat.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 135">[ 135 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Bhotanese, and others. Rheumatism is frequent, and
intermittent fevers, with ague; also violent and often fatal
remittents, almost invariably induced by sleeping in the hot
valleys, especially at the beginning and end of the rains. The
European complaints of liver and bowel disease are all but unknown.
Death is regarded with horror. The dead are burnt or buried,
sometimes both; much depending on custom and position. Omens are
sought in the entrails of fowls, etc., and other vestiges of their
savage origin are still preserved, though now gradually
disappearing.</p>

<p>The Lepchas profess no religion, though acknowledging the
existence of good and bad spirits. To the good they pay no heed;
&ldquo;Why should we?&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;the good spirits do
us no harm; the evil spirits, who dwell in every rock, grove, and
mountain, are constantly at mischief, and to them we must pray, for
they hurt us.&rdquo; Every tribe has a priest-doctor; he neither
knows nor attempts to practise the healing art, but is a pure
exorcist; all bodily ailments being deemed the operations of
devils, who are cast out by prayers and invocations. Still they
acknowledge the Lamas to be very holy men, and were the latter only
moderately active, they would soon convert all the Lepchas. Their
priests are called &ldquo;Bijooas&rdquo;: they profess mendicancy,
and seem intermediate between the begging friars of Tibet, whose
dress and attributes they assume, and the exorcists of the
aboriginal Lepchas: they sing, dance (masked and draped like
harlequins), beg, bless, curse, and are merry mountebanks; those
that affect more of the Lama Boodhist carry the &ldquo;Mani,&rdquo;
or revolving praying machine, and wear rosaries and amulets; others
again are all tatters and rags. They are often employed to carry
messages, and to transact little knaveries. The natives stand in
some awe of them, and being besides of a</p>

<p class="first">generous disposition, keep the wallet of the
Bijooa always full.</p>

<p>Such are some of the prominent features of this people, who
inhabit the sub-Himalayas, between the Nepalese and Bhotan
frontiers, at elevations of 3000 to 6000 feet. In their relations
with us, they are conspicuous for their honesty, their power as
carriers and mountaineers, and their skill as woodsmen; for they
build a waterproof house with a thatch of banana leaves in the
lower, or of bamboo in the elevated regions, and equip it with a
table and bedsteads for three persons, in an hour, using no
implement but their heavy knife. Kindness and good humour soon
attach them to your person and service. A gloomy-tempered or morose
master they avoid, an unkind one they flee. If they serve a good
hills-man like themselves, they will follow him with alacrity,
sleep on the cold, bleak mountain exposed to the pitiless rain,
without a murmur, lay down the heavy burden to carry their master
over a stream, or give him a helping hand up a rock or
precipice&mdash;do anything, in short, but encounter a foe, for I
believe the Lepcha to be a veritable coward.* It is well, perhaps,
he is so: for if a race, numerically so weak, were to embroil
itself by resenting the injuries of the warlike Ghorkas, or dark
Bhotanese, the folly would soon lead to destruction.</p>

<p>Before leaving the Lepchas, it may be worth mentioning that the
northern parts of the country, towards the Tibet frontier, are
inhabited by Sikkim Bhoteeas&dagger; (or Kumpas),</p>

<p class="fnote">* Yet, during the Ghorka war, they displayed many
instances of courage: when so hard pressed, however, that there was
little choice of evils.<br>
&dagger; Bhote is the general name for Tibet (not Bhotan), and
Kumpa is a large province, or district, in that country. The
Bhotanese, natives of Bhotan, or of the Dhurma country, are called
Dhurma people, in allusion to their spiritual chief, the Dhurma
Rajah. They are a darker and more powerful race, rude, turbulent,
and Tibetan in language and religion, with the worst features of
those people exaggerated. The various races of Nepal are too
numerous to be alluded to here: they are all described in various
papers by Mr. Hodgson, in the &ldquo;Journal of the Asiatic Society
of Bengal.&rdquo; The Dhurma people are numerous at Dorjiling; they
are often runaways, but invariably prove more industrious settlers
than the Lepchas. In the Himalaya the name Bhotan is unknown
amongst the Tibetans; it signifies literally (according to Mr.
Hodgson) the end of Bhote, or Tibet, being the eastern extreme of
that country. The Lepchas designate Bhotan as Ayeu, or Aieu, as do
often the Bhotanese themselves. Sikkim, again, is called Lhop, or
Lho&rsquo;, by the Lepchas and Bhotanese.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 137">[ 137 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">a mixed race calling themselves Kumpa Rong, or
Kumpa Lepchas; but they are emigrants from Tibet, having come with
the first rajah of Sikkim. These people are more turbulent and
bolder than the Lepchas, and retain much of their Tibetan
character, and even of that of the very province from which they
came; which is north-east of Lhassa, and inhabited by robbers. All
the accounts I have received of it agree with those given by MM.
Huc and Gabet.</p>

<p>Next to the Lepchas, the most numerous tribe in Sikkim is that
of the Limboos (called &ldquo;Chung&rdquo; by the Lepchas); they
abound also in East Nepal, which they once ruled, inhabiting
elevations from 2000 feet to 5000 feet. They are Boodhists, and
though not divided into castes, belong to several tribes. All
consider themselves as the earliest inhabitants of the Tambur
Valley, though they have a tradition of having originally emigrated
from Tibet, which their Tartar countenance confirms. They are more
slender and sinewy than the Lepchas, and neither plait their hair
nor wear ornaments; instead of the ban they use the Nepal curved
knife, called &ldquo;cookree,&rdquo; while for the striped kirtle
of the Lepcha are substituted loose cotton trousers and a tight
jacket; a sash is worn round the middle, and on the head a small
cotton cap. When they ruled over East Nepal, their system was
feudal; and on their uniting against the Nepalese, they were with
difficulty dislodged from their strongholds. They are said to be
equally brave and cruel in battle, putting the old and weak to the
sword,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 138">[ 138 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">carrying the younger to slavery, and killing on
the march such captives as are unable to proceed. Many enlist at
Dorjiling, which the Lepchas never do; and the rajah of Nepal
employs them in his army, where, however, they seldom obtain
promotion, this being reserved for soldiers of Hindoo tribes.
Latterly Jung Bahadur levied a force of 6000 of them, who were
cantoned at Katmandoo, where the cholera breaking out, carried off
some hundreds, causing many families who dreaded conscription to
flock to Dorjiling. Their habits are so similar to those of the
Lepchas, that they constantly intermarry. They mourn, burn, and
bury their dead, raising a mound over the corpse, erecting a
headstone, and surrounding the grave with a little paling of
sticks; they then scatter eggs and pebbles over the ground. In
these offices the Bijooa of the Lepchas is employed, but the Limboo
has also priests of his own, called &ldquo;Phedangbos,&rdquo; who
belong to rather a higher order than the Bijooas. They officiate at
marriages, when a cock is put into the bridegroom&rsquo;s hands,
and a hen into those of the bride; the Phedangbo then cuts off the
birds&rsquo; heads, when the blood is caught on a plantain leaf,
and runs into pools from which omens are drawn. At death, guns are
fired, to announce to the gods the departure of the spirit; of
these there are many, having one supreme head, and to them
offerings and sacrifices are made. They do not believe in
metempsychosis.</p>

<p>The Limboo language is totally different from the Lepcha; with
less of the <i>z</i> in it, and more labials and palatals, hence
more pleasing. Its affinities I do not know; it has no peculiar
written character, the Lepcha or Nagri being used. Dr. Campbell,
from whom I have, derived most of my information respecting these
people, was informed,*</p>

<p class="fnote">* See &ldquo;Dorjiling Guide,&rdquo; p. 89.
Calcutta, 1845.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 139">[ 139 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">on good authority, that they had once a written
language, now lost; and that it was compounded from many others by
a sage of antiquity. The same authority stated that their Lepcha
name &ldquo;Chung&rdquo; is a corruption of that of their place of
residence; possibly the &ldquo;Tsang&rdquo; province of Tibet.</p>

<p>The Moormis are the only other native tribe remaining in any
numbers in Sikkim, except the Tibetans of the loftier mountains
(whom I shall mention at a future period), and the Mechis of the
pestilential Terai, the forests of which they never leave. The
Moormis are a scattered people, respecting whom I have no
information, except from the authority quoted above. They are of
Tibetan origin, and called &ldquo;Nishung,&rdquo; from being
composed of two branches, respectively from the districts of Nimo
and Shung, both on the road between Sikkim and Lhassa. They are now
most frequent in central and eastern Nepal, and are a pastoral and
agricultural people, inhabiting elevations of 4000 to 6000 feet,
and living in stone houses, thatched with grass. They are a large,
powerful, and active race, grave, very plain in features, with
little hair on the face. Both their language and religion are
purely Tibetan.</p>

<p>The Magras, a tribe now confined to Nepal west of the Arun, are
aborigines of Sikkim, whence they were driven by the Lepchas
westward into the country of the Limboos, and by these latter
further west still. They are said to have been savages, and not of
Tibetan origin, and are now converted to Hindooism. A somewhat
mythical account of a wild people still inhabiting the Sikkim
mountains, will be alluded to elsewhere.</p>

<p>It is curious to observe that these mountains do not appear to
have afforded refuge to the Tamulian* aborigines</p>

<p class="fnote">* The Tamulians are the Coles, Dangas, etc., of
the mountains of Central India and the peninsula, who retired to
mountain fastnesses, on the invasion of their country by the
Indo-Germanic conquerors, who are now represented by the
Hindoos.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 140">[ 140 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">of India proper; all the Himalayan tribes of
Sikkim being markedly Mongolian in origin. It does not, however,
follow that they are all of Tibetan extraction; perhaps, indeed,
none but the Moormis are so. The Mechi of the Terai is decidedly
Indo-Chinese, and of the same stock as the savage races of Assam,
the north-east and east frontier of Bengal, Arracan, Burmah, etc.
Both Lepchas and Limboos had, before the introduction of Lama
Boodhism from Tibet, many features in common with the natives of
Arracan, especially in their creed, sacrifices, faith in omens,
worship of many spirits, absence of idols, and of the doctrine of
metempsychosis. Some of their customs, too, are the same; the form
of their houses and of some of their implements, their striped
garments, their constant and, dexterous use of the bamboo for all
utensils, their practice of night-attacks in war, of using poisoned
arrows only in the chase, and that of planting
&ldquo;crow-feet&rdquo; of sharp bamboo stakes along the paths an
enemy is expected to follow. Such are but a few out of many points
of resemblance, most of which struck me when reading Lieutenant
Phayre&rsquo;s account of Arracan,* and when travelling in the
districts of Khasia and Cachar.</p>

<p>The laws affecting the distribution of plants, and the lower
animals, materially influence the migrations of man also; and as
the botany, zoology, and climate of the Malayan and Siamese
peninsula advance far westwards into India, along the foot of the
Himalaya, so do also the varieties of the human race. These
features are most conspicuously displayed in the natives of Assam,
on both sides of the Burrampooter, as far as the great bend of that
river, beyond which they gradually disappear; and none of the</p>

<p class="fnote">* &ldquo;Journal of the Asiatic Society of
Bengal.&rdquo;</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 141">[ 141 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Himalayan tribes east of that point practise the
bloody and brutal rites in war that prevail amongst the Cookies,
Khasias, Garrows, and other Indo-Chinese tribes of the mountain
forests of Assam, Eastern Bengal, and the Malay peninsula.</p>

<p>I have not alluded to that evidence of the extraction of the
Sikkim races, which is to be derived from their languages, and from
which we may hope for a clue to their origin; the subject is at
present under discussion, and involved in much obscurity.</p>

<p>That six or seven different tribes, without any feudal system or
coercive head, with different languages and customs, should dwell
in close proximity and in peace and unity, within the confined
territory of Sikkim, even for a limited period, is an anomaly; the
more especially when it is considered that except for a tincture of
the Boodhist religion among some few of the people, they are all
but savages, as low in the scale of intellect as the New Zealander
or the Tahitian, and beneath those races in ingenuity and skill as
craftsmen. Wars have been waged amongst them, but they were neither
sanguinary nor destructive, and the fact remains no less
remarkable, that at the period of our occupying Dorjiling,
friendship and unanimity existed amongst all these tribes; from the
Tibetan at 14,000 feet, to the Mechi of the plains; under a
sovereign whose temporal power was wholly unsupported by even the
semblance of arms, and whose spiritual supremacy was acknowledged
by very few.</p>
