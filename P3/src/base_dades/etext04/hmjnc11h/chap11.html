<br>
<p class="first">We passed the night a few miles below the great
moraine, in a pine-wood (alt. 11,000 feet) opposite the gorge which
leads to the Kambachen or Nango pass, over the south shoulder of
the mountain of that name: it is situated on a ridge dividing the
Yangma river from that of Kambachen, which latter falls into the
Tambur opposite Lelyp.</p>

<p>The road crosses the Yangma (which is about fifteen feet wide),
and immediately ascends steeply to the south-east, over a rocky
moraine, clothed with a dense thicket of rhododendrons,
mountain-ash, maples, pine, birch, juniper, etc. The ground was
covered with silvery flakes of birch bark, and that of <i>
Rhododendron Hodgsoni,</i> which is as delicate as tissue-paper,
and of a pale flesh-colour. I had never before met with this
species, and was astonished at the beauty of its foliage, which was
of a beautiful bright green, with leaves sixteen inches long.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 251">[ 251 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond the region of trees and large shrubs the alpine
rhododendrons filled the broken surface of the valley, growing with
<i>Potentilla,</i> Honeysuckle, <i>Polygonum,</i> and dwarf
juniper. The peak of Nango seemed to tower over the gorge, rising
behind some black, splintered, rocky cliffs, sprinkled with snow,
narrow defiles opened up through these cliffs to blue glaciers, and
their mouths were invariably closed by beds of shingly moraines,
curving outwards from either, flank in concentric ridges.</p>

<p>Towards the base of the peak, at about 14,000 feet, the scenery
is very grand; a great moraine rises suddenly to the north-west,
under the principal mass of snow and ice, and barren slopes of
gravel descend from it; on either side are rugged precipices; the
ground is bare and stony, with patches of brown grass: and, on
looking back, the valley appears very steep to the first shrubby
vegetation, of dark green rhododendrons, bristling with ugly
stunted pines.</p>

<p>We followed a valley to the south-east, so as to turn the flank
of the peak; the path lying over beds of October snow at 14,000
feet, and over plashy ground, from its melting. Sometimes our way
lay close to the black precipices on our right, under which the
snow was deep; and we dragged ourselves along, grasping every
prominence of the rock with our numbed fingers. Granite appeared in
large veins in the crumpled gneiss at a great elevation, in its
most beautiful and loosely-crystallised form, of pearly white
prisms of felspar, glassy quartz, and milk-white flat plates of
mica, with occasionally large crystals of tourmaline. Garnets were
very frequent in the gneiss near the granite veins. Small rushes,
grasses, and sedges formed the remaining vegetation, amongst which
were the withered stalks of gentians, <i>Sedum, Arenaria,
Silene,</i> and many Composite plants.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 252">[ 252 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At a little below 15,000 feet, we reached enormous flat beds of
snow, which were said to be perpetual, but covered deeply with the
October fall. They were continuous, and like all the snow I saw at
this season, the surface was honeycombed into thin plates, dipping
north at a high angle; the intervening fissures were about six
inches deep. A thick mist here overtook us, and this, with the
great difficulty of picking our way, rendered the ascent very
fatiguing. Being sanguine about obtaining a good view, I found it
almost impossible to keep my temper under the aggravations of pain
in the forehead, lassitude, oppression of breathing, a dense
drizzling fog, a keen cold wind, a slippery footing, where I was
stumbling at every few steps, and icy-cold wet feet, hands, and
eyelids; the latter, odd as it sounds, I found a very disagreeable
accompaniment of continued raw cold wind.</p>

<p>After an hour and a half&rsquo;s toilsome ascent, during which
we made but little progress, we reached the crest, crossing a broad
shelf of snow between two rocky eminences; the ridge was unsnowed a
little way down the east flank; this was, in a great measure, due
to the eastern exposure being the more sunny, to the prevalence of
the warm and melting south-east winds that blow up the deep
Kambachen valley, and to the fact that the great snow-beds on the
west side are drifted accumulations.* The mist cleared</p>

<p class="fnote">* Such enormous beds of snow in depressions, or on
gentle slopes, are generally adopted as indicating the lower limit
of perpetual snow. They are, however, winter accumulations, due
mainly to eddies of wind, of far more snow than can be melted in
the following summer, being hence perennial in the ordinary sense
of the word. They pass into the state of glacier ice, and, obeying
the laws that govern the motions of a viscous fluid, so admirably
elucidated by Forbes (&ldquo;Travels in the Alps&rdquo;), they flow
downwards. A careful examination of those great beds of snow in the
Alps, from whose position the mean lower level of perpetual snow,
in that latitude, is deduced, has convinced me that these are
mainly due to accumulations of this kind, and that the true limit
of perpetual snow, or that point where all that falls melts, is
much higher than it is usually supposed to be.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 253">[ 253 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">off, and I had a partial, though limited, view. To
the north the blue ice-clad peak of Nango was still 2000 feet above
us, its snowy mantle falling in great sweeps and curves into
glacier-bound valleys, over which the ice streamed out of sight,
bounded by black aiguilles of gneiss. The Yangma valley was quite
hidden, but to the eastward the view across the stupendous gorge of
the Kambachen, 5000 feet below, to the waste of snow, ice, and
rock, piled in confusion along the top of the range of Junnoo and
Choonjerma, parallel to this but higher, was very grand indeed:
this we were to cross in two days, and its appearance was such,
that our guide doubted the possibility of our doing it. A third and
fourth mountain mass (unseen) lay beyond this, between us and
Sikkim, divided by valleys as deep as those of Yangma and
Kambachen.</p>

<p>Having hung up my instruments, I ascended a few hundred feet to
some naked rocks, to the northward; they were of much-crumpled and
dislocated gneiss, thrown up at a very high angle, and striking
north-west. Chlorite, schist, and quartz, in thin beds, alternated
with the gneiss, and veins of granite and quartz, were injected
through them.</p>

<p>It fell calm; when the distance to which the voice was carried
was very remarkable; I could distinctly hear every word spoken 300
to 400 yards off, and did not raise my voice when I asked one of
the men to bring me a hammer.</p>

<p>The few plants about were generally small tufted <i>
Arenarias</i> and woolly <i>Composit&aelig;,</i> with a
thick-rooted Umbellifer that spread its short, fleshy leaves and
branches flat on the ground; the root was very aromatic, but wedged
close in the rock. The temperature at 4 p.m. was 23&deg;, and
bitterly</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 254">[ 254 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">cold; the elevation, 15,770 feet; dew-point,
16&deg;. The air was not very dry; saturation-point,
0&middot;670&deg;, whereas at Calcutta it was 0&middot;498&deg; at
the same hour.</p>

<p>The descent was to a broad, open valley, into which the flank of
Nango dipped in tremendous precipices, which reared their heads in
splintered snowy peaks. At their bases were shoots of d&eacute;bris
fully 700 feet high, sloping at a steep angle. Enormous masses of
rock, detached by the action of the frost and ice from the crags,
were scattered over the bottom of the valley; they had been
precipitated from above, and gaining impetus in their descent, bad
been hurled to almost inconceivable distances from the parent
cliff. All were of a very white, fine-grained crystallised granite,
full of small veins of the same rock still more finely
crystallised. The weathered surface of each block was black, and
covered with moss and lichens; the others beautifully white, with
clean, sharp-fractured edges. The material of which they were
composed was so hard that I found it difficult to detach a
specimen.</p>

<p>Darkness had already come on, and the coolies being far behind,
we encamped by the light of the moon, shining through a thin fog,
where we first found dwarf-juniper for fuel, at 13,500 feet. A
little sleet fell during the night, which was tolerably fine, and
not very cold; the minimum thermometer indicating
14&middot;5&deg;.</p>

<p>Having no tent-poles, I had some difficulty in getting my
blankets arranged as a shelter, which was done by making them slant
from the side of a boulder, on the top of which one end was kept by
heavy stones; under this roof I laid my bed, on a mass of
rhododendron and juniper-twigs. The men did the same against other
boulders, and lighting a huge fire opposite the mouth of my
ground-nest, I sat cross-legged on the bed to eat my supper; my
face</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 255">[ 255 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">scorching, and my back freezing. Rice, boiled with
a few ounces of greasy <i>dindon aux truffes</i> was now my daily
dinner, with chili-vinegar and tea, and I used to relish it keenly:
this finished, I smoked a cigar, and wrote up my journal (in short
intervals between warming myself) by the light of the fire; took
observations by means of a dark-lantern; and when all this was
accomplished, I went to roost.</p>

<p><i>December 5.</i>&mdash;On looking out this morning, it was
with a feeling of awe that I gazed at the stupendous ice-crowned
precipices that shot up to the summit of Nango, their flanks
spotted white at the places whence the gigantic masses with which I
was surrounded had fallen; thence my eye wandered down their black
faces to the slope of d&eacute;bris at the bottom, thus tracing the
course which had probably been taken by that rock under whose
shelter I had passed the previous night.</p>

<p>Meepo, the Lepcha sent by the rajah, had snared a couple of
beautiful pheasants, one of which I skinned, and ate for breakfast;
it is a small bird, common above 12,000 feet, but very wild; the
male has two to five spurs on each of its legs, according to its
age; the general colour is greenish, with a broad scarlet patch
surrounding the eye; the Nepalese name is &ldquo;Khalidge.&rdquo;
The crop was distended with juniper berries, of which the flesh
tasted strongly, and it was the very hardest, toughest bird I ever
did eat.</p>

<p>We descended at first through rhododendron and juniper, then
through black silver-fir (<i>Abies Webbiana</i>), and below that,
near the river, we came to the Himalayan larch; a tree quite
unknown, except from a notice in the journals of Mr. Griffith, who
found it in Bhotan. It is a small tree, twenty to forty feet high,
perfectly similar in general characters to a European larch, but
with larger cones,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 256">[ 256 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">which are erect upon the very long, pensile,
whip-like branches; its leaves,&mdash;now red&mdash;were falling,
and covering the rocky ground on which it grew, scattered amongst
other trees. It is called &ldquo;Saar&rdquo; by the Lepchas and
Cis-himalayan Tibetans, and &ldquo;Boarga-sella&rdquo; by the
Nepalese, who say it is found as far west as the heads of the Cosi
river: it does not inhabit Central or West Nepal, nor the
North-west Himalaya. The distribution of the Himalayan pines is
very remarkable. The Deodar has not been seen east of Nepal, nor
the <i>Pinus Gerardiana, Cupressus torulosa,</i> or <i>Juniperus
communis.</i> On the other hand, <i>Podocarpus</i> is confined to
the east of Katmandoo. <i>Abies Brunoniana</i> does not occur west
of the Gogra, nor the larch west of the Cosi, nor funereal cypress
(an introduced plant, however) west of the Teesta (in Sikkim). Of
the twelve* Sikkim and Bhotan <i>Conifer&aelig;</i> (including yew,
junipers, and <i>Podocarpus</i>) eight are common to the North-west
Himalaya (west of Nepal), and four&dagger; are not: of the thirteen
natives of the north-west provinces, again, only five&Dagger; are
not found in Sikkim, and I have given their names below, because
they show how European the absent ones are, either specifically or
in affinity. I have stated that the Deodar is possibly a variety of
the Cedar of Lebanon. This is now a prevalent opinion, which is
strengthened by the fact that so many more Himalayan plants are now
ascertained to be European than had been supposed before they were
compared with European specimens; such are the yew, <i>Juniperus
communis, Berberis vulgaris, Quercus Ballota, Populus alba</i> and
<i>Euphratica,</i> etc.</p>

<p class="fnote">* Juniper, 3; yew, <i>Abies Webbiana,
Brunoniana,</i> and <i>Smithiana</i>: Larch, <i>Pinus excelsa,</i>
and <i>longifolia,</i> and <i>Podocarpus neriifolia.</i><br>
&dagger; Larch, <i>Cupressus funebris, Podocarpus neriifolia, Abies
Brunoniana.</i><br>
&Dagger; A juniper (the European <i>communis</i>), Deodar (possibly
only a variety of the Cedar of Lebanon and of Mount Atlas), <i>
Pinus Gerardiana, P. excelsa,</i> and <i>Crupressus
torulosa.</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 257">[ 257 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">The cones of the Deodar are identical with those
of the Cedar of Lebanon: the Deodar has, generally longer and more
pale bluish leaves and weeping branches,* but these characters seem
to be unusually developed in our gardens; for several gentlemen,
well acquainted with the Deodar at Simla, when asked to point it
out in the Kew Gardens, have indicated the Cedar of Lebanon, and
when shown the Deodar, declare that they never saw that plant in
the Himalaya!</p>

<p>At the bottom of the valley we turned up the stream, and passing
the Tassichooding convents&dagger; and temple, crossed the
river&mdash;which was a furious torrent, about twelve yards
wide&mdash;to the village of Kambachen, on a flat terrace a few
feet above the stream. There were about a dozen houses of wood,
plastered with mud and dung, scattered over a grassy plain of a few
acres, fenced in, as were also a few fields, with stone dykes. The
only cultivation consists of radishes, potatos, and barley: no
wheat is grown, the climate being said to be too cold for it, by
which is probably meant that it is foggy,&mdash;the elevation
(11,380 feet)</p>

<p class="fnote">* Since writing the above, I have seen, in the
magnificent Pinetum at Dropmore, noble cedars, with the length and
hue of leaf, and the pensile branches of the Deodar, and far more
beautiful than that is, and as unlike the common Lebanon Cedar as
possible. When it is considered from how very few wild trees (and
these said to be exactly alike) the many dissimilar varieties of
the <i>C. Libani</i> have been derived; the probability of this,
the Cedar of Algiers, and of the Himalayas (Deodar) being all forms
of one species, is greatly increased. We cannot presume to judge
from the few cedars which still remain, what the habit and
appearance of the tree may have been, when it covered the slopes of
Libanus, and seeing how very variable <i>Conifer&aelig;</i> are in
habit, we may assume that its surviving specimens give us no
information on this head. Should all three prove one, it will
materially enlarge our ideas of the distribution and variation of
species. The botanist will insist that the typical form of cedar is
that which retains its characters best over the greatest area,
namely, the Deodar; in which case the prejudice of the ignorant,
and the preconceived ideas of the naturalist, must yield to the
fact that the old familiar Cedar of Lebanon is an unusual variety
of the Himalayan Deodar.<br>
&dagger; These were built by the Sikkim people, when the eastern
valleys of Nepal belonged to the Sikkim rajah.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 258">[ 258 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">being 2000 feet less than that of Yangma village,
and the temperature therefore 6&deg; to 7&deg; warmer; but of all
the mountain gorges I have ever visited, this is by far the
wildest, grandest, and most gloomy; and that man should hybernate
here is indeed extraordinary, for there is no route up the valley,
and all communication with Lelyp,* two marches down the river, is
cut off in winter, when the houses are buried in snow, and drifts
fifteen feet deep are said to be common. Standing on the little
flat of Kambachen, precipices, with inaccessible patches of pine
wood, appeared to the west, towering over head; while across the
narrow valley wilder and less wooded crags rose in broken ridges to
the glaciers of Nango. Up the valley, the view was cut off by bluff
cliffs; whilst down it, the scene was most remarkable: enormous
black, round-backed moraines, rose, tier above tier, from a flat
lake-bed, apparently hemming in the river between the lofty
precipices on the east flank of the valley. These had all been
deposited at the mouth of a lateral valley, opening just below the
village, and descending from Junnoo, a mountain of 25,312 feet
elevation, and one of the grandest of the Kinchinjunga group, whose
top&mdash;though only five miles distant in a straight
line&mdash;rises 13,932 feet&dagger; above the village. Few facts
show more decidedly the extraordinary steepness and depth of the
Kambachen valley near the village, which, though nearly 11,400 feet
above the sea, lies between two mountains only eight miles apart,
the one 25,312 feet high, the other (Nango), 19,000 feet.</p>

<p>The villagers received us very kindly, and furnished us</p>

<p class="fnote">* Which I passed, on the Tambur, on the 21st Nov.
See <a href="chap9.html#page 204">page 204.</a><br>
&dagger; This is one of the most sudden slopes in this part of the
Himalaya, the angle between the top of Junnoo and Kambachen being
2,786 feet per mile, or 1 in 1&middot;8. The slope from the top of
Mont Blanc to the Chamouni valley is 2,464 feet per mile, or 1 in
2&middot;1. That from Monte Rosa top to Macugnaga greatly exceeds
either.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 259">[ 259 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">with a guide for the Choonjerma pass, leading to
the Yalloong valley, the most easterly in Nepal; but he recommended
our not attempting any part of the ascent till the morrow, as it
was past 1 p.m., and we should find no camping-ground for half the
way up. The villagers gave us the leg of a musk deer, and some red
potatos, about as big as walnuts&mdash;all they could spare from
their winter-stock. With this scanty addition to our stores we
started down the valley, for a few miles alternately along flat
lake-beds and over moraines, till we crossed the stream from the
lateral valley, and ascending a little, camped on its bank, at
11,400 feet elevation.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I botanized amongst the moraines, which were
very numerous, and had been thrown down at right-angles to the main
valley, which latter being here very narrow, and bounded by lofty
precipices, must have stopped the parent glaciers, and effected the
heaping of some of these moraines to at least 1000 feet above the
river. The general features were modifications of those seen in the
Yangma valley, but contracted into a much smaller space.</p>

<p>The moraines were all accumulated in a sort of delta, through
which the lateral river debouched into the Kambachen, and were all
deposited more or less parallel to the course of the lateral
valley, but curving outwards from its mouth. The village-flat, or
terrace, continued level to the first moraine, which had been
thrown down on the upper or north side of the lateral valley, on
whose and curving steep flanks it abutted, and curving outwards
seemed to encircle the village-flat on the south and west; where it
dipped into the river. This was crossed at the height of about 100
feet, by a stony path, leading to the bed of the rapid torrent
flowing through shingle and boulders,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 260">[ 260 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">beyond which was another moraine, 250 feet high,
and parallel to it a third gigantic one.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images/fig26.jpg" width="296" height="235" alt=
"Ancient moraines in the Kambachen Valley"></center>

<p>Ascending the great moraine at a place where it overhung the
main river, I had a good <i>coup-a&rsquo;&oelig;il</i> of the
whole. The view south-east up the glacial valley&mdash;(represented
in the accompanying cut)&mdash;to the snowy peaks south of Junnoo,
was particularly grand, and most interesting from the precision
with which one great distant existing glacier was marked by two
waving parallel lines of lateral moraines, which formed, as it
were, a vast raised gutter, or channel, ascending from perhaps
16,000 feet elevation, till it was hidden behind a spur in the
valley. With a telescope I could descry many similar smaller
glaciers, with huge accumulations of shingle at their terminations;
but this great one was beautifully seen by the naked eye, and
formed a very curious feature in the landscape.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 261">[ 261 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Between the moraines, near my tent, the soil was perfectly
level, and consisted of little lake-beds strewn with gigantic
boulders, and covered with hard turf of grass and sedge, and little
bushes of dwarf rhododendron and prostrate juniper, as trim as if
they had been clipped. Altogether these formed the most picturesque
little nooks it was possible to conceive; and they exhibited the
withered remains of so many kinds of primrose, gentian, anemone,
potentilla, orchis, saxifrage, parnassia, campanula, and
pedicularis, that in summer they must be perfect gardens of wild
flowers. Around each plot of a few acres was the grand
ice-transported girdle of stupendous rocks, many from 50 to 100
feet long, crested with black tabular-branched silver firs, conical
deep green tree-junipers, and feathery larches; whilst amongst the
blocks grew a profusion of round masses of evergreen rhododendron
bushes. Beyond were stupendous frowning cliffs, beneath which the
river roared like thunder; and looking up the glacial valley, the
setting sun was bathing the expanse of snow in the most delicate
changing tints, pink, amber, and gold.</p>

<p>The boulders forming the moraine were so enormous and angular,
that I had great difficulty in ascending it. I saw some pheasants
feeding on the black berries of the juniper, but where the large
rhododendrons grew amongst the rocks I found it impossible to
penetrate. The largest of the moraines is piled to upwards of 1000
feet against the south flank of the lateral valley, and stretched
far up it beyond my camp, which was in a grove of silver firs. A
large flock of sheep and goats, laden with salt, overtook us here
on their route from Wallanchoon to Yalloong. The sheep I observed
to feed on the <i>Rhododendron Thomsoni</i> and <i>
campylocarpum.</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 262">[ 262 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">On the roots of one of the latter species a
parasitical Broom-rape (<i>Orobanche</i>) grew abundantly; and
about the moraines were more mosses, lichens, etc., than I have
elsewhere seen in the loftier Himalaya, encouraged no doubt by the
dampness of this grand mountain gorge, which is so hemmed in that
the sun never reaches it until four or five hours after it has
gilded the overhanging peaks.</p>

<p><i>December 5.</i>&mdash;The morning was bright and clear, and
we left early for the Choonjerma pass. I had hoped the route would
be up the magnificent glacier-girdled valley in which we had
encamped; but it lay up another, considerably south of it, and to
which we crossed, ascending the rocky moraine, in the clefts of
which grew abundance of a common Scotch fern, <i>Cryptogramma
crispa</i>!</p>

<p>The clouds early commenced gathering, and it was curious to
watch their rapid formation in coalescing streaks, which became
first cirrhi, and then stratus, being apparently continually added
to from below by the moisture-bringing southerly wind. Ascending a
lofty spur, 1000 feet above the valley, against which the moraine
was banked, I found it to be a distinct anticlinal axis. The pass,
bearing north-west, and the valley we had descended on the previous
day, rose immediately over the curved strata of quartz, topped by
the glacier-crowned mountain of Nango, with four glaciers
descending from its perpetual snows. The stupendous cliffs on its
flanks, under which I had camped on the previous night, were very
grand, but not more so than those which dipped into the chasm of
the Kambachen below. Looking up the valley of the latter, was
another wilderness of ice full of enormous moraines, round the
bases of which the river wound.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 263">[ 263 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ascending, we reached an open grassy valley, and overtook the
Tibetans who had preceded us, and who had halted here to feed their
sheep. A good-looking girl of the party came to ask me for medicine
for her husband&rsquo;s eyes, which had suffered from
snow-blindness: she brought me a present of snuff, and carried a
little child, stark naked, yet warm from the powerful rays of the
sun, at nearly 14,000 feet elevation, in December! I prescribed for
the man, and gave the mother a bright farthing to hang round the
child&rsquo;s neck, which delighted the party. My watch was only
wondered at; but a little spring measuring-tape that rolled itself
up, struck them dumb, and when I threw it on the ground with the
tape out, the mother shrieked and ran away, while the little savage
howled after her.</p>

<p>Above, the path up the ascent was blocked with snowbeds, and for
several miles we alternately scrambled among rocks and over
slippery slopes, to the top of the first ridge, there being two to
cross. The first consisted of a ridge of rocks running east and
west from a superb sweep of snowy mountains to the north-west,
which presented a chaotic scene of blue glacial ice and white snow,
through which splintered rocks and beetling crags thrust their
black heads. The view into the Kambachen gorge was magnificent,
though it did not reveal the very bottom of the valley and its
moraines: the black precipices of its opposite flank seemed to rise
to the glaciers of Nango, fore-shortened into snow-capped
precipices 5000 feet high, amongst which lay the Kambachen pass,
bearing north-west by north. Lower down the valley, appeared a
broad flat, called Jubla, a halting-place one stage below the
village of Kambachen, on the road to Lelyp on the Tambur: it must
be a remarkable geological as well as natural feature, for it</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">appeared to jut abruptly and quite horizontally
from the black cliffs of the valley.</p>

<p>Looking north, the conical head of Junnoo was just scattering
the mists from its snowy shoulders, and standing forth to view, the
most magnificent spectacle I ever beheld. It was quite close to me,
bearing north-east by east, and subtending an angle of 12&deg; 23,
and is much the steepest and most conical of all the peaks of these
regions. From whichever side it is viewed, it rises 9000 feet above
the general mountain mass of 16,000 feet elevation, towering like a
blunt cone, with a short saddle on one side, that dips in a steep
cliff: it appeared as if uniformly snowed, from its rocks above
20,000 feet (like those of Kinchinjunga) being of white granite,
and not contrasting with the snow. Whether the top is stratified or
not, I cannot tell, but waving parallel lines are very conspicuous
near it, as shown in the accompanying view.*</p>

<p>Looking south as evening drew on, another wonderful spectacle
presented itself, similar to that which I described at Sakkiazung,
but displayed here on an inconceivably grander scale, with all the
effects exaggerated. I saw a sea of mist floating 3000 feet beneath
me, just below the upper level of the black pines; the magnificent
spurs of the snowy range which I had crossed rising out of it in
rugged grandeur as promontories and peninsulas, between which the
misty ocean seemed to finger up like the fiords of Norway,</p>

<p class="fnote">* The appearance of Mont Cervin, from the
Riffelberg, much reminded me of that of Junnoo, from the Choonjerma
pass, the former bearing the same relation to Monte Rosa that the
latter does to Kinchinjunga. Junnoo, though incomparably the more
stupendous mass, not only rising 10,000 feat higher above the sea,
but towering 4000 feet higher above the ridge on which it is
supported, is not nearly so remarkable in outline, so sharp, or so
peaked as is Mount Cervin: it is a very much grander, but far less
picturesque object. The whiteness of the sides of Junnoo adds also
greatly to its apparent altitude; while the strong relief in which
the black cliffs of Mont Cervin protrude through its snowy mantle
greatly diminish both its apparent height and distance.</p>

<p class="first">or the salt-water lochs of the west of Scotland;
whilst islets tailed off from the promontories, rising here and
there out of the deceptive elements. I was so high above this mist,
that it had not the billowy appearance I saw before, but was a calm
unruffled ocean, boundless to the south and west, where the horizon
over-arched it. A little to the north of west I discerned the most
lofty group of mountains in Nepal* (mentioned at <a href=
"chap8.html#page 185">p. 185</a>), beyond Kinchinjurga, which I
believe are on the west flank of the great valley through which the
Arun river enters Nepal from Tibet: they were very distant, and
subtended so small an angle, that I could not measure them with the
sextant and artificial horizon their height, judging from the
quantity of snow, must be prodigious.</p>

<p>From 4 to 5 p.m. the temperature was 24&deg;, with a very cold
wind; the elevation by the barometer was 15,260 feet, and the
dew-point 10.5&deg;, giving the humidity 0&middot;610, and the
amount of vapour 1&middot;09 grains in a cubic foot of air; the
same elements at Calcutta, at the same hour, being thermometer
66&middot;5&deg;, dew-point 60&middot;5&deg;, humidity
0&middot;840, and weight of vapour 5&middot;9 grains.</p>

<p>I waited for an hour, examining the rocks about the pass, till
the coolies should come up, but saw nothing worthy of remark, the
natural history and geology being identical with those of Kambachen
pass: I then bade adieu to the sublime and majestic peak of Junnoo.
Thence we continued at nearly the same level for about four miles,
dipping into the broad head of a snowy valley, and ascending to the
second pass, which lay to the south-east.</p>

<p>On the left I passed a very curious isolated pillar of rock,</p>

<p class="fnote">* Called Tsungau by the Bhoteeas. Junnoo is called
Kumbo~Kurma by the Hill-men of Nepal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">amongst the wild crags to the north-east, whose
bases we skirted: it resembles the Capuchin on the shoulder of Mont
Blanc, as seen from the Jardin. Evening overtook us while still on
the snow near the last ascent. As the sun declined, the snow at our
feet reflected the most exquisitely delicate peach-bloom hue; and
looking west from the top of the pass, the scenery was gorgeous
beyond description, for the sun was just plunging into a sea of
mist, amongst some cirrhi and stratus, all in a blaze of the
ruddiest coppery hue. As it sank, the Nepal, peaks to the right
assumed more definite, darker, and gigantic forms, and floods of
light shot across the misty ocean, bathing the landscape around me
in the most wonderful and indescribable changing tints. As the
luminary was vanishing, the whole horizon glowed like copper run
from a smelting furnace, and when it had quite disappeared, the
little inequalities of the ragged edges of the mist were lighted up
and shone like a row of volcanos in the far distance. I have never
before or since seen anything, which for sublimity, beauty, and
marvellous effects, could compare with what I gazed on that evening
from Choonjerma pass. In some of Turner&rsquo;s pictures I have
recognized similar effects, caught and fixed by a marvellous effort
of genius; such are the fleeting hues over the ice, in his
&ldquo;Whalers,&rdquo; and the ruddy fire in his &ldquo;Wind,
Steam, and Rain,&rdquo; which one almost fears to touch. Dissolving
views give some idea of the magic creation and dispersion of the
effects, but any combination of science and art can no more recall
the scene, than it can the feelings of awe that crept over me,
during the hour I spent in solitude amongst these stupendous
mountains.</p>

<p>The moon guided us on our descent, which was to the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 267">[ 267 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">south, obliquely into the Yalloong valley. I was
very uneasy about the coolies, who were far behind, and some of
them had been frost-bitten in crossing the Kambachen pass. Still I
thought the best thing was to push on, and light large fires at the
first juniper we should reach. The change, on passing from off the
snow to the dark earth and rock, was so bewildering, that I had
great difficulty in picking my way. Suddenly we came on a flat with
a small tarn, whose waters gleamed illusively in the pale
moonlight: the opposite flanks of the valley were so well reflected
on its gloomy surface, that we were at once brought to a
stand-still on its banks: it looked like a chasm, and whether to
jump across it, or go down it, or along it, was the question, so
deceptive was the spectral landscape. Its true nature was, however,
soon discovered, and we proceeded round it, descending. Of course
there was no path, and after some perplexity amongst rocks and
ravines, we reached the upper limit of wood, and halted by some
bleached juniper-trees, which were soon converted into blazing
fires.</p>

<p>I wandered away from my party to listen for the voices of the
men who had lingered behind, about whom I was still more anxious,
from the very great difficulty they would encounter if, as we did,
they should get off the path. The moon was shining clearly in the
black heavens; and its bright light, with the pale glare of the
surrounding snow, obscured the milky way, and all the smaller
stars; whilst the planets appeared to glow with broader orbs than
elsewhere, and the great stars flashed steadily and
periodically.</p>

<p>Deep black chasms seemed to yawn below, and cliffs rose on all
sides, except down the valley, where looking across the Yalloong
river, a steep range of mountains rose, seamed</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 268">[ 268 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">with torrents that were just visible like threads
of silver coursing down broad landslips. It was a dead calm, and
nothing broke the awful silence but the low hoarse murmur of many
torrents, whose mingled voices rose and fell as if with the
pulsations of the atmosphere; the undulations of which appeared
thus to be marked by the ear alone. Sometimes it was the faintest
possible murmur, and then it rose swelling and filling the air with
sound: the effect was that of being raised from the earth&rsquo;s
surface, and again lowered to it; or that of waters advancing and
retiring. In such scenes and with such accompaniments, the mind
wanders from the real to the ideal, the larger and brighter lamps
of heaven lead us to imagine that we have risen from the surface of
our globe and are floating through the regions of space, and that
the ceaseless murmur of the waters is the Music of the Spheres.</p>

<p>Contemplation amid such soothing sounds and impressive scenes is
very seductive, and withal very dangerous, for the temperature was
at freezing-point, my feet and legs were wet through, and it was
well that I was soon roused from my reveries by the monosyllabic
exclamations of my coolies. They were quite knocked up, and came
along grunting, and halting every minute to rest, by supporting
their loads, still hanging to their backs, on their stout staves. I
had still one bottle of brandy left, with which to splice the main
brace. It had been repeatedly begged for in vain, and being no
longer expected, was received with unfeigned joy. Fortunately with
these people a little spirits goes a long way, and I kept half for
future emergencies.</p>

<p>We camped at 13,290 feet, the air was calm and mild to the
feeling, though the temperature fell to 22&middot;75&deg;. On</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the following morning we saw two musk-deer,*
called &ldquo;Kosturah&rdquo; by the mountaineers. The musk, which
hangs in a pouch near the navel of the male, is the well-known
object of traffic with Bengal. This creature ranges between 8000
and 13,000 feet, on the Himalaya, often scenting the air for many
hundred yards. It is a pretty grey animal, the size of a roebuck,
and something resembling it, with coarse fur, short horns, and two
projecting teeth from the upper jaw, said to be used in rooting up
the aromatic herbs from which the Bhoteeas believe that it derives
the odour of musk. This I much doubt, because the animal never
frequents those very lofty regions where the herbs supposed to
provide the scent are found, nor have I ever seen signs of any
having been so rooted up. The <i>Delphinium glaciale</i> smells
strongly and disagreeably of musk, but it is one of the most alpine
plants in the world, growing at an elevation of 17,000 feet, far
above the limits of the Kosturah. The female and young male are
very good eating, much better than any Indian venison I ever
tasted, being sweet and tender. Mr. Hodgson once kept a female
alive, but it was very wild, and continued so as long as I knew it.
Two of my Lepchas gave chase to these animals, and fired many
arrows in vain after them: these people are fond of carrying a bow,
but are very poor shots.</p>

<p>We descended 3000 feet to the deep valley of the Yalloong river
which runs west-by-south to the Tambur, from between Junnoo and
Kubra: the path was very bad, over quartz, granite, and gneiss,
which cut the shoes and feet severely. The bottom of the valley,
which is elevated 10,450 feet, was filled with an immense
accumulation of</p>

<p class="fnote">* There are two species of musk-deer in the
Himalaya, besides the Tibetan kind, which appears identical with
the Siberian animal originally described by Pallas.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 270">[ 270 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">angular gravel and d&eacute;bris of the above
rocks, forming on both sides of the river a terrace 400 feet above
the stream, which flowed in a furious torrent. The path led over
this deposit for a good many miles, and varied exceedingly in
height, in some places being evidently increased by landslips, and
at others apparently by moraines.</p>
