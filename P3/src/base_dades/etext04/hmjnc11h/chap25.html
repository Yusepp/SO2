<br>
<p class="first">We started on the 3rd of November for Tumloong (or
Sikkim Durbar), Dr. Campbell sending Tchebu Lama forward with
letters to announce his approach. A steep ascent, through large
trees of <i>Rhododendron arboreum,</i> led over a sharp spur of
mica-schist (strike north-west and dip north-east), beyond which
the whole bay-like valley of the Ryott opened before us, presenting
one of the most lovely and fertile landscapes in Sikkim. It is ten
miles long, and three or four broad, flanked by lofty mountains,
and its head girt by the beautiful snowy range of Chola, from which
silvery rills descend through black pine-woods, dividing
innumerable converging cultivated spurs, and uniting about 2000
feet below us, in a profound gorge. Everywhere were scattered
houses, purple crops of buckwheat,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 191">[ 191 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">green fields of young wheat, yellow millet, broad
green plantains, and orange groves.</p>

<p>We crossed spur after spur, often under or over precipices about
fifteen hundred feet above the river, proceeding eastwards to the
village of Rangang, whence we caught sight of the Rajah&rsquo;s
house. It was an irregular low stone building of Tibetan
architecture, with slanting walls and small windows high up under
the broad thatched roof, above which, in the middle, was a
Chinese-looking square copper-gilt canopy, with projecting eaves
and bells at the corners, surmounted by a ball and square spire. On
either gable of the roof was a round-topped cylinder of gilded
copper, something like a closed umbrella; this is a very frequent
and characteristic Boodhist ornament, and is represented in
Turner&rsquo;s plate of the mausoleum of Teshoo Lama
(&ldquo;Tibet&rdquo; plate xi.); indeed the Rajah&rsquo;s canopy at
Tumloong is probably a copy of the upper part of the building there
represented, having been built by architects from Teshoo Loombo. It
was surrounded by chaits, mendongs, poles with banners, and other
religious erections; and though beautifully situated on a flat
terrace overlooking the valley, we were much disappointed with its
size and appearance.</p>

<p>On the brow of the hill behind was the large red goompa of the
Tupgain Lama, the late heir-apparent to the temporal and spiritual
authority in Sikkim; and near it a nunnery called Lagong, the lady
abbess of which is a daughter of the Rajah, who, with the
assistance of sisters, keeps an enormous Mani, or praying-cylinder,
revolving perpetually to the prayer of &ldquo;Om Mani Padmi
hom.&rdquo; On this side was a similar spur, on which the gilded
pinnacles and copper canopy of the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 192">[ 192 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Phadong* goompa gleamed through the trees. At a
considerable distance across the head of the valley was still a
third goompa, that of Phenzong.</p>

<p>We were met by a large party of armed Lepchas, dressed in blue
and white striped kirtles, broad loose scarlet jackets; and the
little bamboo wattle hat lined with talc, and surmounted by a
peacock&rsquo;s feather; they escorted us to the village, and then
retired.</p>

<p>We encamped a few hundred feet below the Rajah&rsquo;s house,
and close by those of Meepo and the Tchebu Lama&rsquo;s family, who
are among the oldest and most respectable of Tibetan origin in
Sikkim. The population on this, the north side of the Ryott,
consists principally of Sikkim Bhoteeas and Tibetans, while the
opposite is peopled by Lepchas. Crowds came to see us, and many
brought presents, with which we were overwhelmed; but we could not
help remarking that our cordial greetings were wholly from the
older families attached to the Rajah, and from the Lamas; none
proceeded from the Dewan&rsquo;s relatives or friends, nor
therefore any in the name of the Rajah himself, or of the Sikkim
government.</p>

<p>Tchebu Lama vainly used every endeavour to procure for us an
audience with his highness; who was surrounded by his councillors,
or Amlah, all of whom were adherents of the Dewan, who was in
Tibet. My man Meepo, and the Tchebu Lama; who were ordered to
continue in official attendance upon us, shrugged their shoulders,
but could suggest no remedy. On the following morning Campbell was
visited by many parties, amongst whom were the Lama&rsquo;s family,
and that of the late Dewan (Ilam Sing), who implored us to send
again to announce</p>

<p class="fnote">* Phadong means Royal, and this temple answers to
a chapel royal for the Rajah.</p>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">our presence, and not to dismiss at once the
moonshie and his office,* who had accompanied us for the purpose of
a conference with the Rajah. Their wishes were complied with, and
we waited till noon before proceeding.</p>

<br>

<p>A gay and animated scene was produced by the concourse of women,
dressed in their pretty striped and crossed cloaks, who brought
tokens of good-will. Amongst them Meepo&rsquo;s wife appeared
conspicuous from the large</p>

<p class="fnote">* It is usual in India for Government officers
when about to transact business, to travel with a staff (called
office) of native interpreters, clerks, etc., of whom the chief is
commonly called moonchie.</p>

<p class="first">necklaces* and amulets, corals, and silver
filagree work, with which her neck and shoulders were loaded: she
wore on her head a red tiara (&ldquo;Patuk&rdquo;) bedizened with
seed pearls and large turquoises, and a gold fillet of filagree
bosses united by a web of slender chains; her long tails were
elaborately plaited, and woven with beads, and her cloak hooked in
front by a chain of broad silver links studded with turquoises.
White silk scarfs, the emblem of peace and friendship, were thrown
over our hands by each party; and rice, eggs, fowls, kids, goats,
and Murwa beer, poured in apace, to the great delight of our
servants.</p>

<p>We returned two visits of ceremony, one to Meepo&rsquo;s house,
a poor cottage, to which we carried presents of chintz dresses for
his two little girls, who were busy teazing their hair with
cylindrical combs, formed of a single slender joint of bamboo slit
all round half-way up into innumerable teeth. Our other visit was
paid to the Lama&rsquo;s family, who inhabited a large house not
far from the Rajah&rsquo;s. The lower story was an area enclosed by
stone walls, into which the cattle, etc., were driven. An outside
stone stair led to the upper story, where we were received by the
head of the family, accompanied by a great concourse of Lamas. He
conducted us to a beautiful little oratory at one end of the
building, fitted up like a square temple, and lighted with latticed
windows, covered with brilliant and tasteful paintings by Lhassan
artists. The beams of the ceiling were supported by octagonal
columns painted red, with broad capitals. Everywhere the lotus, the
mani, and the chirki (or wheel with three rays, emblematic of the
Boodhist Trinity), were introduced; &ldquo;Om Mani Padmi hom&rdquo;
in gilt letters, adorned the</p>

&ldquo;Poshea&rdquo;) were larger than the fist: they are procured
in East Tibet, probably from Birmah.</p>

<p class="first">projecting end of every beam;* and the Chinese
&ldquo;cloud messenger,&rdquo; or winged dragon, floated in azure
and gold along the capitals and beams, amongst scrolls and groups
of flowers. At one end was a sitting figure of Gorucknath in Lama
robes, surrounded by a glory, with mitre and beads; the right hand
holding the Dorje, and the forefinger raised in prayer. Around was
a good library of books. More presents were brought here, and tea
served.</p>

<p>The route to Chola pass, which crosses the range of that name
south of the Chola peak (17,320 feet) at the head of this valley,
is across the Ryott, and then eastwards along a</p>

<p class="fnote">* A mythical animal with a dog&rsquo;s head and
blood-red spot over the forehead was not uncommon in this chapel,
and is also seen in the Sikkim temples and throughout Tibet.
Ermann, in his Siberian Travels, mentions it as occurring in the
Khampa Lama&rsquo;s temple at Maimao chin; he conjectures it to
have been the Cyclops of the Greeks, which according to the Homeric
myth had a mark on the forehead, instead of an eye. The glory
surrounding the heads of Tibetan deities is also alluded to by
Ermann, who recognises in it the Nimbus of the ancients, used to
protect the heads of statues from the weather, and from being
soiled by birds; and adds that the glory of the ancient masters in
painting was no doubt introduced into the Byzantine school from the
Boodhists.</p>

<p class="first">lofty ridge. Campbell started at noon, and I
waited behind with Meepo, who wished me to see the Rajah&rsquo;s
dwelling, to which we therefore ascended; but, to my guide&rsquo;s
chagrin, we were met and turned back by a scribe, or clerk, of the
Amlah. We were followed by a messenger, apologising and begging me
to return; but I had already descended 1000 feet, and felt no
inclination to reascend the hill, especially as there did not
appear to be anything worth seeing. Soon after I had overtaken
Campbell, he was accosted by an excessively dirty fellow, who
desired him to return for a conference with the Amlah; this was of
course declined, but, at the same time, Campbell expressed his
readiness to receive the Amlah at our halting place.</p>

<p>The Ryott flows in a very tropical gorge 2000 feet above the
sea; from the proximity of the snowy mountains, its temperature was
only 64&middot;3&deg;. Thence the ascent is very steep to Rungpo,
where we took up our quarters at a rest house at an height of 6008
feet. This road is well kept, and hence onwards is traversed yearly
by the Rajah on his way to his summer residence of Choombi, two
marches beyond the Cbola pass; whither he is taken to avoid the
Sikkim rains, which are peculiarly disagreeable to Tibetans. Rungpo
commands a most beautiful view northwards, across the valley, of
the royal residence, temples, goompas, hamlets, and cultivation,
scattered over spurs that emerge from the forest, studded below
with tree-ferns and plantains, and backed by black pine-woods and
snowy mountains. In the evening the Amlah arrived to confer with
Campbell; at first there was a proposal of turning us out of the
house, in which there was plenty of room besides, but as we
declined to move, except by his Highness&rsquo;s order, they put up
in houses close by.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 197">[ 197 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the following morning they met us as we were departing for
Chola pass, bringing large presents in the name of the Rajah, and
excuses on their and his part for having paid us no respect at
Tumloong, saying, that it was not the custom to receive strangers
till after they had rested a day, that they were busy preparing a
suitable reception, etc.; this was all false, and contrary to
etiquette, but there was no use in telling them so. Campbell spoke
firmly and kindly to them, and pointed out their incivility and the
unfriendly tone of their whole conduct. They then desired Campbell
to wait and discuss business affairs with them; this was out of the
question, and he assured them that he was ever ready to do so with
the Rajah, that he was now (as he had informed his Highness) on his
way with me to the Chola and Yakla passes, and that we had, for
want of coolies, left some loads behind us, which, if they were
really friendly, they would forward. This they did, and so we
parted; they (contrary to expectation) making no objection to
Campbell&rsquo;s proceeding with me.</p>

<p>A long march up a very steep, narrow ridge took us by a good
road to Laghep, a stone resting-house (alt. 10,475 feet) on a very
narrow flat. I had abundance of occupation in gathering
rhododendron-seeds, of which I procured twenty-four kinds* on this
and the following day.</p>

<p>A very remarkable plant, which I had seen in flower in the
Lachen valley, called &ldquo;Loodoo-ma&rdquo; by the Bhoteeas, and
&ldquo;Nomorchi&rdquo; by Lepchas, grew on the ridge at 7000</p>

<p class="fnote">* These occurred in the following order in
ascending, commencing at 6000 feet.&mdash;1. <i>R.
Dalhousi&aelig;</i>; 2. <i>R. vaccinioides</i>; 3. <i>R.
camelli&aelig;florwm</i>; 4. <i>R. arboreum.</i> Above 8000
feet:&mdash;5. <i>R. argenteum</i>; 6. <i>R. Falconeri</i>; 7. <i>
R. barbatum</i>; 8. <i>R. Campbelli&aelig;</i>; 9. <i>R.
Edgeworthii</i>; 10. <i>R. niveum</i>; 11. <i>R. Thomsoni</i>; 12.
<i>R. cinnabarinum</i>; 13. <i>R. glaucum.</i> Above 10,500
feet:&mdash;14. <i>R. lanatum</i>; 15. <i>R. virgatum</i>; 16. <i>
R. campylocarpum</i>; 17. <i>R. ciliatum</i>; 18. <i>R.
Hodgsoni</i>; 19. <i>R. campanulatum.</i> Above 12,000
feet:&mdash;20. <i>R. lepidotum</i>; 21. <i>R. fulgens</i>; 22. <i>
R. Wightianum</i>; 23. <i>R. anthopogon</i>; 24. <i>R.
setosum.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">feet; it bears a yellow fruit like short
cucumbers, full of a soft, sweet, milky pulp, and large black
seeds; it belongs to a new genus,* allied to <i>Stauntonia,</i> of
which two Himalayan kinds produce similar, but less agreeable
edible fruits (&ldquo;Kole-pot,&rdquo; Lepcha). At Laghep, iris was
abundant, and a small bushy berberry (<i>B. concinna</i>) with oval
eatable berries. The north wall of the house (which was in a very
exposed spot) was quite bare, while the south was completely
clothed with moss and weeds.</p>

<p>The rocks above Laghep were gneiss; below it, mica-schist,
striking north-west, and dipping north-east, at a high angle. A
beautiful yellow poppy-like plant grew in clefts at 10,000 feet; it
has flowered in England, from seeds which I sent home, and bears
the name of <i>Cathcartia.</i>&dagger;</p>

<p>We continued, on the following morning, in an easterly
direction, up the same narrow steep ridge, to a lofty eminence
called Phieung-goong (alt. 12,422 feet), from being covered with
the Phieung, or small bamboo. <i>Abies Webbiana</i> begins here,
and continues onwards, but, as on Tonglo, Mainom, and the other
outer wetter Sikkim ranges, there is neither larch, <i>Pinus
excelsa, Abies Smithiana,</i> or <i>A. Brunoniana.</i></p>

<p class="fnote">* This genus, for which Dr. Thomson and I, in our
&ldquo;Flora Indies,&rdquo; have proposed the name <i>Decaisnea</i>
(in honour of my friend Professor J. Decaisne, the eminent French
botanist), has several straight, stick-like, erect branches from
the root, which bear spreading pinnated leaves, two feet long,
standing out horizontally. The flowers are uni-sexual, green, and
in racemes, and the fruits, of which two or three grow together,
are about four inches long, and one in diameter. All the other
plants of the natural order to which it belongs, are climbers.<br>
&dagger; See &ldquo;Botanical Magazine,&rdquo; for 1852. The name
was given in honour of the memory of my friend, the late J. F.
Cathcart, Esq., of the Bengal Civil Service. This gentleman was
devoted to the pursuit of botany, and caused a magnificent series
of drawings of Dorjiling plants to be made by native artists during
his residence there. This collection is now deposited at Kew,
through the liberality of his family, and it is proposed to publish
a selection from the plates, as a tribute to his memory. Mr.
Cathcart, after the expiration of his Indian service, returned to
Europe, and died at Lausanne on his way to England.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 199">[ 199 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hence we followed an oblique descent of 1,500 feet, to the bed
of the Rutto river, through thick woods of pines and <i>
Rhododendron Hodgsoni,</i> which latter, on our again ascending,
was succeeded by the various alpine kinds. We halted at Barfonchen
(alt. 11,233 feet), a stone-but in the silver-fir forest. Some yaks
were grazing in the vicinity, and from their herdsman we learnt
that the Dewan was at Choombi, on the road to Yakla; he had kept
wholly out of the way during the summer, directing every unfriendly
action to be pursued towards myself and the government by the
Amlah, consisting of his brothers and relatives, whom he left at
Tumloong.</p>

<p>The night was brilliant and starlight: the minimum thermometer
fell to 27&deg;, a strong north-east wind blew down the valley, and
there was a thick hoar-frost, with which the black yaks were drolly
powdered. The broad leaves of <i>R. Hodgsoni</i> were curled, from
the expansion of the frozen fluid in the layer of cells on the
upper surface of the leaf, which is exposed to the greatest cold of
radiation. The sun restores them a little, but as winter advances,
they become irrecoverably cured, and droop at the ends of the
branches.</p>

<p>We left Barfonchen on the 7th November, and ascended the river,
near which we put up a woodcock. Emerging from the woods at
Chumanako (alt. 12,590 feet), where there is another stone hut, the
mountains become bleak, bare, and stony, and the rocks are all
moutonn&eacute;ed by ancient glaciers. At 13,000 feet the ground
was covered with ice, and all the streams were frozen. Crossing
several rocky ledges, behind which were small lakes, a gradual
ascent led to the summit of the Chola pass, a broad low depression,
14,925 feet above the sea, wholly bare of snow.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 200">[ 200 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Campbell had preceded me, and I found him conversing with some
Tibetans, who told him that there was no road hence to Yakla, and
that we should not be permitted to go to Choombi. As the Chinese
guard was posted in the neighbourhood, he accompanied one of the
Tibetans to see the commandant, whilst I remained taking
observations. The temperature was 33&deg;, with a violent, biting,
dry east wind. The rocks were gneiss, striking north-east, and
horizontal, or dipping north-west. The scanty vegetation consisted
chiefly of grass and <i>Sibbaldia.</i></p>

<p>In about an hour Meepo and some of my people came up and asked
for Campbell, for whom the Tchebu Lama was waiting below: the Lama
had remained at Rungpo, endeavouring to put matters on a better
footing with the Amlah. Wishing to see the Tibet guard myself, I
accompanied the two remaining Tibetans down a steep valley with
cliffs on either hand, for several hundred feet, when I was
overtaken by some Sikkim sepoys in red jackets, who wanted to turn
me back forcibly: I was at a loss to understand their conduct, and
appealed to the Tibetan sepoys, who caused them to desist. About
1000 feet down I found Campbell, with a body of about ninety
Tibetans, a few of whom were armed with matchlocks, and the rest
with bows and arrows. They were commanded by a Dingpun, a short
swarthy man, with a flat-crowned cap with floss-silk hanging all
round, and a green glass button in front; he wore a loose scarlet
jacket, broadly edged with black velvet, and having great brass
buttons of the Indian naval uniform; his subaltern was similarly
dressed, but his buttons were those of the 44th Bengal Infantry.
The commandant having heard of our wish to go round by Choombi,
told Campbell that he had come purposely to inform him that there
was no road that way to</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 201">[ 201 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Yakla; he was very polite, ordering his party to
rise and salute me when I arrived, and doing the same when we both
left.</p>

<p>On our return we were accompanied by the Dingpun of the Tibetans
and a few of his people, and were soon met by more Sikkim sepoys,
who said they were sent from the Durbar, to bring Campbell back to
transact business; they behaved very rudely, and when still half a
mile from the Sikkim frontier, jostled him and feigned to draw
their knives, and one of them pointed a spear-headed bow to his
breast. Campbell defended himself with a stick, and remonstrated
with them on their rudeness; and I, who had nothing but a barometer
in my hand, called up the Tibetans. The Dingpun came instantly, and
driving the Sikkim people forward, escorted us to the frontier,
where he took an inscribed board from the chait, and showing us the
great vermilion seal of the Emperor of China (or more probably of
the Lhassan authorities) on one side, and two small brown ones of
the Sikkim Rajah on the other; and giving us to understand that
here his jurisdiction ceased, he again saluted and left us.</p>

<p>On descending, I was surprised to meet the Singtam Soubah, whom
I had not seen since leaving Tungu; he was seated on a rock, and I
remarked that he looked ashy pale and haggard, and that he salaamed
to me only, and not to Campbell; and that Tchebu Lama, who was with
him, seemed very uncomfortable. The Soubah wanted Campbell to stop
for a conference, which at such a time, and in such a wind, was
impossible, so he followed us to Chumanako, where we proposed to
pass the night.</p>

<p>A great party of Sikkim Bhoteeas had assembled here, all
strangers to me: I certainly thought the concourse unusually large,
and the previous conduct to Campbell,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 202">[ 202 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">strange, rude, and quite unintelligible,
especially before the Tibetans. But the Bhoteeas were always a
queer, and often insolent people,* whom I was long ago tired of
trying to understand, and they might have wanted to show off before
their neighbours; and such was the confidence with which my long
travels amongst them had inspired me, that the possibility of
danger or violence never entered my head.</p>

<p>We went into the hut, and were resting ourselves on a log at one
end of it, when, the evening being very cold, the people crowded
in; on which Campbell went out, saying, that we had better leave
the hut to them, and that he would see the tents pitched. He had
scarcely left, when I heard him calling loudly to me,
&ldquo;Hooker! Hooker! the savages are murdering me!&rdquo; I
rushed to the door, and caught sight of him striking out with his
fists, and struggling violently; being tall and powerful, he had
already prostrated a few, but, a host of men bore him down, and
appeared to be trampling on him; at the same moment I was myself
seized by eight men, who forced me back into the hut, and down on
the log, where they held me in a sitting posture, pressing me
against the wall; here I spent a few moments of agony, as I heard
my friend&rsquo;s stifled cries grow fainter and fainter. I
struggled but little, and that only at first, for at least
five-and-twenty men crowded round and laid their hands upon me,
rendering any effort to move useless; they were, however, neither
angry nor</p>

<p class="fnote">* Captain Pemberton during his mission to Bhotan
was repeatedly treated with the utmost insolence by the officials
in that country (see Griffith&rsquo;s Journal). My Sirdar, Nimbo,
himself a native of Bhotan, saw a good deal of the embassy when
there, and told me many particulars as to the treatment to which it
had been subjected, and the consequent low estimation in which both
the ambassadors themselves and the Government whom they represented
were held in Bhotan.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 203">[ 203 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">violent, and signed to me to keep quiet. I
retained my presence of mind, and felt comfort in remembering that
I saw no knives used by the party who fell on Campbell, and that if
their intentions had been murderous, an arrow would have been the
more sure and less troublesome weapon. It was evident that the
whole animus was directed against Campbell, and though at first
alarmed on my own account, all the inferences which, with the
rapidity of lightning my mind involuntarily drew, were
favourable.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, three persons came into the hut, and seated
themselves opposite to me: I only recognised two of them; namely,
the Singtam Soubah, pale, trembling like a leaf, and with great
drops of sweat trickling from his greasy brow; and the Tchebu Lama,
stolid, but evidently under restraint, and frightened. The former
ordered the men to leave hold of me, and to stand guard on either
side, and, in a violently agitated manner, he endeavoured to
explain that Campbell was a prisoner by the orders of the Rajah,
who was dissatisfied with his conduct as a government officer,
during the past twelve years; and that he was to be taken to the
Durbar and confined till the supreme government at Calcutta should
confirm such articles as he should be compelled to subscribe to; he
also wanted to know from me how Campbell would be likely to behave.
I refused to answer any questions till I should be informed why I
was myself made prisoner; on which he went away, leaving me still
guarded. My own Sirdar then explained that Campbell had been
knocked down, tied hand and foot, and taken to his tent, and that
all his coolies were also bound, our captors claiming them as
Sikkimites, and subjects of the Rajah.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 204">[ 204 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the three returned, the Soubah looking more
spectral than ever, and still more violently agitated, and I
thought I perceived that whatever were his plans, he had failed in
them. He asked me what view the Governor-General would take of this
proceeding? and receiving no answer, he went off with the Tchebu
Lama, and left me with the third individual. The latter looked
steadily at me for some time, and then asked if I did not know him.
I said I did not, when he gave his name as Dingpun Tinli, and I
recognised in him one of the men whom the Dewan had sent to conduct
us to the top of Mainom the previous year (see vol. i. <a href=
"chap13.html#page 305">p. 305</a>). This opened my eyes a good
deal, for he was known to be a right-hand man of the Dewan&rsquo;s,
and had within a few months been convicted of kidnapping two
Brahmin girls from Nepal,* and had vowed vengeance against Campbell
for the duty he performed in bringing him to punishment.</p>

<p>I was soon asked to go to my tent, which I found pitched close
by; they refused me permission to see my fellow-prisoner, or to be
near him, but allowed me to hang up my instruments, and arrange my
collections. My guards were frequently changed during the night,
Lepchas often taking a turn; they repeatedly assured me that there
was no complaint or ill-feeling against me, that the better classes
in Sikkim would be greatly ashamed of the whole affair, that Tchebu
Lama was equally a prisoner, and that the grievances against
Campbell were of a political nature, but what they were they did
not know.</p>

<p class="fnote">* This act as I have mentioned at v. i. <a href=
"chap15.html#page 341">p. 341,</a> was not only a violation of the
British treaty, but an outrage on the religion of Nepal. Jung
Bahadoor demanded instant restitution, which Campbell effected;
thus incurring the Dingpun&rsquo;s wrath, who lost, besides his
prize, a good deal of money which the escapade cost him.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 205">[ 205 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The night was very cold (thermometer 26&deg;), and two inches of
snow fell. I took as many of my party as I could into my tent, they
having no shelter fit for such an elevation (12,590 feet) at this
season. Through the connivance of some of the people, I managed to
correspond with Campbell, who afterwards gave me the following
account of the treatment he had received. He stated that on leaving
the hut, he had been met by Meepo, who told him the Soubah had
ordered his being turned out. A crowd of sepoys then fell on him
and brought him to the ground, knocked him on the head, trampled on
him, and pressed his neck down to his chest as he lay, as if
endeavouring to break it. His feet were tied, and his arms pinioned
behind, the wrist of the right hand being bound to the left arm
above the elbow; the cords were then doubled, and he was violently
shaken. The Singtam Soubah directed all this, which was performed
chiefly by the Dingpun Tinli and Jongpun Sangabadoo.* After this
the Soubah came to me, as I have related; and returning, had
Campbell brought bound before him, and asked him, through Tchebu
Lama, if he would write from dictation. The Soubah was violent,
excited, and nervous; Tchebu Lama scared. Campbell answered, that
if they continued torturing him (which was done by twisting the
cords round his wrists by a bamboo-wrench), he might say or do
anything, but that his government would not confirm any acts thus
extorted. The Soubah became still more violent, shook his bow in
Campbell&rsquo;s face, and drawing his hand significantly across
his throat, repeated his questions, adding others, enquiring why he
had refused to receive the Lassoo Kajee as Vakeel, etc. (see <a
href="chap18.html#page 2">p. 2</a>).</p>

<p class="fnote">* This was the other man sent with us to Mainom,
by the Dewan, in the previous December.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 206">[ 206 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Soubah&rsquo;s people, meanwhile, gradually slunk away,
seeing which he left Campbell, who was taken to his tent.</p>

<p>Early next morning Meepo was sent by the Soubah, to ask whether
I would go to Yakla pass, or return to Dorjiling, and to say that
the Rajah&rsquo;s orders had been very strict that I was not to be
molested, and that I might proceed to whatever passes I wished to
visit, whilst Campbell was to be taken back to the Durbar, to
transact business. I was obliged to call upon the Soubah and
Dingpun to explain their conduct of the previous day, which they
declared arose from no ill-feeling, but simply from their fear of
my interfering in Campbell&rsquo;s behalf; they could not see what
reason I had to complain, so long as I was neither hurt nor bound.
I tried in vain to explain to them that they could not so play fast
and loose with a British subject, and insisted that if they really
considered me free, they should place me with Campbell, under whose
protection I considered myself, he being still the
Governor-General&rsquo;s agent.</p>

<p>Much discussion followed this: Meepo urged me to go on to Yakla,
and leave these bad people; and the Soubah and Dingpun, who had
exceeded their orders in laying hands on me, both wished me away.
My course was, however, clear as to the propriety of keeping as
close to Campbell as I was allowed, so they reluctantly agreed to
take me with him to the Durbar.</p>

<p>Tchebu Lama came to me soon afterwards, looking as stolid as
ever, but with a gulping in his throat; he alone was glad I was
going with them, and implored me to counsel Campbell not to
irritate the Amlah by a refusal to accede to their dictates, in
which case his life might be the forfeit. As to himself, the
opposite faction had now got</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 207">[ 207 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the mastery, there was nothing for it but to
succumb, and his throat would surely be cut. I endeavoured to
comfort him with the assurance that they dared not hurt Campbell,
and that this conduct of a party of ruffians, influenced by the
Dewan and their own private pique, did not represent his
Rajah&rsquo;s feelings and wishes, as he himself knew; but the poor
fellow was utterly unnerved, and shaking hands warmly, with his
eyes full of tears, he took his leave.</p>

<p>We were summoned by the Dingpun to march at 10 a.m.: I demanded
an interview with Campbell first, which was refused; but I felt
myself pretty safe, and insisting upon it, he was brought to me. He
was sadly bruised about the head, arms, and wrists, walked very
lame, and had a black eye to boot, but was looking stout and
confident.</p>

<p>I may here mention that seizing the representative of a
neighbouring power and confining him till he shall have become
amenable to terms, is a common practice along the Tibet, Sikkim,
and Bhotan frontiers. It had been resorted to in 1847, by the
Bhotanese, under the instructions of the Paro Pilo, who waylaid the
Sikkim Rajah when still in Tibet, on his return from Jigatzi, and
beleagured him for two months, endeavouring to bring him to their
terms about some border dispute; on this occasion the Rajah applied
to the British government for assistance, which was refused; and he
was ultimately rescued by a Tibetan force.</p>

<p>In the present case the Dewan issued orders that Campbell was to
be confined at Tumloong till he himself should arrive there; and
the Rajah was kept in ignorance of the affair. The Sepoys who met
us on our approach to Tumloong on the 3rd of November, were, I
suspect, originally sent for the purpose; and I think that the
Amlah</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 208">[ 208 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">also had followed us to Rungpo with the same
object. Their own extreme timidity, and the general good-feeling in
the country towards Campbell prevented its execution before, and,
as a last resource, they selected the Singtam Soubah and Dingpun
Tinli for the office, as being personally hostile to him. The Dewan
meanwhile being in Tibet, and knowing that we were about to visit
the frontier, for which I had full permission and escort, sent up
the Tibetan guard, hoping to embroil them in the affair; in this he
failed, and it drew upon him the anger of the Lhassan authorities.*
The Soubah, in endeavouring to extort the new treaty by force, and
the Dingpun, who had his own revenge to gratify, exceeded their
instructions in using violence towards Campbell, whom the Dewan
ordered should be simply taken and confined; they were consequently
disgraced, long before we were released, and the failure of the
stratagem thrown upon their shoulders.</p>

<p>During the march down to Laghep, Campbell was treated by the
Dingpun&rsquo;s men with great rudeness: I kept</p>

<p class="fnote">* In the following summer (1850), when the Rajah,
Dewan, and Soubah, repaired to Choombi, the Lhassan authorities
sent a Commissioner to inquire into the affair, understanding that
the Dewan had attempted to embroil the Tibetans in it. The
commissioner asked the Rajah why he had committed such an outrage
on the representative of the British government, under whose
protection he was; thus losing his territory, and bringing English
troops so near the Tibet frontier. The Rajah answered that he never
did anything of the kind; that he was old and infirm, and unable to
transact all his affairs; that the mischief had arisen out of the
acts and ignorance of others, and finally begged the Commissioner
to investigate the whole affair, and satisfy himself about it.
During the inquiry that followed, the Dewan threw all the blame on
the Tibetans, who, he said were alone implicated: this assertion
was easily disproved, and on the conclusion of the inquiry the
Commissioner railed vehemently at the Dewan,
saying:&mdash;&ldquo;You tried to put this business on the people
of my country; it is an abominable lie. You did it yourselves, and
no one else. The Company is a great monarchy; you insulted it, and
it has taken its revenge. If you, or any other Tibetan, ever again
cause a rupture with the English, you shall be taken with ropes
round your necks to Pekin, there to undergo the just punishment of
your offence under the sentence of the mighty Emperor.&rdquo;</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 209">[ 209 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">as near as I was allowed, quietly gathering
rhododendron seeds by the way. At the camping-ground we were again
separated, at which I remonstrated with the Dingpun, also
complaining of his people&rsquo;s insolent behaviour towards their
prisoner, which he promised should be discontinued.</p>

<p>The next day we reached Rungpo, where we halted for further
instructions: our tents were placed apart, but we managed to
correspond by stealth. On the 10th of November we were conducted to
Tumloong: a pony was brought for me, but I refused it, on seeing
that Campbell was treated with great indignity, and obliged to
follow at the tail of the mule ridden by the Dingpun, who thus
marched him in triumph up to the village.</p>

<p>I was taken to a house at Phadong, and my fellow traveller was
confined in another at some distance to the eastward, a
stone&rsquo;s throw below the Rajah&rsquo;s; and thrust into a
little cage-like room. I was soon visited by an old Lama, who
assured me that we were both perfectly safe, but that there were
many grievances against Campbell. The Soubah arrived shortly after,
bringing me compliments, nominally in the Rajah&rsquo;s name, and a
substantial present, consisting of a large cow, sheep, fowls, a
brick of tea, bags of rice, flour, butter, eggs, and a profusion of
vegetables. I refused to take them on the friendly terms on which
they were brought, and only accepted them as provisions during my
detention. I remonstrated again about our separation, and warned
the Soubah of the inevitable consequence of this outrage upon the
representative of a friendly power, travelling under the authority
of his own government, unarmed and without escort: he was greatly
perplexed, and assured me that Campbell&rsquo;s detention was only
temporary, because he had not given</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 210">[ 210 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">satisfaction to the Rajah, and as the latter could
not get answers to his demands from Calcutta in less than a month,
it was determined to keep him till then; but to send me to
Dorjiling. He returned in the evening to tell me that
Campbell&rsquo;s men (with the exception only of the Ghorkas*) had
been seized, because they were runaway slaves from Sikkim; but that
I need not alarm myself, for mine should be untouched.</p>

<p>The hut being small, and intolerably dirty, I pitched my tent
close by, and lived in it for seven days: I was not guarded, but so
closely watched, that I could not go out for the most trifling
purpose, except under surveillance. They were evidently afraid of
my escaping; I was however treated with civility, but forbidden to
communicate either with Campbell or with Dorjiling.</p>

<p>The Soubah frequently visited me, always protesting I was no
prisoner, that Campbell&rsquo;s seizure was a very trifling affair,
and the violence employed all a mistake. He always brought
presents, and tried to sound me about the government at Calcutta.
On the 12th he paid his last visit, looking wofully dejected, being
out of favour at court, and dismissed to his home: he referred me
to Meepo for all future communications to the Rajah, and bade me a
most cordial farewell, which I regretted being unable to return
with any show of kind feeling. Poor fellow! he had staked his last,
and lost it, when he undertook to seize the agent of the most
powerful government in the east, and to reduce him to the condition
of a tool of the Dewan. Despite the many obstructions he had placed
in my way, we had not fallen out since July; we had been</p>

<p class="fnote">* These people stood in far greater fear of the
Nepalese than of the English, and the reason is obvious: the former
allow no infraction of their rights to pass unnoticed, whereas we
had permitted every article of our treaty to be contravened.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 211">[ 211 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">constant companions, and though at issue, never at
enmity. I had impeached him, and my grievances had been forwarded
to the Rajah with a demand for his punishment, but he never seemed
to owe me a grudge for that, knowing the Rajah&rsquo;s impotence as
compared with the power of the Dewan whom he served; and, in common
with all his party, presuming on the unwillingness of the British
government to punish.</p>

<p>On the 13th of November I was hurriedly summoned by Meepo to the
Phadong temple, where I was interrogated by the Amlah, as the
Rajah&rsquo;s councillors (in this instance the Dewan&rsquo;s
adherents) are called. I found four China mats placed on a stone
bench, on one of which I was requested to seat myself, the others
being occupied by the Dewan&rsquo;s elder brother, a younger
brother of the Gangtok Kajee (a man of some wealth), and an old
Lama: the conference took place in the open air and amongst an
immense crowd of Lamas, men, women, and children.</p>

<p>I took the initiative (as I made a point of doing on all such
occasions) and demanded proper interpreters, which were refused;
and the Amlah began a rambling interrogatory in Tibetan, through my
Lepcha Sirdar Pakshok, who spoke very little Tibetan or
Hindostanee, and my half-caste servant, who spoke as little
English. The Dewan&rsquo;s brother was very nervously counting his
beads, and never raised his eyes while I kept mine steadily upon
him.</p>

<p>He suggested most of the queries, every one of which took
several minutes, as he was constantly interrupted by the Kajee, who
was very fat and stupid: the Lama scarcely spoke, and the
bystanders never. My connection with the Indian government was
first enquired into; next they came to political matters, upon
which I declined entering; but I</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 212">[ 212 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">gathered that their object was to oblige Campbell
to accept the Lassoo Kajee as Vakeel, to alter the slavery laws, to
draw a new boundary line with Nepal, to institute direct
communication between themselves and the Governor-General,* and to
engage that there should be no trade or communication between
Sikkim and India, except through the Dewan: all of these subjects
related to the terms of the original treaty between the Rajah and
the Indian government. They told me they had sent these proposals
to the government through Dorjiling,&dagger; but had received no
acknowledgment from the latter place, and they wanted to know the
probable result at Calcutta. As the only answer I could give might
irritate them, I again declined giving any. Lastly, they assured me
that no blame was imputed to myself, that on the contrary I had
been travelling under the Rajah&rsquo;s protection, who rejoiced in
my success, that I might have visited Yakla pass as I had intended
doing, but that preferring to accompany my friend, they had allowed
me to do so, and that I might now either join him, or continue to
live in my tent: of course I joyfully accepted the former proposal.
After being refused permission to send a letter to Dorjiling,
except I would write in a character which they could read, I asked
if they had anything more to say, and being answered in the
negative, I was taken by</p>

<p class="fnote">* They were prompted to demand this by an
unfortunate oversight that occurred at Calcutta some years before.
Vakeels from the Sikkim Durbar repaired to that capital, and though
unaccredited by the Governor-General&rsquo;s agent at Dorjiling,
were (in the absence of the Governor-General) received by the
president of the council in open Durbar. The effect was of course
to reduce the Governor-General&rsquo;s agent at Dorjiling to a
cipher.<br>
&dagger; These letters, which concluded with a line stating that
Campbell was detained at Tumloong till favourable answers should be
received, had arrived at Dorjiling; but being written in Tibetan,
and containing matters into which no one but Campbell could enter,
they were laid on one side till his return. The interpreter did not
read the last line, which stated that Dr. Campbell was <i>
detained</i> till answers were received, and the fact of our
capture and imprisonment therefore remained unknown for several
weeks.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 213">[ 213 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Meepo to Campbell, heartily glad to end a parley
which had lasted for an hour and a half.</p>

<p>I found my friend in good health and spirits, strictly guarded
in a small thatched hut, of bamboo wattle and clay: the situation
was pretty, and commanded a view of the Ryott valley and the snowy
mountains; there were some picturesque chaits hard by, and a
blacksmith&rsquo;s forge. Our walks were confined to a few steps in
front of the hut, and included a puddle and a spring of water. We
had one black room with a small window, and a fire in the middle on
a stone; we slept in the narrow apartment behind it, which was the
cage in which Campbell had been at first confined, and which
exactly admitted us both, lying on the floor. Two or three Sepoys
occupied an adjoining room, and had a peep-hole through the
partition-wall.</p>

<p>My gratification at our being placed together was damped by the
seizure of all my faithful attendants except my own servant, and
one who was a Nepalese: the rest were bound, and placed in the
stocks and close confinement, charged with being Sikkim people who
had no authority to take service in Dorjiling. On the contrary they
were all registered as British subjects, and had during my travels
been recognised as such by the Rajah and all his authorities. Three
times the Soubah and others had voluntarily assured me that my
person and people were inviolate; nor was there any cause for this
outrage but the fear of their escaping with news to Dorjiling, and
possibly a feeling of irritation amongst the authorities at the
failure of their schemes. Meanwhile we were not allowed to write,
and we heard that the bag of letters which we had sent before our
capture had been seized and burnt. Campbell greatly feared that
they would threaten</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 214">[ 214 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Dorjiling with a night attack,* as we heard that
the Lassoo Kajee was stationed at Namtchi with a party for that
purpose, and all communication cut off, except through him.</p>

<p class="fnote">* Threats of sacking Dorjiling had on several
previous occasions been made by the Dewan, to the too great alarm
of the inhabitants, who were ignorant of the timid and pacific
disposition of the Lepchas, and of the fact that there are not
fifty muskets in the country, nor twenty men able to use them. On
this occasion the threats were coupled with the report that we were
murdered, and that the Rajah had asked for 50,000 Tibetan soldiers,
who were being marched twenty-five days&rsquo; journey over passes
16,000 feet high, and deep in snow, and were coming to drive the
English out of Sikkim! I need hardly observe that the Tibetans (who
have repeatedly refused to interfere on this side the snows) had no
hand in the matter, or that, supposing they could collect that
number of men in all Tibet, it would be impossible to feed them for
a week, there or in Sikkim. Such reports unfortunately spread a
panic in Dorjiling: the guards were called in from all the
outposts, and the ladies huddled into one house, whilst the males
stood on the defensive; to the great amusement of the Amlah at
Tumloong, whose insolence to us increased proportionally.</p>
