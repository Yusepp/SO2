AGNES GREY<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER I - THE PARSONAGE<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All true histories contain instruction; though, in some, the treasure
may be hard to find, and when found, so trivial in quantity, that the
dry, shrivelled kernel scarcely compensates for the trouble of cracking
the nut.&nbsp; Whether this be the case with my history or not, I am
hardly competent to judge.&nbsp; I sometimes think it might prove useful
to some, and entertaining to others; but the world may judge for itself.&nbsp;
Shielded by my own obscurity, and by the lapse of years, and a few fictitious
names, I do not fear to venture; and will candidly lay before the public
what I would not disclose to the most intimate friend.<br>
<br>
My father was a clergyman of the north of England, who was deservedly
respected by all who knew him; and, in his younger days, lived pretty
comfortably on the joint income of a small incumbency and a snug little
property of his own.&nbsp; My mother, who married him against the wishes
of her friends, was a squire&rsquo;s daughter, and a woman of spirit.&nbsp;
In vain it was represented to her, that if she became the poor parson&rsquo;s
wife, she must relinquish her carriage and her lady&rsquo;s-maid, and
all the luxuries and elegancies of affluence; which to her were little
less than the necessaries of life.&nbsp; A carriage and a lady&rsquo;s-maid
were great conveniences; but, thank heaven, she had feet to carry her,
and hands to minister to her own necessities.&nbsp; An elegant house
and spacious grounds were not to be despised; but she would rather live
in a cottage with Richard Grey than in a palace with any other man in
the world.<br>
<br>
Finding arguments of no avail, her father, at length, told the lovers
they might marry if they pleased; but, in so doing, his daughter would
forfeit every fraction of her fortune.&nbsp; He expected this would
cool the ardour of both; but he was mistaken.&nbsp; My father knew too
well my mother&rsquo;s superior worth not to be sensible that she was
a valuable fortune in herself: and if she would but consent to embellish
his humble hearth he should be happy to take her on any terms; while
she, on her part, would rather labour with her own hands than be divided
from the man she loved, whose happiness it would be her joy to make,
and who was already one with her in heart and soul.&nbsp; So her fortune
went to swell the purse of a wiser sister, who had married a rich nabob;
and she, to the wonder and compassionate regret of all who knew her,
went to bury herself in the homely village parsonage among the hills
of -.&nbsp; And yet, in spite of all this, and in spite of my mother&rsquo;s
high spirit and my father&rsquo;s whims, I believe you might search
all England through, and fail to find a happier couple.<br>
<br>
Of six children, my sister Mary and myself were the only two that survived
the perils of infancy and early childhood.&nbsp; I, being the younger
by five or six years, was always regarded as <i>the</i> child, and the
pet of the family: father, mother, and sister, all combined to spoil
me - not by foolish indulgence, to render me fractious and ungovernable,
but by ceaseless kindness, to make me too helpless and dependent - too
unfit for buffeting with the cares and turmoils of life.<br>
<br>
Mary and I were brought up in the strictest seclusion.&nbsp; My mother,
being at once highly accomplished, well informed, and fond of employment,
took the whole charge of our education on herself, with the exception
of Latin - which my father undertook to teach us - so that we never
even went to school; and, as there was no society in the neighbourhood,
our only intercourse with the world consisted in a stately tea-party,
now and then, with the principal farmers and tradespeople of the vicinity
(just to avoid being stigmatized as too proud to consort with our neighbours),
and an annual visit to our paternal grandfather&rsquo;s; where himself,
our kind grandmamma, a maiden aunt, and two or three elderly ladies
and gentlemen, were the only persons we ever saw.&nbsp; Sometimes our
mother would amuse us with stories and anecdotes of her younger days,
which, while they entertained us amazingly, frequently awoke - in <i>me</i>,
at least - a secret wish to see a little more of the world.<br>
<br>
I thought she must have been very happy: but she never seemed to regret
past times.&nbsp; My father, however, whose temper was neither tranquil
nor cheerful by nature, often unduly vexed himself with thinking of
the sacrifices his dear wife had made for him; and troubled his head
with revolving endless schemes for the augmentation of his little fortune,
for her sake and ours.&nbsp; In vain my mother assured him she was quite
satisfied; and if he would but lay by a little for the children, we
should all have plenty, both for time present and to come: but saving
was not my father&rsquo;s forte.&nbsp; He would not run in debt (at
least, my mother took good care he should not), but while he had money
he must spend it: he liked to see his house comfortable, and his wife
and daughters well clothed, and well attended; and besides, he was charitably
disposed, and liked to give to the poor, according to his means: or,
as some might think, beyond them.<br>
<br>
At length, however, a kind friend suggested to him a means of doubling
his private property at one stroke; and further increasing it, hereafter,
to an untold amount.&nbsp; This friend was a merchant, a man of enterprising
spirit and undoubted talent, who was somewhat straitened in his mercantile
pursuits for want of capital; but generously proposed to give my father
a fair share of his profits, if he would only entrust him with what
he could spare; and he thought he might safely promise that whatever
sum the latter chose to put into his hands, it should bring him in cent.
per cent.&nbsp; The small patrimony was speedily sold, and the whole
of its price was deposited in the hands of the friendly merchant; who
as promptly proceeded to ship his cargo, and prepare for his voyage.<br>
<br>
My father was delighted, so were we all, with our brightening prospects.&nbsp;
For the present, it is true, we were reduced to the narrow income of
the curacy; but my father seemed to think there was no necessity for
scrupulously restricting our expenditure to that; so, with a standing
bill at Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s, another at Smith&rsquo;s, and a third at
Hobson&rsquo;s, we got along even more comfortably than before: though
my mother affirmed we had better keep within bounds, for our prospects
of wealth were but precarious, after all; and if my father would only
trust everything to her management, he should never feel himself stinted:
but he, for once, was incorrigible.<br>
<br>
What happy hours Mary and I have passed while sitting at our work by
the fire, or wandering on the heath-clad hills, or idling under the
weeping birch (the only considerable tree in the garden), talking of
future happiness to ourselves and our parents, of what we would do,
and see, and possess; with no firmer foundation for our goodly superstructure
than the riches that were expected to flow in upon us from the success
of the worthy merchant&rsquo;s speculations.&nbsp; Our father was nearly
as bad as ourselves; only that he affected not to be so much in earnest:
expressing his bright hopes and sanguine expectations in jests and playful
sallies, that always struck me as being exceedingly witty and pleasant.&nbsp;
Our mother laughed with delight to see him so hopeful and happy: but
still she feared he was setting his heart too much upon the matter;
and once I heard her whisper as she left the room, &lsquo;God grant
he be not disappointed!&nbsp; I know not how he would bear it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Disappointed he was; and bitterly, too.&nbsp; It came like a thunder-clap
on us all, that the vessel which contained our fortune had been wrecked,
and gone to the bottom with all its stores, together with several of
the crew, and the unfortunate merchant himself.&nbsp; I was grieved
for him; I was grieved for the overthrow of all our air-built castles:
but, with the elasticity of youth, I soon recovered the shook.<br>
<br>
Though riches had charms, poverty had no terrors for an inexperienced
girl like me.&nbsp; Indeed, to say the truth, there was something exhilarating
in the idea of being driven to straits, and thrown upon our own resources.&nbsp;
I only wished papa, mamma, and Mary were all of the same mind as myself;
and then, instead of lamenting past calamities we might all cheerfully
set to work to remedy them; and the greater the difficulties, the harder
our present privations, the greater should be our cheerfulness to endure
the latter, and our vigour to contend against the former.<br>
<br>
Mary did not lament, but she brooded continually over the misfortune,
and sank into a state of dejection from which no effort of mine could
rouse her.&nbsp; I could not possibly bring her to regard the matter
on its bright side as I did: and indeed I was so fearful of being charged
with childish frivolity, or stupid insensibility, that I carefully kept
most of my bright ideas and cheering notions to myself; well knowing
they could not be appreciated.<br>
<br>
My mother thought only of consoling my father, and paying our debts
and retrenching our expenditure by every available means; but my father
was completely overwhelmed by the calamity: health, strength, and spirits
sank beneath the blow, and he never wholly recovered them.&nbsp; In
vain my mother strove to cheer him, by appealing to his piety, to his
courage, to his affection for herself and us.&nbsp; That very affection
was his greatest torment: it was for our sakes he had so ardently longed
to increase his fortune - it was our interest that had lent such brightness
to his hopes, and that imparted such bitterness to his present distress.&nbsp;
He now tormented himself with remorse at having neglected my mother&rsquo;s
advice; which would at least have saved him from the additional burden
of debt - he vainly reproached himself for having brought her from the
dignity, the ease, the luxury of her former station to toil with him
through the cares and toils of poverty.&nbsp; It was gall and wormwood
to his soul to see that splendid, highly-accomplished woman, once so
courted and admired, transformed into an active managing housewife,
with hands and head continually occupied with household labours and
household economy.&nbsp; The very willingness with which she performed
these duties, the cheerfulness with which she bore her reverses, and
the kindness which withheld her from imputing the smallest blame to
him, were all perverted by this ingenious self-tormentor into further
aggravations of his sufferings.&nbsp; And thus the mind preyed upon
the body, and disordered the system of the nerves, and they in turn
increased the troubles of the mind, till by action and reaction his
health was seriously impaired; and not one of us could convince him
that the aspect of our affairs was not half so gloomy, so utterly hopeless,
as his morbid imagination represented it to be.<br>
<br>
The useful pony phaeton was sold, together with the stout, well-fed
pony - the old favourite that we had fully determined should end its
days in peace, and never pass from our hands; the little coach-house
and stable were let; the servant boy, and the more efficient (being
the more expensive) of the two maid-servants, were dismissed.&nbsp;
Our clothes were mended, turned, and darned to the utmost verge of decency;
our food, always plain, was now simplified to an unprecedented degree
- except my father&rsquo;s favourite dishes; our coals and candles were
painfully economized - the pair of candles reduced to one, and that
most sparingly used; the coals carefully husbanded in the half-empty
grate: especially when my father was out on his parish duties, or confined
to bed through illness - then we sat with our feet on the fender, scraping
the perishing embers together from time to time, and occasionally adding
a slight scattering of the dust and fragments of coal, just to keep
them alive.&nbsp; As for our carpets, they in time were worn threadbare,
and patched and darned even to a greater extent than our garments.&nbsp;
To save the expense of a gardener, Mary and I undertook to keep the
garden in order; and all the cooking and household work that could not
easily be managed by one servant-girl, was done by my mother and sister,
with a little occasional help from me: only a little, because, though
a woman in my own estimation, I was still a child in theirs; and my
mother, like most active, managing women, was not gifted with very active
daughters: for this reason - that being so clever and diligent herself,
she was never tempted to trust her affairs to a deputy, but, on the
contrary, was willing to act and think for others as well as for number
one; and whatever was the business in hand, she was apt to think that
no one could do it so well as herself: so that whenever I offered to
assist her, I received such an answer as - &lsquo;No, love, you cannot
indeed - there&rsquo;s nothing here you can do.&nbsp; Go and help your
sister, or get her to take a walk with you - tell her she must not sit
so much, and stay so constantly in the house as she does - she may well
look thin and dejected.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Mary, mamma says I&rsquo;m to help you; or get you to take a
walk with me; she says you may well look thin and dejected, if you sit
so constantly in the house.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Help me you cannot, Agnes; and I cannot go out with <i>you</i>
- I have far too much to do.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Then let me help you.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You cannot, indeed, dear child.&nbsp; Go and practise your music,
or play with the kitten.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
There was always plenty of sewing on hand; but I had not been taught
to cut out a single garment, and except plain hemming and seaming, there
was little I could do, even in that line; for they both asserted that
it was far easier to do the work themselves than to prepare it for me:
and besides, they liked better to see me prosecuting my studies, or
amusing myself - it was time enough for me to sit bending over my work,
like a grave matron, when my favourite little pussy was become a steady
old cat.&nbsp; Under such circumstances, although I was not many degrees
more useful than the kitten, my idleness was not entirely without excuse.<br>
<br>
Through all our troubles, I never but once heard my mother complain
of our want of money.&nbsp; As summer was coming on she observed to
Mary and me, &lsquo;What a desirable thing it would be for your papa
to spend a few weeks at a watering-place.&nbsp; I am convinced the sea-air
and the change of scene would be of incalculable service to him.&nbsp;
But then, you see, there&rsquo;s no money,&rsquo; she added, with a
sigh.&nbsp; We both wished exceedingly that the thing might be done,
and lamented greatly that it could not.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo;
said she, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s no use complaining.&nbsp; Possibly something
might be done to further the project after all.&nbsp; Mary, you are
a beautiful drawer.&nbsp; What do you say to doing a few more pictures
in your best style, and getting them framed, with the water-coloured
drawings you have already done, and trying to dispose of them to some
liberal picture-dealer, who has the sense to discern their merits?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Mamma, I should be delighted if you think they <i>could</i> be
sold; and for anything worth while.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s worth while trying, however, my dear: do you procure
the drawings, and I&rsquo;ll endeavour to find a purchaser.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I wish <i>I</i> could do something,&rsquo; said I.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You, Agnes! well, who knows?&nbsp; You draw pretty well, too:
if you choose some simple piece for your subject, I daresay you will
be able to produce something we shall all be proud to exhibit.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But I have another scheme in my head, mamma, and have had long,
only I did not like to mention it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Indeed! pray tell us what it is.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I should like to be a governess.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
My mother uttered an exclamation of surprise, and laughed.&nbsp; My
sister dropped her work in astonishment, exclaiming, &lsquo;<i>You</i>
a governess, Agnes!&nbsp; What can you be dreaming of?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see anything so <i>very</i> extraordinary
in it.&nbsp; I do not pretend to be able to instruct great girls; but
surely I could teach little ones: and I should like it so much: I am
so fond of children.&nbsp; Do let me, mamma!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But, my love, you have not learned to take care of <i>yourself</i>
yet: and young children require more judgment and experience to manage
than elder ones.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But, mamma, I am above eighteen, and quite able to take care
of myself, and others too.&nbsp; You do not know half the wisdom and
prudence I possess, because I have never been tried.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Only think,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;what would you do in a house
full of strangers, without me or mamma to speak and act for you - with
a parcel of children, besides yourself, to attend to; and no one to
look to for advice?&nbsp; You would not even know what clothes to put
on.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You think, because I always do as you bid me, I have no judgment
of my own: but only try me - that is all I ask - and you shall see what
I can do.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
At that moment my father entered and the subject of our discussion was
explained to him.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;What, my little Agnes a governess!&rsquo; cried he, and, in spite
of his dejection, he laughed at the idea.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, papa, don&rsquo;t <i>you</i> say anything against it: I
should like it so much; and I am sure I could manage delightfully.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But, my darling, we could not spare you.&rsquo;&nbsp; And a tear
glistened in his eye as he added - &lsquo;No, no! afflicted as we are,
surely we are not brought to that pass yet.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; said my mother.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is no necessity
whatever for such a step; it is merely a whim of her own.&nbsp; So you
must hold your tongue, you naughty girl; for, though you are so ready
to leave us, you know very well we cannot part with <i>you</i>.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I was silenced for that day, and for many succeeding ones; but still
I did not wholly relinquish my darling scheme.&nbsp; Mary got her drawing
materials, and steadily set to work.&nbsp; I got mine too; but while
I drew, I thought of other things.&nbsp; How delightful it would be
to be a governess!&nbsp; To go out into the world; to enter upon a new
life; to act for myself; to exercise my unused faculties; to try my
unknown powers; to earn my own maintenance, and something to comfort
and help my father, mother, and sister, besides exonerating them from
the provision of my food and clothing; to show papa what his little
Agnes could do; to convince mamma and Mary that I was not quite the
helpless, thoughtless being they supposed.&nbsp; And then, how charming
to be entrusted with the care and education of children!&nbsp; Whatever
others said, I felt I was fully competent to the task: the clear remembrance
of my own thoughts in early childhood would be a surer guide than the
instructions of the most mature adviser.&nbsp; I had but to turn from
my little pupils to myself at their age, and I should know, at once,
how to win their confidence and affections: how to waken the contrition
of the erring; how to embolden the timid and console the afflicted;
how to make Virtue practicable, Instruction desirable, and Religion
lovely and comprehensible.<br>
<br>
<br>
- Delightful task!<br>
To teach the young idea how to shoot!<br>
<br>
<br>
To train the tender plants, and watch their buds unfolding day by day!<br>
<br>
Influenced by so many inducements, I determined still to persevere;
though the fear of displeasing my mother, or distressing my father&rsquo;s
feelings, prevented me from resuming the subject for several days.&nbsp;
At length, again, I mentioned it to my mother in private; and, with
some difficulty, got her to promise to assist me with her endeavours.&nbsp;
My father&rsquo;s reluctant consent was next obtained, and then, though
Mary still sighed her disapproval, my dear, kind mother began to look
out for a situation for me.&nbsp; She wrote to my father&rsquo;s relations,
and consulted the newspaper advertisements - her own relations she had
long dropped all communication with: a formal interchange of occasional
letters was all she had ever had since her marriage, and she would not
at any time have applied to them in a case of this nature.&nbsp; But
so long and so entire had been my parents&rsquo; seclusion from the
world, that many weeks elapsed before a suitable situation could be
procured.&nbsp; At last, to my great joy, it was decreed that I should
take charge of the young family of a certain Mrs. Bloomfield; whom my
kind, prim aunt Grey had known in her youth, and asserted to be a very
nice woman.&nbsp; Her husband was a retired tradesman, who had realized
a very comfortable fortune; but could not be prevailed upon to give
a greater salary than twenty-five pounds to the instructress of his
children.&nbsp; I, however, was glad to accept this, rather than refuse
the situation - which my parents were inclined to think the better plan.<br>
<br>
But some weeks more were yet to be devoted to preparation.&nbsp; How
long, how tedious those weeks appeared to me!&nbsp; Yet they were happy
ones in the main - full of bright hopes and ardent expectations.&nbsp;
With what peculiar pleasure I assisted at the making of my new clothes,
and, subsequently, the packing of my trunks!&nbsp; But there was a feeling
of bitterness mingling with the latter occupation too; and when it was
done - when all was ready for my departure on the morrow, and the last
night at home approached - a sudden anguish seemed to swell my heart.&nbsp;
My dear friends looked so sad, and spoke so very kindly, that I could
scarcely keep my eyes from overflowing: but I still affected to be gay.&nbsp;
I had taken my last ramble with Mary on the moors, my last walk in the
garden, and round the house; I had fed, with her, our pet pigeons for
the last time - the pretty creatures that we had tamed to peck their
food from our hands: I had given a farewell stroke to all their silky
backs as they crowded in my lap.&nbsp; I had tenderly kissed my own
peculiar favourites, the pair of snow-white fantails; I had played my
last tune on the old familiar piano, and sung my last song to papa:
not the last, I hoped, but the last for what appeared to me a very long
time.&nbsp; And, perhaps, when I did these things again it would be
with different feelings: circumstances might be changed, and this house
might never be my settled home again.&nbsp; My dear little friend, the
kitten, would certainly be changed: she was already growing a fine cat;
and when I returned, even for a hasty visit at Christmas, would, most
likely, have forgotten both her playmate and her merry pranks.&nbsp;
I had romped with her for the last time; and when I stroked her soft
bright fur, while she lay purring herself to sleep in my lap, it was
with a feeling of sadness I could not easily disguise.&nbsp; Then at
bed-time, when I retired with Mary to our quiet little chamber, where
already my drawers were cleared out and my share of the bookcase was
empty - and where, hereafter, she would have to sleep alone, in dreary
solitude, as she expressed it - my heart sank more than ever: I felt
as if I had been selfish and wrong to persist in leaving her; and when
I knelt once more beside our little bed, I prayed for a blessing on
her and on my parents more fervently than ever I had done before.&nbsp;
To conceal my emotion, I buried my face in my hands, and they were presently
bathed in tears.&nbsp; I perceived, on rising, that she had been crying
too: but neither of us spoke; and in silence we betook ourselves to
our repose, creeping more closely together from the consciousness that
we were to part so soon.<br>
<br>
But the morning brought a renewal of hope and spirits.&nbsp; I was to
depart early; that the conveyance which took me (a gig, hired from Mr.
Smith, the draper, grocer, and tea-dealer of the village) might return
the same day.&nbsp; I rose, washed, dressed, swallowed a hasty breakfast,
received the fond embraces of my father, mother, and sister, kissed
the cat - to the great scandal of Sally, the maid - shook hands with
her, mounted the gig, drew my veil over my face, and then, but not till
then, burst into a flood of tears.&nbsp; The gig rolled on; I looked
back; my dear mother and sister were still standing at the door, looking
after me, and waving their adieux.&nbsp; I returned their salute, and
prayed God to bless them from my heart: we descended the hill, and I
could see them no more.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s a coldish mornin&rsquo; for you, Miss Agnes,&rsquo;
observed Smith; &lsquo;and a darksome &rsquo;un too; but we&rsquo;s
happen get to yon spot afore there come much rain to signify.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, I hope so,&rsquo; replied I, as calmly as I could.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s comed a good sup last night too.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But this cold wind will happen keep it off.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Perhaps it will.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Here ended our colloquy.&nbsp; We crossed the valley, and began to ascend
the opposite hill.&nbsp; As we were toiling up, I looked back again;
there was the village spire, and the old grey parsonage beyond it, basking
in a slanting beam of sunshine - it was but a sickly ray, but the village
and surrounding hills were all in sombre shade, and I hailed the wandering
beam as a propitious omen to my home.&nbsp; With clasped hands I fervently
implored a blessing on its inhabitants, and hastily turned away; for
I saw the sunshine was departing; and I carefully avoided another glance,
lest I should see it in gloomy shadow, like the rest of the landscape.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER II - FIRST LESSONS IN THE ART OF INSTRUCTION<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As we drove along, my spirits revived again, and I turned, with pleasure,
to the contemplation of the new life upon which I was entering.&nbsp;
But though it was not far past the middle of September, the heavy clouds
and strong north-easterly wind combined to render the day extremely
cold and dreary; and the journey seemed a very long one, for, as Smith
observed, the roads were &lsquo;very heavy&rsquo;; and certainly, his
horse was very heavy too: it crawled up the hills, and crept down them,
and only condescended to shake its sides in a trot where the road was
at a dead level or a very gentle slope, which was rarely the case in
those rugged regions; so that it was nearly one o&rsquo;clock before
we reached the place of our destination.&nbsp; Yet, after all, when
we entered the lofty iron gateway, when we drove softly up the smooth,
well-rolled carriage-road, with the green lawn on each side, studded
with young trees, and approached the new but stately mansion of Wellwood,
rising above its mushroom poplar-groves, my heart failed me, and I wished
it were a mile or two farther off.&nbsp; For the first time in my life
I must stand alone: there was no retreating now.&nbsp; I must enter
that house, and introduce myself among its strange inhabitants.&nbsp;
But how was it to be done?&nbsp; True, I was near nineteen; but, thanks
to my retired life and the protecting care of my mother and sister,
I well knew that many a girl of fifteen, or under, was gifted with a
more womanly address, and greater ease and self-possession, than I was.&nbsp;
Yet, if Mrs. Bloomfield were a kind, motherly woman, I might do very
well, after all; and the children, of course, I should soon be at ease
with them - and Mr. Bloomfield, I hoped, I should have but little to
do with.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Be calm, be calm, whatever happens,&rsquo; I said within myself;
and truly I kept this resolution so well, and was so fully occupied
in steadying my nerves and stifling the rebellious flutter of my heart,
that when I was admitted into the hall and ushered into the presence
of Mrs. Bloomfield, I almost forgot to answer her polite salutation;
and it afterwards struck me, that the little I did say was spoken in
the tone of one half-dead or half-asleep.&nbsp; The lady, too, was somewhat
chilly in her manner, as I discovered when I had time to reflect.&nbsp;
She was a tall, spare, stately woman, with thick black hair, cold grey
eyes, and extremely sallow complexion.<br>
<br>
With due politeness, however, she showed me my bedroom, and left me
there to take a little refreshment.&nbsp; I was somewhat dismayed at
my appearance on looking in the glass: the cold wind had swelled and
reddened my hands, uncurled and entangled my hair, and dyed my face
of a pale purple; add to this my collar was horridly crumpled, my frock
splashed with mud, my feet clad in stout new boots, and as the trunks
were not brought up, there was no remedy; so having smoothed my hair
as well as I could, and repeatedly twitched my obdurate collar, I proceeded
to clomp down the two flights of stairs, philosophizing as I went; and
with some difficulty found my way into the room where Mrs. Bloomfield
awaited me.<br>
<br>
She led me into the dining-room, where the family luncheon had been
laid out.&nbsp; Some beefsteaks and half-cold potatoes were set before
me; and while I dined upon these, she sat opposite, watching me (as
I thought) and endeavouring to sustain something like a conversation
- consisting chiefly of a succession of commonplace remarks, expressed
with frigid formality: but this might be more my fault than hers, for
I really could <i>not</i> converse.&nbsp; In fact, my attention was
almost wholly absorbed in my dinner: not from ravenous appetite, but
from distress at the toughness of the beefsteaks, and the numbness of
my hands, almost palsied by their five-hours&rsquo; exposure to the
bitter wind.&nbsp; I would gladly have eaten the potatoes and let the
meat alone, but having got a large piece of the latter on to my plate,
I could not be so impolite as to leave it; so, after many awkward and
unsuccessful attempts to cut it with the knife, or tear it with the
fork, or pull it asunder between them, sensible that the awful lady
was a spectator to the whole transaction, I at last desperately grasped
the knife and fork in my fists, like a child of two years old, and fell
to work with all the little strength I possessed.&nbsp; But this needed
some apology - with a feeble attempt at a laugh, I said, &lsquo;My hands
are so benumbed with the cold that I can scarcely handle my knife and
fork.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I daresay you would find it cold,&rsquo; replied she with a cool,
immutable gravity that did not serve to reassure me.<br>
<br>
When the ceremony was concluded, she led me into the sitting-room again,
where she rang and sent for the children.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You will find them not very far advanced in their attainments,&rsquo;
said she, &lsquo;for I have had so little time to attend to their education
myself, and we have thought them too young for a governess till now;
but I think they are clever children, and very apt to learn, especially
the little boy; he is, I think, the flower of the flock - a generous,
noble-spirited boy, one to be led, but not driven, and remarkable for
always speaking the truth.&nbsp; He seems to scorn deception&rsquo;
(this was good news).&nbsp; &lsquo;His sister Mary Ann will require
watching,&rsquo; continued she, &lsquo;but she is a very good girl upon
the whole; though I wish her to be kept out of the nursery as much as
possible, as she is now almost six years old, and might acquire bad
habits from the nurses.&nbsp; I have ordered her crib to be placed in
your room, and if you will be so kind as to overlook her washing and
dressing, and take charge of her clothes, she need have nothing further
to do with the nursery maid.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I replied I was quite willing to do so; and at that moment my young
pupils entered the apartment, with their two younger sisters.&nbsp;
Master Tom Bloomfield was a well-grown boy of seven, with a somewhat
wiry frame, flaxen hair, blue eyes, small turned-up nose, and fair complexion.&nbsp;
Mary Ann was a tall girl too, somewhat dark like her mother, but with
a round full face and a high colour in her cheeks.&nbsp; The second
sister was Fanny, a very pretty little girl; Mrs. Bloomfield assured
me she was a remarkably gentle child, and required encouragement: she
had not learned anything yet; but in a few days, she would be four years
old, and then she might take her first lesson in the alphabet, and be
promoted to the schoolroom.&nbsp; The remaining one was Harriet, a little
broad, fat, merry, playful thing of scarcely two, that I coveted more
than all the rest - but with her I had nothing to do.<br>
<br>
I talked to my little pupils as well as I could, and tried to render
myself agreeable; but with little success I fear, for their mother&rsquo;s
presence kept me under an unpleasant restraint.&nbsp; They, however,
were remarkably free from shyness.&nbsp; They seemed bold, lively children,
and I hoped I should soon be on friendly terms with them - the little
boy especially, of whom I had heard such a favourable character from
his mamma.&nbsp; In Mary Ann there was a certain affected simper, and
a craving for notice, that I was sorry to observe.&nbsp; But her brother
claimed all my attention to himself; he stood bolt upright between me
and the fire, with his hands behind his back, talking away like an orator,
occasionally interrupting his discourse with a sharp reproof to his
sisters when they made too much noise.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, Tom, what a darling you are!&rsquo; exclaimed his mother.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come and kiss dear mamma; and then won&rsquo;t you show Miss
Grey your schoolroom, and your nice new books?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t kiss <i>you</i>, mamma; but I <i>will</i> show
Miss Grey my schoolroom, and my new books.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And <i>my</i> schoolroom, and <i>my</i> new books, Tom,&rsquo;
said Mary Ann.&nbsp; &lsquo;They&rsquo;re mine too.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;They&rsquo;re <i>mine</i>,&rsquo; replied he decisively.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Come along, Miss Grey - I&rsquo;ll escort you.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
When the room and books had been shown, with some bickerings between
the brother and sister that I did my utmost to appease or mitigate,
Mary Ann brought me her doll, and began to be very loquacious on the
subject of its fine clothes, its bed, its chest of drawers, and other
appurtenances; but Tom told her to hold her clamour, that Miss Grey
might see his rocking-horse, which, with a most important bustle, he
dragged forth from its corner into the middle of the room, loudly calling
on me to attend to it.&nbsp; Then, ordering his sister to hold the reins,
he mounted, and made me stand for ten minutes, watching how manfully
he used his whip and spurs.&nbsp; Meantime, however, I admired Mary
Ann&rsquo;s pretty doll, and all its possessions; and then told Master
Tom he was a capital rider, but I hoped he would not use his whip and
spurs so much when he rode a real pony.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, yes, I will!&rsquo; said he, laying on with redoubled ardour.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll cut into him like smoke!&nbsp; Eeh! my word! but he
shall sweat for it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
This was very shocking; but I hoped in time to be able to work a reformation.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Now you must put on your bonnet and shawl,&rsquo; said the little
hero, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll show you my garden.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And <i>mine</i>,&rsquo; said Mary Ann.<br>
<br>
Tom lifted his fist with a menacing gesture; she uttered a loud, shrill
scream, ran to the other side of me, and made a face at him.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Surely, Tom, you would not strike your sister!&nbsp; I hope I
shall <i>never</i> see you do that.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You will sometimes: I&rsquo;m obliged to do it now and then to
keep her in order.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But it is not your business to keep her in order, you know -
that is for - &rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, now go and put on your bonnet.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know - it is so very cloudy and cold, it seems
likely to rain; - and you know I have had a long drive.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No matter - you <i>must</i> come; I shall allow of no excuses,&rsquo;
replied the consequential little gentleman.&nbsp; And, as it was the
first day of our acquaintance, I thought I might as well indulge him.&nbsp;
It was too cold for Mary Ann to venture, so she stayed with her mamma,
to the great relief of her brother, who liked to have me all to himself.<br>
<br>
The garden was a large one, and tastefully laid out; besides several
splendid dahlias, there were some other fine flowers still in bloom:
but my companion would not give me time to examine them: I must go with
him, across the wet grass, to a remote sequestered corner, the most
important place in the grounds, because it contained <i>his</i> garden.&nbsp;
There were two round beds, stocked with a variety of plants.&nbsp; In
one there was a pretty little rose-tree.&nbsp; I paused to admire its
lovely blossoms.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, never mind that!&rsquo; said he, contemptuously.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
only <i>Mary Ann&rsquo;s</i> garden; look, THIS is mine.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
After I had observed every flower, and listened to a disquisition on
every plant, I was permitted to depart; but first, with great pomp,
he plucked a polyanthus and presented it to me, as one conferring a
prodigious favour.&nbsp; I observed, on the grass about his garden,
certain apparatus of sticks and corn, and asked what they were.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Traps for birds.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Why do you catch them?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Papa says they do harm.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And what do you do with them when you catch them?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Different things.&nbsp; Sometimes I give them to the cat; sometimes
I cut them in pieces with my penknife; but the next, I mean to roast
alive.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And why do you mean to do such a horrible thing?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;For two reasons: first, to see how long it will live - and then,
to see what it will taste like.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But don&rsquo;t you know it is extremely wicked to do such things?&nbsp;
Remember, the birds can feel as well as you; and think, how would you
like it yourself?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothing!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a bird, and I can&rsquo;t
feel what I do to them.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But you will have to feel it some time, Tom: you have heard where
wicked people go to when they die; and if you don&rsquo;t leave off
torturing innocent birds, remember, you will have to go there, and suffer
just what you have made them suffer.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, pooh!&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Papa knows how I treat
them, and he never blames me for it: he says it is just what <i>he</i>
used to do when <i>he</i> was a boy.&nbsp; Last summer, he gave me a
nest full of young sparrows, and he saw me pulling off their legs and
wings, and heads, and never said anything; except that they were nasty
things, and I must not let them soil my trousers: end Uncle Robson was
there too, and he laughed, and said I was a fine boy.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But what would your mamma say?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, she doesn&rsquo;t care! she says it&rsquo;s a pity to kill
the pretty singing birds, but the naughty sparrows, and mice, and rats,
I may do what I like with.&nbsp; So now, Miss Grey, you see it is <i>not</i>
wicked.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I still think it is, Tom; and perhaps your papa and mamma would
think so too, if they thought much about it.&nbsp; However,&rsquo; I
internally added, &lsquo;they may say what they please, but I am determined
you shall do nothing of the kind, as long as I have power to prevent
it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
He next took me across the lawn to see his mole-traps, and then into
the stack-yard to see his weasel-traps: one of which, to his great joy,
contained a dead weasel; and then into the stable to see, not the fine
carriage-horses, but a little rough colt, which he informed me had been
bred on purpose for him, and he was to ride it as soon as it was properly
trained.&nbsp; I tried to amuse the little fellow, and listened to all
his chatter as complacently as I could; for I thought if he had any
affections at all, I would endeavour to win them; and then, in time,
I might be able to show him the error of his ways: but I looked in vain
for that generous, noble spirit his mother talked of; though I could
see he was not without a certain degree of quickness and penetration,
when he chose to exert it.<br>
<br>
When we re-entered the house it was nearly tea-time.&nbsp; Master Tom
told me that, as papa was from home, he and I and Mary Ann were to have
tea with mamma, for a treat; for, on such occasions, she always dined
at luncheon-time with them, instead of at six o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Soon
after tea, Mary Ann went to bed, but Tom favoured us with his company
and conversation till eight.&nbsp; After he was gone, Mrs. Bloomfield
further enlightened me on the subject of her children&rsquo;s dispositions
and acquirements, and on what they were to learn, and how they were
to be managed, and cautioned me to mention their defects to no one but
herself.&nbsp; My mother had warned me before to mention them as little
as possible to <i>her</i>, for people did not like to be told of their
children&rsquo;s faults, and so I concluded I was to keep silence on
them altogether.&nbsp; About half-past nine, Mrs. Bloomfield invited
me to partake of a frugal supper of cold meat and bread.&nbsp; I was
glad when that was over, and she took her bedroom candlestick and retired
to rest; for though I wished to be pleased with her, her company was
extremely irksome to me; and I could not help feeling that she was cold,
grave, and forbidding - the very opposite of the kind, warm-hearted
matron my hopes had depicted her to be.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER III - A FEW MORE LESSONS<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I rose next morning with a feeling of hopeful exhilaration, in spite
of the disappointments already experienced; but I found the dressing
of Mary Ann was no light matter, as her abundant hair was to be smeared
with pomade, plaited in three long tails, and tied with bows of ribbon:
a task my unaccustomed fingers found great difficulty in performing.&nbsp;
She told me her nurse could do it in half the time, and, by keeping
up a constant fidget of impatience, contrived to render me still longer.&nbsp;
When all was done, we went into the schoolroom, where I met my other
pupil, and chatted with the two till it was time to go down to breakfast.&nbsp;
That meal being concluded, and a few civil words having been exchanged
with Mrs. Bloomfield, we repaired to the schoolroom again, and commenced
the business of the day.&nbsp; I found my pupils very backward, indeed;
but Tom, though averse to every species of mental exertion, was not
without abilities.&nbsp; Mary Ann could scarcely read a word, and was
so careless and inattentive that I could hardly get on with her at all.&nbsp;
However, by dint of great labour and patience, I managed to get something
done in the course of the morning, and then accompanied my young charge
out into the garden and adjacent grounds, for a little recreation before
dinner.&nbsp; There we got along tolerably together, except that I found
they had no notion of going with me: I must go with them, wherever they
chose to lead me.&nbsp; I must run, walk, or stand, exactly as it suited
their fancy.&nbsp; This, I thought, was reversing the order of things;
and I found it doubly disagreeable, as on this as well as subsequent
occasions, they seemed to prefer the dirtiest places and the most dismal
occupations.&nbsp; But there was no remedy; either I must follow them,
or keep entirely apart from them, and thus appear neglectful of my charge.&nbsp;
To-day, they manifested a particular attachment to a well at the bottom
of the lawn, where they persisted in dabbling with sticks and pebbles
for above half an hour.&nbsp; I was in constant fear that their mother
would see them from the window, and blame me for allowing them thus
to draggle their clothes and wet their feet and hands, instead of taking
exercise; but no arguments, commands, or entreaties could draw them
away.&nbsp; If <i>she</i> did not see them, some one else did - a gentleman
on horseback had entered the gate and was proceeding up the road; at
the distance of a few paces from us he paused, and calling to the children
in a waspish penetrating tone, bade them &lsquo;keep out of that water.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Miss Grey,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;(I suppose it <i>is</i> Miss
Grey), I am surprised that you should allow them to dirty their clothes
in that manner!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you see how Miss Bloomfield has soiled
her frock? and that Master Bloomfield&rsquo;s socks are quite wet? and
both of them without gloves?&nbsp; Dear, dear!&nbsp; Let me <i>request</i>
that in future you will keep them <i>decent</i> at least!&rsquo; so
saying, he turned away, and continued his ride up to the house.&nbsp;
This was Mr. Bloomfield.&nbsp; I was surprised that he should nominate
his children Master and Miss Bloomfield; and still more so, that he
should speak so uncivilly to me, their governess, and a perfect stranger
to himself.&nbsp; Presently the bell rang to summon us in.&nbsp; I dined
with the children at one, while he and his lady took their luncheon
at the same table.&nbsp; His conduct there did not greatly raise him
in my estimation.&nbsp; He was a man of ordinary stature - rather below
than above - and rather thin than stout, apparently between thirty and
forty years of age: he had a large mouth, pale, dingy complexion, milky
blue eyes, and hair the colour of a hempen cord.&nbsp; There was a roast
leg of mutton before him: he helped Mrs. Bloomfield, the children, and
me, desiring me to cut up the children&rsquo;s meat; then, after twisting
about the mutton in various directions, and eyeing it from different
points, he pronounced it not fit to be eaten, and called for the cold
beef.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;What is the matter with the mutton, my dear?&rsquo; asked his
mate.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;It is quite overdone.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you taste, Mrs. Bloomfield,
that all the goodness is roasted out of it?&nbsp; And can&rsquo;t you
see that all that nice, red gravy is completely dried away?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, I think the <i>beef</i> will suit you.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
The beef was set before him, and he began to carve, but with the most
rueful expressions of discontent.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;What is the matter with the <i>beef</i>, Mr. Bloomfield?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sure I thought it was very nice.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And so it <i>was</i> very nice.&nbsp; A nicer joint could not
be; but it is <i>quite</i> spoiled,&rsquo; replied he, dolefully.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;How so?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;How so!&nbsp; Why, don&rsquo;t you see how it is cut?&nbsp; Dear
- dear! it is quite shocking!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;They must have cut it wrong in the kitchen, then, for I&rsquo;m
sure I carved it quite properly here, yesterday.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No <i>doubt</i> they cut it wrong in the kitchen - the savages!&nbsp;
Dear - dear!&nbsp; Did ever any one see such a fine piece of beef so
completely ruined?&nbsp; But remember that, in future, when a decent
dish leaves this table, they shall not <i>touch</i> it in the kitchen.&nbsp;
Remember <i>that</i>, Mrs. Bloomfield!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding the ruinous state of the beef, the gentleman managed
to out himself some delicate slices, part of which he ate in silence.&nbsp;
When he next spoke, it was, in a less querulous tone, to ask what there
was for dinner.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Turkey and grouse,&rsquo; was the concise reply.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And what besides?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Fish.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;What kind of fish?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;<i>You don&rsquo;t know</i>?&rsquo; cried he, looking solemnly
up from his plate, and suspending his knife and fork in astonishment.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No.&nbsp; I told the cook to get some fish - I did not particularize
what.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, that beats everything!&nbsp; A lady professes to keep house,
and doesn&rsquo;t even know what fish is for dinner! professes to order
fish, and doesn&rsquo;t specify what!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Perhaps, Mr. Bloomfield, you will order dinner yourself in future.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Nothing more was said; and I was very glad to get out of the room with
my pupils; for I never felt so ashamed and uncomfortable in my life
for anything that was not my own fault.<br>
<br>
In the afternoon we applied to lessons again: then went out again; then
had tea in the schoolroom; then I dressed Mary Ann for dessert; and
when she and her brother had gone down to the dining-room, I took the
opportunity of beginning a letter to my dear friends at home: but the
children came up before I had half completed it.&nbsp; At seven I had
to put Mary Ann to bed; then I played with Tom till eight, when he,
too, went; and I finished my letter and unpacked my clothes, which I
had hitherto found no opportunity for doing, and, finally, went to bed
myself.<br>
<br>
But this is a very favourable specimen of a day&rsquo;s proceedings.<br>
<br>
My task of instruction and surveillance, instead of becoming easier
as my charges and I got better accustomed to each other, became more
arduous as their characters unfolded.&nbsp; The name of governess, I
soon found, was a mere mockery as applied to me: my pupils had no more
notion of obedience than a wild, unbroken colt.&nbsp; The habitual fear
of their father&rsquo;s peevish temper, and the dread of the punishments
he was wont to inflict when irritated, kept them generally within bounds
in his immediate presence.&nbsp; The girls, too, had some fear of their
mother&rsquo;s anger; and the boy might occasionally be bribed to do
as she bid him by the hope of reward; but I had no rewards to offer;
and as for punishments, I was given to understand, the parents reserved
that privilege to themselves; and yet they expected me to keep my pupils
in order.&nbsp; Other children might be guided by the fear of anger
and the desire of approbation; but neither the one nor the other had
any effect upon these.<br>
<br>
Master Tom, not content with refusing to be ruled, must needs set up
as a ruler, and manifested a determination to keep, not only his sisters,
but his governess in order, by violent manual and pedal applications;
and, as he was a tall, strong boy of his years, this occasioned no trifling
inconvenience.&nbsp; A few sound boxes on the ear, on such occasions,
might have settled the matter easily enough: but as, in that case, he
might make up some story to his mother which she would be sure to believe,
as she had such unshaken faith in his veracity - though I had already
discovered it to be by no means unimpeachable - I determined to refrain
from striking him, even in self-defence; and, in his most violent moods,
my only resource was to throw him on his back and hold his hands and
feet till the frenzy was somewhat abated.&nbsp; To the difficulty of
preventing him from doing what he ought not, was added that of forcing
him to do what he ought.&nbsp; Often he would positively refuse to learn,
or to repeat his lessons, or even to look at his book.&nbsp; Here, again,
a good birch rod might have been serviceable; but, as my powers were
so limited, I must make the best use of what I had.<br>
<br>
As there were no settled hours for study and play, I resolved to give
my pupils a certain task, which, with moderate attention, they could
perform in a short time; and till this was done, however weary I was,
or however perverse they might be, nothing short of parental interference
should induce me to suffer them to leave the schoolroom, even if I should
sit with my chair against the door to keep them in.&nbsp; Patience,
Firmness, and Perseverance were my only weapons; and these I resolved
to use to the utmost.&nbsp; I determined always strictly to fulfil the
threats and promises I made; and, to that end, I must be cautious to
threaten and promise nothing that I could not perform.&nbsp; Then, I
would carefully refrain from all useless irritability and indulgence
of my own ill-temper: when they behaved tolerably, I would be as kind
and obliging as it was in my power to be, in order to make the widest
possible distinction between good and bad conduct; I would reason with
them, too, in the simplest and most effective manner.&nbsp; When I reproved
them, or refused to gratify their wishes, after a glaring fault, it
should be more in sorrow than in anger: their little hymns and prayers
I would make plain and clear to their understanding; when they said
their prayers at night and asked pardon for their offences, I would
remind them of the sins of the past day, solemnly, but in perfect kindness,
to avoid raising a spirit of opposition; penitential hymns should be
said by the naughty, cheerful ones by the comparatively good; and every
kind of instruction I would convey to them, as much as possible, by
entertaining discourse - apparently with no other object than their
present amusement in view.<br>
<br>
By these means I hoped in time both to benefit the children and to gain
the approbation of their parents; and also to convince my friends at
home that I was not so wanting in skill and prudence as they supposed.&nbsp;
I knew the difficulties I had to contend with were great; but I knew
(at least I believed) unremitting patience and perseverance could overcome
them; and night and morning I implored Divine assistance to this end.&nbsp;
But either the children were so incorrigible, the parents so unreasonable,
or myself so mistaken in my views, or so unable to carry them out, that
my best intentions and most strenuous efforts seemed productive of no
better result than sport to the children, dissatisfaction to their parents,
and torment to myself.<br>
<br>
The task of instruction was as arduous for the body as the mind.&nbsp;
I had to run after my pupils to catch them, to carry or drag them to
the table, and often forcibly to hold them there till the lesson was
done.&nbsp; Tom I frequently put into a corner, seating myself before
him in a chair, with a book which contained the little task that must
be said or read, before he was released, in my hand.&nbsp; He was not
strong enough to push both me and the chair away, so he would stand
twisting his body and face into the most grotesque and singular contortions
- laughable, no doubt, to an unconcerned spectator, but not to me -
and uttering loud yells and doleful outcries, intended to represent
weeping but wholly without the accompaniment of tears.&nbsp; I knew
this was done solely for the purpose of annoying me; and, therefore,
however I might inwardly tremble with impatience and irritation, I manfully
strove to suppress all visible signs of molestation, and affected to
sit with calm indifference, waiting till it should please him to cease
this pastime, and prepare for a run in the garden, by casting his eye
on the book and reading or repeating the few words he was required to
say.&nbsp; Sometimes he was determined to do his writing badly; and
I had to hold his hand to prevent him from purposely blotting or disfiguring
the paper.&nbsp; Frequently I threatened that, if he did not do better,
he should have another line: then he would stubbornly refuse to write
this line; and I, to save my word, had finally to resort to the expedient
of holding his fingers upon the pen, and forcibly drawing his hand up
and down, till, in spite of his resistance, the line was in some sort
completed.<br>
<br>
Yet Tom was by no means the most unmanageable of my pupils: sometimes,
to my great joy, he would have the sense to see that his wisest policy
was to finish his tasks, and go out and amuse himself till I and his
sisters came to join him; which frequently was not at all, for Mary
Ann seldom followed his example in this particular: she apparently preferred
rolling on the floor to any other amusement: down she would drop like
a leaden weight; and when I, with great difficulty, had succeeded in
rooting her thence, I had still to hold her up with one arm, while with
the other I held the book from which she was to read or spell her lesson.&nbsp;
As the dead weight of the big girl of six became too heavy for one arm
to bear, I transferred it to the other; or, if both were weary of the
burden, I carried her into a corner, and told her she might come out
when she should find the use of her feet, and stand up: but she generally
preferred lying there like a log till dinner or tea-time, when, as I
could not deprive her of her meals, she must be liberated, and would
come crawling out with a grin of triumph on her round, red face.&nbsp;
Often she would stubbornly refuse to pronounce some particular word
in her lesson; and now I regret the lost labour I have had in striving
to conquer her obstinacy.&nbsp; If I had passed it over as a matter
of no consequence, it would have been better for both parties, than
vainly striving to overcome it as I did; but I thought it my absolute
duty to crush this vicious tendency in the bud: and so it was, if I
could have done it; and had my powers been less limited, I might have
enforced obedience; but, as it was, it was a trial of strength between
her and me, in which she generally came off victorious; and every victory
served to encourage and strengthen her for a future contest.&nbsp; In
vain I argued, coaxed, entreated, threatened, scolded; in vain I kept
her in from play, or, if obliged to take her out, refused to play with
her, or to speak kindly or have anything to do with her; in vain I tried
to set before her the advantages of doing as she was bid, and being
loved, and kindly treated in consequence, and the disadvantages of persisting
in her absurd perversity.&nbsp; Sometimes, when she would ask me to
do something for her, I would answer, - &lsquo;Yes, I will, Mary Ann,
if you will only say that word.&nbsp; Come! you&rsquo;d better say it
at once, and have no more trouble about it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Then, of course, I can do nothing for you.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
With me, at her age, or under, neglect and disgrace were the most dreadful
of punishments; but on her they made no impression.&nbsp; Sometimes,
exasperated to the utmost pitch, I would shake her violently by the
shoulder, or pull her long hair, or put her in the corner; for which
she punished me with loud, shrill, piercing screams, that went through
my head like a knife.&nbsp; She knew I hated this, and when she had
shrieked her utmost, would look into my face with an air of vindictive
satisfaction, exclaiming, - &lsquo;<i>Now</i>, then! <i>that&rsquo;s</i>
for you!&rsquo; and then shriek again and again, till I was forced to
stop my ears.&nbsp; Often these dreadful cries would bring Mrs. Bloomfield
up to inquire what was the matter?<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Mary Ann is a naughty girl, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But what are these shocking screams?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;She is screaming in a passion.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I never heard such a dreadful noise!&nbsp; You might be killing
her.&nbsp; Why is she not out with her brother?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I cannot get her to finish her lessons.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But Mary Ann must be a <i>good</i> girl, and finish her lessons.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This was blandly spoken to the child.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I hope I shall
<i>never</i> hear such terrible cries again!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
And fixing her cold, stony eyes upon me with a look that could not be
mistaken, she would shut the door, and walk away.&nbsp; Sometimes I
would try to take the little obstinate creature by surprise, and casually
ask her the word while she was thinking of something else; frequently
she would begin to say it, and then suddenly cheek herself, with a provoking
look that seemed to say, &lsquo;Ah! I&rsquo;m too sharp for you; you
shan&rsquo;t trick it out of me, either.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
On another occasion, I pretended to forget the whole affair; and talked
and played with her as usual, till night, when I put her to bed; then
bending over her, while she lay all smiles and good humour, just before
departing, I said, as cheerfully and kindly as before - &lsquo;Now,
Mary Ann, just tell me that word before I kiss you good-night.&nbsp;
You are a good girl now, and, of course, you will say it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Then I can&rsquo;t kiss you.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
In vain I expressed my sorrow; in vain I lingered for some symptom of
contrition; she really &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t care,&rsquo; and I left her
alone, and in darkness, wondering most of all at this last proof of
insensate stubbornness.&nbsp; In <i>my</i> childhood I could not imagine
a more afflictive punishment than for my mother to refuse to kiss me
at night: the very idea was terrible.&nbsp; More than the idea I never
felt, for, happily, I never committed a fault that was deemed worthy
of such penalty; but once I remember, for some transgression of my sister&rsquo;s,
our mother thought proper to inflict it upon her: what <i>she</i> felt,
I cannot tell; but my sympathetic tears and suffering for her sake I
shall not soon forget.<br>
<br>
Another troublesome trait in Mary Ann was her incorrigible propensity
to keep running into the nursery, to play with her little sisters and
the nurse.&nbsp; This was natural enough, but, as it was against her
mother&rsquo;s express desire, I, of course, forbade her to do so, and
did my utmost to keep her with me; but that only increased her relish
for the nursery, and the more I strove to keep her out of it, the oftener
she went, and the longer she stayed, to the great dissatisfaction of
Mrs. Bloomfield, who, I well knew, would impute all the blame of the
matter to me.&nbsp; Another of my trials was the dressing in the morning:
at one time she would not be washed; at another she would not be dressed,
unless she might wear some particular frock, that I knew her mother
would not like her to have; at another she would scream and run away
if I attempted to touch her hair.&nbsp; So that, frequently, when, after
much trouble and toil, I had, at length, succeeded in bringing her down,
the breakfast was nearly half over; and black looks from &lsquo;mamma,&rsquo;
and testy observations from &lsquo;papa,&rsquo; spoken at me, if not
to me, were sure to be my meed: for few things irritated the latter
so much as want of punctuality at meal times.&nbsp; Then, among the
minor annoyances, was my inability to satisfy Mrs. Bloomfield with her
daughter&rsquo;s dress; and the child&rsquo;s hair &lsquo;was never
fit to be seen.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sometimes, as a powerful reproach to me,
she would perform the office of tire woman herself, and then complain
bitterly of the trouble it gave her.<br>
<br>
When little Fanny came into the schoolroom, I hoped she would be mild
and inoffensive, at least; but a few days, if not a few hours, sufficed
to destroy the illusion: I found her a mischievous, intractable little
creature, given up to falsehood and deception, young as she was, and
alarmingly fond of exercising her two favourite weapons of offence and
defence: that of spitting in the faces of those who incurred her displeasure,
and bellowing like a bull when her unreasonable desires were not gratified.&nbsp;
As she, generally, was pretty quiet in her parents&rsquo; presence,
and they were impressed with the notion of her being a remarkably gentle
child, her falsehoods were readily believed, and her loud uproars led
them to suspect harsh and injudicious treatment on my part; and when,
at length, her bad disposition became manifest even to their prejudiced
eyes, I felt that the whole was attributed to me.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;What a naughty girl Fanny is getting!&rsquo; Mrs. Bloomfield
would say to her spouse.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you observe, my dear,
how she is altered since she entered the schoolroom?&nbsp; She will
soon be as bad as the other two; and, I am sorry to say, they have quite
deteriorated of late.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You may say that,&rsquo; was the answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
been thinking that same myself.&nbsp; I thought when we got them a governess
they&rsquo;d improve; but, instead of that, they get worse and worse:
I don&rsquo;t know how it is with their learning, but their habits,
I know, make no sort of improvement; they get rougher, and dirtier,
and more unseemly every day.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I knew this was all pointed at me; and these, and all similar innuendoes,
affected me far more deeply than any open accusations would have done;
for against the latter I should have been roused to speak in my own
defence: now I judged it my wisest plan to subdue every resentful impulse,
suppress every sensitive shrinking, and go on perseveringly, doing my
best; for, irksome as my situation was, I earnestly wished to retain
it.&nbsp; I thought, if I could struggle on with unremitting firmness
and integrity, the children would in time become more humanized: every
month would contribute to make them some little wiser, and, consequently,
more manageable; for a child of nine or ten as frantic and ungovernable
as these at six and seven would be a maniac.<br>
<br>
I flattered myself I was benefiting my parents and sister by my continuance
here; for small as the salary was, I still was earning something, and
with strict economy I could easily manage to have something to spare
for them, if they would favour me by taking it.&nbsp; Then it was by
my own will that I had got the place: I had brought all this tribulation
on myself, and I was determined to bear it; nay, more than that, I did
not even regret the step I had taken.&nbsp; I longed to show my friends
that, even now, I was competent to undertake the charge, and able to
acquit myself honourably to the end; and if ever I felt it degrading
to submit so quietly, or intolerable to toil so constantly, I would
turn towards my home, and say within myself -<br>
<br>
<br>
They may crush, but they shall not subdue me!<br>
&rsquo;Tis of thee that I think, not of them.<br>
<br>
<br>
About Christmas I was allowed to visit home; but my holiday was only
of a fortnight&rsquo;s duration: &lsquo;For,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bloomfield,
&lsquo;I thought, as you had seen your friends so lately, you would
not care for a longer stay.&rsquo;&nbsp; I left her to think so still:
but she little knew how long, how wearisome those fourteen weeks of
absence had been to me; how intensely I had longed for my holidays,
how greatly I was disappointed at their curtailment.&nbsp; Yet she was
not to blame in this.&nbsp; I had never told her my feelings, and she
could not be expected to divine them; I had not been with her a full
term, and she was justified in not allowing me a full vacation.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IV - THE GRANDMAMMA<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I spare my readers the account of my delight on coming home, my happiness
while there - enjoying a brief space of rest and liberty in that dear,
familiar place, among the loving and the loved - and my sorrow on being
obliged to bid them, once more, a long adieu.<br>
<br>
I returned, however, with unabated vigour to my work - a more arduous
task than anyone can imagine, who has not felt something like the misery
of being charged with the care and direction of a set of mischievous,
turbulent rebels, whom his utmost exertions cannot bind to their duty;
while, at the same time, he is responsible for their conduct to a higher
power, who exacts from him what cannot be achieved without the aid of
the superior&rsquo;s more potent authority; which, either from indolence,
or the fear of becoming unpopular with the said rebellious gang, the
latter refuses to give.&nbsp; I can conceive few situations more harassing
than that wherein, however you may long for success, however you may
labour to fulfil your duty, your efforts are baffled and set at nought
by those beneath you, and unjustly censured and misjudged by those above.<br>
<br>
I have not enumerated half the vexatious propensities of my pupils,
or half the troubles resulting from my heavy responsibilities, for fear
of trespassing too much upon the reader&rsquo;s patience; as, perhaps,
I have already done; but my design in writing the few last pages was
not to amuse, but to benefit those whom it might concern; he that has
no interest in such matters will doubtless have skipped them over with
a cursory glance, and, perhaps, a malediction against the prolixity
of the writer; but if a parent has, therefrom, gathered any useful hint,
or an unfortunate governess received thereby the slightest benefit,
I am well rewarded for my pains.<br>
<br>
To avoid trouble and confusion, I have taken my pupils one by one, and
discussed their various qualities; but this can give no adequate idea
of being worried by the whole three together; when, as was often the
case, all were determined to &lsquo;be naughty, and to tease Miss Grey,
and put her in a passion.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Sometimes, on such occasions, the thought has suddenly occurred to me
- &lsquo;If they could see me now!&rsquo; meaning, of course, my friends
at home; and the idea of how they would pity me has made me pity myself
- so greatly that I have had the utmost difficulty to restrain my tears:
but I have restrained them, till my little tormentors were gone to dessert,
or cleared off to bed (my only prospects of deliverance), and then,
in all the bliss of solitude, I have given myself up to the luxury of
an unrestricted burst of weeping.&nbsp; But this was a weakness I did
not often indulge: my employments were too numerous, my leisure moments
too precious, to admit of much time being given to fruitless lamentations.<br>
<br>
I particularly remember one wild, snowy afternoon, soon after my return
in January: the children had all come up from dinner, loudly declaring
that they meant &lsquo;to be naughty;&rsquo; and they had well kept
their resolution, though I had talked myself hoarse, and wearied every
muscle in my throat, in the vain attempt to reason them out of it.&nbsp;
I had got Tom pinned up in a corner, whence, I told him, he should not
escape till he had done his appointed task.&nbsp; Meantime, Fanny had
possessed herself of my work-bag, and was rifling its contents - and
spitting into it besides.&nbsp; I told her to let it alone, but to no
purpose, of course.&nbsp; &lsquo;Burn it, Fanny!&rsquo; cried Tom: and
<i>this</i> command she hastened to obey.&nbsp; I sprang to snatch it
from the fire, and Tom darted to the door.&nbsp; &lsquo;Mary Ann, throw
her desk out of the window!&rsquo; cried he: and my precious desk, containing
my letters and papers, my small amount of cash, and all my valuables,
was about to be precipitated from the three-storey window.&nbsp; I flew
to rescue it.&nbsp; Meanwhile Tom had left the room, and was rushing
down the stairs, followed by Fanny.&nbsp; Having secured my desk, I
ran to catch them, and Mary Ann came scampering after.&nbsp; All three
escaped me, and ran out of the house into the garden, where they plunged
about in the snow, shouting and screaming in exultant glee.<br>
<br>
What must I do?&nbsp; If I followed them, I should probably be unable
to capture one, and only drive them farther away; if I did not, how
was I to get them in?&nbsp; And what would their parents think of me,
if they saw or heard the children rioting, hatless, bonnetless, gloveless,
and bootless, in the deep soft snow?&nbsp; While I stood in this perplexity,
just without the door, trying, by grim looks and angry words, to awe
them into subjection, I heard a voice behind me, in harshly piercing
tones, exclaiming, -<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Miss Grey!&nbsp; Is it possible?&nbsp; What, in the devil&rsquo;s
name, can you be thinking about?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t get them in, sir,&rsquo; said I, turning round,
and beholding Mr. Bloomfield, with his hair on end, and his pale blue
eyes bolting from their sockets.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But I INSIST upon their being got in!&rsquo; cried he, approaching
nearer, and looking perfectly ferocious.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Then, sir, you must call them yourself, if you please, for they
won&rsquo;t listen to me,&rsquo; I replied, stepping back.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Come in with you, you filthy brats; or I&rsquo;ll horsewhip you
every one!&rsquo; roared he; and the children instantly obeyed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There, you see! - they come at the first word!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, when <i>you</i> speak.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And it&rsquo;s very strange, that when you&rsquo;ve the care
of &rsquo;em you&rsquo;ve no better control over &rsquo;em than that!
- Now, there they are - gone upstairs with their nasty snowy feet!&nbsp;
Do go after &rsquo;em and see them made decent, for heaven&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
That gentleman&rsquo;s mother was then staying in the house; and, as
I ascended the stairs and passed the drawing-room door, I had the satisfaction
of hearing the old lady declaiming aloud to her daughter-in-law to this
effect (for I could only distinguish the most emphatic words) -<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Gracious heavens! - never in all my life - ! - get their death
as sure as - !&nbsp; Do you think, my dear, she&rsquo;s a <i>proper
person</i>?&nbsp; Take my word for it - &rsquo;<br>
<br>
I heard no more; but that sufficed.<br>
<br>
The senior Mrs. Bloomfield had been very attentive and civil to me;
and till now I had thought her a nice, kind-hearted, chatty old body.&nbsp;
She would often come to me and talk in a confidential strain; nodding
and shaking her head, and gesticulating with hands and eyes, as a certain
class of old ladies are won&rsquo;t to do; though I never knew one that
carried the peculiarity to so great an extent.&nbsp; She would even
sympathise with me for the trouble I had with the children, and express
at times, by half sentences, interspersed with nods and knowing winks,
her sense of the injudicious conduct of their mamma in so restricting
my power, and neglecting to support me with her authority.&nbsp; Such
a mode of testifying disapprobation was not much to my taste; and I
generally refused to take it in, or understand anything more than was
openly spoken; at least, I never went farther than an implied acknowledgment
that, if matters were otherwise ordered my task would be a less difficult
one, and I should be better able to guide and instruct my charge; but
now I must be doubly cautious.&nbsp; Hitherto, though I saw the old
lady had her defects (of which one was a proneness to proclaim her perfections),
I had always been wishful to excuse them, and to give her credit for
all the virtues she professed, and even imagine others yet untold.&nbsp;
Kindness, which had been the food of my life through so many years,
had lately been so entirely denied me, that I welcomed with grateful
joy the slightest semblance of it.&nbsp; No wonder, then, that my heart
warmed to the old lady, and always gladdened at her approach and regretted
her departure.<br>
<br>
But now, the few words luckily or unluckily heard in passing had wholly
revolutionized my ideas respecting her: now I looked upon her as hypocritical
and insincere, a flatterer, and a spy upon my words and deeds.&nbsp;
Doubtless it would have been my interest still to meet her with the
same cheerful smile and tone of respectful cordiality as before; but
I could not, if I would: my manner altered with my feelings, and became
so cold and shy that she could not fail to notice it.&nbsp; She soon
did notice it, and <i>her</i> manner altered too: the familiar nod was
changed to a stiff bow, the gracious smile gave place to a glare of
Gorgon ferocity; her vivacious loquacity was entirely transferred from
me to &lsquo;the darling boy and girls,&rsquo; whom she flattered and
indulged more absurdly than ever their mother had done.<br>
<br>
I confess I was somewhat troubled at this change: I feared the consequences
of her displeasure, and even made some efforts to recover the ground
I had lost - and with better apparent success than I could have anticipated.&nbsp;
At one time, I, merely in common civility, asked after her cough; immediately
her long visage relaxed into a smile, and she favoured me with a particular
history of that and her other infirmities, followed by an account of
her pious resignation, delivered in the usual emphatic, declamatory
style, which no writing can portray.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But there&rsquo;s one remedy for all, my dear, and that&rsquo;s
resignation&rsquo; (a toss of the head), &lsquo;resignation to the will
of heaven!&rsquo; (an uplifting of the hands and eyes).&nbsp; &lsquo;It
has always supported me through all my trials, and always will do&rsquo;
(a succession of nods).&nbsp; &lsquo;But then, it isn&rsquo;t everybody
that can say that&rsquo; (a shake of the head); &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m
one of the pious ones, Miss Grey!&rsquo; (a very significant nod and
toss).&nbsp; &lsquo;And, thank heaven, I always was&rsquo; (another
nod), &lsquo;and I glory in it!&rsquo; (an emphatic clasping of the
hands and shaking of the head).&nbsp; And with several texts of Scripture,
misquoted or misapplied, and religious exclamations so redolent of the
ludicrous in the style of delivery and manner of bringing in, if not
in the expressions themselves, that I decline repeating them, she withdrew;
tossing her large head in high good-humour - with herself at least -
and left me hoping that, after all, she was rather weak than wicked.<br>
<br>
At her next visit to Wellwood House, I went so far as to say I was glad
to see her looking so well.&nbsp; The effect of this was magical: the
words, intended as a mark of civility, were received as a flattering
compliment; her countenance brightened up, and from that moment she
became as gracious and benign as heart could wish - in outward semblance
at least.&nbsp; From what I now saw of her, and what I heard from the
children, I know that, in order to gain her cordial friendship, I had
but to utter a word of flattery at each convenient opportunity: but
this was against my principles; and for lack of this, the capricious
old dame soon deprived me of her favour again, and I believe did me
much secret injury.<br>
<br>
She could not greatly influence her daughter-in-law against me, because,
between that lady and herself there was a mutual dislike - chiefly shown
by her in secret detractions and calumniations; by the other, in an
excess of frigid formality in her demeanour; and no fawning flattery
of the elder could thaw away the wall of ice which the younger interposed
between them.&nbsp; But with her son, the old lady had better success:
he would listen to all she had to say, provided she could soothe his
fretful temper, and refrain from irritating him by her own asperities;
and I have reason to believe that she considerably strengthened his
prejudice against me.&nbsp; She would tell him that I shamefully neglected
the children, and even his wife did not attend to them as she ought;
and that he must look after them himself, or they would all go to ruin.<br>
<br>
Thus urged, he would frequently give himself the trouble of watching
them from the windows during their play; at times, he would follow them
through the grounds, and too often came suddenly upon them while they
were dabbling in the forbidden well, talking to the coachman in the
stables, or revelling in the filth of the farm-yard - and I, meanwhile,
wearily standing, by, having previously exhausted my energy in vain
attempts to get them away.&nbsp; Often, too, he would unexpectedly pop
his head into the schoolroom while the young people were at meals, and
find them spilling their milk over the table and themselves, plunging
their fingers into their own or each other&rsquo;s mugs, or quarrelling
over their victuals like a set of tiger&rsquo;s cubs.&nbsp; If I were
quiet at the moment, I was conniving at their disorderly conduct; if
(as was frequently the case) I happened to be exalting my voice to enforce
order, I was using undue violence, and setting the girls a bad example
by such ungentleness of tone and language.<br>
<br>
I remember one afternoon in spring, when, owing to the rain, they could
not go out; but, by some amazing good fortune, they had all finished
their lessons, and yet abstained from running down to tease their parents
- a trick that annoyed me greatly, but which, on rainy days, I seldom
could prevent their doing; because, below, they found novelty and amusement
- especially when visitors were in the house; and their mother, though
she bid me keep them in the schoolroom, would never chide them for leaving
it, or trouble herself to send them back.&nbsp; But this day they appeared
satisfied with, their present abode, and what is more wonderful still,
seemed disposed to play together without depending on me for amusement,
and without quarrelling with each other.&nbsp; Their occupation was
a somewhat puzzling one: they were all squatted together on the floor
by the window, over a heap of broken toys and a quantity of birds&rsquo;
eggs - or rather egg-shells, for the contents had luckily been abstracted.&nbsp;
These shells they had broken up and were pounding into small fragments,
to what end I could not imagine; but so long as they were quiet and
not in positive mischief, I did not care; and, with a feeling of unusual
repose, I sat by the fire, putting the finishing stitches to a frock
for Mary Ann&rsquo;s doll; intending, when that was done, to begin a
letter to my mother.&nbsp; Suddenly the door opened, and the dingy head
of Mr. Bloomfield looked in.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;All very quiet here!&nbsp; What are you doing?&rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No harm <i>to-day</i>, at least,&rsquo; thought I.&nbsp; But
he was of a different opinion.&nbsp; Advancing to the window, and seeing
the children&rsquo;s occupations, he testily exclaimed - &lsquo;What
in the world are you about?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;We&rsquo;re grinding egg-shells, papa!&rsquo; cried Tom.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;How <i>dare</i> you make such a mess, you little devils?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you see what confounded work you&rsquo;re making of the
carpet?&rsquo; (the carpet was a plain brown drugget).&nbsp; &lsquo;Miss
Grey, did you know what they were doing?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, sir.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You knew it?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You knew it! and you actually sat there and permitted them to
go on without a word of reproof!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think they were doing any harm.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Any harm!&nbsp; Why, look there!&nbsp; Just look at that carpet,
and see - was there ever anything like it in a Christian house before?&nbsp;
No wonder your room is not fit for a pigsty - no wonder your pupils
are worse than a litter of pigs! - no wonder - oh! I declare, it puts
me quite past my patience&rsquo; and he departed, shutting the door
after him with a bang that made the children laugh.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;It puts me quite past my patience too!&rsquo; muttered I, getting
up; and, seizing the poker, I dashed it repeatedly into the cinders,
and stirred them up with unwonted energy; thus easing my irritation
under pretence of mending the fire.<br>
<br>
After this, Mr. Bloomfield was continually looking in to see if the
schoolroom was in order; and, as the children were continually littering
the floor with fragments of toys, sticks, stones, stubble, leaves, and
other rubbish, which I could not prevent their bringing, or oblige them
to gather up, and which the servants refused to &lsquo;clean after them,&rsquo;
I had to spend a considerable portion of my valuable leisure moments
on my knees upon the floor, in painsfully reducing things to order.&nbsp;
Once I told them that they should not taste their supper till they had
picked up everything from the carpet; Fanny might have hers when she
had taken up a certain quantity, Mary Ann when she had gathered twice
as many, and Tom was to clear away the rest.&nbsp; Wonderful to state,
the girls did their part; but Tom was in such a fury that he flew upon
the table, scattered the bread and milk about the floor, struck his
sisters, kicked the coals out of the coal-pan, attempted to overthrow
the table and chairs, and seemed inclined to make a Douglas-larder of
the whole contents of the room: but I seized upon him, and, sending
Mary Ann to call her mamma, held him, in spite of kicks, blows, yells,
and execrations, till Mrs. Bloomfield made her appearance.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;What is the matter with my boy?&rsquo; said she.<br>
<br>
And when the matter was explained to her, all she did was to send for
the nursery-maid to put the room in order, and bring Master Bloomfield
his supper.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;There now,&rsquo; cried Tom, triumphantly, looking up from his
viands with his mouth almost too full for speech.&nbsp; &lsquo;There
now, Miss Grey! you see I&rsquo;ve got my supper in spite of you: and
I haven&rsquo;t picked up a single thing!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
The only person in the house who had any real sympathy for me was the
nurse; for she had suffered like afflictions, though in a smaller degree;
as she had not the task of teaching, nor was she so responsible for
the conduct of her charge.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, Miss Grey!&rsquo; she would say, &lsquo;you have some trouble
with them childer!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I have, indeed, Betty; and I daresay you know what it is.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Ay, I do so!&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t vex myself o&rsquo;er &rsquo;em
as you do.&nbsp; And then, you see, I hit &rsquo;em a slap sometimes:
and them little &rsquo;uns - I gives &rsquo;em a good whipping now and
then: there&rsquo;s nothing else will do for &rsquo;em, as what they
say.&nbsp; Howsoever, I&rsquo;ve lost my place for it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Have you, Betty?&nbsp; I heard you were going to leave.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Eh, bless you, yes!&nbsp; Missis gave me warning a three wik
sin&rsquo;.&nbsp; She told me afore Christmas how it mud be, if I hit
&rsquo;em again; but I couldn&rsquo;t hold my hand off &rsquo;em at
nothing.&nbsp; I know not how <i>you</i> do, for Miss Mary Ann&rsquo;s
worse by the half nor her sisters!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER V - THE UNCLE<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Besides the old lady, there was another relative of the family, whose
visits were a great annoyance to me - this was &lsquo;Uncle Robson,&rsquo;
Mrs. Bloomfield&rsquo;s brother; a tall, self-sufficient fellow, with
dark hair and sallow complexion like his sister, a nose that seemed
to disdain the earth, and little grey eyes, frequently half-closed,
with a mixture of real stupidity and affected contempt of all surrounding
objects.&nbsp; He was a thick-set, strongly-built man, but he had found
some means of compressing his waist into a remarkably small compass;
and that, together with the unnatural stillness of his form, showed
that the lofty-minded, manly Mr. Robson, the scorner of the female sex,
was not above the foppery of stays.&nbsp; He seldom deigned to notice
me; and, when he did, it was with a certain supercilious insolence of
tone and manner that convinced me he was no gentleman: though it was
intended to have a contrary effect.&nbsp; But it was not for that I
disliked his coming, so much as for the harm he did the children - encouraging
all their evil propensities, and undoing in a few minutes the little
good it had taken me months of labour to achieve.<br>
<br>
Fanny and little Harriet he seldom condescended to notice; but Mary
Ann was something of a favourite.&nbsp; He was continually encouraging
her tendency to affectation (which I had done my utmost to crush), talking
about her pretty face, and filling her head with all manner of conceited
notions concerning her personal appearance (which I had instructed her
to regard as dust in the balance compared with the cultivation of her
mind and manners); and I never saw a child so susceptible of flattery
as she was.&nbsp; Whatever was wrong, in either her or her brother,
he would encourage by laughing at, if not by actually praising: people
little know the injury they do to children by laughing at their faults,
and making a pleasant jest of what their true friends have endeavoured
to teach them to hold in grave abhorrence.<br>
<br>
Though not a positive drunkard, Mr. Robson habitually swallowed great
quantities of wine, and took with relish an occasional glass of brandy
and water.&nbsp; He taught his nephew to imitate him in this to the
utmost of his ability, and to believe that the more wine and spirits
he could take, and the better he liked them, the more he manifested
his bold, and manly spirit, and rose superior to his sisters.&nbsp;
Mr. Bloomfield had not much to say against it, for his favourite beverage
was gin and water; of which he took a considerable portion every day,
by dint of constant sipping - and to that I chiefly attributed his dingy
complexion and waspish temper.<br>
<br>
Mr. Robson likewise encouraged Tom&rsquo;s propensity to persecute the
lower creation, both by precept and example.&nbsp; As he frequently
came to course or shoot over his brother-in-law&rsquo;s grounds, he
would bring his favourite dogs with him; and he treated them so brutally
that, poor as I was, I would have given a sovereign any day to see one
of them bite him, provided the animal could have done it with impunity.&nbsp;
Sometimes, when in a very complacent mood, he would go a-birds&rsquo;-nesting
with the children, a thing that irritated and annoyed me exceedingly;
as, by frequent and persevering attempts, I flattered myself I had partly
shown them the evil of this pastime, and hoped, in time, to bring them
to some general sense of justice and humanity; but ten minutes&rsquo;
birds&rsquo;-nesting with uncle Robson, or even a laugh from him at
some relation of their former barbarities, was sufficient at once to
destroy the effect of my whole elaborate course of reasoning and persuasion.&nbsp;
Happily, however, during that spring, they never, but once, got anything
but empty nests, or eggs - being too impatient to leave them till the
birds were hatched; that once, Tom, who had been with his uncle into
the neighbouring plantation, came running in high glee into the garden,
with a brood of little callow nestlings in his hands.&nbsp; Mary Ann
and Fanny, whom I was just bringing out, ran to admire his spoils, and
to beg each a bird for themselves.&nbsp; &lsquo;No, not one!&rsquo;
cried Tom.&nbsp; &lsquo;They&rsquo;re all mine; uncle Robson gave them
to me - one, two, three, four, five - you shan&rsquo;t touch one of
them! no, not one, for your lives!&rsquo; continued he, exultingly;
laying the nest on the ground, and standing over it with his legs wide
apart, his hands thrust into his breeches-pockets, his body bent forward,
and his face twisted into all manner of contortions in the ecstasy of
his delight.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But you shall see me fettle &rsquo;em off.&nbsp; My word, but
I <i>will</i> wallop &rsquo;em?&nbsp; See if I don&rsquo;t now.&nbsp;
By gum! but there&rsquo;s rare sport for me in that nest.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But, Tom,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I shall not allow you to torture
those birds.&nbsp; They must either be killed at once or carried back
to the place you took them from, that the old birds may continue to
feed them.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But you don&rsquo;t know where that is, Madam: it&rsquo;s only
me and uncle Robson that knows that.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But if you don&rsquo;t tell me, I shall kill them myself - much
as I hate it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You daren&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You daren&rsquo;t touch them for your
life! because you know papa and mamma, and uncle Robson, would be angry.&nbsp;
Ha, ha! I&rsquo;ve caught you there, Miss!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I shall do what I think right in a case of this sort without
consulting any one.&nbsp; If your papa and mamma don&rsquo;t happen
to approve of it, I shall be sorry to offend them; but your uncle Robson&rsquo;s
opinions, of course, are nothing to me.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
So saying - urged by a sense of duty - at the risk of both making myself
sick and incurring the wrath of my employers - I got a large flat stone,
that had been reared up for a mouse-trap by the gardener; then, having
once more vainly endeavoured to persuade the little tyrant to let the
birds be carried back, I asked what he intended to do with them.&nbsp;
With fiendish glee he commenced a list of torments; and while he was
busied in the relation, I dropped the stone upon his intended victims
and crushed them flat beneath it.&nbsp; Loud were the outcries, terrible
the execrations, consequent upon this daring outrage; uncle Robson had
been coming up the walk with his gun, and was just then pausing to kick
his dog.&nbsp; Tom flew towards him, vowing he would make him kick me
instead of Juno.&nbsp; Mr. Robson leant upon his gun, and laughed excessively
at the violence of his nephew&rsquo;s passion, and the bitter maledictions
and opprobrious epithets he heaped upon me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, you <i>are</i>
a good &rsquo;un!&rsquo; exclaimed he, at length, taking up his weapon
and proceeding towards the house.&nbsp; &lsquo;Damme, but the lad has
some spunk in him, too.&nbsp; Curse me, if ever I saw a nobler little
scoundrel than that.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s beyond petticoat government already:
by God! he defies mother, granny, governess, and all!&nbsp; Ha, ha,
ha!&nbsp; Never mind, Tom, I&rsquo;ll get you another brood to-morrow.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;If you do, Mr. Robson, I shall kill them too,&rsquo; said I.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; replied he, and having honoured me with a broad
stare - which, contrary to his expectations, I sustained without flinching
- he turned away with an air of supreme contempt, and stalked into the
house.&nbsp; Tom next went to tell his mamma.&nbsp; It was not her way
to say much on any subject; but, when she next saw me, her aspect and
demeanour were doubly dark and chilled.&nbsp; After some casual remark
about the weather, she observed - &lsquo;I am sorry, Miss Grey, you
should think it necessary to interfere with Master Bloomfield&rsquo;s
amusements; he was very much distressed about your destroying the birds.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;When Master Bloomfield&rsquo;s amusements consist in injuring
sentient creatures,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;I think it my duty to
interfere.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You seemed to have forgotten,&rsquo; said she, calmly, &lsquo;that
the creatures were all created for our convenience.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I thought that doctrine admitted some doubt, but merely replied - &lsquo;If
they were, we have no right to torment them for our amusement.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I think,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;a child&rsquo;s amusement is
scarcely to be weighed against the welfare of a soulless brute.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But, for the child&rsquo;s own sake, it ought not to be encouraged
to have such amusements,&rsquo; answered I, as meekly as I could, to
make up for such unusual pertinacity.&nbsp; &lsquo;&ldquo;Blessed are
the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.&rdquo;&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh! of course; but that refers to our conduct towards each other.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;The merciful man shows mercy to his beast,&rdquo;&rsquo;
I ventured to add.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I think <i>you</i> have not shown much mercy,&rsquo; replied
she, with a short, bitter laugh; &lsquo;killing the poor birds by wholesale
in that shocking manner, and putting the dear boy to such misery for
a mere whim.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I judged it prudent to say no more.&nbsp; This was the nearest approach
to a quarrel I ever had with Mrs. Bloomfield; as well as the greatest
number of words I ever exchanged with her at one time, since the day
of my first arrival.<br>
<br>
But Mr. Robson and old Mrs. Bloomfield were not the only guests whose
coming to Wellwood House annoyed me; every visitor disturbed me more
or less; not so much because they neglected me (though I did feel their
conduct strange and disagreeable in that respect), as because I found
it impossible to keep my pupils away from them, as I was repeatedly
desired to do: Tom must talk to them, and Mary Ann must be noticed by
them.&nbsp; Neither the one nor the other knew what it was to feel any
degree of shamefacedness, or even common modesty.&nbsp; They would indecently
and clamorously interrupt the conversation of their elders, tease them
with the most impertinent questions, roughly collar the gentlemen, climb
their knees uninvited, hang about their shoulders or rifle their pockets,
pull the ladies&rsquo; gowns, disorder their hair, tumble their collars,
and importunately beg for their trinkets.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Bloomfield had the sense to be shocked and annoyed at all this,
but she had not sense to prevent it: she expected me to prevent it.&nbsp;
But how could I - when the guests, with their fine clothes and new faces,
continually flattered and indulged them, out of complaisance to their
parents - how could I, with my homely garments, every-day face, and
honest words, draw them away?&nbsp; I strained every nerve to do so:
by striving to amuse them, I endeavoured to attract them to my side;
by the exertion of such authority as I possessed, and by such severity
as I dared to use, I tried to deter them from tormenting the guests;
and by reproaching their unmannerly conduct, to make them ashamed to
repeat it.&nbsp; But they knew no shame; they scorned authority which
had no terrors to back it; and as for kindness and affection, either
they had no hearts, or such as they had were so strongly guarded, and
so well concealed, that I, with all my efforts, had not yet discovered
how to reach them.<br>
<br>
But soon my trials in this quarter came to a close - sooner than I either
expected or desired; for one sweet evening towards the close of May,
as I was rejoicing in the near approach of the holidays, and congratulating
myself upon having made some progress with my pupils (as far as their
learning went, at least, for I <i>had</i> instilled <i>something</i>
into their heads, and I had, at length, brought them to be a little
- a very little - more rational about getting their lessons done in
time to leave some space for recreation, instead of tormenting themselves
and me all day long to no purpose), Mrs. Bloomfield sent for me, and
calmly told me that after Midsummer my services would be no longer required.&nbsp;
She assured me that my character and general conduct were unexceptionable;
but the children had made so little improvement since my arrival that
Mr. Bloomfield and she felt it their duty to seek some other mode of
instruction.&nbsp; Though superior to most children of their years in
abilities, they were decidedly behind them in attainments; their manners
were uncultivated, and their tempers unruly.&nbsp; And this she attributed
to a want of sufficient firmness, and diligent, persevering care on
my part.<br>
<br>
Unshaken firmness, devoted diligence, unwearied perseverance, unceasing
care, were the very qualifications on which I had secretly prided myself;
and by which I had hoped in time to overcome all difficulties, and obtain
success at last.&nbsp; I wished to say something in my own justification;
but in attempting to speak, I felt my voice falter; and rather than
testify any emotion, or suffer the tears to overflow that were already
gathering in my eyes, I chose to keep silence, and bear all like a self-convicted
culprit.<br>
<br>
Thus was I dismissed, and thus I sought my home.&nbsp; Alas! what would
they think of me? unable, after all my boasting, to keep my place, even
for a single year, as governess to three small children, whose mother
was asserted by my own aunt to be a &lsquo;very nice woman.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Having been thus weighed in the balance and found wanting, I need not
hope they would be willing to try me again.&nbsp; And this was an unwelcome
thought; for vexed, harassed, disappointed as I had been, and greatly
as I had learned to love and value my home, I was not yet weary of adventure,
nor willing to relax my efforts.&nbsp; I knew that all parents were
not like Mr. and Mrs. Bloomfield, and I was certain all children were
not like theirs.&nbsp; The next family must be different, and any change
must be for the better.&nbsp; I had been seasoned by adversity, and
tutored by experience, and I longed to redeem my lost honour in the
eyes of those whose opinion was more than that of all the world to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VI - THE PARSONAGE AGAIN<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
For a few months I remained peaceably at home, in the quiet enjoyment
of liberty and rest, and genuine friendship, from all of which I had
fasted so long; and in the earnest prosecution of my studies, to recover
what I had lost during my stay at Wellwood House, and to lay in new
stores for future use.&nbsp; My father&rsquo;s health was still very
infirm, but not materially worse than when I last saw him; and I was
glad I had it in my power to cheer him by my return, and to amuse him
with singing his favourite songs.<br>
<br>
No one triumphed over my failure, or said I had better have taken his
or her advice, and quietly stayed at home.&nbsp; All were glad to have
me back again, and lavished more kindness than ever upon me, to make
up for the sufferings I had undergone; but not one would touch a shilling
of what I had so cheerfully earned and so carefully saved, in the hope
of sharing it with them.&nbsp; By dint of pinching here, and scraping
there, our debts were already nearly paid.&nbsp; Mary had had good success
with her drawings; but our father had insisted upon <i>her</i> likewise
keeping all the produce of her industry to herself.&nbsp; All we could
spare from the supply of our humble wardrobe and our little casual expenses,
he directed us to put into the savings&rsquo;-bank; saying, we knew
not how soon we might be dependent on that alone for support: for he
felt he had not long to be with us, and what would become of our mother
and us when he was gone, God only knew!<br>
<br>
Dear papa! if he had troubled himself less about the afflictions that
threatened us in case of his death, I am convinced that dreaded event
would not have taken place so soon.&nbsp; My mother would never suffer
him to ponder on the subject if she could help it.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, Richard!&rsquo; exclaimed she, on one occasion, &lsquo;if
you would but dismiss such gloomy subjects from your mind, you would
live as long as any of us; at least you would live to see the girls
married, and yourself a happy grandfather, with a canty old dame for
your companion.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
My mother laughed, and so did my father: but his laugh soon perished
in a dreary sigh.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;<i>They</i> married - poor penniless things!&rsquo; said he;
&lsquo;who will take them I wonder!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Why, nobody shall that isn&rsquo;t thankful for them.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t
I penniless when you took me? and you <i>pretended</i>, at least, to
be vastly pleased with your acquisition.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s no matter
whether they get married or not: we can devise a thousand honest ways
of making a livelihood.&nbsp; And I wonder, Richard, you can think of
bothering your head about our <i>poverty</i> in case of your death;
as if <i>that</i> would be anything compared with the calamity of losing
you - an affliction that you well know would swallow up all others,
and which you ought to do your utmost to preserve us from: and there
is nothing like a cheerful mind for keeping the body in health.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I know, Alice, it is wrong to keep repining as I do, but I cannot
help it: you must bear with me.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I <i>won&rsquo;t</i> bear with you, if I can alter you,&rsquo;
replied my mother: but the harshness of her words was undone by the
earnest affection of her tone and pleasant smile, that made my father
smile again, less sadly and less transiently than was his wont.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Mamma,&rsquo; said I, as soon as I could find an opportunity
of speaking with her alone, &lsquo;my money is but little, and cannot
last long; if I could increase it, it would lessen papa&rsquo;s anxiety,
on one subject at least.&nbsp; I cannot draw like Mary, and so the best
thing I could do would be to look out for another situation.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And so you would actually try again, Agnes?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Decidedly, I would.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Why, my dear, I should have thought you had had enough of it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I know,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;everybody is not like Mr. and Mrs.
Bloomfield - &rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Some are worse,&rsquo; interrupted my mother.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But not many, I think,&rsquo; replied I, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m
sure all children are not like theirs; for I and Mary were not: we always
did as you bid us, didn&rsquo;t we?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Generally: but then, I did not spoil you; and you were not perfect
angels after all: Mary had a fund of quiet obstinacy, and you were somewhat
faulty in regard to temper; but you were very good children on the whole.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I know I was sulky sometimes, and I should have been glad to
see these children sulky sometimes too; for then I could have understood
them: but they never were, for they <i>could</i> not be offended, nor
hurt, nor ashamed: they could not be unhappy in any way, except when
they were in a passion.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, if they <i>could</i> not, it was not their fault: you cannot
expect stone to be as pliable as clay.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, but still it is very unpleasant to live with such unimpressible,
incomprehensible creatures.&nbsp; You cannot love them; and if you could,
your love would be utterly thrown away: they could neither return it,
nor value, nor understand it.&nbsp; But, however, even if I should stumble
on such a family again, which is quite unlikely, I have all this experience
to begin with, and I should manage better another time; and the end
and aim of this preamble is, let me try again.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, my girl, you are not easily discouraged, I see: I am glad
of that.&nbsp; But, let me tell you, you are a good deal paler and thinner
than when you first left home; and we cannot have you undermining your
health to hoard up money either for yourself or others.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Mary tells me I am changed too; and I don&rsquo;t much wonder
at it, for I was in a constant state of agitation and anxiety all day
long: but next time I am determined to take things coolly.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
After some further discussion, my mother promised once more to assist
me, provided I would wait and be patient; and I left her to broach the
matter to my father, when and how she deemed it most advisable: never
doubting her ability to obtain his consent.&nbsp; Meantime, I searched,
with great interest, the advertising columns of the newspapers, and
wrote answers to every &lsquo;Wanted a Governess&rsquo; that appeared
at all eligible; but all my letters, as well as the replies, when I
got any, were dutifully shown to my mother; and she, to my chagrin,
made me reject the situations one after another: these were low people,
these were too exacting in their demands, and these too niggardly in
their remuneration.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Your talents are not such as every poor clergyman&rsquo;s daughter
possesses, Agnes,&rsquo; she would say, &lsquo;and you must not throw
them away.&nbsp; Remember, you promised to be patient: there is no need
of hurry: you have plenty of time before you, and may have many chances
yet.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
At length, she advised me to put an advertisement, myself, in the paper,
stating my qualifications, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Music, singing, drawing, French, Latin, and German,&rsquo; said
she, &lsquo;are no mean assemblage: many will be glad to have so much
in one instructor; and this time, you shall try your fortune in a somewhat
higher family in that of some genuine, thoroughbred gentleman; for such
are far more likely to treat you with proper respect and consideration
than those purse-proud tradespeople and arrogant upstarts.&nbsp; I have
known several among the higher ranks who treated their governesses quite
as one of the family; though some, I allow, are as insolent and exacting
as any one else can be: for there are bad and good in all classes.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
The advertisement was quickly written and despatched.&nbsp; Of the two
parties who answered it, but one would consent to give me fifty pounds,
the sum my mother bade me name as the salary I should require; and here,
I hesitated about engaging myself, as I feared the children would be
too old, and their parents would require some one more showy, or more
experienced, if not more accomplished than I.&nbsp; But my mother dissuaded
me from declining it on that account: I should do vastly well, she said,
if I would only throw aside my diffidence, and acquire a little more
confidence in myself.&nbsp; I was just to give a plain, true statement
of my acquirements and qualifications, and name what stipulations I
chose to make, and then await the result.&nbsp; The only stipulation
I ventured to propose, was that I might be allowed two months&rsquo;
holidays during the year to visit my friends, at Midsummer and Christmas.&nbsp;
The unknown lady, in her reply, made no objection to this, and stated
that, as to my acquirements, she had no doubt I should be able to give
satisfaction; but in the engagement of governesses she considered those
things as but subordinate points; as being situated in the neighbourhood
of O---, she could get masters to supply any deficiencies in that respect:
but, in her opinion, next to unimpeachable morality, a mild and cheerful
temper and obliging disposition were the most essential requisities.<br>
<br>
My mother did not relish this at all, and now made many objections to
my accepting the situation; in which my sister warmly supported her:
but, unwilling to be balked again, I overruled them all; and, having
first obtained the consent of my father (who had, a short time previously,
been apprised of these transactions), I wrote a most obliging epistle
to my unknown correspondent, and, finally, the bargain was concluded.<br>
<br>
It was decreed that on the last day of January I was to enter upon my
new office as governess in the family of Mr. Murray, of Horton Lodge,
near O---, about seventy miles from our village: a formidable distance
to me, as I had never been above twenty miles from home in all the course
of my twenty years&rsquo; sojourn on earth; and as, moreover, every
individual in that family and in the neighbourhood was utterly unknown
to myself and all my acquaintances.&nbsp; But this rendered it only
the more piquant to me.&nbsp; I had now, in some measure, got rid of
the <i>mauvaise honte</i> that had formerly oppressed me so much; there
was a pleasing excitement in the idea of entering these unknown regions,
and making my way alone among its strange inhabitants.&nbsp; I now flattered
myself I was going to see something in the world: Mr. Murray&rsquo;s
residence was near a large town, and not in a manufacturing district,
where the people had nothing to do but to make money; his rank from
what I could gather, appeared to be higher than that of Mr. Bloomfield;
and, doubtless, he was one of those genuine thoroughbred gentry my mother
spoke of, who would treat his governess with due consideration as a
respectable well-educated lady, the instructor and guide of his children,
and not a mere upper servant.&nbsp; Then, my pupils being older, would
be more rational, more teachable, and less troublesome than the last;
they would be less confined to the schoolroom, and not require that
constant labour and incessant watching; and, finally, bright visions
mingled with my hopes, with which the care of children and the mere
duties of a governess had little or nothing to do.&nbsp; Thus, the reader
will see that I had no claim to be regarded as a martyr to filial piety,
going forth to sacrifice peace and liberty for the sole purpose of laying
up stores for the comfort and support of my parents: though certainly
the comfort of my father, and the future support of my mother, had a
large share in my calculations; and fifty pounds appeared to me no ordinary
sum.&nbsp; I must have decent clothes becoming my station; I must, it
seemed, put out my washing, and also pay for my four annual journeys
between Horton Lodge and home; but with strict attention to economy,
surely twenty pounds, or little more, would cover those expenses, and
then there would be thirty for the bank, or little less: what a valuable
addition to our stock!&nbsp; Oh, I must struggle to keep this situation,
whatever it might be! both for my own honour among my friends and for
the solid services I might render them by my continuance there.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VII - HORTON LODGE<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The 31st of January was a wild, tempestuous day: there was a strong
north wind, with a continual storm of snow drifting on the ground and
whirling through the air.&nbsp; My friends would have had me delay my
departure, but fearful of prejudicing my employers against me by such
want of punctuality at the commencement of my undertaking, I persisted
in keeping the appointment.<br>
<br>
I will not inflict upon my readers an account of my leaving home on
that dark winter morning: the fond farewells, the long, long journey
to O---, the solitary waitings in inns for coaches or trains - for there
were some railways then - and, finally, the meeting at O--- with Mr.
Murray&rsquo;s servant, who had been sent with the phaeton to drive
me from thence to Horton Lodge.&nbsp; I will just state that the heavy
snow had thrown such impediments in the way of both horses and steam-engines,
that it was dark some hours before I reached my journey&rsquo;s end,
and that a most bewildering storm came on at last, which made the few
miles&rsquo; space between O--- and Horton Lodge a long and formidable
passage.&nbsp; I sat resigned, with the cold, sharp snow drifting through
my veil and filling my lap, seeing nothing, and wondering how the unfortunate
horse and driver could make their way even as well as they did; and
indeed it was but a toilsome, creeping style of progression, to say
the best of it.&nbsp; At length we paused; and, at the call of the driver,
someone unlatched and rolled back upon their creaking hinges what appeared
to be the park gates.&nbsp; Then we proceeded along a smoother road,
whence, occasionally, I perceived some huge, hoary mass gleaming through
the darkness, which I took to be a portion of a snow-clad tree.&nbsp;
After a considerable time we paused again, before the stately portico
of a large house with long windows descending to the ground.<br>
<br>
I rose with some difficulty from under the superincumbent snowdrift,
and alighted from the carriage, expecting that a kind and hospitable
reception would indemnify me for the toils and hardships of the day.&nbsp;
A gentleman person in black opened the door, and admitted me into a
spacious hall, lighted by an amber-coloured lamp suspended from the
ceiling; he led me through this, along a passage, and opening the door
of a back room, told me that was the schoolroom.&nbsp; I entered, and
found two young ladies and two young gentlemen - my future pupils, I
supposed.&nbsp; After a formal greeting, the elder girl, who was trifling
over a piece of canvas and a basket of German wools, asked if I should
like to go upstairs.&nbsp; I replied in the affirmative, of course.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Matilda, take a candle, and show her her room,&rsquo; said she.<br>
<br>
Miss Matilda, a strapping hoyden of about fourteen, with a short frock
and trousers, shrugged her shoulders and made a slight grimace, but
took a candle and proceeded before me up the back stairs (a long, steep,
double flight), and through a long, narrow passage, to a small but tolerably
comfortable room.&nbsp; She then asked me if I would take some tea or
coffee.&nbsp; I was about to answer No; but remembering that I had taken
nothing since seven o&rsquo;clock that morning, and feeling faint in
consequence, I said I would take a cup of tea.&nbsp; Saying she would
tell &lsquo;Brown,&rsquo; the young lady departed; and by the time I
had divested myself of my heavy, wet cloak, shawl, bonnet, &amp;c.,
a mincing damsel came to say the young ladies desired to know whether
I would take my tea up there or in the schoolroom.&nbsp; Under the plea
of fatigue I chose to take it there.&nbsp; She withdrew; and, after
a while, returned again with a small tea-tray, and placed it on the
chest of drawers, which served as a dressing-table.&nbsp; Having civilly
thanked her, I asked at what time I should be expected to rise in the
morning.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The young ladies and gentlemen breakfast at half-past eight,
ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;they rise early; but, as they seldom
do any lessons before breakfast, I should think it will do if you rise
soon after seven.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I desired her to be so kind as to call me at seven, and, promising to
do so, she withdrew.&nbsp; Then, having broken my long fast on a cup
of tea and a little thin bread and butter, I sat down beside the small,
smouldering fire, and amused myself with a hearty fit of crying; after
which, I said my prayers, and then, feeling considerably relieved, began
to prepare for bed.&nbsp; Finding that none of my luggage was brought
up, I instituted a search for the bell; and failing to discover any
signs of such a convenience in any corner of the room, I took my candle
and ventured through the long passage, and down the steep stairs, on
a voyage of discovery.&nbsp; Meeting a well-dressed female on the way,
I told her what I wanted; but not without considerable hesitation, as
I was not quite sure whether it was one of the upper servants, or Mrs.
Murray herself: it happened, however, to be the lady&rsquo;s-maid.&nbsp;
With the air of one conferring an unusual favour, she vouchsafed to
undertake the sending up of my things; and when I had re-entered my
room, and waited and wondered a long time (greatly fearing that she
had forgotten or neglected to perform her promise, and doubting whether
to keep waiting or go to bed, or go down again), my hopes, at length,
were revived by the sound of voices and laughter, accompanied by the
tramp of feet along the passage; and presently the luggage was brought
in by a rough-looking maid and a man, neither of them very respectful
in their demeanour to me.&nbsp; Having shut the door upon their retiring
footsteps, and unpacked a few of my things, I betook myself to rest;
gladly enough, for I was weary in body and mind.<br>
<br>
It was with a strange feeling of desolation, mingled with a strong sense
of the novelty of my situation, and a joyless kind of curiosity concerning
what was yet unknown, that I awoke the next morning; feeling like one
whirled away by enchantment, and suddenly dropped from the clouds into
a remote and unknown land, widely and completely isolated from all he
had ever seen or known before; or like a thistle-seed borne on the wind
to some strange nook of uncongenial soil, where it must lie long enough
before it can take root and germinate, extracting nourishment from what
appears so alien to its nature: if, indeed, it ever can.&nbsp; But this
gives no proper idea of my feelings at all; and no one that has not
lived such a retired, stationary life as mine, can possibly imagine
what they were: hardly even if he has known what it is to awake some
morning, and find himself in Port Nelson, in New Zealand, with a world
of waters between himself and all that knew him.<br>
<br>
I shall not soon forget the peculiar feeling with which I raised my
blind and looked out upon the unknown world: a wide, white wilderness
was all that met my gaze; a waste of<br>
<br>
<br>
Deserts tossed in snow,<br>
And heavy laden groves.<br>
<br>
<br>
I descended to the schoolroom with no remarkable eagerness to join my
pupils, though not without some feeling of curiosity respecting what
a further acquaintance would reveal.&nbsp; One thing, among others of
more obvious importance, I determined with myself - I must begin with
calling them Miss and Master.&nbsp; It seemed to me a chilling and unnatural
piece of punctilio between the children of a family and their instructor
and daily companion; especially where the former were in their early
childhood, as at Wellwood House; but even there, my calling the little
Bloomfields by their simple names had been regarded as an offensive
liberty: as their parents had taken care to show me, by carefully designating
them <i>Master</i> and <i>Miss</i> Bloomfield, &amp;c., in speaking
to me.&nbsp; I had been very slow to take the hint, because the whole
affair struck me as so very absurd; but now I determined to be wiser,
and begin at once with as much form and ceremony as any member of the
family would be likely to require: and, indeed, the children being so
much older, there would be less difficulty; though the little words
Miss and Master seemed to have a surprising effect in repressing all
familiar, open-hearted kindness, and extinguishing every gleam of cordiality
that might arise between us.<br>
<br>
As I cannot, like Dogberry, find it in my heart to bestow all my tediousness
upon the reader, I will not go on to bore him with a minute detail of
all the discoveries and proceedings of this and the following day.&nbsp;
No doubt he will be amply satisfied with a slight sketch of the different
members of the family, and a general view of the first year or two of
my sojourn among them.<br>
<br>
To begin with the head: Mr. Murray was, by all accounts, a blustering,
roystering, country squire: a devoted fox-hunter, a skilful horse-jockey
and farrier, an active, practical farmer, and a hearty <i>bon vivant</i>.&nbsp;
By all accounts, I say; for, except on Sundays, when he went to church,
I never saw him from month to month: unless, in crossing the hall or
walking in the grounds, the figure of a tall, stout gentleman, with
scarlet cheeks and crimson nose, happened to come across me; on which
occasions, if he passed near enough to speak, an unceremonious nod,
accompanied by a &lsquo;Morning, Miss Grey,&rsquo; or some such brief
salutation, was usually vouchsafed.&nbsp;  Frequently, indeed, his loud
laugh reached me from afar; and oftener still I heard him swearing and
blaspheming against the footmen, groom, coachman, or some other hapless
dependant.<br>
<br>
Mrs. Murray was a handsome, dashing lady of forty, who certainly required
neither rouge nor padding to add to her charms; and whose chief enjoyments
were, or seemed to be, in giving or frequenting parties, and in dressing
at the very top of the fashion.&nbsp; I did not see her till eleven
o&rsquo;clock on the morning after my arrival; when she honoured me
with a visit, just as my mother might step into the kitchen to see a
new servant-girl: yet not so, either, for my mother would have seen
her immediately after her arrival, and not waited till the next day;
and, moreover, she would have addressed her in a more kind and friendly
manner, and given her some words of comfort as well as a plain exposition
of her duties; but Mrs. Murray did neither the one nor the other.&nbsp;
She just stepped into the schoolroom on her return from ordering dinner
in the housekeeper&rsquo;s room, bade me good-morning, stood for two
minutes by the fire, said a few words about the weather and the &lsquo;rather
rough&rsquo; journey I must have had yesterday; petted her youngest
child - a boy of ten - who had just been wiping his mouth and hands
on her gown, after indulging in some savoury morsel from the housekeeper&rsquo;s
store; told me what a sweet, good boy he was; and then sailed out, with
a self-complacent smile upon her face: thinking, no doubt, that she
had done quite enough for the present, and had been delightfully condescending
into the bargain.&nbsp; Her children evidently held the same opinion,
and I alone thought otherwise.<br>
<br>
After this she looked in upon me once or twice, during the absence of
my pupils, to enlighten me concerning my duties towards them.&nbsp;
For the girls she seemed anxious only to render them as superficially
attractive and showily accomplished as they could possibly be made,
without present trouble or discomfort to themselves; and I was to act
accordingly - to study and strive to amuse and oblige, instruct, refine,
and polish, with the least possible exertion on their part, and no exercise
of authority on mine.&nbsp; With regard to the two boys, it was much
the same; only instead of accomplishments, I was to get the greatest
possible quantity of Latin grammar and Valpy&rsquo;s Delectus into their
heads, in order to fit them for school - the greatest possible quantity
at least <i>without</i> trouble to themselves.&nbsp; John might be a
&lsquo;little high-spirited,&rsquo; and Charles might be a little &lsquo;nervous
and tedious - &rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But at all events, Miss Grey,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I hope
<i>you</i> will keep your temper, and be mild and patient throughout;
especially with the dear little Charles; he is so extremely nervous
and susceptible, and so utterly unaccustomed to anything but the tenderest
treatment.&nbsp; You will excuse my naming these things to you; for
the fact is, I have hitherto found all the governesses, even the very
best of them, faulty in this particular.&nbsp; They wanted that meek
and quiet spirit, which St. Matthew, or some of them, says is better
than the putting on of apparel - you will know the passage to which
I allude, for you are a clergyman&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; But I have
no doubt you will give satisfaction in this respect as well as the rest.&nbsp;
And remember, on all occasions, when any of the young people do anything
improper, if persuasion and gentle remonstrance will not do, let one
of the others come and tell me; for I can speak to them more plainly
than it would be proper for you to do.&nbsp; And make them as happy
as you can, Miss Grey, and I dare say you will do very well.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I observed that while Mrs. Murray was so extremely solicitous for the
comfort and happiness of her children, and continually talking about
it, she never once mentioned mine; though they were at home, surrounded
by friends, and I an alien among strangers; and I did not yet know enough
of the world, not to be considerably surprised at this anomaly.<br>
<br>
Miss Murray, otherwise Rosalie, was about sixteen when I came, and decidedly
a very pretty girl; and in two years longer, as time more completely
developed her form and added grace to her carriage and deportment, she
became positively beautiful; and that in no common degree.&nbsp; She
was tall and slender, yet not thin; perfectly formed, exquisitely fair,
though not without a brilliant, healthy bloom; her hair, which she wore
in a profusion of long ringlets, was of a very light brown inclining
to yellow; her eyes were pale blue, but so clear and bright that few
would wish them darker; the rest of her features were small, not quite
regular, and not remarkably otherwise: but altogether you could not
hesitate to pronounce her a very lovely girl.&nbsp; I wish I could say
as much for mind and disposition as I can for her form and face.<br>
<br>
Yet think not I have any dreadful disclosures to make: she was lively,
light-hearted, and could be very agreeable, with those who did not cross
her will.&nbsp; Towards me, when I first came, she was cold and haughty,
then insolent and overbearing; but, on a further acquaintance, she gradually
laid aside her airs, and in time became as deeply attached to me as
it was possible for <i>her</i> to be to one of my character and position:
for she seldom lost sight, for above half an hour at a time, of the
fact of my being a hireling and a poor curate&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp;
And yet, upon the whole, I believe she respected me more than she herself
was aware of; because I was the only person in the house who steadily
professed good principles, habitually spoke the truth, and generally
endeavoured to make inclination bow to duty; and this I say, not, of
course, in commendation of myself, but to show the unfortunate state
of the family to which my services were, for the present, devoted.&nbsp;
There was no member of it in whom I regretted this sad want of principle
so much as Miss Murray herself; not only because she had taken a fancy
to me, but because there was so much of what was pleasant and prepossessing
in herself, that, in spite of her failings, I really liked her - when
she did not rouse my indignation, or ruffle my temper by <i>too</i>
great a display of her faults.&nbsp; These, however, I would fain persuade
myself were rather the effect of her education than her disposition:
she had never been perfectly taught the distinction between right and
wrong; she had, like her brothers and sisters, been suffered, from infancy,
to tyrannize over nurses, governesses, and servants; she had not been
taught to moderate her desires, to control her temper or bridle her
will, or to sacrifice her own pleasure for the good of others.&nbsp;
Her temper being naturally good, she was never violent or morose, but
from constant indulgence, and habitual scorn of reason, she was often
testy and capricious; her mind had never been cultivated: her intellect,
at best, was somewhat shallow; she possessed considerable vivacity,
some quickness of perception, and some talent for music and the acquisition
of languages, but till fifteen she had troubled herself to acquire nothing;
- then the love of display had roused her faculties, and induced her
to apply herself, but only to the more showy accomplishments.&nbsp;
And when I came it was the same: everything was neglected but French,
German, music, singing, dancing, fancy-work, and a little drawing -
such drawing as might produce the greatest show with the smallest labour,
and the principal parts of which were generally done by me.&nbsp; For
music and singing, besides my occasional instructions, she had the attendance
of the best master the country afforded; and in these accomplishments,
as well as in dancing, she certainly attained great proficiency.&nbsp;
To music, indeed, she devoted too much of her time, as, governess though
I was, I frequently told her; but her mother thought that if <i>she</i>
liked it, she <i>could</i> not give too much time to the acquisition
of so attractive an art.&nbsp; Of fancy-work I knew nothing but what
I gathered from my pupil and my own observation; but no sooner was I
initiated, than she made me useful in twenty different ways: all the
tedious parts of her work were shifted on to my shoulders; such as stretching
the frames, stitching in the canvas, sorting the wools and silks, putting
in the grounds, counting the stitches, rectifying mistakes, and finishing
the pieces she was tired of.<br>
<br>
At sixteen, Miss Murray was something of a romp, yet not more so than
is natural and allowable for a girl of that age, but at seventeen, that
propensity, like all other things, began to give way to the ruling passion,
and soon was swallowed up in the all-absorbing ambition to attract and
dazzle the other sex.&nbsp; But enough of her: now let us turn to her
sister.<br>
<br>
Miss Matilda Murray was a veritable hoyden, of whom little need be said.&nbsp;
She was about two years and a half younger than her sister; her features
were larger, her complexion much darker.&nbsp; She might possibly make
a handsome woman; but she was far too big-boned and awkward ever to
be called a pretty girl, and at present she cared little about it.&nbsp;
Rosalie knew all her charms, and thought them even greater than they
were, and valued them more highly than she ought to have done, had they
been three times as great; Matilda thought she was well enough, but
cared little about the matter; still less did she care about the cultivation
of her mind, and the acquisition of ornamental accomplishments.&nbsp;
The manner in which she learnt her lessons and practised her music was
calculated to drive any governess to despair.&nbsp; Short and easy as
her tasks were, if done at all, they were slurred over, at any time
and in any way; but generally at the least convenient times, and in
the way least beneficial to herself, and least satisfactory to me: the
short half-hour of practising was horribly strummed through; she, meantime,
unsparingly abusing me, either for interrupting her with corrections,
or for not rectifying her mistakes before they were made, or something
equally unreasonable.&nbsp; Once or twice, I ventured to remonstrate
with her seriously for such irrational conduct; but on each of those
occasions, I received such reprehensive expostulations from her mother,
as convinced me that, if I wished to keep the situation, I must even
let Miss Matilda go on in her own way.<br>
<br>
When her lessons were over, however, her ill-humour was generally over
too: while riding her spirited pony, or romping with the dogs or her
brothers and sister, but especially with her dear brother John, she
was as happy as a lark.&nbsp; As an animal, Matilda was all right, full
of life, vigour, and activity; as an intelligent being, she was barbarously
ignorant, indocile, careless and irrational; and, consequently, very
distressing to one who had the task of cultivating her understanding,
reforming her manners, and aiding her to acquire those ornamental attainments
which, unlike her sister, she despised as much as the rest.&nbsp; Her
mother was partly aware of her deficiencies, and gave me many a lecture
as to how I should try to form her tastes, and endeavour to rouse and
cherish her dormant vanity; and, by insinuating, skilful flattery, to
win her attention to the desired objects - which I would not do; and
how I should prepare and smooth the path of learning till she could
glide along it without the least exertion to herself: which I could
not, for nothing can be taught to any purpose without some little exertion
on the part of the learner.<br>
<br>
As a moral agent, Matilda was reckless, headstrong, violent, and unamenable
to reason.&nbsp; One proof of the deplorable state of her mind was,
that from her father&rsquo;s example she had learned to swear like a
trooper.&nbsp; Her mother was greatly shocked at the &lsquo;unlady-like
trick,&rsquo; and wondered &lsquo;how she had picked it up.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;But you can soon break her of it, Miss Grey,&rsquo; said she:
&lsquo;it is only a habit; and if you will just gently remind her every
time she does so, I am sure she will soon lay it aside.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I not only &lsquo;gently reminded&rsquo; her, I tried to impress upon
her how wrong it was, and how distressing to the ears of decent people:
but all in vain: I was only answered by a careless laugh, and, &lsquo;Oh,
Miss Grey, how shocked you are!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so glad!&rsquo; or,
&lsquo;Well!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help it; papa shouldn&rsquo;t have
taught me: I learned it all from him; and maybe a bit from the coachman.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Her brother John, <i>alias</i> Master Murray, was about eleven when
I came: a fine, stout, healthy boy, frank and good-natured in the main,
and might have been a decent lad had he been properly educated; but
now he was as rough as a young bear, boisterous, unruly, unprincipled,
untaught, unteachable - at least, for a governess under his mother&rsquo;s
eye.&nbsp; His masters at school might be able to manage him better
- for to school he was sent, greatly to my relief, in the course of
a year; in a state, it is true, of scandalous ignorance as to Latin,
as well as the more useful though more neglected things: and this, doubtless,
would all be laid to the account of his education having been entrusted
to an ignorant female teacher, who had presumed to take in hand what
she was wholly incompetent to perform.&nbsp; I was not delivered from
his brother till full twelve months after, when he also was despatched
in the same state of disgraceful ignorance as the former.<br>
<br>
Master Charles was his mother&rsquo;s peculiar darling.&nbsp; He was
little more than a year younger than John, but much smaller, paler,
and less active and robust; a pettish, cowardly, capricious, selfish
little fellow, only active in doing mischief, and only clever in inventing
falsehoods: not simply to hide his faults, but, in mere malicious wantonness,
to bring odium upon others.&nbsp; In fact, Master Charles was a very
great nuisance to me: it was a trial of patience to live with him peaceably;
to watch over him was worse; and to teach him, or pretend to teach him,
was inconceivable.&nbsp; At ten years old, he could not read correctly
the easiest line in the simplest book; and as, according to his mother&rsquo;s
principle, he was to be told every word, before he had time to hesitate
or examine its orthography, and never even to be informed, as a stimulant
to exertion, that other boys were more forward than he, it is not surprising
that he made but little progress during the two years I had charge of
his education.&nbsp; His minute portions of Latin grammar, &amp;c.,
were to be repeated over to him, till he chose to say he knew them,
and then he was to be helped to say them; if he made mistakes in his
little easy sums in arithmetic, they were to be shown him at once, and
the sum done for him, instead of his being left to exercise his faculties
in finding them out himself; so that, of course, he took no pains to
avoid mistakes, but frequently set down his figures at random, without
any calculation at all.<br>
<br>
I did not invariably confine myself to these rules: it was against my
conscience to do so; but I seldom could venture to deviate from them
in the slightest degree, without incurring the wrath of my little pupil,
and subsequently of his mamma; to whom he would relate my transgressions
maliciously exaggerated, or adorned with embellishments of his own;
and often, in consequence, was I on the point of losing or resigning
my situation.&nbsp; But, for their sakes at home, I smothered my pride
and suppressed my indignation, and managed to struggle on till my little
tormentor was despatched to school; his father declaring that home education
was &lsquo;no go; for him, it was plain; his mother spoiled him outrageously,
and his governess could make no hand of him at all.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
A few more observations about Horton Lodge and its ongoings, and I have
done with dry description for the present.&nbsp; The house was a very
respectable one; superior to Mr. Bloomfield&rsquo;s, both in age, size,
and magnificence: the garden was not so tastefully laid out; but instead
of the smooth-shaven lawn, the young trees guarded by palings, the grove
of upstart poplars, and the plantation of firs, there was a wide park,
stocked with deer, and beautified by fine old trees.&nbsp; The surrounding
country itself was pleasant, as far as fertile fields, flourishing trees,
quiet green lanes, and smiling hedges with wild-flowers scattered along
their banks, could make it; but it was depressingly flat to one born
and nurtured among the rugged hills of -.<br>
<br>
We were situated nearly two miles from the village church, and, consequently,
the family carriage was put in requisition every Sunday morning, and
sometimes oftener.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Murray generally thought it sufficient
to show themselves at church once in the course of the day; but frequently
the children preferred going a second time to wandering about the grounds
all the day with nothing to do.&nbsp; If some of my pupils chose to
walk and take me with them, it was well for me; for otherwise my position
in the carriage was to be crushed into the corner farthest from the
open window, and with my back to the horses: a position which invariably
made me sick; and if I were not actually obliged to leave the church
in the middle of the service, my devotions were disturbed with a feeling
of languor and sickliness, and the tormenting fear of its becoming worse:
and a depressing headache was generally my companion throughout the
day, which would otherwise have been one of welcome rest, and holy,
calm enjoyment.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s very odd, Miss Grey, that the carriage should always
make you sick: it never makes <i>me</i>,&rsquo; remarked Miss Matilda,<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Nor me either,&rsquo; said her sister; &lsquo;but I dare say
it would, if I sat where she does - such a nasty, horrid place, Miss
Grey; I wonder how you can bear it!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I am obliged to bear it, since no choice is left me,&rsquo; -
I might have answered; but in tenderness for their feelings I only replied,
- &lsquo;Oh! it is but a short way, and if I am not sick in church,
I don&rsquo;t mind it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
If I were called upon to give a description of the usual divisions and
arrangements of the day, I should find it a very difficult matter.&nbsp;
I had all my meals in the schoolroom with my pupils, at such times as
suited their fancy: sometimes they would ring for dinner before it was
half cooked; sometimes they would keep it waiting on the table for above
an hour, and then be out of humour because the potatoes were cold, and
the gravy covered with cakes of solid fat; sometimes they would have
tea at four; frequently, they would storm at the servants because it
was not in precisely at five; and when these orders were obeyed, by
way of encouragement to punctuality, they would keep it on the table
till seven or eight.<br>
<br>
Their hours of study were managed in much the same way; my judgment
or convenience was never once consulted.&nbsp; Sometimes Matilda and
John would determine &lsquo;to get all the plaguy business over before
breakfast,&rsquo; and send the maid to call me up at half-past five,
without any scruple or apology; sometimes, I was told to be ready precisely
at six, and, having dressed in a hurry, came down to an empty room,
and after waiting a long time in suspense, discovered that they had
changed their minds, and were still in bed; or, perhaps, if it were
a fine summer morning, Brown would come to tell me that the young ladies
and gentlemen had taken a holiday, and were gone out; and then I was
kept waiting for breakfast till I was almost ready to faint: they having
fortified themselves with something before they went.<br>
<br>
Often they would do their lessons in the open air; which I had nothing
to say against: except that I frequently caught cold by sitting on the
damp grass, or from exposure to the evening dew, or some insidious draught,
which seemed to have no injurious effect on them.&nbsp; It was quite
right that they should be hardy; yet, surely, they might have been taught
some consideration for others who were less so.&nbsp; But I must not
blame them for what was, perhaps, my own fault; for I never made any
particular objections to sitting where they pleased; foolishly choosing
to risk the consequences, rather than trouble them for my convenience.&nbsp;
Their indecorous manner of doing their lessons was quite as remarkable
as the caprice displayed in their choice of time and place.&nbsp; While
receiving my instructions, or repeating what they had learned, they
would lounge upon the sofa, lie on the rug, stretch, yawn, talk to each
other, or look out of the window; whereas, I could not so much as stir
the fire, or pick up the handkerchief I had dropped, without being rebuked
for inattention by one of my pupils, or told that &lsquo;mamma would
not like me to be so careless.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
The servants, seeing in what little estimation the governess was held
by both parents and children, regulated their behaviour by the same
standard.&nbsp; I have frequently stood up for them, at the risk of
some injury to myself, against the tyranny and injustice of their young
masters and mistresses; and I always endeavoured to give them as little
trouble as possible: but they entirely neglected my comfort, despised
my requests, and slighted my directions.&nbsp; All servants, I am convinced,
would not have done so; but domestics in general, being ignorant and
little accustomed to reason and reflection, are too easily corrupted
by the carelessness and bad example of those above them; and these,
I think, were not of the best order to begin with.<br>
<br>
I sometimes felt myself degraded by the life I led, and ashamed of submitting
to so many indignities; and sometimes I thought myself a fool for caring
so much about them, and feared I must be sadly wanting in Christian
humility, or that charity which &lsquo;suffereth long and is kind, seeketh
not her own, is not easily provoked, beareth all things, endureth all
things.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
But, with time and patience, matters began to be slightly ameliorated:
slowly, it is true, and almost imperceptibly; but I got rid of my male
pupils (that was no trifling advantage), and the girls, as I intimated
before concerning one of them, became a little less insolent, and began
to show some symptoms of esteem.&nbsp; &lsquo;Miss Grey was a queer
creature: she never flattered, and did not praise them half enough;
but whenever she did speak favourably of them, or anything belonging
to them, they could be quite sure her approbation was sincere.&nbsp;
She was very obliging, quiet, and peaceable in the main, but there were
some things that put her out of temper: they did not much care for that,
to be sure, but still it was better to keep her in tune; as when she
was in a good humour she would talk to them, and be very agreeable and
amusing sometimes, in her way; which was quite different to mamma&rsquo;s,
but still very well for a change.&nbsp; She had her own opinions on
every subject, and kept steadily to them - very tiresome opinions they
often were; as she was always thinking of what was right and what was
wrong, and had a strange reverence for matters connected with religion,
and an unaccountable liking to good people.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER VIII - THE &lsquo;COMING OUT&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
At eighteen, Miss Murray was to emerge from the quiet obscurity of the
schoolroom into the full blaze of the fashionable world - as much of
it, at least, as could be had out of London; for her papa could not
be persuaded to leave his rural pleasures and pursuits, even for a few
weeks&rsquo; residence in town.&nbsp; She was to make her d&eacute;but
on the third of January, at a magnificent ball, which her mamma proposed
to give to all the nobility and choice gentry of O--- and its neighbourhood
for twenty miles round.&nbsp; Of course, she looked forward to it with
the wildest impatience, and the most extravagant anticipations of delight.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Miss Grey,&rsquo; said she, one evening, a month before the all-important
day, as I was perusing a long and extremely interesting letter of my
sister&rsquo;s - which I had just glanced at in the morning to see that
it contained no very bad news, and kept till now, unable before to find
a quiet moment for reading it, - &lsquo;Miss Grey, do put away that
dull, stupid letter, and listen to me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure my talk
must be far more amusing than that.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
She seated herself on the low stool at my feet; and I, suppressing a
sigh of vexation, began to fold up the epistle.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You should tell the good people at home not to bore you with
such long letters,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;and, above all, do bid them
write on proper note-paper, and not on those great vulgar sheets.&nbsp;
You should see the charming little lady-like notes mamma writes to her
friends.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The good people at home,&rsquo; replied I, &lsquo;know very well
that the longer their letters are, the better I like them.&nbsp; I should
be very sorry to receive a charming little lady-like note from any of
them; and I thought you were too much of a lady yourself, Miss Murray,
to talk about the &ldquo;vulgarity&rdquo; of writing on a large sheet
of paper.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, I only said it to tease you.&nbsp; But now I want to talk
about the ball; and to tell you that you positively must put off your
holidays till it is over.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Why so? - I shall not be present at the ball.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, but you will see the rooms decked out before it begins, and
hear the music, and, above all, see me in my splendid new dress.&nbsp;
I shall be so charming, you&rsquo;ll be ready to worship me - you really
must stay.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I should like to see you very much; but I shall have many opportunities
of seeing you equally charming, on the occasion of some of the numberless
balls and parties that are to be, and I cannot disappoint my friends
by postponing my return so long.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, never mind your friends!&nbsp; Tell them we won&rsquo;t let
you go.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But, to say the truth, it would be a disappointment to myself:
I long to see them as much as they to see me - perhaps more.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, but it is such a short time.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Nearly a fortnight by my computation; and, besides, I cannot
bear the thoughts of a Christmas spent from home: and, moreover, my
sister is going to be married.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Is she - when?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Not till next month; but I want to be there to assist her in
making preparations, and to make the best of her company while we have
her.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me before?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve only got the news in this letter, which you stigmatize
as dull and stupid, and won&rsquo;t let me read.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;To whom is she to be married?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;To Mr. Richardson, the vicar of a neighbouring parish.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Is he rich?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No; only comfortable.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Is he handsome?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No; only decent.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Young?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No; only middling.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, mercy! what a wretch!&nbsp; What sort of a house is it?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;A quiet little vicarage, with an ivy-clad porch, an old-fashioned
garden, and - &rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, stop! - you&rsquo;ll make me sick.&nbsp; How <i>can</i> she
bear it?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I expect she&rsquo;ll not only be able to bear it, but to be
very happy.&nbsp; You did not ask me if Mr. Richardson were a good,
wise, or amiable man; I could have answered Yes, to all these questions
- at least so Mary thinks, and I hope she will not find herself mistaken.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But - miserable creature! how can she think of spending her life
there, cooped up with that nasty old man; and no hope of change?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;He is not old: he&rsquo;s only six or seven and thirty; and she
herself is twenty-eight, and as sober as if she were fifty.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s better then - they&rsquo;re well matched; but
do they call him the &ldquo;worthy vicar&rdquo;?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know; but if they do, I believe he merits the epithet.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Mercy, how shocking! and will she wear a white apron and make
pies and puddings?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about the white apron, but I dare say she
will make pies and puddings now and then; but that will be no great
hardship, as she has done it before.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And will she go about in a plain shawl, and a large straw bonnet,
carrying tracts and bone soup to her husband&rsquo;s poor parishioners?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not clear about that; but I dare say she will do her
best to make them comfortable in body and mind, in accordance with our
mother&rsquo;s example.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER IX - THE BALL<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Now, Miss Grey,&rsquo; exclaimed Miss Murray, immediately I entered
the schoolroom, after having taken off my outdoor garments, upon returning
from my four weeks&rsquo; recreation, &lsquo;Now - shut the door, and
sit down, and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about the ball.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No - damn it, no!&rsquo; shouted Miss Matilda.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hold
your tongue, can&rsquo;t ye? and let me tell her about my new mare -
<i>such</i> a splendour, Miss Grey! a fine blood mare - &rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Do be quiet, Matilda; and let me tell my news first.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, no, Rosalie; you&rsquo;ll be such a damned long time over
it - she shall hear me first - I&rsquo;ll be hanged if she doesn&rsquo;t!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear, Miss Matilda, that you&rsquo;ve not
got rid of that shocking habit yet.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t help it: but I&rsquo;ll never say a wicked
word again, if you&rsquo;ll only listen to me, and tell Rosalie to hold
her confounded tongue.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Rosalie remonstrated, and I thought I should have been torn in pieces
between them; but Miss Matilda having the loudest voice, her sister
at length gave in, and suffered her to tell her story first: so I was
doomed to hear a long account of her splendid mare, its breeding and
pedigree, its paces, its action, its spirit, &amp;c., and of her own
amazing skill and courage in riding it; concluding with an assertion
that she could clear a five-barred gate &lsquo;like winking,&rsquo;
that papa said she might hunt the next time the hounds met, and mamma
had ordered a bright scarlet hunting-habit for her.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, Matilda! what stories you are telling!&rsquo; exclaimed her
sister.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; answered she, no whit abashed, &lsquo;I know I <i>could</i>
clear a five-barred gate, if I tried, and papa <i>will</i> say I may
hunt, and mamma <i>will</i> order the habit when I ask it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, now get along,&rsquo; replied Miss Murray; &lsquo;and do,
dear Matilda, try to be a little more lady-like.&nbsp; Miss Grey, I
wish you would tell her not to use such shocking words; she will call
her horse a mare: it is so inconceivably shocking! and then she uses
such dreadful expressions in describing it: she must have learned it
from the grooms.&nbsp; It nearly puts me into fits when she begins.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I learned it from papa, you ass! and his jolly friends,&rsquo;
said the young lady, vigorously cracking a hunting-whip, which she habitually
carried in her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m as good judge of horseflesh
as the best of &rsquo;m.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, now get along, you shocking girl!&nbsp; I really shall
take a fit if you go on in such a way.&nbsp; And now, Miss Grey, attend
to me; I&rsquo;m going to tell you about the ball.&nbsp; You must be
dying to hear about it, I know.&nbsp; Oh, <i>such</i> a ball!&nbsp;
You never saw or heard, or read, or dreamt of anything like it in all
your life.&nbsp; The decorations, the entertainment, the supper, the
music were indescribable! and then the guests!&nbsp; There were two
noblemen, three baronets, and five titled ladies, and other ladies and
gentlemen innumerable.&nbsp; The ladies, of course, were of no consequence
to me, except to put me in a good humour with myself, by showing how
ugly and awkward most of them were; and the best, mamma told me, - the
most transcendent beauties among them, were nothing to me.&nbsp; As
for me, Miss Grey - I&rsquo;m so <i>sorry</i> you didn&rsquo;t see me!&nbsp;
I was <i>charming</i> - wasn&rsquo;t I, Matilda?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Middling.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, but I really was - at least so mamma said - and Brown and
Williamson.&nbsp; Brown said she was sure no gentleman could set eyes
on me without falling in love that minute; and so I may be allowed to
be a little vain.&nbsp; I know you think me a shocking, conceited, frivolous
girl; but then, you know, I don&rsquo;t attribute it <i>all</i> to my
personal attractions: I give some praise to the hairdresser, and some
to my exquisitely lovely dress - you must see it to-morrow - white gauze
over pink satin - and so <i>sweetly</i> made! and a necklace and bracelet
of beautiful, large pearls!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I have no doubt you looked very charming: but should that delight
you so very much?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, no! - not that alone: but, then, I was so much admired; and
I made so <i>many</i> conquests in that one night - you&rsquo;d be astonished
to hear - &rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But what good will they do you?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;What good!&nbsp; Think of any woman asking that!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, I should think one conquest would be enough; and too much,
unless the subjugation were mutual.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, but you know I never agree with you on those points.&nbsp;
Now, wait a bit, and I&rsquo;ll tell you my principal admirers - those
who made themselves very conspicuous that night and after: for I&rsquo;ve
been to two parties since.&nbsp; Unfortunately the two noblemen, Lord
G--- and Lord F---, were married, or I might have condescended to be
particularly gracious to <i>them</i>; as it was, I did not: though Lord
F---, who hates his wife, was evidently much struck with me.&nbsp; He
asked me to dance with him twice - he is a charming dancer, by-the-by,
and so am I: you can&rsquo;t think how well I did - I was astonished
at myself.&nbsp; My lord was very complimentary too - rather too much
so in fact - and I thought proper to be a little haughty and repellent;
but I had the pleasure of seeing his nasty, cross wife ready to perish
with spite and vexation - &rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, Miss Murray! you don&rsquo;t mean to say that such a thing
could really give you pleasure?&nbsp; However cross or - &rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, I know it&rsquo;s very wrong; - but never mind!&nbsp; I
mean to be good some time - only don&rsquo;t preach now, there&rsquo;s
a good creature.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t told you half yet.&nbsp; Let
me see.&nbsp; Oh! I was going to tell you how many unmistakeable admirers
I had:- Sir Thomas Ashby was one, - Sir Hugh Meltham and Sir Broadley
Wilson are old codgers, only fit companions for papa and mamma.&nbsp;
Sir Thomas is young, rich, and gay; but an ugly beast, nevertheless:
however, mamma says I should not mind that after a few months&rsquo;
acquaintance.&nbsp; Then, there was Henry Meltham, Sir Hugh&rsquo;s
younger son; rather good-looking, and a pleasant fellow to flirt with:
but <i>being</i> a younger son, that is all he is good for; then there
was young Mr. Green, rich enough, but of no family, and a great stupid
fellow, a mere country booby! and then, our good rector, Mr. Hatfield:
an <i>humble</i> admirer he ought to consider himself; but I fear he
has forgotten to number humility among his stock of Christian virtues.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Was Mr. Hatfield at the ball?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, to be sure.&nbsp; Did you think he was too good to go?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I thought be might consider it unclerical.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;By no means.&nbsp; He did not profane his cloth by dancing; but
it was with difficulty he could refrain, poor man: he looked as if he
were dying to ask my hand just for <i>one</i> set; and - oh! by-the-by
- he&rsquo;s got a new curate: that seedy old fellow Mr. Bligh has got
his long-wished-for living at last, and is gone.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And what is the new one like?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, <i>such</i> a beast!&nbsp; Weston his name is.&nbsp; I can
give you his description in three words - an insensate, ugly, stupid
blockhead.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s four, but no matter - enough of <i>him</i>
now.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Then she returned to the ball, and gave me a further account of her
deportment there, and at the several parties she had since attended;
and further particulars respecting Sir Thomas Ashby and Messrs. Meltham,
Green, and Hatfield, and the ineffaceable impression she had wrought
upon each of them.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, which of the four do you like best?&rsquo; said I, suppressing
my third or fourth yawn.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I detest them all!&rsquo; replied she, shaking her bright ringlets
in vivacious scorn.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;That means, I suppose, &ldquo;I like them all&rdquo; - but which
most?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, I really detest them all; but Harry Meltham is the handsomest
and most amusing, and Mr. Hatfield the cleverest, Sir Thomas the wickedest,
and Mr. Green the most stupid.&nbsp; But the one I&rsquo;m to have,
I suppose, if I&rsquo;m doomed to have any of them, is Sir Thomas Ashby.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Surely not, if he&rsquo;s so wicked, and if you dislike him?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind his being wicked: he&rsquo;s all the better
for that; and as for disliking him - I shouldn&rsquo;t greatly object
to being Lady Ashby of Ashby Park, if I must marry.&nbsp; But if I could
be always young, I would be always single.&nbsp; I should like to enjoy
myself thoroughly, and coquet with all the world, till I am on the verge
of being called an old maid; and then, to escape the infamy of that,
after having made ten thousand conquests, to break all their hearts
save one, by marrying some high-born, rich, indulgent husband, whom,
on the other hand, fifty ladies were dying to have.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, as long as you entertain these views, keep single by all
means, and never marry at all: not even to escape the infamy of old-maidenhood.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER X - THE CHURCH<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, Miss Grey, what do you think of the new curate?&rsquo;
asked Miss Murray, on our return from church the Sunday after the recommencement
of our duties.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I can scarcely tell,&rsquo; was my reply: &lsquo;I have not even
heard him preach.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, but you saw him, didn&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, but I cannot pretend to judge of a man&rsquo;s character
by a single cursory glance at his face.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But isn&rsquo;t he ugly?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;He did not strike me as being particularly so; I don&rsquo;t
dislike that cast of countenance: but the only thing I particularly
noticed about him was his style of reading; which appeared to me good
- infinitely better, at least, than Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He read
the Lessons as if he were bent on giving full effect to every passage;
it seemed as if the most careless person could not have helped attending,
nor the most ignorant have failed to understand; and the prayers he
read as if he were not reading at all, but praying earnestly and sincerely
from his own heart.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, yes, that&rsquo;s all he is good for: he can plod through
the service well enough; but he has not a single idea beyond it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh! I know perfectly well; I am an excellent judge in such matters.&nbsp;
Did you see how he went out of church? stumping along - as if there
were nobody there but himself - never looking to the right hand or the
left, and evidently thinking of nothing but just getting out of the
church, and, perhaps, home to his dinner: his great stupid head could
contain no other idea.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I suppose you would have had him cast a glance into the squire&rsquo;s
pew,&rsquo; said I, laughing at the vehemence of her hostility.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Indeed! I should have been highly indignant if he had dared to
do such a thing!&rsquo; replied she, haughtily tossing her head; then,
after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, she added - &lsquo;Well, well!&nbsp;
I suppose he&rsquo;s good enough for his place: but I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m
not dependent on <i>him</i> for amusement - that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp;
Did you see how Mr. Hatfield hurried out to get a bow from me, and be
in time to put us into the carriage?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; answered I; internally adding, &lsquo;and I thought
it somewhat derogatory to his dignity as a clergyman to come flying
from the pulpit in such eager haste to shake hands with the squire,
and hand his wife and daughters into their carriage: and, moreover,
I owe him a grudge for nearly shutting me out of it&rsquo;; for, in
fact, though I was standing before his face, close beside the carriage
steps, waiting to get in, he would persist in putting them up and closing
the door, till one of the family stopped him by calling out that the
governess was not in yet; then, without a word of apology, he departed,
wishing them good-morning, and leaving the footman to finish the business.<br>
<br>
<i>Nota bene</i>. - Mr. Hatfield never spoke to me, neither did Sir
Hugh or Lady Meltham, nor Mr. Harry or Miss Meltham, nor Mr. Green or
his sisters, nor any other lady or gentleman who frequented that church:
nor, in fact, any one that visited at Horton Lodge.<br>
<br>
Miss Murray ordered the carriage again, in the afternoon, for herself
and her sister: she said it was too cold for them to enjoy themselves
in the garden; and besides, she believed Harry Meltham would be at church.&nbsp;
&lsquo;For,&rsquo; said she, smiling slyly at her own fair image in
the glass, &lsquo;he has been a most exemplary attendant at church these
last few Sundays: you would think he was quite a good Christian.&nbsp;
And you may go with us, Miss Grey: I want you to see him; he is so greatly
improved since he returned from abroad - you can&rsquo;t think!&nbsp;
And besides, then you will have an opportunity of seeing the beautiful
Mr. Weston again, and of hearing him preach.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I did hear him preach, and was decidedly pleased with the evangelical
truth of his doctrine, as well as the earnest simplicity of his manner,
and the clearness and force of his style.&nbsp; It was truly refreshing
to hear such a sermon, after being so long accustomed to the dry, prosy
discourses of the former curate, and the still less edifying harangues
of the rector.&nbsp; Mr. Hatfield would come sailing up the aisle, or
rather sweeping along like a whirlwind, with his rich silk gown flying
behind him and rustling against the pew doors, mount the pulpit like
a conqueror ascending his triumphal car; then, sinking on the velvet
cushion in an attitude of studied grace, remain in silent prostration
for a certain time; then mutter over a Collect, and gabble through the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, rise, draw off one bright lavender glove, to give
the congregation the benefit of his sparkling rings, lightly pass his
fingers through his well-curled hair, flourish a cambric handkerchief,
recite a very short passage, or, perhaps, a mere phrase of Scripture,
as a head-piece to his discourse, and, finally, deliver a composition
which, as a composition, might be considered good, though far too studied
and too artificial to be pleasing to me: the propositions were well
laid down, the arguments logically conducted; and yet, it was sometimes
hard to listen quietly throughout, without some slight demonstrations
of disapproval or impatience.<br>
<br>
His favourite subjects were church discipline, rites and ceremonies,
apostolical succession, the duty of reverence and obedience to the clergy,
the atrocious criminality of dissent, the absolute necessity of observing
all the forms of godliness, the reprehensible presumption of individuals
who attempted to think for themselves in matters connected with religion,
or to be guided by their own interpretations of Scripture, and, occasionally
(to please his wealthy parishioners) the necessity of deferential obedience
from the poor to the rich - supporting his maxims and exhortations throughout
with quotations from the Fathers: with whom he appeared to be far better
acquainted than with the Apostles and Evangelists, and whose importance
he seemed to consider at least equal to theirs.&nbsp; But now and then
he gave us a sermon of a different order - what some would call a very
good one; but sunless and severe: representing the Deity as a terrible
taskmaster rather than a benevolent father.&nbsp; Yet, as I listened,
I felt inclined to think the man was sincere in all he said: he must
have changed his views, and become decidedly religious, gloomy and austere,
yet still devout.&nbsp; But such illusions were usually dissipated,
on coming out of church, by hearing his voice in jocund colloquy with
some of the Melthams or Greens, or, perhaps, the Murrays themselves;
probably laughing at his own sermon, and hoping that he had given the
rascally people something to think about; perchance, exulting in the
thought that old Betty Holmes would now lay aside the sinful indulgence
of her pipe, which had been her daily solace for upwards of thirty years:
that George Higgins would be frightened out of his Sabbath evening walks,
and Thomas Jackson would be sorely troubled in his conscience, and shaken
in his sure and certain hope of a joyful resurrection at the last day.<br>
<br>
Thus, I could not but conclude that Mr. Hatfield was one of those who
&lsquo;bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them upon
men&rsquo;s shoulders, while they themselves will not move them with
one of their fingers&rsquo;; and who &lsquo;make the word of God of
none effect by their traditions, teaching for doctrines the commandments
of men.&rsquo;&nbsp; I was well pleased to observe that the new curate
resembled him, as far as I could see, in none of these particulars.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, Miss Grey, what do you think of him now?&rsquo; said Miss
Murray, as we took our places in the carriage after service.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No harm still,&rsquo; replied I.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No harm!&rsquo; repeated she in amazement.&nbsp; &lsquo;What
do you mean?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I mean, I think no worse of him than I did before.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No worse!&nbsp; I should think not indeed - quite the contrary!&nbsp;
Is he not greatly improved?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, yes; very much indeed,&rsquo; replied I; for I had now discovered
that it was Harry Meltham she meant, not Mr. Weston.&nbsp; That gentleman
had eagerly come forward to speak to the young ladies: a thing he would
hardly have ventured to do had their mother been present; he had likewise
politely handed them into the carriage.&nbsp; He had not attempted to
shut me out, like Mr. Hatfield; neither, of course, had he offered me
his assistance (I should not have accepted it, if he had), but as long
as the door remained open he had stood smirking and chatting with them,
and then lifted his hat and departed to his own abode: but I had scarcely
noticed him all the time.&nbsp; My companions, however, had been more
observant; and, as we rolled along, they discussed between them not
only his looks, words, and actions, but every feature of his face, and
every article of his apparel.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You shan&rsquo;t have him all to yourself, Rosalie,&rsquo; said
Miss Matilda at the close of this discussion; &lsquo;I like him: I know
he&rsquo;d make a nice, jolly companion for me.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;re quite welcome to him, Matilda,&rsquo; replied
her sister, in a tone of affected indifference.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; continued the other, &lsquo;he admires
me quite as much as he does you; doesn&rsquo;t he, Miss Grey?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I&rsquo;m not acquainted with his sentiments.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, but he <i>does</i> though.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;My <i>dear</i> Matilda! nobody will ever admire you till you
get rid of your rough, awkward manners.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, stuff!&nbsp; Harry Meltham likes such manners; and so do
papa&rsquo;s friends.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, you <i>may</i> captivate old men, and younger sons; but
nobody else, I am sure, will ever take a fancy to you.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care: I&rsquo;m not always grabbing after money,
like you and mamma.&nbsp; If my husband is able to keep a few good horses
and dogs, I shall be quite satisfied; and all the rest may go to the
devil!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, if you use such shocking expressions, I&rsquo;m sure no
real gentleman will ever venture to come near you.&nbsp; Really, Miss
Grey, you should not let her do so.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t possibly prevent it, Miss Murray.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And you&rsquo;re quite mistaken, Matilda, in supposing that Harry
Meltham admires you: I assure you he does nothing of the kind.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Matilda was beginning an angry reply; but, happily, our journey was
now at an end; and the contention was cut short by the footman opening
the carriage-door, and letting down the steps for our descent.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XI - THE COTTAGERS<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As I had now only one regular pupil - though she contrived to give me
as much trouble as three or four ordinary ones, and though her sister
still took lessons in German and drawing - I had considerably more time
at my own disposal than I had ever been blessed with before, since I
had taken upon me the governess&rsquo;s yoke; which time I devoted partly
to correspondence with my friends, partly to reading, study, and the
practice of music, singing, &amp;c., partly to wandering in the grounds
or adjacent fields, with my pupils if they wanted me, alone if they
did not.<br>
<br>
Often, when they had no more agreeable occupation at hand, the Misses
Murray would amuse themselves with visiting the poor cottagers on their
father&rsquo;s estate, to receive their flattering homage, or to hear
the old stories or gossiping news of the garrulous old women; or, perhaps,
to enjoy the purer pleasure of making the poor people happy with their
cheering presence and their occasional gifts, so easily bestowed, so
thankfully received.&nbsp; Sometimes, I was called upon to accompany
one or both of the sisters in these visits; and sometimes I was desired
to go alone, to fulfil some promise which they had been more ready to
make than to perform; to carry some small donation, or read to one who
was sick or seriously disposed: and thus I made a few acquaintances
among the cottagers; and, occasionally, I went to see them on my own
account.<br>
<br>
I generally had more satisfaction in going alone than with either of
the young ladies; for they, chiefly owing to their defective education,
comported themselves towards their inferiors in a manner that was highly
disagreeable for me to witness.&nbsp; They never, in thought, exchanged
places with them; and, consequently, had no consideration for their
feelings, regarding them as an order of beings entirely different from
themselves.&nbsp; They would watch the poor creatures at their meals,
making uncivil remarks about their food, and their manner of eating;
they would laugh at their simple notions and provincial expressions,
till some of them scarcely durst venture to speak; they would call the
grave elderly men and women old fools and silly old blockheads to their
faces: and all this without meaning to offend.&nbsp; I could see that
the people were often hurt and annoyed by such conduct, though their
fear of the &lsquo;grand ladies&rsquo; prevented them from testifying
any resentment; but <i>they</i> never perceived it.&nbsp; They thought
that, as these cottagers were poor and untaught, they must be stupid
and brutish; and as long as they, their superiors, condescended to talk
to them, and to give them shillings and half-crowns, or articles of
clothing, they had a right to amuse themselves, even at their expense;
and the people must adore them as angels of light, condescending to
minister to their necessities, and enlighten their humble dwellings.<br>
<br>
I made many and various attempts to deliver my pupils from these delusive
notions without alarming their pride - which was easily offended, and
not soon appeased - but with little apparent result; and I know not
which was the more reprehensible of the two: Matilda was more rude and
boisterous; but from Rosalie&rsquo;s womanly age and lady-like exterior
better things were expected: yet she was as provokingly careless and
inconsiderate as a giddy child of twelve.<br>
<br>
One bright day in the last week of February, I was walking in the park,
enjoying the threefold luxury of solitude, a book, and pleasant weather;
for Miss Matilda had set out on her daily ride, and Miss Murray was
gone in the carriage with her mamma to pay some morning calls.&nbsp;
But it struck me that I ought to leave these selfish pleasures, and
the park with its glorious canopy of bright blue sky, the west wind
sounding through its yet leafless branches, the snow-wreaths still lingering
in its hollows, but melting fast beneath the sun, and the graceful deer
browsing on its moist herbage already assuming the freshness and verdure
of spring - and go to the cottage of one Nancy Brown, a widow, whose
son was at work all day in the fields, and who was afflicted with an
inflammation in the eyes; which had for some time incapacitated her
from reading: to her own great grief, for she was a woman of a serious,
thoughtful turn of mind.&nbsp; I accordingly went, and found her alone,
as usual, in her little, close, dark cottage, redolent of smoke and
confined air, but as tidy and clean as she could make it.&nbsp; She
was seated beside her little fire (consisting of a few red cinders and
a bit of stick), busily knitting, with a small sackcloth cushion at
her feet, placed for the accommodation of her gentle friend the cat,
who was seated thereon, with her long tail half encircling her velvet
paws, and her half-closed eyes dreamily gazing on the low, crooked fender.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, Nancy, how are you to-day?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Why, middling, Miss, i&rsquo; myseln - my eyes is no better,
but I&rsquo;m a deal easier i&rsquo; my mind nor I have been,&rsquo;
replied she, rising to welcome me with a contented smile; which I was
glad to see, for Nancy had been somewhat afflicted with religious melancholy.&nbsp;
I congratulated her upon the change.&nbsp; She agreed that it was a
great blessing, and expressed herself &lsquo;right down thankful for
it&rsquo;; adding, &lsquo;If it please God to spare my sight, and make
me so as I can read my Bible again, I think I shall be as happy as a
queen.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I hope He will, Nancy,&rsquo; replied I; &lsquo;and, meantime,
I&rsquo;ll come and read to you now and then, when I have a little time
to spare.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
With expressions of grateful pleasure, the poor woman moved to get me
a chair; but, as I saved her the trouble, she busied herself with stirring
the fire, and adding a few more sticks to the decaying embers; and then,
taking her well-used Bible from the shelf, dusted it carefully, and
gave it me.&nbsp; On my asking if there was any particular part she
should like me to read, she answered -<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, Miss Grey, if it&rsquo;s all the same to you, I should
like to hear that chapter in the First Epistle of St. John, that says,
&ldquo;God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and
God in him.&rdquo;&rsquo;<br>
<br>
With a little searching, I found these words in the fourth chapter.&nbsp;
When I came to the seventh verse she interrupted me, and, with needless
apologies for such a liberty, desired me to read it very slowly, that
she might take it all in, and dwell on every word; hoping I would excuse
her, as she was but a &lsquo;simple body.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The wisest person,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;might think over
each of these verses for an hour, and be all the better for it; and
I would rather read them slowly than not.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Accordingly, I finished the chapter as slowly as need be, and at the
same time as impressively as I could; my auditor listened most attentively
all the while, and sincerely thanked me when I had done.&nbsp; I sat
still about half a minute to give her time to reflect upon it; when,
somewhat to my surprise, she broke the pause by asking me how I liked
Mr. Weston?<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; I replied, a little startled by the
suddenness of the question; &lsquo;I think he preaches very well.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Ay, he does so; and talks well too.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Does he?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;He does.&nbsp; Maybe, you haven&rsquo;t seen him - not to talk
to him much, yet?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, I never see any one to talk to - except the young ladies
of the Hall.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Ah; they&rsquo;re nice, kind young ladies; but they can&rsquo;t
talk as he does.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Then he comes to see you, Nancy?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;He does, Miss; and I&rsquo;se thankful for it.&nbsp; He comes
to see all us poor bodies a deal ofter nor Maister Bligh, or th&rsquo;
Rector ever did; an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s well he does, for he&rsquo;s always
welcome: we can&rsquo;t say as much for th&rsquo; Rector - there is
&lsquo;at says they&rsquo;re fair feared on him.&nbsp; When he comes
into a house, they say he&rsquo;s sure to find summut wrong, and begin
a-calling &rsquo;em as soon as he crosses th&rsquo; doorstuns: but maybe
he thinks it his duty like to tell &rsquo;em what&rsquo;s wrong.&nbsp;
And very oft he comes o&rsquo; purpose to reprove folk for not coming
to church, or not kneeling an&rsquo; standing when other folk does,
or going to the Methody chapel, or summut o&rsquo; that sort: but I
can&rsquo;t say &rsquo;at he ever fund much fault wi&rsquo; me.&nbsp;
He came to see me once or twice, afore Maister Weston come, when I was
so ill troubled in my mind; and as I had only very poor health besides,
I made bold to send for him - and he came right enough.&nbsp; I was
sore distressed, Miss Grey - thank God, it&rsquo;s owered now - but
when I took my Bible, I could get no comfort of it at all.&nbsp; That
very chapter &lsquo;at you&rsquo;ve just been reading troubled me as
much as aught - &ldquo;He that loveth not, knoweth not God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It seemed fearsome to me; for I felt that I loved neither God nor man
as I should do, and could not, if I tried ever so.&nbsp; And th&rsquo;
chapter afore, where it says, - &ldquo;He that is born of God cannot
commit sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; And another place where it says, - &ldquo;Love
is the fulfilling of the Law.&rdquo;&nbsp; And many, many others, Miss:
I should fair weary you out, if I was to tell them all.&nbsp; But all
seemed to condemn me, and to show me &lsquo;at I was not in the right
way; and as I knew not how to get into it, I sent our Bill to beg Maister
Hatfield to be as kind as look in on me some day and when he came, I
telled him all my troubles.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And what did he say, Nancy?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Why, Miss, he seemed to scorn me.&nbsp; I might be mista&rsquo;en
- but he like gave a sort of a whistle, and I saw a bit of a smile on
his face; and he said, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all stuff!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
been among the Methodists, my good woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I telled
him I&rsquo;d never been near the Methodies.&nbsp; And then he said,
- &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you must come to church, where
you&rsquo;ll hear the Scriptures properly explained, instead of sitting
poring over your Bible at home.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But I telled him I always used coming to church when I had my
health; but this very cold winter weather I hardly durst venture so
far - and me so bad wi&rsquo; th&rsquo; rheumatic and all.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But he says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll do your rheumatiz good to hobble
to church: there&rsquo;s nothing like exercise for the rheumatiz.&nbsp;
You can walk about the house well enough; why can&rsquo;t you walk to
church?&nbsp; The fact is,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re getting
too fond of your ease.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s always easy to find excuses
for shirking one&rsquo;s duty.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But then, you know, Miss Grey, it wasn&rsquo;t so.&nbsp; However,
I telled him I&rsquo;d try.&nbsp; &ldquo;But please, sir,&rdquo; says
I, &ldquo;if I do go to church, what the better shall I be?&nbsp; I
want to have my sins blotted out, and to feel that they are remembered
no more against me, and that the love of God is shed abroad in my heart;
and if I can get no good by reading my Bible an&rsquo; saying my prayers
at home, what good shall I get by going to church?&rdquo;&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;The church,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is the place appointed
by God for His worship.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s your duty to go there as often
as you can.&nbsp; If you want comfort, you must seek it in the path
of duty,&rdquo; - an&rsquo; a deal more he said, but I cannot remember
all his fine words.&nbsp; However, it all came to this, that I was to
come to church as oft as ever I could, and bring my prayer-book with
me, an&rsquo; read up all the sponsers after the clerk, an&rsquo; stand,
an&rsquo; kneel, an&rsquo; sit, an&rsquo; do all as I should, and take
the Lord&rsquo;s Supper at every opportunity, an&rsquo; hearken his
sermons, and Maister Bligh&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; it &rsquo;ud be all right:
if I went on doing my duty, I should get a blessing at last.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;But if you get no comfort that way,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
all up.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;should you think I&rsquo;m
a reprobate?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says he - he says, &ldquo;if you do your best
to get to heaven and can&rsquo;t manage it, you must be one of those
that seek to enter in at the strait gate and shall not be able.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;An&rsquo; then he asked me if I&rsquo;d seen any of the ladies
o&rsquo; th&rsquo; Hall about that mornin&rsquo;; so I telled him where
I had seen the young misses go on th&rsquo; Moss Lane; - an&rsquo; he
kicked my poor cat right across th&rsquo; floor, an&rsquo; went after
&rsquo;em as gay as a lark: but I was very sad.&nbsp; That last word
o&rsquo; his fair sunk into my heart, an&rsquo; lay there like a lump
o&rsquo; lead, till I was weary to bear it.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Howsever, I follered his advice: I thought he meant it all for
th&rsquo; best, though he <i>had</i> a queer way with him.&nbsp; But
you know, Miss, he&rsquo;s rich an&rsquo; young, and such like cannot
right understand the thoughts of a poor old woman such as me.&nbsp;
But, howsever, I did my best to do all as he bade me - but maybe I&rsquo;m
plaguing you, Miss, wi&rsquo; my chatter.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, no, Nancy!&nbsp; Go on, and tell me all.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, my rheumatiz got better - I know not whether wi&rsquo;
going to church or not, but one frosty Sunday I got this cold i&rsquo;
my eyes.&nbsp; Th&rsquo; inflammation didn&rsquo;t come on all at once
like, but bit by bit - but I wasn&rsquo;t going to tell you about my
eyes, I was talking about my trouble o&rsquo; mind; - and to tell the
truth, Miss Grey, I don&rsquo;t think it was anyways eased by coming
to church - nought to speak on, at least: I like got my health better;
but that didn&rsquo;t mend my soul.&nbsp; I hearkened and hearkened
the ministers, and read an&rsquo; read at my prayer-book; but it was
all like sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal: the sermons I couldn&rsquo;t
understand, an&rsquo; th&rsquo; prayer-book only served to show me how
wicked I was, that I could read such good words an&rsquo; never be no
better for it, and oftens feel it a sore labour an&rsquo; a heavy task
beside, instead of a blessing and a privilege as all good Christians
does.&nbsp; It seemed like as all were barren an&rsquo; dark to me.&nbsp;
And then, them dreadful words, &ldquo;Many shall seek to enter in, and
shall not be able.&rdquo;&nbsp; They like as they fair dried up my sperrit.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But one Sunday, when Maister Hatfield gave out about the sacrament,
I noticed where he said, &ldquo;If there be any of you that cannot quiet
his own conscience, but requireth further comfort or counsel, let him
come to me, or some other discreet and learned minister of God&rsquo;s
word, and open his grief!&rdquo;&nbsp; So next Sunday morning, afore
service, I just looked into the vestry, an&rsquo; began a-talking to
th&rsquo; Rector again.&nbsp; I hardly could fashion to take such a
liberty, but I thought when my soul was at stake I shouldn&rsquo;t stick
at a trifle.&nbsp; But he said he hadn&rsquo;t time to attend to me
then.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;And, indeed,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing
to say to you but what I&rsquo;ve said before.&nbsp; Take the sacrament,
of course, and go on doing your duty; and if that won&rsquo;t serve
you, nothing will.&nbsp; So don&rsquo;t bother me any more.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;So then, I went away.&nbsp; But I heard Maister Weston - Maister
Weston was there, Miss - this was his first Sunday at Horton, you know,
an&rsquo; he was i&rsquo; th&rsquo; vestry in his surplice, helping
th&rsquo; Rector on with his gown - &rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, Nancy.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And I heard him ask Maister Hatfield who I was, an&rsquo; he
says, &ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s a canting old fool.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And I was very ill grieved, Miss Grey; but I went to my seat,
and I tried to do my duty as aforetime: but I like got no peace.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; I even took the sacrament; but I felt as though I were eating
and drinking to my own damnation all th&rsquo; time.&nbsp; So I went
home, sorely troubled.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But next day, afore I&rsquo;d gotten fettled up - for indeed,
Miss, I&rsquo;d no heart to sweeping an&rsquo; fettling, an&rsquo; washing
pots; so I sat me down i&rsquo; th&rsquo; muck - who should come in
but Maister Weston!&nbsp; I started siding stuff then, an&rsquo; sweeping
an&rsquo; doing; and I expected he&rsquo;d begin a-calling me for my
idle ways, as Maister Hatfield would a&rsquo; done; but I was mista&rsquo;en:
he only bid me good-mornin&rsquo; like, in a quiet dacent way.&nbsp;
So I dusted him a chair, an&rsquo; fettled up th&rsquo; fireplace a
bit; but I hadn&rsquo;t forgotten th&rsquo; Rector&rsquo;s words, so
says I, &ldquo;I wonder, sir, you should give yourself that trouble,
to come so far to see a &lsquo;canting old fool,&rsquo; such as me.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;He seemed taken aback at that; but he would fain persuade me
&lsquo;at the Rector was only in jest; and when that wouldn&rsquo;t
do, he says, &ldquo;Well, Nancy, you shouldn&rsquo;t think so much about
it: Mr. Hatfield was a little out of humour just then: you know we&rsquo;re
none of us perfect - even Moses spoke unadvisedly with his lips.&nbsp;
But now sit down a minute, if you can spare the time, and tell me all
your doubts and fears; and I&rsquo;ll try to remove them.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;So I sat me down anent him.&nbsp; He was quite a stranger, you
know, Miss Grey, and even <i>younger</i> nor Maister Hatfield, I believe;
and I had thought him not so pleasant-looking as him, and rather a bit
crossish, at first, to look at; but he spake so civil like - and when
th&rsquo; cat, poor thing, jumped on to his knee, he only stroked her,
and gave a bit of a smile: so I thought that was a good sign; for once,
when she did so to th&rsquo; Rector, he knocked her off, like as it
might be in scorn and anger, poor thing.&nbsp; But you can&rsquo;t expect
a cat to know manners like a Christian, you know, Miss Grey.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No; of course not, Nancy.&nbsp; But what did Mr. Weston say then?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;He said nought; but he listened to me as steady an&rsquo; patient
as could be, an&rsquo; never a bit o&rsquo; scorn about him; so I went
on, an&rsquo; telled him all, just as I&rsquo;ve telled you - an&rsquo;
more too.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;Mr. Hatfield was quite right
in telling you to persevere in doing your duty; but in advising you
to go to church and attend to the service, and so on, he didn&rsquo;t
mean that was the whole of a Christian&rsquo;s duty: he only thought
you might there learn what more was to be done, and be led to take delight
in those exercises, instead of finding them a task and a burden.&nbsp;
And if you had asked him to explain those words that trouble you so
much, I think he would have told you, that if many shall seek to enter
in at the strait gate and shall not be able, it is their own sins that
hinder them; just as a man with a large sack on his back might wish
to pass through a narrow doorway, and find it impossible to do so unless
he would leave his sack behind him.&nbsp; But you, Nancy, I dare say,
have no sins that you would not gladly throw aside, if you knew how?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Indeed, sir, you speak truth,&rdquo; said I.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;you know the first and great
commandment - and the second, which is like unto it - on which two commandments
hang all the law and the prophets?&nbsp; You say you cannot love God;
but it strikes me that if you rightly consider who and what He is, you
cannot help it.&nbsp; He is your father, your best friend: every blessing,
everything good, pleasant, or useful, comes from Him; and everything
evil, everything you have reason to hate, to shun, or to fear, comes
from Satan - <i>His</i> enemy as well as ours.&nbsp; And for <i>this</i>
cause was God manifest in the flesh, that He might destroy the works
of the Devil: in one word, God is LOVE; and the more of love we have
within us, the nearer we are to Him and the more of His spirit we possess.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;if I can always think
on these things, I think I might well love God: but how can I love my
neighbours, when they vex me, and be so contrary and sinful as some
on &rsquo;em is?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;It may seem a hard matter,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to love
our neighbours, who have so much of what is evil about them, and whose
faults so often awaken the evil that lingers within ourselves; but remember
that <i>He</i> made them, and <i>He</i> loves them; and whosoever loveth
him that begat, loveth him that is begotten also.&nbsp; And if God so
loveth us, that He gave His only begotten Son to die for us, we ought
also to love one another.&nbsp; But if you cannot feel positive affection
for those who do not care for you, you can at least try to do to them
as you would they should do unto you: you can endeavour to pity their
failings and excuse their offences, and to do all the good you can to
those about you.&nbsp; And if you accustom yourself to this, Nancy,
the very effort itself will make you love them in some degree - to say
nothing of the goodwill your kindness would beget in them, though they
might have little else that is good about them.&nbsp; If we love God
and wish to serve Him, let us try to be like Him, to do His work, to
labour for His glory - which is the good of man - to hasten the coming
of His kingdom, which is the peace and happiness of all the world: however
powerless we may seem to be, in doing all the good we can through life,
the humblest of us may do much towards it: and let us dwell in love,
that He may dwell in us and we in Him.&nbsp; The more happiness we bestow,
the more we shall receive, even here; and the greater will be our reward
in heaven when we rest from our labours.&rdquo;&nbsp; I believe, Miss,
them is his very words, for I&rsquo;ve thought &rsquo;em ower many a
time.&nbsp; An&rsquo; then he took that Bible, an&rsquo; read bits here
and there, an&rsquo; explained &rsquo;em as clear as the day: and it
seemed like as a new light broke in on my soul; an&rsquo; I felt fair
aglow about my heart, an&rsquo; only wished poor Bill an&rsquo; all
the world could ha&rsquo; been there, an&rsquo; heard it all, and rejoiced
wi&rsquo; me.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;After he was gone, Hannah Rogers, one o&rsquo; th&rsquo; neighbours,
came in and wanted me to help her to wash.&nbsp; I telled her I couldn&rsquo;t
just then, for I hadn&rsquo;t set on th&rsquo; potaties for th&rsquo;
dinner, nor washed up th&rsquo; breakfast stuff yet.&nbsp; So then she
began a-calling me for my nasty idle ways.&nbsp; I was a little bit
vexed at first, but I never said nothing wrong to her: I only telled
her like all in a quiet way, &rsquo;at I&rsquo;d had th&rsquo; new parson
to see me; but I&rsquo;d get done as quick as ever I could, an&rsquo;
then come an&rsquo; help her.&nbsp; So then she softened down; and my
heart like as it warmed towards her, an&rsquo; in a bit we was very
good friends.&nbsp; An&rsquo; so it is, Miss Grey, &ldquo;a soft answer
turneth away wrath; but grievous words stir up anger.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
isn&rsquo;t only in them you speak to, but in yourself.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Very true, Nancy, if we could always remember it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Ay, if we could!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And did Mr. Weston ever come to see you again?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, many a time; and since my eyes has been so bad, he&rsquo;s
sat an&rsquo; read to me by the half-hour together: but you know, Miss,
he has other folks to see, and other things to do - God bless him!&nbsp;
An&rsquo; that next Sunday he preached <i>such</i> a sermon!&nbsp; His
text was, &ldquo;Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest,&rdquo; and them two blessed verses that follows.&nbsp;
You wasn&rsquo;t there, Miss, you was with your friends then - but it
made me <i>so</i> happy!&nbsp; And I <i>am</i> happy now, thank God!
an&rsquo; I take a pleasure, now, in doing little bits o&rsquo; jobs
for my neighbours - such as a poor old body &rsquo;at&rsquo;s half blind
can do; and they take it kindly of me, just as he said.&nbsp; You see,
Miss, I&rsquo;m knitting a pair o&rsquo; stockings now; - they&rsquo;re
for Thomas Jackson: he&rsquo;s a queerish old body, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve
had many a bout at threaping, one anent t&rsquo;other; an&rsquo; at
times we&rsquo;ve differed sorely.&nbsp; So I thought I couldn&rsquo;t
do better nor knit him a pair o&rsquo; warm stockings; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve
felt to like him a deal better, poor old man, sin&rsquo; I began.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s turned out just as Maister Weston said.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m very glad to see you so happy, Nancy, and so
wise: but I must go now; I shall be wanted at the Hall,&rsquo; said
I; and bidding her good-bye, I departed, promising to come again when
I had time, and feeling nearly as happy as herself.<br>
<br>
At another time I went to read to a poor labourer who was in the last
stage of consumption.&nbsp; The young ladies had been to see him, and
somehow a promise of reading had been extracted from them; but it was
too much trouble, so they begged me to do it instead.&nbsp; I went,
willingly enough; and there too I was gratified with the praises of
Mr. Weston, both from the sick man and his wife.&nbsp; The former told
me that he derived great comfort and benefit from the visits of the
new parson, who frequently came to see him, and was &lsquo;another guess
sort of man&rsquo; to Mr. Hatfield; who, before the other&rsquo;s arrival
at Horton, had now and then paid him a visit; on which occasions he
would always insist upon having the cottage-door kept open, to admit
the fresh air for his own convenience, without considering how it might
injure the sufferer; and having opened his prayer-book and hastily read
over a part of the Service for the Sick, would hurry away again: if
he did not stay to administer some harsh rebuke to the afflicted wife,
or to make some thoughtless, not to say heartless, observation, rather
calculated to increase than diminish the troubles of the suffering pair.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Whereas,&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;Maister Weston &rsquo;ull
pray with me quite in a different fashion, an&rsquo; talk to me as kind
as owt; an&rsquo; oft read to me too, an&rsquo; sit beside me just like
a brother.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Just for all the world!&rsquo; exclaimed his wife; &lsquo;an&rsquo;
about a three wik sin&rsquo;, when he seed how poor Jem shivered wi&rsquo;
cold, an&rsquo; what pitiful fires we kept, he axed if wer stock of
coals was nearly done.&nbsp; I telled him it was, an&rsquo; we was ill
set to get more: but you know, mum, I didn&rsquo;t think o&rsquo; him
helping us; but, howsever, he sent us a sack o&rsquo; coals next day;
an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ve had good fires ever sin&rsquo;: and a great blessing
it is, this winter time.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s his way, Miss Grey:
when he comes into a poor body&rsquo;s house a-seein&rsquo; sick folk,
he like notices what they most stand i&rsquo; need on; an&rsquo; if
he thinks they can&rsquo;t readily get it therseln, he never says nowt
about it, but just gets it for &rsquo;em.&nbsp; An&rsquo; it isn&rsquo;t
everybody &rsquo;at &rsquo;ud do that, &rsquo;at has as little as he
has: for you know, mum, he&rsquo;s nowt at all to live on but what he
gets fra&rsquo; th&rsquo; Rector, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s little enough
they say.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I remembered then, with a species of exultation, that he had frequently
been styled a vulgar brute by the amiable Miss Murray, because he wore
a silver watch, and clothes not quite so bright and fresh as Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s.<br>
<br>
In returning to the Lodge I felt very happy, and thanked God that I
had now something to think about; something to dwell on as a relief
from the weary monotony, the lonely drudgery, of my present life: for
I <i>was</i> lonely.&nbsp; Never, from month to month, from year to
year, except during my brief intervals of rest at home, did I see one
creature to whom I could open my heart, or freely speak my thoughts
with any hope of sympathy, or even comprehension: never one, unless
it were poor Nancy Brown, with whom I could enjoy a single moment of
real social intercourse, or whose conversation was calculated to render
me better, wiser, or happier than before; or who, as far as I could
see, could be greatly benefited by mine.&nbsp; My only companions had
been unamiable children, and ignorant, wrong-headed girls; from whose
fatiguing folly, unbroken solitude was often a relief most earnestly
desired and dearly prized.&nbsp; But to be restricted to such associates
was a serious evil, both in its immediate effects and the consequences
that were likely to ensue.&nbsp; Never a new idea or stirring thought
came to me from without; and such as rose within me were, for the most
part, miserably crushed at once, or doomed to sicken or fade away, because
they could not see the light.<br>
<br>
Habitual associates are known to exercise a great influence over each
other&rsquo;s minds and manners.&nbsp; Those whose actions are for ever
before our eyes, whose words are ever in our ears, will naturally lead
us, albeit against our will, slowly, gradually, imperceptibly, perhaps,
to act and speak as they do.&nbsp; I will not presume to say how far
this irresistible power of assimilation extends; but if one civilised
man were doomed to pass a dozen years amid a race of intractable savages,
unless he had power to improve them, I greatly question whether, at
the close of that period, he would not have become, at least, a barbarian
himself.&nbsp; And I, as I could not make my young companions better,
feared exceedingly that they would make me worse - would gradually bring
my feelings, habits, capacities, to the level of their own; without,
however, imparting to me their lightheartedness and cheerful vivacity.<br>
<br>
Already, I seemed to feel my intellect deteriorating, my heart petrifying,
my soul contracting; and I trembled lest my very moral perceptions should
become deadened, my distinctions of right and wrong confounded, and
all my better faculties be sunk, at last, beneath the baneful influence
of such a mode of life.&nbsp; The gross vapours of earth were gathering
around me, and closing in upon my inward heaven; and thus it was that
Mr. Weston rose at length upon me, appearing like the morning star in
my horizon, to save me from the fear of utter darkness; and I rejoiced
that I had now a subject for contemplation that was above me, not beneath.&nbsp;
I was glad to see that all the world was not made up of Bloomfields,
Murrays, Hatfields, Ashbys, &amp;c.; and that human excellence was not
a mere dream of the imagination.&nbsp; When we hear a little good and
no harm of a person, it is easy and pleasant to imagine more: in short,
it is needless to analyse all my thoughts; but Sunday was now become
a day of peculiar delight to me (I was now almost broken-in to the back
corner in the carriage), for I liked to hear him - and I liked to see
him, too; though I knew he was not handsome, or even what is called
agreeable, in outward aspect; but, certainly, he was not ugly.<br>
<br>
In stature he was a little, a very little, above the middle size; the
outline of his face would be pronounced too square for beauty, but to
me it announced decision of character; his dark brown hair was not carefully
curled, like Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s, but simply brushed aside over a broad
white forehead; the eyebrows, I suppose, were too projecting, but from
under those dark brows there gleamed an eye of singular power, brown
in colour, not large, and somewhat deep-set, but strikingly brilliant,
and full of expression; there was character, too, in the mouth, something
that bespoke a man of firm purpose and an habitual thinker; and when
he smiled - but I will not speak of that yet, for, at the time I mention,
I had never seen him smile: and, indeed, his general appearance did
not impress me with the idea of a man given to such a relaxation, nor
of such an individual as the cottagers described him.&nbsp; I had early
formed my opinion of him; and, in spite of Miss Murray&rsquo;s objurgations:
was fully convinced that he was a man of strong sense, firm faith, and
ardent piety, but thoughtful and stern: and when I found that, to his
other good qualities, was added that of true benevolence and gentle,
considerate kindness, the discovery, perhaps, delighted me the more,
as I had not been prepared to expect it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XII - THE SHOWER<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The next visit I paid to Nancy Brown was in the second week in March:
for, though I had many spare minutes during the day, I seldom could
look upon an hour as entirely my own; since, where everything was left
to the caprices of Miss Matilda and her sister, there could be no order
or regularity.&nbsp; Whatever occupation I chose, when not actually
busied about them or their concerns, I had, as it were, to keep my loins
girded, my shoes on my feet, and my staff in my hand; for not to be
immediately forthcoming when called for, was regarded as a grave and
inexcusable offence: not only by my pupils and their mother, but by
the very servant, who came in breathless haste to call me, exclaiming,
&lsquo;You&rsquo;re to go to the schoolroom <i>directly</i>, mum, the
young ladies is WAITING!!&rsquo;&nbsp; Climax of horror! actually waiting
for their governess!!!<br>
<br>
But this time I was pretty sure of an hour or two to myself; for Matilda
was preparing for a long ride, and Rosalie was dressing for a dinner-party
at Lady Ashby&rsquo;s: so I took the opportunity of repairing to the
widow&rsquo;s cottage, where I found her in some anxiety about her cat,
which had been absent all day.&nbsp; I comforted her with as many anecdotes
of that animal&rsquo;s roving propensities as I could recollect.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m feared o&rsquo; th&rsquo; gamekeepers,&rsquo; said
she: &lsquo;that&rsquo;s all &rsquo;at I think on.&nbsp; If th&rsquo;
young gentlemen had been at home, I should a&rsquo; thought they&rsquo;d
been setting their dogs at her, an&rsquo; worried her, poor thing, as
they did <i>many</i> a poor thing&rsquo;s cat; but I haven&rsquo;t that
to be feared on now.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nancy&rsquo;s eyes were better, but
still far from well: she had been trying to make a Sunday shirt for
her son, but told me she could only bear to do a little bit at it now
and then, so that it progressed but slowly, though the poor lad wanted
it sadly.&nbsp; So I proposed to help her a little, after I had read
to her, for I had plenty of time that evening, and need not return till
dusk.&nbsp; She thankfully accepted the offer.&nbsp; &lsquo;An&rsquo;
you&rsquo;ll be a bit o&rsquo; company for me too, Miss,&rsquo; said
she; &lsquo;I like as I feel lonesome without my cat.&rsquo;&nbsp; But
when I had finished reading, and done the half of a seam, with Nancy&rsquo;s
capacious brass thimble fitted on to my finger by means of a roll of
paper, I was disturbed by the entrance of Mr. Weston, with the identical
cat in his arms.&nbsp; I now saw that he could smile, and very pleasantly
too.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done you a piece of good service, Nancy,&rsquo; he
began: then seeing me, he acknowledged my presence by a slight bow.&nbsp;
I should have been invisible to Hatfield, or any other gentleman of
those parts.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve delivered your cat,&rsquo; he continued,
&lsquo;from the hands, or rather the gun, of Mr. Murray&rsquo;s gamekeeper.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;God bless you, sir!&rsquo; cried the grateful old woman, ready
to weep for joy as she received her favourite from his arms.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Take care of it,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and don&rsquo;t let it
go near the rabbit-warren, for the gamekeeper swears he&rsquo;ll shoot
it if he sees it there again: he would have done so to-day, if I had
not been in time to stop him.&nbsp; I believe it is raining, Miss Grey,&rsquo;
added he, more quietly, observing that I had put aside my work, and
was preparing to depart.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let me disturb you
- I shan&rsquo;t stay two minutes.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll <i>both</i> stay while this shower gets owered,&rsquo;
said Nancy, as she stirred the fire, and placed another chair beside
it; &lsquo;what! there&rsquo;s room for all.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I can see better here, thank you, Nancy,&rsquo; replied I, taking
my work to the window, where she had the goodness to suffer me to remain
unmolested, while she got a brush to remove the cat&rsquo;s hairs from
Mr. Weston&rsquo;s coat, carefully wiped the rain from his hat, and
gave the cat its supper, busily talking all the time: now thanking her
clerical friend for what he had done; now wondering how the cat had
found out the warren; and now lamenting the probable consequences of
such a discovery.&nbsp; He listened with a quiet, good-natured smile,
and at length took a seat in compliance with her pressing invitations,
but repeated that he did not mean to stay.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I have another place to go to,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and I see&rsquo;
(glancing at the book on the table) &lsquo;someone else has been reading
to you.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, sir; Miss Grey has been as kind as read me a chapter; an&rsquo;
now she&rsquo;s helping me with a shirt for our Bill - but I&rsquo;m
feared she&rsquo;ll be cold there.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you come to th&rsquo;
fire, Miss?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, thank you, Nancy, I&rsquo;m quite warm.&nbsp; I must go as
soon as this shower is over.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, Miss!&nbsp; You said you could stop while dusk!&rsquo; cried
the provoking old woman, and Mr. Weston seized his hat.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Nay, sir,&rsquo; exclaimed she, &lsquo;pray don&rsquo;t go now,
while it rains so fast.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But it strikes me I&rsquo;m keeping your visitor away from the
fire.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, you&rsquo;re not, Mr. Weston,&rsquo; replied I, hoping there
was no harm in a falsehood of that description.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, sure!&rsquo; cried Nancy.&nbsp; &lsquo;What, there&rsquo;s
lots o&rsquo; room!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Miss Grey,&rsquo; said he, half-jestingly, as if he felt it necessary
to change the present subject, whether he had anything particular to
say or not, &lsquo;I wish you would make my peace with the squire, when
you see him.&nbsp; He was by when I rescued Nancy&rsquo;s cat, and did
not quite approve of the deed.&nbsp; I told him I thought he might better
spare all his rabbits than she her cat, for which audacious assertion
he treated me to some rather ungentlemanly language; and I fear I retorted
a trifle too warmly.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, lawful sir!&nbsp; I hope you didn&rsquo;t fall out wi&rsquo;
th&rsquo; maister for sake o&rsquo; my cat! he cannot bide answering
again - can th&rsquo; maister.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s no matter, Nancy: I don&rsquo;t care about it,
really; I said nothing <i>very</i> uncivil; and I suppose Mr. Murray
is accustomed to use rather strong language when he&rsquo;s heated.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Ay, sir: it&rsquo;s a pity.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And now, I really must go.&nbsp; I have to visit a place a mile
beyond this; and you would not have me to return in the dark: besides,
it has nearly done raining now - so good-evening, Nancy.&nbsp; Good-evening,
Miss Grey.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Good-evening, Mr. Weston; but don&rsquo;t depend upon me for
making your peace with Mr. Murray, for I never see him - to speak to.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you; it can&rsquo;t be helped then,&rsquo; replied
he, in dolorous resignation: then, with a peculiar half-smile, he added,
&lsquo;But never mind; I imagine the squire has more to apologise for
than I;&rsquo; and left the cottage.<br>
<br>
I went on with my sewing as long as I could see, and then bade Nancy
good-evening; checking her too lively gratitude by the undeniable assurance
that I had only done for her what she would have done for me, if she
had been in my place and I in hers.&nbsp; I hastened back to Horton
Lodge, where, having entered the schoolroom, I found the tea-table all
in confusion, the tray flooded with slops, and Miss Matilda in a most
ferocious humour.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Miss Grey, whatever have you been about?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had
tea half an hour ago, and had to make it myself, and drink it all alone!&nbsp;
I wish you would come in sooner!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been to see Nancy Brown.&nbsp; I thought you would
not be back from your ride.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;How could I ride in the rain, I should like to know.&nbsp; That
damned pelting shower was vexatious enough - coming on when I was just
in full swing: and then to come and find nobody in to tea! and you know
I can&rsquo;t make the tea as I like it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of the shower,&rsquo; replied I (and, indeed,
the thought of its driving her home had never entered my head).<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, of course; you were under shelter yourself, and you never
thought of other people.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I bore her coarse reproaches with astonishing equanimity, even with
cheerfulness; for I was sensible that I had done more good to Nancy
Brown than harm to her: and perhaps some other thoughts assisted to
keep up my spirits, and impart a relish to the cup of cold, overdrawn
tea, and a charm to the otherwise unsightly table; and - I had almost
said - to Miss Matilda&rsquo;s unamiable face.&nbsp; But she soon betook
herself to the stables, and left me to the quiet enjoyment of my solitary
meal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XIII - THE PRIMROSES<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Miss Murray now always went twice to church, for she so loved admiration
that she could not bear to lose a single opportunity of obtaining it;
and she was so sure of it wherever she showed herself, that, whether
Harry Meltham and Mr. Green were there or not, there was certain to
be somebody present who would not be insensible to her charms, besides
the Rector, whose official capacity generally obliged him to attend.&nbsp;
Usually, also, if the weather permitted, both she and her sister would
walk home; Matilda, because she hated the confinement of the carriage;
she, because she disliked the privacy of it, and enjoyed the company
that generally enlivened the first mile of the journey in walking from
the church to Mr. Green&rsquo;s park-gates: near which commenced the
private road to Horton Lodge, which lay in the opposite direction, while
the highway conducted in a straightforward course to the still more
distant mansion of Sir Hugh Meltham.&nbsp; Thus there was always a chance
of being accompanied, so far, either by Harry Meltham, with or without
Miss Meltham, or Mr. Green, with perhaps one or both of his sisters,
and any gentlemen visitors they might have.<br>
<br>
Whether I walked with the young ladies or rode with their parents, depended
upon their own capricious will: if they chose to &lsquo;take&rsquo;
me, I went; if, for reasons best known to themselves, they chose to
go alone, I took my seat in the carriage.&nbsp; I liked walking better,
but a sense of reluctance to obtrude my presence on anyone who did not
desire it, always kept me passive on these and similar occasions; and
I never inquired into the causes of their varying whims.&nbsp; Indeed,
this was the best policy - for to submit and oblige was the governess&rsquo;s
part, to consult their own pleasure was that of the pupils.&nbsp; But
when I did walk, the first half of journey was generally a great nuisance
to me.&nbsp; As none of the before-mentioned ladies and gentlemen ever
noticed me, it was disagreeable to walk beside them, as if listening
to what they said, or wishing to be thought one of them, while they
talked over me, or across; and if their eyes, in speaking, chanced to
fall on me, it seemed as if they looked on vacancy - as if they either
did not see me, or were very desirous to make it appear so.&nbsp; It
was disagreeable, too, to walk behind, and thus appear to acknowledge
my own inferiority; for, in truth, I considered myself pretty nearly
as good as the best of them, and wished them to know that I did so,
and not to imagine that I looked upon myself as a mere domestic, who
knew her own place too well to walk beside such fine ladies and gentlemen
as they were - though her young ladies might choose to have her with
them, and even condescend to converse with her when no better company
were at hand.&nbsp; Thus - I am almost ashamed to confess it - but indeed
I gave myself no little trouble in my endeavours (if I did keep up with
them) to appear perfectly unconscious or regardless of their presence,
as if I were wholly absorbed in my own reflections, or the contemplation
of surrounding objects; or, if I lingered behind, it was some bird or
insect, some tree or flower, that attracted my attention, and having
duly examined that, I would pursue my walk alone, at a leisurely pace,
until my pupils had bidden adieu to their companions and turned off
into the quiet private road.<br>
<br>
One such occasion I particularly well remember; it was a lovely afternoon
about the close of March; Mr. Green and his sisters had sent their carriage
back empty, in order to enjoy the bright sunshine and balmy air in a
sociable walk home along with their visitors, Captain Somebody and Lieutenant
Somebody-else (a couple of military fops), and the Misses Murray, who,
of course, contrived to join them.&nbsp; Such a party was highly agreeable
to Rosalie; but not finding it equally suitable to my taste, I presently
fell back, and began to botanise and entomologise along the green banks
and budding hedges, till the company was considerably in advance of
me, and I could hear the sweet song of the happy lark; then my spirit
of misanthropy began to melt away beneath the soft, pure air and genial
sunshine; but sad thoughts of early childhood, and yearnings for departed
joys, or for a brighter future lot, arose instead.&nbsp; As my eyes
wandered over the steep banks covered with young grass and green-leaved
plants, and surmounted by budding hedges, I longed intensely for some
familiar flower that might recall the woody dales or green hill-sides
of home: the brown moorlands, of course, were out of the question.&nbsp;
Such a discovery would make my eyes gush out with water, no doubt; but
that was one of my greatest enjoyments now.&nbsp; At length I descried,
high up between the twisted roots of an oak, three lovely primroses,
peeping so sweetly from their hiding-place that the tears already started
at the sight; but they grew so high above me, that I tried in vain to
gather one or two, to dream over and to carry with me: I could not reach
them unless I climbed the bank, which I was deterred from doing by hearing
a footstep at that moment behind me, and was, therefore, about to turn
away, when I was startled by the words, &lsquo;Allow me to gather them
for you, Miss Grey,&rsquo; spoken in the grave, low tones of a well-known
voice.&nbsp; Immediately the flowers were gathered, and in my hand.&nbsp;
It was Mr. Weston, of course - who else would trouble himself to do
so much for <i>me</i>?<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I thanked him; whether warmly or coldly, I cannot tell: but certain
I am that I did not express half the gratitude I felt.&nbsp; It was
foolish, perhaps, to feel any gratitude at all; but it seemed to me,
at that moment, as if this were a remarkable instance of his good-nature:
an act of kindness, which I could not repay, but never should forget:
so utterly unaccustomed was I to receive such civilities, so little
prepared to expect them from anyone within fifty miles of Horton Lodge.&nbsp;
Yet this did not prevent me from feeling a little uncomfortable in his
presence; and I proceeded to follow my pupils at a much quicker pace
than before; though, perhaps, if Mr. Weston had taken the hint, and
let me pass without another word, I might have repeated it an hour after:
but he did not.&nbsp; A somewhat rapid walk for me was but an ordinary
pace for him.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Your young ladies have left you alone,&rsquo; said he.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, they are occupied with more agreeable company.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Then don&rsquo;t trouble yourself to overtake them.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I slackened my pace; but next moment regretted having done so: my companion
did not speak; and I had nothing in the world to say, and feared he
might be in the same predicament.&nbsp; At length, however, he broke
the pause by asking, with a certain quiet abruptness peculiar to himself,
if I liked flowers.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes; very much,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;wild-flowers especially.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;<i>I</i> like wild-flowers,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;others I don&rsquo;t
care about, because I have no particular associations connected with
them - except one or two.&nbsp; What are your favourite flowers?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Primroses, bluebells, and heath-blossoms.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Not violets?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No; because, as you say, I have no particular associations connected
with them; for there are no sweet violets among the hills and valleys
round my home.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;It must be a great consolation to you to have a home, Miss Grey,&rsquo;
observed my companion after a short pause: &lsquo;however remote, or
however seldom visited, still it is something to look to.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;It is so much that I think I could not live without it,&rsquo;
replied I, with an enthusiasm of which I immediately repented; for I
thought it must have sounded essentially silly.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, yes, you could,&rsquo; said he, with a thoughtful smile.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The ties that bind us to life are tougher than you imagine, or
than anyone can who has not felt how roughly they may be pulled without
breaking.&nbsp; You might be miserable without a home, but even <i>you</i>
could live; and not so miserably as you suppose.&nbsp; The human heart
is like india-rubber; a little swells it, but a great deal will not
burst it.&nbsp; If &ldquo;little more than nothing will disturb it,
little less than all things will suffice&rdquo; to break it.&nbsp; As
in the outer members of our frame, there is a vital power inherent in
itself that strengthens it against external violence.&nbsp; Every blow
that shakes it will serve to harden it against a future stroke; as constant
labour thickens the skin of the hand, and strengthens its muscles instead
of wasting them away: so that a day of arduous toil, that might excoriate
a lady&rsquo;s palm, would make no sensible impression on that of a
hardy ploughman.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I speak from experience - partly my own.&nbsp; There was a time
when I thought as you do - at least, I was fully persuaded that home
and its affections were the only things that made life tolerable: that,
if deprived of these, existence would become a burden hard to be endured;
but now I have no home - unless you would dignify my two hired rooms
at Horton by such a name; - and not twelve months ago I lost the last
and dearest of my early friends; and yet, not only I live, but I am
not wholly destitute of hope and comfort, even for this life: though
I must acknowledge that I can seldom enter even an humble cottage at
the close of day, and see its inhabitants peaceably gathered around
their cheerful hearth, without a feeling <i>almost</i> of envy at their
domestic enjoyment.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know what happiness lies before you yet,&rsquo;
said I: &lsquo;you are now only in the commencement of your journey.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The best of happiness,&rsquo; replied he, &lsquo;is mine already
- the power and the will to be useful.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
We now approached a stile communicating with a footpath that conducted
to a farm-house, where, I suppose, Mr. Weston purposed to make himself
&lsquo;useful;&rsquo; for he presently took leave of me, crossed the
stile, and traversed the path with his usual firm, elastic tread, leaving
me to ponder his words as I continued my course alone.&nbsp; I had heard
before that he had lost his mother not many months before he came.&nbsp;
She then was the last and dearest of his early friends; and he had <i>no
home</i>.&nbsp; I pitied him from my heart: I almost wept for sympathy.&nbsp;
And this, I thought, accounted for the shade of premature thoughtfulness
that so frequently clouded his brow, and obtained for him the reputation
of a morose and sullen disposition with the charitable Miss Murray and
all her kin.&nbsp; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; thought I, &lsquo;he is not so
miserable as I should be under such a deprivation: he leads an active
life; and a wide field for useful exertion lies before him.&nbsp; He
can <i>make</i> friends; and he can make a home too, if he pleases;
and, doubtless, he will please some time.&nbsp; God grant the partner
of that home may be worthy of his choice, and make it a happy one -
such a home as he deserves to have!&nbsp; And how delightful it would
be to - &rsquo;&nbsp; But no matter what I thought.<br>
<br>
I began this book with the intention of concealing nothing; that those
who liked might have the benefit of perusing a fellow-creature&rsquo;s
heart: but we have some thoughts that all the angels in heaven are welcome
to behold, but not our brother-men - not even the best and kindest amongst
them.<br>
<br>
By this time the Greens had taken themselves to their own abode, and
the Murrays had turned down the private road, whither I hastened to
follow them.&nbsp; I found the two girls warm in an animated discussion
on the respective merits of the two young officers; but on seeing me
Rosalie broke off in the middle of a sentence to exclaim, with malicious
glee -<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh-ho, Miss Grey! you&rsquo;re come at last, are you?&nbsp; No
<i>wonder</i> you lingered so long behind; and no <i>wonder</i> you
always stand up so vigorously for Mr. Weston when I abuse him.&nbsp;
Ah-ha!&nbsp; I see it all now!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Now, come, Miss Murray, don&rsquo;t be foolish,&rsquo; said I,
attempting a good-natured laugh; &lsquo;you know such nonsense can make
no impression on me.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
But she still went on talking such intolerable stuff - her sister helping
her with appropriate fiction coined for the occasion - that I thought
it necessary to say something in my own justification.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;What folly all this is!&rsquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &lsquo;If Mr.
Weston&rsquo;s road happened to be the same as mine for a few yards,
and if he chose to exchange a word or two in passing, what is there
so remarkable in that?&nbsp; I assure you, I never spoke to him before:
except once.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Where? where? and when?&rsquo; cried they eagerly.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;In Nancy&rsquo;s cottage.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Ah-ha! you&rsquo;ve met him there, have you?&rsquo; exclaimed
Rosalie, with exultant laughter.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah! now, Matilda, I&rsquo;ve
found out why she&rsquo;s so fond of going to Nancy Brown&rsquo;s!&nbsp;
She goes there to flirt with Mr. Weston.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Really, that is not worth contradicting - I only saw him there
once, I tell you - and how could I know he was coming?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Irritated as I was at their foolish mirth and vexatious imputations,
the uneasiness did not continue long: when they had had their laugh
out, they returned again to the captain and lieutenant; and, while they
disputed and commented upon them, my indignation rapidly cooled; the
cause of it was quickly forgotten, and I turned my thoughts into a pleasanter
channel.&nbsp; Thus we proceeded up the park, and entered the hall;
and as I ascended the stairs to my own chamber, I had but one thought
within me: my heart was filled to overflowing with one single earnest
wish.&nbsp; Having entered the room, and shut the door, I fell upon
my knees and offered up a fervent but not impetuous prayer: &lsquo;Thy
will be done,&rsquo; I strove to say throughout; but, &lsquo;Father,
all things are possible with Thee, and may it be Thy will,&rsquo; was
sure to follow.&nbsp; That wish - that prayer - both men and women would
have scorned me for - &lsquo;But, Father, <i>Thou</i> wilt <i>not</i>
despise!&rsquo; I said, and felt that it was true.&nbsp; It seemed to
me that another&rsquo;s welfare was at least as ardently implored for
as my own; nay, even <i>that</i> was the principal object of my heart&rsquo;s
desire.&nbsp; I might have been deceiving myself; but that idea gave
me confidence to ask, and power to hope I did not ask in vain.&nbsp;
As for the primroses, I kept two of them in a glass in my room until
they were completely withered, and the housemaid threw them out; and
the petals of the other I pressed between the leaves of my Bible - I
have them still, and mean to keep them always.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XIV - THE RECTOR<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The following day was as fine as the preceding one.&nbsp; Soon after
breakfast Miss Matilda, having galloped and blundered through a few
unprofitable lessons, and vengeably thumped the piano for an hour, in
a terrible humour with both me and it, because her mamma would not give
her a holiday, had betaken herself to her favourite places of resort,
the yards, the stables, and the dog-kennels; and Miss Murray was gone
forth to enjoy a quiet ramble with a new fashionable novel for her companion,
leaving me in the schoolroom hard at work upon a water-colour drawing
which I had promised to do for her, and which she insisted upon my finishing
that day.<br>
<br>
At my feet lay a little rough terrier.&nbsp; It was the property of
Miss Matilda; but she hated the animal, and intended to sell it, alleging
that it was quite spoiled.&nbsp; It was really an excellent dog of its
kind; but she affirmed it was fit for nothing, and had not even the
sense to know its own mistress.<br>
<br>
The fact was she had purchased it when but a small puppy, insisting
at first that no one should touch it but herself; but soon becoming
tired of so helpless and troublesome a nursling, she had gladly yielded
to my entreaties to be allowed to take charge of it; and I, by carefully
nursing the little creature from infancy to adolescence, of course,
had obtained its affections: a reward I should have greatly valued,
and looked upon as far outweighing all the trouble I had had with it,
had not poor Snap&rsquo;s grateful feelings exposed him to many a harsh
word and many a spiteful kick and pinch from his owner, and were he
not now in danger of being &lsquo;put away&rsquo; in consequence, or
transferred to some rough, stony-hearted master.&nbsp; But how could
I help it?&nbsp; I could not make the dog hate me by cruel treatment,
and she would not propitiate him by kindness.<br>
<br>
However, while I thus sat, working away with my pencil, Mrs. Murray
came, half-sailing, half-bustling, into the room.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Miss Grey,&rsquo; she began, - &lsquo;dear! how can you sit at
your drawing such a day as this?&rsquo;&nbsp; (She thought I was doing
it for my own pleasure.)&nbsp; &lsquo;I <i>wonder</i> you don&rsquo;t
put on your bonnet and go out with the young ladies.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I think, ma&rsquo;am, Miss Murray is reading; and Miss Matilda
is amusing herself with her dogs.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;If you would try to amuse Miss Matilda yourself a little more,
I think she would not be driven to seek amusement in the companionship
of dogs and horses and grooms, so much as she is; and if you would be
a little more cheerful and conversable with Miss Murray, she would not
so often go wandering in the fields with a book in her hand.&nbsp; However,
I don&rsquo;t want to vex you,&rsquo; added she, seeing, I suppose,
that my cheeks burned and my hand trembled with some unamiable emotion.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Do, pray, try not to be so touchy - there&rsquo;s no speaking
to you else.&nbsp; And tell me if you know where Rosalie is gone: and
why she likes to be so much alone?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;She says she likes to be alone when she has a new book to read.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But why can&rsquo;t she read it in the park or the garden? -
why should she go into the fields and lanes?&nbsp; And how is it that
that Mr. Hatfield so often finds her out?&nbsp; She told me last week
he&rsquo;d walked his horse by her side all up Moss Lane; and now I&rsquo;m
sure it was he I saw, from my dressing-room window, walking so briskly
past the park-gates, and on towards the field where she so frequently
goes.&nbsp; I wish you would go and see if she is there; and just gently
remind her that it is not proper for a young lady of her rank and prospects
to be wandering about by herself in that manner, exposed to the attentions
of anyone that presumes to address her; like some poor neglected girl
that has no park to walk in, and no friends to take care of her: and
tell her that her papa would be extremely angry if he knew of her treating
Mr. Hatfield in the familiar manner that I fear she does; and - oh!
if you - if <i>any</i> governess had but half a mother&rsquo;s watchfulness
- half a mother&rsquo;s anxious care, I should be saved this trouble;
and you would see at once the necessity of keeping your eye upon her,
and making your company agreeable to -&nbsp; Well, go - go; there&rsquo;s
no time to be lost,&rsquo; cried she, seeing that I had put away my
drawing materials, and was waiting in the doorway for the conclusion
of her address.<br>
<br>
According to her prognostications, I found Miss Murray in her favourite
field just without the park; and, unfortunately, not alone; for the
tall, stately figure of Mr. Hatfield was slowly sauntering by her side.<br>
<br>
Here was a poser for me.&nbsp; It was my duty to interrupt the <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>:
but how was it to be done?&nbsp; Mr. Hatfield could not to be driven
away by so insignificant person as I; and to go and place myself on
the other side of Miss Murray, and intrude my unwelcome presence upon
her without noticing her companion, was a piece of rudeness I could
not be guilty of: neither had I the courage to cry aloud from the top
of the field that she was wanted elsewhere.&nbsp; So I took the intermediate
course of walking slowly but steadily towards them; resolving, if my
approach failed to scare away the beau, to pass by and tell Miss Murray
her mamma wanted her.<br>
<br>
She certainly looked very charming as she strolled, lingering along
under the budding horse-chestnut trees that stretched their long arms
over the park-palings; with her closed book in one hand, and in the
other a graceful sprig of myrtle, which served her as a very pretty
plaything; her bright ringlets escaping profusely from her little bonnet,
and gently stirred by the breeze, her fair cheek flushed with gratified
vanity, her smiling blue eyes, now slyly glancing towards her admirer,
now gazing downward at her myrtle sprig.&nbsp; But Snap, running before
me, interrupted her in the midst of some half-pert, half-playful repartee,
by catching hold of her dress and vehemently tugging thereat; till Mr.
Hatfield, with his cane, administered a resounding thwack upon the animal&rsquo;s
skull, and sent it yelping back to me with a clamorous outcry that afforded
the reverend gentleman great amusement: but seeing me so near, he thought,
I suppose, he might as well be taking his departure; and, as I stooped
to caress the dog, with ostentatious pity to show my disapproval of
his severity, I heard him say: &lsquo;When shall I see you again, Miss
Murray?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;At church, I suppose,&rsquo; replied she, &lsquo;unless your
business chances to bring you here again at the precise moment when
I happen to be walking by.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I could always manage to have business here, if I knew precisely
when and where to find you.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But if I would, I could not inform you, for I am so immethodical,
I never can tell to-day what I shall do to-morrow.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Then give me that, meantime, to comfort me,&rsquo; said he, half
jestingly and half in earnest, extending his hand for the sprig of myrtle.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, indeed, I shan&rsquo;t.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Do! <i>pray</i> do!&nbsp; I shall be the most miserable of men
if you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; You cannot be so cruel as to deny me a favour
so easily granted and yet so highly prized!&rsquo; pleaded he as ardently
as if his life depended on it.<br>
<br>
By this time I stood within a very few yards of them, impatiently waiting
his departure.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;There then! take it and go,&rsquo; said Rosalie.<br>
<br>
He joyfully received the gift, murmured something that made her blush
and toss her head, but with a little laugh that showed her displeasure
was entirely affected; and then with a courteous salutation withdrew.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Did you ever see such a man, Miss Grey?&rsquo; said she, turning
to me; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so <i>glad</i> you came!&nbsp; I thought I never
<i>should</i>, get rid of him; and I was so terribly afraid of papa
seeing him.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Has he been with you long?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, not long, but he&rsquo;s so extremely impertinent: and he&rsquo;s
always hanging about, pretending his business or his clerical duties
require his attendance in these parts, and really watching for poor
me, and pouncing upon me wherever he sees me.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, your mamma thinks you ought not to go beyond the park or
garden without some discreet, matronly person like me to accompany you,
and keep off all intruders.&nbsp; She descried Mr. Hatfield hurrying
past the park-gates, and forthwith despatched me with instructions to
seek you up and to take care of you, and likewise to warn - &rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, mamma&rsquo;s so tiresome!&nbsp; As if I couldn&rsquo;t take
care of myself.&nbsp; She bothered me before about Mr. Hatfield; and
I told her she might trust me: I never should forget my rank and station
for the most delightful man that ever breathed.&nbsp; I wish he would
go down on his knees to-morrow, and implore me to be his wife, that
I might just show her how mistaken she is in supposing that I could
ever - Oh, it provokes me so!&nbsp; To think that I could be such a
fool as to fall in <i>love</i>!&nbsp; It is quite beneath the dignity
of a woman to do such a thing.&nbsp; Love!&nbsp; I detest the word!&nbsp;
As applied to one of our sex, I think it a perfect insult.&nbsp; A preference
I <i>might</i> acknowledge; but never for one like poor Mr. Hatfield,
who has not seven hundred a year to bless himself with.&nbsp; I like
to talk to him, because he&rsquo;s so clever and amusing - I wish Sir
Thomas Ashby were half as nice; besides, I must have <i>somebody</i>
to flirt with, and no one else has the sense to come here; and when
we go out, mamma won&rsquo;t let me flirt with anybody but Sir Thomas
- if he&rsquo;s there; and if he&rsquo;s <i>not</i> there, I&rsquo;m
bound hand and foot, for fear somebody should go and make up some exaggerated
story, and put it into his head that I&rsquo;m engaged, or likely to
be engaged, to somebody else; or, what is more probable, for fear his
nasty old mother should see or hear of my ongoings, and conclude that
I&rsquo;m not a fit wife for her excellent son: as if the said son were
not the greatest scamp in Christendom; and as if any woman of common
decency were not a world too good for him.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Is it really so, Miss Murray? and does your mamma know it, and
yet wish you to marry him?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;To be sure, she does!&nbsp; She knows more against him than I
do, I believe: she keeps it from me lest I should be discouraged; not
knowing how little I care about such things.&nbsp; For it&rsquo;s no
great matter, really: he&rsquo;ll be all right when he&rsquo;s married,
as mamma says; and reformed rakes make the best husbands, <i>everybody</i>
knows.&nbsp; I only wish he were not so ugly - <i>that&rsquo;s</i> all
<i>I</i> think about: but then there&rsquo;s no choice here in the country;
and papa <i>will not</i> let us go to London - &rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But I should think Mr. Hatfield would be far better.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And so he would, if he were lord of Ashby Park - there&rsquo;s
not a doubt of it: but the fact is, I <i>must</i> have Ashby Park, whoever
shares it with me.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But Mr. Hatfield thinks you like him all this time; you don&rsquo;t
consider how bitterly he will be disappointed when he finds himself
mistaken.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;<i>No</i>, indeed!&nbsp; It will be a proper punishment for his
presumption - for ever <i>daring</i> to think I could like him.&nbsp;
I should enjoy nothing so much as lifting the veil from his eyes.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The sooner you do it the better then.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No; I tell you, I like to amuse myself with him.&nbsp; Besides,
he doesn&rsquo;t really think I like him.&nbsp; I take good care of
that: you don&rsquo;t know how cleverly I manage.&nbsp; He may presume
to think he can induce me to like him; for which I shall punish him
as he deserves.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, mind you don&rsquo;t give too much reason for such presumption
- that&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; replied I.<br>
<br>
But all my exhortations were in vain: they only made her somewhat more
solicitous to disguise her wishes and her thoughts from me.&nbsp; She
talked no more to me about the Rector; but I could see that her mind,
if not her heart, was fixed upon him still, and that she was intent
upon obtaining another interview: for though, in compliance with her
mother&rsquo;s request, I was now constituted the companion of her rambles
for a time, she still persisted in wandering in the fields and lanes
that lay in the nearest proximity to the road; and, whether she talked
to me or read the book she carried in her hand, she kept continually
pausing to look round her, or gaze up the road to see if anyone was
coming; and if a horseman trotted by, I could tell by her unqualified
abuse of the poor equestrian, whoever he might be, that she hated him
<i>because</i> he was not Mr. Hatfield.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; thought I, &lsquo;she is not so indifferent to
him as she believes herself to be, or would have others to believe her;
and her mother&rsquo;s anxiety is not so wholly causeless as she affirms.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Three days passed away, and he did not make his appearance.&nbsp; On
the afternoon of the fourth, as we were walking beside the park-palings
in the memorable field, each furnished with a book (for I always took
care to provide myself with something to be doing when she did not require
me to talk), she suddenly interrupted my studies by exclaiming -<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, Miss Grey! do be so kind as to go and see Mark Wood, and
take his wife half-a-crown from me - I should have given or sent it
a week ago, but quite forgot.&nbsp; There!&rsquo; said she, throwing
me her purse, and speaking very fast - &lsquo;Never mind getting it
out now, but take the purse and give them what you like; I would go
with you, but I want to finish this volume.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll come and
meet you when I&rsquo;ve done it.&nbsp; Be quick, will you - and - oh,
wait; hadn&rsquo;t you better read to him a bit?&nbsp; Run to the house
and get some sort of a good book.&nbsp; Anything will do.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I did as I was desired; but, suspecting something from her hurried manner
and the suddenness of the request, I just glanced back before I quitted
the field, and there was Mr. Hatfield about to enter at the gate below.&nbsp;
By sending me to the house for a book, she had just prevented my meeting
him on the road.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Never mind!&rsquo; thought I, &lsquo;there&rsquo;ll be no great
harm done.&nbsp; Poor Mark will be glad of the half-crown, and perhaps
of the good book too; and if the Rector does steal Miss Rosalie&rsquo;s
heart, it will only humble her pride a little; and if they do get married
at last, it will only save her from a worse fate; and she will be quite
a good enough partner for him, and he for her.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Mark Wood was the consumptive labourer whom I mentioned before.&nbsp;
He was now rapidly wearing away.&nbsp; Miss Murray, by her liberality,
obtained literally the blessing of him that was ready to perish; for
though the half-crown could be of very little service to him, he was
glad of it for the sake of his wife and children, so soon to be widowed
and fatherless.&nbsp; After I had sat a few minutes, and read a little
for the comfort and edification of himself and his afflicted wife, I
left them; but I had not proceeded fifty yards before I encountered
Mr. Weston, apparently on his way to the same abode.&nbsp; He greeted
me in his usual quiet, unaffected way, stopped to inquire about the
condition of the sick man and his family, and with a sort of unconscious,
brotherly disregard to ceremony took from my hand the book out of which
I had been reading, turned over its pages, made a few brief but very
sensible remarks, and restored it; then told me about some poor sufferer
he had just been visiting, talked a little about Nancy Brown, made a
few observations upon my little rough friend the terrier, that was frisking
at his feet, and finally upon the beauty of the weather, and departed.<br>
<br>
I have omitted to give a detail of his words, from a notion that they
would not interest the reader as they did me, and not because I have
forgotten them.&nbsp; No; I remember them well; for I thought them over
and over again in the course of that day and many succeeding ones, I
know not how often; and recalled every intonation of his deep, clear
voice, every flash of his quick, brown eye, and every gleam of his pleasant,
but too transient smile.&nbsp; Such a confession will look very absurd,
I fear: but no matter: I have written it: and they that read it will
not know the writer.<br>
<br>
While I was walking along, happy within, and pleased with all around,
Miss Murray came hastening to meet me; her buoyant step, flushed cheek,
and radiant smiles showing that she, too, was happy, in her own way.&nbsp;
Running up to me, she put her arm through mine, and without waiting
to recover breath, began - &lsquo;Now, Miss Grey, think yourself highly
honoured, for I&rsquo;m come to tell you my news before I&rsquo;ve breathed
a word of it to anyone else.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, what is it?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, <i>such</i> news!&nbsp; In the first place, you must know
that Mr. Hatfield came upon me just after you were gone.&nbsp; I was
in such a way for fear papa or mamma should see him; but you know I
couldn&rsquo;t call you back again, and so! - oh, dear!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
tell you all about it now, for there&rsquo;s Matilda, I see, in the
park, and I must go and open my budget to her.&nbsp; But, however, Hatfield
was most uncommonly audacious, unspeakably complimentary, and unprecedentedly
tender - tried to be so, at least - he didn&rsquo;t succeed very well
in <i>that</i>, because it&rsquo;s not his vein.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell
you all he said another time.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But what did <i>you</i> say - I&rsquo;m more interested in that?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you that, too, at some future period.&nbsp; I
happened to be in a very good humour just then; but, though I was complaisant
and gracious enough, I took care not to compromise myself in any possible
way.&nbsp; But, however, the conceited wretch chose to interpret my
amiability of temper his own way, and at length presumed upon my indulgence
so far - what do you think? - he actually made me an offer!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And you - &rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I proudly drew myself up, and with the greatest coolness expressed
my astonishment at such an occurrence, and hoped he had seen nothing
in my conduct to justify his expectations.&nbsp; You should have <i>seen</i>
how his countenance fell!&nbsp; He went perfectly white in the face.&nbsp;
I assured him that I esteemed him and all that, but could not possibly
accede to his proposals; and if I did, papa and mamma could never be
brought to give their consent.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;But if they could,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;would yours
be wanting?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Certainly, Mr. Hatfield,&rdquo; I replied, with a cool
decision which quelled all hope at once.&nbsp; Oh, if you had seen how
dreadfully mortified he was - how crushed to the earth by his disappointment!
really, I almost pitied him myself.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;One more desperate attempt, however, he made.&nbsp; After a silence
of considerable duration, during which he struggled to be calm, and
I to be grave - for I felt a strong propensity to laugh - which would
have ruined all - he said, with the ghost of a smile - &ldquo;But tell
me plainly, Miss Murray, if I had the wealth of Sir Hugh Meltham, or
the prospects of his eldest son, would you still refuse me?&nbsp; Answer
me truly, upon your honour.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;That would make
no difference whatever.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;It was a great lie, but he looked so confident in his own attractions
still, that I determined not to leave him one stone upon another.&nbsp;
He looked me full in the face; but I kept my countenance so well that
he could not imagine I was saying anything more than the actual truth.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s all over, I suppose,&rdquo; he said, looking
as if he could have died on the spot with vexation and the intensity
of his despair.&nbsp; But he was angry as well as disappointed.&nbsp;
There was he, suffering so unspeakably, and there was I, the pitiless
cause of it all, so utterly impenetrable to all the artillery of his
looks and words, so calmly cold and proud, he could not but feel some
resentment; and with singular bitterness he began - &ldquo;I certainly
did not expect this, Miss Murray.&nbsp; I might say something about
your past conduct, and the hopes you have led me to foster, but I forbear,
on condition - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;No conditions, Mr. Hatfield!&rdquo; said I, now truly
indignant at his insolence.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Then let me beg it as a favour,&rdquo; he replied, lowering
his voice at once, and taking a humbler tone: &ldquo;let me entreat
that you will not mention this affair to anyone whatever.&nbsp; If you
will keep silence about it, there need be no unpleasantness on either
side - nothing, I mean, beyond what is quite unavoidable: for my own
feelings I will endeavour to keep to myself, if I cannot annihilate
them - I will try to forgive, if I cannot forget the cause of my sufferings.&nbsp;
I will not suppose, Miss Murray, that you know how deeply you have injured
me.&nbsp; I would not have you aware of it; but if, in addition to the
injury you have already done me - pardon me, but, whether innocently
or not, you <i>have</i> done it - and if you add to it by giving publicity
to this unfortunate affair, or naming it <i>at all</i>, you will find
that I too can speak, and though you scorned my love, you will hardly
scorn my - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;He stopped, but he bit his bloodless lip, and looked so terribly
fierce that I was quite frightened.&nbsp; However, my pride upheld me
still, and I answered disdainfully; &ldquo;I do not know what motive
you suppose I could have for naming it to anyone, Mr. Hatfield; but
if I were disposed to do so, you would not deter me by threats; and
it is scarcely the part of a gentleman to attempt it.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Pardon me, Miss Murray,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have
loved you so intensely - I do still adore you so deeply, that I would
not willingly offend you; but though I never have loved, and never <i>can</i>
love any woman as I have loved you, it is equally certain that I never
was so ill-treated by any.&nbsp; On the contrary, I have always found
your sex the kindest and most tender and obliging of God&rsquo;s creation,
till now.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Think of the conceited fellow saying that!)&nbsp;
&ldquo;And the novelty and harshness of the lesson you have taught me
to-day, and the bitterness of being disappointed in the only quarter
on which the happiness of my life depended, must excuse any appearance
of asperity.&nbsp; If my presence is disagreeable to you, Miss Murray,&rdquo;
he said (for I was looking about me to show how little I cared for him,
so he thought I was tired of him, I suppose) - &ldquo;if my presence
is disagreeable to you, Miss Murray, you have only to promise me the
favour I named, and I will relieve you at once.&nbsp; There are many
ladies - some even in this parish - who would be delighted to accept
what you have so scornfully trampled under your feet.&nbsp; They would
be naturally inclined to hate one whose surpassing loveliness has so
completely estranged my heart from them and blinded me to their attractions;
and a single hint of the truth from me to one of these would be sufficient
to raise such a talk against you as would seriously injure your prospects,
and diminish your chance of success with any other gentleman you or
your mamma might design to entangle.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;What do your mean, sir?&rdquo; said I, ready to stamp
with passion.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;I mean that this affair from beginning to end appears
to me like a case of arrant flirtation, to say the least of it - such
a case as you would find it rather inconvenient to have blazoned through
the world: especially with the additions and exaggerations of your female
rivals, who would be too glad to publish the matter, if I only gave
them a handle to it.&nbsp; But I promise you, on the faith of a gentleman,
that no word or syllable that could tend to your prejudice shall ever
escape my lips, provided you will - &rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, well, I won&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You may rely upon my silence, if that can afford you any consolation.&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;You promise it?&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered; for I wanted to get rid of him
now.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;&ldquo;Farewell, then!&rdquo; said he, in a most doleful, heart-sick
tone; and with a look where pride vainly struggled against despair,
he turned and went away: longing, no doubt, to get home, that he might
shut himself up in his study and cry - if he doesn&rsquo;t burst into
tears before he gets there.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But you have broken your promise already,&rsquo; said I, truly
horrified at her perfidy.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s only to you; I know you won&rsquo;t repeat it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Certainly, I shall not: but you say you are going to tell your
sister; and she will tell your brothers when they come home, and Brown
immediately, if you do not tell her yourself; and Brown will blazon
it, or be the means of blazoning it, throughout the country.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, indeed, she won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; We shall not tell her at all,
unless it be under the promise of the strictest secrecy.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But how can you expect her to keep her promises better than her
more enlightened mistress?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, well, she shan&rsquo;t hear it then,&rsquo; said Miss Murray,
somewhat snappishly.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But you will tell your mamma, of course,&rsquo; pursued I; &lsquo;and
she will tell your papa.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Of course I shall tell mamma - that is the very thing that pleases
me so much.&nbsp; I shall now be able to convince her how mistaken she
was in her fears about me.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<i>&lsquo;</i>Oh, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> it, is it?&nbsp; I was wondering
what it was that delighted you so much.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes; and another thing is, that I&rsquo;ve humbled Mr. Hatfield
so charmingly; and another - why, you must allow me some share of female
vanity: I don&rsquo;t pretend to be without that most essential attribute
of our sex - and if you had seen poor Hatfield&rsquo;s intense eagerness
in making his ardent declaration and his flattering proposal, and his
agony of mind, that no effort of pride could conceal, on being refused,
you would have allowed I had some cause to be gratified.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The greater his agony, I should think, the less your cause for
gratification.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, nonsense!&rsquo; cried the young lady, shaking herself with
vexation.&nbsp; &lsquo;You either can&rsquo;t understand me, or you
won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; If I had not confidence in your magnanimity, I should
think you envied me.&nbsp; But you will, perhaps, comprehend this cause
of pleasure - which is as great as any - namely, that I am delighted
with myself for my prudence, my self-command, my heartlessness, if you
please.&nbsp; I was not a bit taken by surprise, not a bit confused,
or awkward, or foolish; I just acted and spoke as I ought to have done,
and was completely my own mistress throughout.&nbsp; And here was a
man, decidedly good-looking - Jane and Susan Green call him bewitchingly
handsome I suppose they&rsquo;re two of the ladies he pretends would
be so glad to have him; but, however, he was certainly a very clever,
witty, agreeable companion - not what you call clever, but just enough
to make him entertaining; and a man one needn&rsquo;t be ashamed of
anywhere, and would not soon grow tired of; and to confess the truth,
I rather liked him - better even, of late, than Harry Meltham - and
he evidently idolised me; and yet, though he came upon me all alone
and unprepared, I had the wisdom, and the pride, and the strength to
refuse him - and so scornfully and coolly as I did: I have good reason
to be proud of that.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And are you equally proud of having told him that his having
the wealth of Sir Hugh Meltham would make no difference to you, when
that was not the case; and of having promised to tell no one of his
misadventure, apparently without the slightest intention of keeping
your promise?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Of course! what else could I do?&nbsp; You would not have had
me - but I see, Miss Grey, you&rsquo;re not in a good temper.&nbsp;
Here&rsquo;s Matilda; I&rsquo;ll see what she and mamma have to say
about it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
She left me, offended at my want of sympathy, and thinking, no doubt,
that I envied her.&nbsp; I did not - at least, I firmly believed I did
not.&nbsp; I was sorry for her; I was amazed, disgusted at her heartless
vanity; I wondered why so much beauty should be given to those who made
so bad a use of it, and denied to some who would make it a benefit to
both themselves and others.<br>
<br>
But, God knows best, I concluded.&nbsp; There are, I suppose, some men
as vain, as selfish, and as heartless as she is, and, perhaps, such
women may be useful to punish them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XV - THE WALK<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, dear!&nbsp; I wish Hatfield had not been so precipitate!&rsquo;
said Rosalie next day at four P.M., as, with a portentous yawn, she
laid down her worsted-work and looked listlessly towards the window.&nbsp;
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no inducement to go out now; and nothing to look
forward to.&nbsp; The days will be so long and dull when there are no
parties to enliven them; and there are none this week, or next either,
that I know of.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Pity you were so cross to him,&rsquo; observed Matilda, to whom
this lamentation was addressed.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll never come
again: and I suspect you liked him after all.&nbsp; I hoped you would
have taken him for your beau, and left dear Harry to me.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Humph! my beau must be an Adonis indeed, Matilda, the admired
of all beholders, if I am to be contented with him alone.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sorry to lose Hatfield, I confess; but the first decent man, or number
of men, that come to supply his place, will be more than welcome.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s Sunday to-morrow - I do wonder how he&rsquo;ll look, and
whether he&rsquo;ll be able to go through the service.&nbsp; Most likely
he&rsquo;ll pretend he&rsquo;s got a cold, and make Mr. Weston do it
all.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Not he!&rsquo; exclaimed Matilda, somewhat contemptuously.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Fool as he is, he&rsquo;s not so soft as that comes to.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Her sister was slightly offended; but the event proved Matilda was right:
the disappointed lover performed his pastoral duties as usual.&nbsp;
Rosalie, indeed, affirmed he looked very pale and dejected: he might
be a little paler; but the difference, if any, was scarcely perceptible.&nbsp;
As for his dejection, I certainly did not hear his laugh ringing from
the vestry as usual, nor his voice loud in hilarious discourse; though
I did hear it uplifted in rating the sexton in a manner that made the
congregation stare; and, in his transits to and from the pulpit and
the communion-table, there was more of solemn pomp, and less of that
irreverent, self-confident, or rather self-delighted imperiousness with
which he usually swept along - that air that seemed to say, &lsquo;You
all reverence and adore me, I know; but if anyone does not, I defy him
to the teeth!&rsquo;&nbsp; But the most remarkable change was, that
he never once suffered his eyes to wander in the direction of Mr. Murray&rsquo;s
pew, and did not leave the church till we were gone.<br>
<br>
Mr. Hatfield had doubtless received a very severe blow; but his pride
impelled him to use every effort to conceal the effects of it.&nbsp;
He had been disappointed in his certain hope of obtaining not only a
beautiful, and, to him, highly attractive wife, but one whose rank and
fortune might give brilliance to far inferior charms: he was likewise,
no doubt, intensely mortified by his repulse, and deeply offended at
the conduct of Miss Murray throughout.&nbsp; It would have given him
no little consolation to have known how disappointed she was to find
him apparently so little moved, and to see that he was able to refrain
from casting a single glance at her throughout both services; though,
she declared, it showed he was thinking of her all the time, or his
eyes would have fallen upon her, if it were only by chance: but if they
had so chanced to fall, she would have affirmed it was because they
could not resist the attraction.&nbsp; It might have pleased him, too,
in some degree, to have seen how dull and dissatisfied she was throughout
that week (the greater part of it, at least), for lack of her usual
source of excitement; and how often she regretted having &lsquo;used
him up so soon,&rsquo; like a child that, having devoured its plumcake
too hastily, sits sucking its fingers, and vainly lamenting its greediness.<br>
<br>
At length I was called upon, one fine morning, to accompany her in a
walk to the village.&nbsp; Ostensibly she went to get some shades of
Berlin wool, at a tolerably respectable shop that was chiefly supported
by the ladies of the vicinity: really - I trust there is no breach of
charity in supposing that she went with the idea of meeting either with
the Rector himself, or some other admirer by the way; for as we went
along, she kept wondering &lsquo;what Hatfield would do or say, if we
met him,&rsquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.; as we passed Mr. Green&rsquo;s park-gates,
she &lsquo;wondered whether he was at home - great stupid blockhead&rsquo;;
as Lady Meltham&rsquo;s carriage passed us, she &lsquo;wondered what
Mr. Harry was doing this fine day&rsquo;; and then began to abuse his
elder brother for being &lsquo;such a fool as to get married and go
and live in London.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I thought you wanted to live in London
yourself.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, because it&rsquo;s so dull here: but then he makes it still
duller by taking himself off: and if he were not married I might have
him instead of that odious Sir Thomas.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Then, observing the prints of a horse&rsquo;s feet on the somewhat miry
road, she &lsquo;wondered whether it was a gentleman&rsquo;s horse,&rsquo;
and finally concluded it was, for the impressions were too small to
have been made by a &lsquo;great clumsy cart-horse&rsquo;; and then
she &lsquo;wondered who the rider could be,&rsquo; and whether we should
meet him coming back, for she was sure he had only passed that morning;
and lastly, when we entered the village and saw only a few of its humble
inhabitants moving about, she &lsquo;wondered why the stupid people
couldn&rsquo;t keep in their houses; she was sure she didn&rsquo;t want
to see their ugly faces, and dirty, vulgar clothes - it wasn&rsquo;t
for that she came to Horton!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Amid all this, I confess, I wondered, too, in secret, whether we should
meet, or catch a glimpse of somebody else; and as we passed his lodgings,
I even went so far as to wonder whether he was at the window.&nbsp;
On entering the shop, Miss Murray desired me to stand in the doorway
while she transacted her business, and tell her if anyone passed.&nbsp;
But alas! there was no one visible besides the villagers, except Jane
and Susan Green coming down the single street, apparently returning
from a walk.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Stupid things!&rsquo; muttered she, as she came out after having
concluded her bargain.&nbsp; &lsquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t they have their
dolt of a brother with them? even he would be better than nothing.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
She greeted them, however, with a cheerful smile, and protestations
of pleasure at the happy meeting equal to their own.&nbsp; They placed
themselves one on each side of her, and all three walked away chatting
and laughing as young ladies do when they get together, if they be but
on tolerably intimate terms.&nbsp; But I, feeling myself to be one too
many, left them to their merriment and lagged behind, as usual on such
occasions: I had no relish for walking beside Miss Green or Miss Susan
like one deaf and dumb, who could neither speak nor be spoken to.<br>
<br>
But this time I was not long alone.&nbsp; It struck me, first, as very
odd, that just as I was thinking about Mr. Weston he should come up
and accost me; but afterwards, on due reflection, I thought there was
nothing odd about it, unless it were the fact of his speaking to me;
for on such a morning and so near his own abode, it was natural enough
that he should be about; and as for my thinking of him, I had been doing
that, with little intermission, ever since we set out on our journey;
so there was nothing remarkable in that.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You are alone again, Miss Grey,&rsquo; said he.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;What kind of people are those ladies - the Misses Green?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I really don&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;That&rsquo;s strange - when you live so near and see them so
often!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, I suppose they are lively, good-tempered girls; but I imagine
you must know them better than I do, yourself, for I never exchanged
a word with either of them.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Indeed?&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t strike me as being particularly
reserved.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Very likely they are not so to people of their own class; but
they consider themselves as moving in quite a different sphere from
me!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
He made no reply to this: but after a short pause, he said, - &lsquo;I
suppose it&rsquo;s these things, Miss Grey, that make you think you
could not live without a home?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Not exactly.&nbsp; The fact is I am too socially disposed to
be able to live contentedly without a friend; and as the only friends
I have, or am likely to have, are at home, if it - or rather, if they
were gone - I will not say I could not live - but I would rather not
live in such a desolate world.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But why do you say the only friends you are likely to have?&nbsp;
Are you so unsociable that you cannot make friends?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, but I never made one yet; and in my present position there
is no possibility of doing so, or even of forming a common acquaintance.&nbsp;
The fault may be partly in myself, but I hope not altogether.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The fault is partly in society, and partly, I should think, in
your immediate neighbours: and partly, too, in yourself; for many ladies,
in your position, would make themselves be noticed and accounted of.&nbsp;
But your pupils should be companions for you in some degree; they cannot
be many years younger than yourself.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, yes, they are good company sometimes; but I cannot call them
friends, nor would they think of bestowing such a name on me - they
have other companions better suited to their tastes.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Perhaps you are too wise for them.&nbsp; How do you amuse yourself
when alone - do you read much?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Reading is my favourite occupation, when I have leisure for it
and books to read.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
From speaking of books in general, he passed to different books in particular,
and proceeded by rapid transitions from topic to topic, till several
matters, both of taste and opinion, had been discussed considerably
within the space of half an hour, but without the embellishment of many
observations from himself; he being evidently less bent upon communicating
his own thoughts and predilections, than on discovering mine.&nbsp;
He had not the tact, or the art, to effect such a purpose by skilfully
drawing out my sentiments or ideas through the real or apparent statement
of his own, or leading the conversation by imperceptible gradations
to such topics as he wished to advert to: but such gentle abruptness,
and such single-minded straightforwardness, could not possibly offend
me.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And why should he interest himself at all in my moral and intellectual
capacities: what is it to him what I think or feel?&rsquo; I asked myself.&nbsp;
And my heart throbbed in answer to the question.<br>
<br>
But Jane and Susan Green soon reached their home.&nbsp; As they stood
parleying at the park-gates, attempting to persuade Miss Murray to come
in, I wished Mr. Weston would go, that she might not see him with me
when she turned round; but, unfortunately, his business, which was to
pay one more visit to poor Mark Wood, led him to pursue the same path
as we did, till nearly the close of our journey.&nbsp; When, however,
he saw that Rosalie had taken leave of her friends and I was about to
join her, he would have left me and passed on at a quicker pace; but,
as he civilly lifted his hat in passing her, to my surprise, instead
of returning the salute with a stiff, ungracious bow, she accosted him
with one of her sweetest smiles, and, walking by his side, began to
talk to him with all imaginable cheerfulness and affability; and so
we proceeded all three together.<br>
<br>
After a short pause in the conversation, Mr. Weston made some remark
addressed particularly to me, as referring to something we had been
talking of before; but before I could answer, Miss Murray replied to
the observation and enlarged upon it: he rejoined; and, from thence
to the close of the interview, she engrossed him entirely to herself.&nbsp;
It might be partly owing to my own stupidity, my want of tact and assurance:
but I felt myself wronged: I trembled with apprehension; and I listened
with envy to her easy, rapid flow of utterance, and saw with anxiety
the bright smile with which she looked into his face from time to time:
for she was walking a little in advance, for the purpose (as I judged)
of being seen as well as heard.&nbsp; If her conversation was light
and trivial, it was amusing, and she was never at a loss for something
to say, or for suitable words to express it in.&nbsp; There was nothing
pert or flippant in her manner now, as when she walked with Mr. Hatfield,
there was only a gentle, playful kind of vivacity, which I thought must
be peculiarly pleasing to a man of Mr. Weston&rsquo;s disposition and
temperament.<br>
<br>
When he was gone she began to laugh, and muttered to herself, &lsquo;I
thought I could do it!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Do what?&rsquo; I asked.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Fix that man.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;What in the world do you mean?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I mean that he will go home and dream of me.&nbsp; I have shot
him through the heart!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;How do you know?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;By many infallible proofs: more especially the look he gave me
when he went away.&nbsp; It was not an impudent look - I exonerate him
from that - it was a look of reverential, tender adoration.&nbsp; Ha,
ha! he&rsquo;s not quite such a stupid blockhead as I thought him!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I made no answer, for my heart was in my throat, or something like it,
and I could not trust myself to speak.&nbsp; &lsquo;O God, avert it!&rsquo;
I cried, internally - &lsquo;for his sake, not for mine!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Miss Murray made several trivial observations as we passed up the park,
to which (in spite of my reluctance to let one glimpse of my feelings
appear) I could only answer by monosyllables.&nbsp; Whether she intended
to torment me, or merely to amuse herself, I could not tell - and did
not much care; but I thought of the poor man and his one lamb, and the
rich man with his thousand flocks; and I dreaded I knew not what for
Mr. Weston, independently of my own blighted hopes.<br>
<br>
Right glad was I to get into the house, and find myself alone once more
in my own room.&nbsp; My first impulse was to sink into the chair beside
the bed; and laying my head on the pillow, to seek relief in a passionate
burst of tears: there was an imperative craving for such an indulgence;
but, alas! I must restrain and swallow back my feelings still: there
was the bell - the odious bell for the schoolroom dinner; and I must
go down with a calm face, and smile, and laugh, and talk nonsense -
yes, and eat, too, if possible, as if all was right, and I was just
returned from a pleasant walk.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XVI - THE SUBSTITUTION<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Next Sunday was one of the gloomiest of April days - a day of thick,
dark clouds, and heavy showers.&nbsp; None of the Murrays were disposed
to attend church in the afternoon, excepting Rosalie: she was bent upon
going as usual; so she ordered the carriage, and I went with her: nothing
loth, of course, for at church I might look without fear of scorn or
censure upon a form and face more pleasing to me than the most beautiful
of God&rsquo;s creations; I might listen without disturbance to a voice
more charming than the sweetest music to my ears; I might seem to hold
communion with that soul in which I felt so deeply interested, and imbibe
its purest thoughts and holiest aspirations, with no alloy to such felicity
except the secret reproaches of my conscience, which would too often
whisper that I was deceiving my own self, and mocking God with the service
of a heart more bent upon the creature than the Creator.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, such thoughts would give me trouble enough; but sometimes
I could quiet them with thinking - it is not the man, it is his goodness
that I love.&nbsp; &lsquo;Whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things
are lovely, whatsoever things are honest and of good report, think on
these things.&rsquo;&nbsp; We do well to worship God in His works; and
I know none of them in which so many of His attributes - so much of
His own spirit shines, as in this His faithful servant; whom to know
and not to appreciate, were obtuse insensibility in me, who have so
little else to occupy my heart.<br>
<br>
Almost immediately after the conclusion of the service, Miss Murray
left the church.&nbsp; We had to stand in the porch, for it was raining,
and the carriage was not yet come.&nbsp; I wondered at her coming forth
so hastily, for neither young Meltham nor Squire Green was there; but
I soon found it was to secure an interview with Mr. Weston as he came
out, which he presently did.&nbsp; Having saluted us both, he would
have passed on, but she detained him; first with observations upon the
disagreeable weather, and then with asking if he would be so kind as
to come some time to-morrow to see the granddaughter of the old woman
who kept the porter&rsquo;s lodge, for the girl was ill of a fever,
and wished to see him.&nbsp; He promised to do so.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And at what time will you be most likely to come, Mr. Weston?&nbsp;
The old woman will like to know when to expect you - you know such people
think more about having their cottages in order when decent people come
to see them than we are apt to suppose.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Here was a wonderful instance of consideration from the thoughtless
Miss Murray.&nbsp; Mr. Weston named an hour in the morning at which
he would endeavour, to be there.&nbsp; By this time the carriage was
ready, and the footman was waiting, with an open umbrella, to escort
Miss Murray through the churchyard.&nbsp; I was about to follow; but
Mr. Weston had an umbrella too, and offered me the benefit of its shelter,
for it was raining heavily.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, thank you, I don&rsquo;t mind the rain,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp;
I always lacked common sense when taken by surprise.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But you don&rsquo;t <i>like</i> it, I suppose? - an umbrella
will do you no harm at any rate,&rsquo; he replied, with a smile that
showed he was not offended; as a man of worse temper or less penetration
would have been at such a refusal of his aid.&nbsp; I could not deny
the truth of his assertion, and so went with him to the carriage; he
even offered me his hand on getting in: an unnecessary piece of civility,
but I accepted that too, for fear of giving offence.&nbsp; One glance
he gave, one little smile at parting - it was but for a moment; but
therein I read, or thought I read, a meaning that kindled in my heart
a brighter flame of hope than had ever yet arisen.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I would have sent the footman back for you, Miss Grey, if you&rsquo;d
waited a moment - you needn&rsquo;t have taken Mr. Weston&rsquo;s umbrella,&rsquo;
observed Rosalie, with a very unamiable cloud upon her pretty face.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I would have come without an umbrella, but Mr. Weston offered
me the benefit of his, and I could not have refused it more than I did
without offending him,&rsquo; replied I, smiling placidly; for my inward
happiness made that amusing, which would have wounded me at another
time.<br>
<br>
The carriage was now in motion.&nbsp; Miss Murray bent forwards, and
looked out of the window as we were passing Mr. Weston.&nbsp; He was
pacing homewards along the causeway, and did not turn his head.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Stupid ass!&rsquo; cried she, throwing herself back again in
the seat.&nbsp; &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve lost by
not looking this way!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;What has he lost?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;A bow from me, that would have raised him to the seventh heaven!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I made no answer.&nbsp; I saw she was out of humour, and I derived a
secret gratification from the fact, not that she was vexed, but that
she thought she had reason to be so.&nbsp; It made me think my hopes
were not entirely the offspring of my wishes and imagination.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I mean to take up Mr. Weston instead of Mr. Hatfield,&rsquo;
said my companion, after a short pause, resuming something of her usual
cheerfulness.&nbsp; &lsquo;The ball at Ashby Park takes place on Tuesday,
you know; and mamma thinks it very likely that Sir Thomas will propose
to me then: such things are often done in the privacy of the ball-room,
when gentlemen are most easily ensnared, and ladies most enchanting.&nbsp;
But if I am to be married so soon, I must make the best of the present
time: I am determined Hatfield shall not be the only man who shall lay
his heart at my feet, and implore me to accept the worthless gift in
vain.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;If you mean Mr. Weston to be one of your victims,&rsquo; said
I, with affected indifference, &lsquo;you will have to make such overtures
yourself that you will find it difficult to draw back when he asks you
to fulfil the expectations you have raised.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose he will ask me to marry him, nor should
I desire it: that would be rather too much presumption! but I intend
him to feel my power.&nbsp; He has felt it already, indeed: but he shall
<i>acknowledge</i> it too; and what visionary hopes he may have, he
must keep to himself, and only amuse me with the result of them - for
a time.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh! that some kind spirit would whisper those words in his ear,&rsquo;
I inwardly exclaimed.&nbsp; I was far too indignant to hazard a reply
to her observation aloud; and nothing more was said about Mr. Weston
that day, by me or in my hearing.&nbsp; But next morning, soon after
breakfast, Miss Murray came into the schoolroom, where her sister was
employed at her studies, or rather her lessons, for studies they were
not, and said, &lsquo;Matilda, I want you to take a walk with me about
eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t, Rosalie!&nbsp; I have to give orders about
my new bridle and saddle-cloth, and speak to the rat-catcher about his
dogs: Miss Grey must go with you.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, I want you,&rsquo; said Rosalie; and calling her sister to
the window, she whispered an explanation in her ear; upon which the
latter consented to go.<br>
<br>
I remembered that eleven was the hour at which Mr. Weston proposed to
come to the porter&rsquo;s lodge; and remembering that, I beheld the
whole contrivance.&nbsp; Accordingly, at dinner, I was entertained with
a long account of how Mr. Weston had overtaken them as they were walking
along the road; and how they had had a long walk and talk with him,
and really found him quite an agreeable companion; and how he must have
been, and evidently was, delighted with them and their amazing condescension,
&amp;c. &amp;c.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XVII - CONFESSIONS<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As I am in the way of confessions I may as well acknowledge that, about
this time, I paid more attention to dress than ever I had done before.&nbsp;
This is not saying much - for hitherto I had been a little neglectful
in that particular; but now, also, it was no uncommon thing to spend
as much as two minutes in the contemplation of my own image in the glass;
though I never could derive any consolation from such a study.&nbsp;
I could discover no beauty in those marked features, that pale hollow
cheek, and ordinary dark brown hair; there might be intellect in the
forehead, there might be expression in the dark grey eyes, but what
of that? - a low Grecian brow, and large black eyes devoid of sentiment
would be esteemed far preferable.&nbsp; It is foolish to wish for beauty.&nbsp;
Sensible people never either desire it for themselves or care about
it in others.&nbsp; If the mind be but well cultivated, and the heart
well disposed, no one ever cares for the exterior.&nbsp; So said the
teachers of our childhood; and so say we to the children of the present
day.&nbsp; All very judicious and proper, no doubt; but are such assertions
supported by actual experience?<br>
<br>
We are naturally disposed to love what gives us pleasure, and what more
pleasing than a beautiful face - when we know no harm of the possessor
at least?&nbsp; A little girl loves her bird - Why?&nbsp; Because it
lives and feels; because it is helpless and harmless?&nbsp; A toad,
likewise, lives and feels, and is equally helpless and harmless; but
though she would not hurt a toad, she cannot love it like the bird,
with its graceful form, soft feathers, and bright, speaking eyes.&nbsp;
If a woman is fair and amiable, she is praised for both qualities, but
especially the former, by the bulk of mankind: if, on the other hand,
she is disagreeable in person and character, her plainness is commonly
inveighed against as her greatest crime, because, to common observers,
it gives the greatest offence; while, if she is plain and good, provided
she is a person of retired manners and secluded life, no one ever knows
of her goodness, except her immediate connections.&nbsp; Others, on
the contrary, are disposed to form unfavourable opinions of her mind,
and disposition, if it be but to excuse themselves for their instinctive
dislike of one so unfavoured by nature; and <i>visa vers&acirc;</i>
with her whose angel form conceals a vicious heart, or sheds a false,
deceitful charm over defects and foibles that would not be tolerated
in another.&nbsp; They that have beauty, let them be thankful for it,
and make a good use of it, like any other talent; they that have it
not, let them console themselves, and do the best they can without it:
certainly, though liable to be over-estimated, it is a gift of God,
and not to be despised.&nbsp; Many will feel this who have felt that
they could love, and whose hearts tell them that they are worthy to
be loved again; while yet they are debarred, by the lack of this or
some such seeming trifle, from giving and receiving that happiness they
seem almost made to feel and to impart.&nbsp; As well might the humble
glowworm despise that power of giving light without which the roving
fly might pass her and repass her a thousand times, and never rest beside
her: she might hear her winged darling buzzing over and around her;
he vainly seeking her, she longing to be found, but with no power to
make her presence known, no voice to call him, no wings to follow his
flight; - the fly must seek another mate, the worm must live and die
alone.<br>
<br>
Such were some of my reflections about this period.&nbsp; I might go
on prosing more and more, I might dive much deeper, and disclose other
thoughts, propose questions the reader might be puzzled to answer, and
deduce arguments that might startle his prejudices, or, perhaps, provoke
his ridicule, because he could not comprehend them; but I forbear.<br>
<br>
Now, therefore, let us return to Miss Murray.&nbsp; She accompanied
her mamma to the ball on Tuesday; of course splendidly attired, and
delighted with her prospects and her charms.&nbsp; As Ashby Park was
nearly ten miles distant from Horton Lodge, they had to set out pretty
early, and I intended to have spent the evening with Nancy Brown, whom
I had not seen for a long time; but my kind pupil took care I should
spend it neither there nor anywhere else beyond the limits of the schoolroom,
by giving me a piece of music to copy, which kept me closely occupied
till bed-time.&nbsp; About eleven next morning, as soon as she had left
her room, she came to tell me her news.&nbsp; Sir Thomas had indeed
proposed to her at the ball; an event which reflected great credit on
her mamma&rsquo;s sagacity, if not upon her skill in contrivance.&nbsp;
I rather incline to the belief that she had first laid her plans, and
then predicted their success.&nbsp; The offer had been accepted, of
course, and the bridegroom elect was coming that day to settle matters
with Mr. Murray.<br>
<br>
Rosalie was pleased with the thoughts of becoming mistress of Ashby
Park; she was elated with the prospect of the bridal ceremony and its
attendant splendour and &eacute;clat, the honeymoon spent abroad, and
the subsequent gaieties she expected to enjoy in London and elsewhere;
she appeared pretty well pleased too, for the time being, with Sir Thomas
himself, because she had so lately seen him, danced with him, and been
flattered by him; but, after all, she seemed to shrink from the idea
of being so soon united: she wished the ceremony to be delayed some
months, at least; and I wished it too.&nbsp; It seemed a horrible thing
to hurry on the inauspicious match, and not to give the poor creature
time to think and reason on the irrevocable step she was about to take.&nbsp;
I made no pretension to &lsquo;a mother&rsquo;s watchful, anxious care,&rsquo;
but I was amazed and horrified at Mrs. Murray&rsquo;s heartlessness,
or want of thought for the real good of her child; and by my unheeded
warnings and exhortations, I vainly strove to remedy the evil.&nbsp;
Miss Murray only laughed at what I said; and I soon found that her reluctance
to an immediate union arose chiefly from a desire to do what execution
she could among the young gentlemen of her acquaintance, before she
was incapacitated from further mischief of the kind.&nbsp; It was for
this cause that, before confiding to me the secret of her engagement,
she had extracted a promise that I would not mention a word on the subject
to any one.&nbsp; And when I saw this, and when I beheld her plunge
more recklessly than ever into the depths of heartless coquetry, I had
no more pity for her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come what will,&rsquo; I thought,
&lsquo;she deserves it.&nbsp; Sir Thomas cannot be too bad for her;
and the sooner she is incapacitated from deceiving and injuring others
the better.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
The wedding was fixed for the first of June.&nbsp; Between that and
the critical ball was little more than six weeks; but, with Rosalie&rsquo;s
accomplished skill and resolute exertion, much might be done, even within
that period; especially as Sir Thomas spent most of the interim in London;
whither he went up, it was said, to settle affairs with his lawyer,
and make other preparations for the approaching nuptials.&nbsp; He endeavoured
to supply the want of his presence by a pretty constant fire of billets-doux;
but these did not attract the neighbours&rsquo; attention, and open
their eyes, as personal visits would have done; and old Lady Ashby&rsquo;s
haughty, sour spirit of reserve withheld her from spreading the news,
while her indifferent health prevented her coming to visit her future
daughter-in-law; so that, altogether, this affair was kept far closer
than such things usually are.<br>
<br>
Rosalie would sometimes show her lover&rsquo;s epistles to me, to convince
me what a kind, devoted husband he would make.&nbsp; She showed me the
letters of another individual, too, the unfortunate Mr. Green, who had
not the courage, or, as she expressed it, the &lsquo;spunk,&rsquo; to
plead his cause in person, but whom one denial would not satisfy: he
must write again and again.&nbsp; He would not have done so if he could
have seen the grimaces his fair idol made over his moving appeals to
her feelings, and heard her scornful laughter, and the opprobrious epithets
she heaped upon him for his perseverance.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you tell him, at once, that you are engaged?&rsquo;
I asked.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want him to know that,&rsquo; replied she.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If he knew it, his sisters and everybody would know it, and then
there would be an end of my - ahem!&nbsp; And, besides, if I told him
that, he would think my engagement was the only obstacle, and that I
would have him if I were free; which I could not bear that any man should
think, and he, of all others, at least.&nbsp; Besides, I don&rsquo;t
care for his letters,&rsquo; she added, contemptuously; &lsquo;he may
write as often as he pleases, and look as great a calf as he likes when
I meet him; it only amuses me.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Meantime, young Meltham was pretty frequent in his visits to the house
or transits past it; and, judging by Matilda&rsquo;s execrations and
reproaches, her sister paid more attention to him than civility required;
in other words, she carried on as animated a flirtation as the presence
of her parents would admit.&nbsp; She made some attempts to bring Mr.
Hatfield once more to her feet; but finding them unsuccessful, she repaid
his haughty indifference with still loftier scorn, and spoke of him
with as much disdain and detestation as she had formerly done of his
curate.&nbsp; But, amid all this, she never for a moment lost sight
of Mr. Weston.&nbsp; She embraced every opportunity of meeting him,
tried every art to fascinate him, and pursued him with as much perseverance
as if she really loved him and no other, and the happiness of her life
depended upon eliciting a return of affection.&nbsp; Such conduct was
completely beyond my comprehension.&nbsp; Had I seen it depicted in
a novel, I should have thought it unnatural; had I heard it described
by others, I should have deemed it a mistake or an exaggeration; but
when I saw it with my own eyes, and suffered from it too, I could only
conclude that excessive vanity, like drunkenness, hardens the heart,
enslaves the faculties, and perverts the feelings; and that dogs are
not the only creatures which, when gorged to the throat, will yet gloat
over what they cannot devour, and grudge the smallest morsel to a starving
brother.<br>
<br>
She now became extremely beneficent to the poor cottagers.&nbsp; Her
acquaintance among them was more widely extended, her visits to their
humble dwellings were more frequent and excursive than they had ever
been before.&nbsp; Hereby, she earned among them the reputation of a
condescending and very charitable young lady; and their encomiums were
sure to be repeated to Mr. Weston: whom also she had thus a daily chance
of meeting in one or other of their abodes, or in her transits to and
fro; and often, likewise, she could gather, through their gossip, to
what places he was likely to go at such and such a time, whether to
baptize a child, or to visit the aged, the sick, the sad, or the dying;
and most skilfully she laid her plans accordingly.&nbsp; In these excursions
she would sometimes go with her sister - whom, by some means, she had
persuaded or bribed to enter into her schemes - sometimes alone, never,
now, with me; so that I was debarred the pleasure of seeing Mr. Weston,
or hearing his voice even in conversation with another: which would
certainly have been a very great pleasure, however hurtful or however
fraught with pain.&nbsp; I could not even see him at church: for Miss
Murray, under some trivial pretext, chose to take possession of that
corner in the family pew which had been mine ever since I came; and,
unless I had the presumption to station myself between Mr. and Mrs.
Murray, I must sit with my back to the pulpit, which I accordingly did.<br>
<br>
Now, also, I never walked home with my pupils: they said their mamma
thought it did not look well to see three people out of the family walking,
and only two going in the carriage; and, as they greatly preferred walking
in fine weather, I should be honoured by going with the seniors.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And besides,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t walk as
fast as we do; you know you&rsquo;re always lagging behind.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I knew these were false excuses, but I made no objections, and never
contradicted such assertions, well knowing the motives which dictated
them.&nbsp; And in the afternoons, during those six memorable weeks,
I never went to church at all.&nbsp; If I had a cold, or any slight
indisposition, they took advantage of that to make me stay at home;
and often they would tell me they were not going again that day, themselves,
and then pretend to change their minds, and set off without telling
me: so managing their departure that I never discovered the change of
purpose till too late.&nbsp; Upon their return home, on one of these
occasions, they entertained me with an animated account of a conversation
they had had with Mr. Weston as they came along.&nbsp; &lsquo;And he
asked if you were ill, Miss Grey,&rsquo; said Matilda; &lsquo;but we
told him you were quite well, only you didn&rsquo;t want to come to
church - so he&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re turned wicked.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
All chance meetings on week-days were likewise carefully prevented;
for, lest I should go to see poor Nancy Brown or any other person, Miss
Murray took good care to provide sufficient employment for all my leisure
hours.&nbsp; There was always some drawing to finish, some music to
copy, or some work to do, sufficient to incapacitate me from indulging
in anything beyond a short walk about the grounds, however she or her
sister might be occupied.<br>
<br>
One morning, having sought and waylaid Mr. Weston, they returned in
high glee to give me an account of their interview.&nbsp; &lsquo;And
he asked after you again,&rsquo; said Matilda, in spite of her sister&rsquo;s
silent but imperative intimation that she should hold her tongue.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He wondered why you were never with us, and thought you must
have delicate health, as you came out so seldom.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t Matilda - what nonsense you&rsquo;re talking!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, Rosalie, what a lie!&nbsp; He did, you know; and you said
- Don&rsquo;t, Rosalie - hang it! - I won&rsquo;t be pinched so!&nbsp;
And, Miss Grey, Rosalie told him you were quite well, but you were always
so buried in your books that you had no pleasure in anything else.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;What an idea he must have of me!&rsquo; I thought.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And,&rsquo; I asked, &lsquo;does old Nancy ever inquire about
me?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes; and we tell her you are so fond of reading and drawing that
you can do nothing else.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;That is not the case though; if you had told her I was so busy
I could not come to see her, it would have been nearer the truth.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it would,&rsquo; replied Miss Murray, suddenly
kindling up; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure you have plenty of time to yourself
now, when you have so little teaching to do.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
It was no use beginning to dispute with such indulged, unreasoning creatures:
so I held my peace.&nbsp; I was accustomed, now, to keeping silence
when things distasteful to my ear were uttered; and now, too, I was
used to wearing a placid smiling countenance when my heart was bitter
within me.&nbsp; Only those who have felt the like can imagine my feelings,
as I sat with an assumption of smiling indifference, listening to the
accounts of those meetings and interviews with Mr. Weston, which they
seemed to find such pleasure in describing to me; and hearing things
asserted of him which, from the character of the man, I knew to be exaggerations
and perversions of the truth, if not entirely false - things derogatory
to him, and flattering to them - especially to Miss Murray - which I
burned to contradict, or, at least, to show my doubts about, but dared
not; lest, in expressing my disbelief, I should display my interest
too.&nbsp; Other things I heard, which I felt or feared were indeed
too true: but I must still conceal my anxiety respecting him, my indignation
against them, beneath a careless aspect; others, again, mere hints of
something said or done, which I longed to hear more of, but could not
venture to inquire.&nbsp; So passed the weary time.&nbsp; I could not
even comfort myself with saying, &lsquo;She will soon be married; and
then there may be hope.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Soon after her marriage the holidays would come; and when I returned
from home, most likely, Mr. Weston would be gone, for I was told that
he and the Rector could not agree (the Rector&rsquo;s fault, of course),
and he was about to remove to another place.<br>
<br>
No - besides my hope in God, my only consolation was in thinking that,
though he know it not, I was more worthy of his love than Rosalie Murray,
charming and engaging as she was; for I could appreciate his excellence,
which she could not: I would devote my life to the promotion of his
happiness; she would destroy his happiness for the momentary gratification
of her own vanity.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, if he could but know the difference!&rsquo;&nbsp;
I would earnestly exclaim.&nbsp; &lsquo;But no!&nbsp; I would not have
him see my heart: yet, if he could but know her hollowness, her worthless,
heartless frivolity, he would then be safe, and I should be - <i>almost</i>
happy, though I might never see him more!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I fear, by this time, the reader is well nigh disgusted with the folly
and weakness I have so freely laid before him.&nbsp; I never disclosed
it then, and would not have done so had my own sister or my mother been
with me in the house.&nbsp; I was a close and resolute dissembler -
in this one case at least.&nbsp; My prayers, my tears, my wishes, fears,
and lamentations, were witnessed by myself and heaven alone.<br>
<br>
When we are harassed by sorrows or anxieties, or long oppressed by any
powerful feelings which we must keep to ourselves, for which we can
obtain and seek no sympathy from any living creature, and which yet
we cannot, or will not wholly crush, we often naturally seek relief
in poetry - and often find it, too - whether in the effusions of others,
which seem to harmonize with our existing case, or in our own attempts
to give utterance to those thoughts and feelings in strains less musical,
perchance, but more appropriate, and therefore more penetrating and
sympathetic, and, for the time, more soothing, or more powerful to rouse
and to unburden the oppressed and swollen heart.&nbsp; Before this time,
at Wellwood House and here, when suffering from home-sick melancholy,
I had sought relief twice or thrice at this secret source of consolation;
and now I flew to it again, with greater avidity than ever, because
I seemed to need it more.&nbsp; I still preserve those relics of past
sufferings and experience, like pillars of witness set up in travelling
through the vale of life, to mark particular occurrences.&nbsp; The
footsteps are obliterated now; the face of the country may be changed;
but the pillar is still there, to remind me how all things were when
it was reared.&nbsp; Lest the reader should be curious to see any of
these effusions, I will favour him with one short specimen: cold and
languid as the lines may seem, it was almost a passion of grief to which
they owed their being:-<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, they have robbed me of the hope<br>
My spirit held so dear;<br>
They will not let me hear that voice<br>
My soul delights to hear.<br>
<br>
They will not let me see that face<br>
I so delight to see;<br>
And they have taken all thy smiles,<br>
And all thy love from me.<br>
<br>
Well, let them seize on all they can; -<br>
One treasure still is mine, -<br>
A heart that loves to think on thee,<br>
And feels the worth of thine.<br>
<br>
<br>
Yes, at least, they could not deprive me of that: I could think of him
day and night; and I could feel that he was worthy to be thought of.&nbsp;
Nobody knew him as I did; nobody could appreciate him as I did; nobody
could love him as I - could, if I might: but there was the evil.&nbsp;
What business had I to think so much of one that never thought of me?&nbsp;
Was it not foolish? was it not wrong?&nbsp; Yet, if I found such deep
delight in thinking of him, and if I kept those thoughts to myself,
and troubled no one else with them, where was the harm of it? I would
ask myself.&nbsp; And such reasoning prevented me from making any sufficient
effort to shake off my fetters.<br>
<br>
But, if those thoughts brought delight, it was a painful, troubled pleasure,
too near akin to anguish; and one that did me more injury than I was
aware of.&nbsp; It was an indulgence that a person of more wisdom or
more experience would doubtless have denied herself.&nbsp; And yet,
how dreary to turn my eyes from the contemplation of that bright object
and force them to dwell on the dull, grey, desolate prospect around:
the joyless, hopeless, solitary path that lay before me.&nbsp; It was
wrong to be so joyless, so desponding; I should have made God my friend,
and to do His will the pleasure and the business of my life; but faith
was weak, and passion was too strong.<br>
<br>
In this time of trouble I had two other causes of affliction.&nbsp;
The first may seem a trifle, but it cost me many a tear: Snap, my little
dumb, rough-visaged, but bright-eyed, warm-hearted companion, the only
thing I had to love me, was taken away, and delivered over to the tender
mercies of the village rat-catcher, a man notorious for his brutal treatment
of his canine slaves.&nbsp; The other was serious enough; my letters
from home gave intimation that my father&rsquo;s health was worse.&nbsp;
No boding fears were expressed, but I was grown timid and despondent,
and could not help fearing that some dreadful calamity awaited us there.&nbsp;
I seemed to see the black clouds gathering round my native hills, and
to hear the angry muttering of a storm that was about to burst, and
desolate our hearth.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XVIII - MIRTH AND MOURNING<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The 1st of June arrived at last: and Rosalie Murray was transmuted into
Lady Ashby.&nbsp; Most splendidly beautiful she looked in her bridal
costume.&nbsp; Upon her return from church, after the ceremony, she
came flying into the schoolroom, flushed with excitement, and laughing,
half in mirth, and half in reckless desperation, as it seemed to me.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Now, Miss Grey, I&rsquo;m Lady Ashby!&rsquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It&rsquo;s done, my fate is sealed: there&rsquo;s no drawing
back now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m come to receive your congratulations and bid
you good-by; and then I&rsquo;m off for Paris, Rome, Naples, Switzerland,
London - oh, dear! what a deal I shall see and hear before I come back
again.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t forget me: I shan&rsquo;t forget you, though
I&rsquo;ve been a naughty girl.&nbsp; Come, why don&rsquo;t you congratulate
me?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I cannot congratulate you,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;till I know
whether this change is really for the better: but I sincerely hope it
is; and I wish you true happiness and the best of blessings.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, good-by, the carriage is waiting, and they&rsquo;re calling
me.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
She gave me a hasty kiss, and was hurrying away; but, suddenly returning,
embraced me with more affection than I thought her capable of evincing,
and departed with tears in her eyes.&nbsp; Poor girl!&nbsp; I really
loved her then; and forgave her from my heart all the injury she had
done me - and others also: she had not half known it, I was sure; and
I prayed God to pardon her too.<br>
<br>
During the remainder of that day of festal sadness, I was left to my
own devices.&nbsp; Being too much unhinged for any steady occupation,
I wandered about with a book in my hand for several hours, more thinking
than reading, for I had many things to think about.&nbsp; In the evening,
I made use of my liberty to go and see my old friend Nancy once again;
to apologize for my long absence (which must have seemed so neglectful
and unkind) by telling her how busy I had been; and to talk, or read,
or work for her, whichever might be most acceptable, and also, of course,
to tell her the news of this important day: and perhaps to obtain a
little information from her in return, respecting Mr. Weston&rsquo;s
expected departure.&nbsp; But of this she seemed to know nothing, and
I hoped, as she did, that it was all a false report.&nbsp; She was very
glad to see me; but, happily, her eyes were now so nearly well that
she was almost independent of my services.&nbsp; She was deeply interested
in the wedding; but while I amused her with the details of the festive
day, the splendours of the bridal party and of the bride herself, she
often sighed and shook her head, and wished good might come of it; she
seemed, like me, to regard it rather as a theme for sorrow than rejoicing.&nbsp;
I sat a long time talking to her about that and other things - but no
one came.<br>
<br>
Shall I confess that I sometimes looked towards the door with a half-expectant
wish to see it open and give entrance to Mr. Weston, as had happened
once before? and that, returning through the lanes and fields, I often
paused to look round me, and walked more slowly than was at all necessary
- for, though a fine evening, it was not a hot one - and, finally, felt
a sense of emptiness and disappointment at having reached the house
without meeting or even catching a distant glimpse of any one, except
a few labourers returning from their work?<br>
<br>
Sunday, however, was approaching: I should see him then: for now that
Miss Murray was gone, I could have my old corner again.&nbsp; I should
see him, and by look, speech, and manner, I might judge whether the
circumstance of her marriage had very much afflicted him.&nbsp; Happily
I could perceive no shadow of a difference: he wore the same aspect
as he had worn two months ago - voice, look, manner, all alike unchanged:
there was the same keen-sighted, unclouded truthfulness in his discourse,
the same forcible clearness in his style, the same earnest simplicity
in all he said and did, that made itself, not marked by the eye and
ear, but felt upon the hearts of his audience.<br>
<br>
I walked home with Miss Matilda; but <i>he did not join us</i>.&nbsp;
Matilda was now sadly at a loss for amusement, and wofully in want of
a companion: her brothers at school, her sister married and gone, she
too young to be admitted into society; for which, from Rosalie&rsquo;s
example, she was in some degree beginning to acquire a taste - a taste
at least for the company of certain classes of gentlemen; at this dull
time of year - no hunting going on, no shooting even - for, though she
might not join in that, it was <i>something</i> to see her father or
the gamekeeper go out with the dogs, and to talk with them on their
return, about the different birds they had bagged.&nbsp; Now, also,
she was denied the solace which the companionship of the coachman, grooms,
horses, greyhounds, and pointers might have afforded; for her mother
having, notwithstanding the disadvantages of a country life, so satisfactorily
disposed of her elder daughter, the pride of her heart had begun seriously
to turn her attention to the younger; and, being truly alarmed at the
roughness of her manners, and thinking it high time to work a reform,
had been roused at length to exert her authority, and prohibited entirely
the yards, stables, kennels, and coach-house.&nbsp; Of course, she was
not implicitly obeyed; but, indulgent as she had hitherto been, when
once her spirit was roused, her temper was not so gentle as she required
that of her governesses to be, and her will was not to be thwarted with
impunity.&nbsp; After many a scene of contention between mother and
daughter, many a violent outbreak which I was ashamed to witness, in
which the father&rsquo;s authority was often called in to confirm with
oaths and threats the mother&rsquo;s slighted prohibitions - for even
<i>he</i> could see that &lsquo;Tilly, though she would have made a
fine lad, was not quite what a young lady ought to be&rsquo; - Matilda
at length found that her easiest plan was to keep clear of the forbidden
regions; unless she could now and then steal a visit without her watchful
mother&rsquo;s knowledge.<br>
<br>
Amid all this, let it not be imagined that I escaped without many a
reprimand, and many an implied reproach, that lost none of its sting
from not being openly worded; but rather wounded the more deeply, because,
from that very reason, it seemed to preclude self-defence.&nbsp; Frequently,
I was told to amuse Miss Matilda with other things, and to remind her
of her mother&rsquo;s precepts and prohibitions.&nbsp; I did so to the
best of my power: but she would not be amused against her will, and
could not against her taste; and though I went beyond mere reminding,
such gentle remonstrances as I could use were utterly ineffectual.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;<i>Dear</i> Miss Grey! it is the <i>strangest</i> thing.&nbsp;
I suppose you can&rsquo;t help it, if it&rsquo;s not in your nature
- but I <i>wonder</i> you can&rsquo;t win the confidence of that girl,
and make your society at <i>least</i> as agreeable to her as that of
Robert or Joseph!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;They can talk the best about the things in which she is most
interested,&rsquo; I replied.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well! that is a strange confession, <i>however</i>, to come from
her <i>governess</i>!&nbsp; Who is to form a young lady&rsquo;s tastes,
I wonder, if the governess doesn&rsquo;t do it?&nbsp; I have known governesses
who have so completely identified themselves with the reputation of
their young ladies for elegance and propriety in mind and manners, that
they would blush to speak a word against them; and to hear the slightest
blame imputed to their pupils was worse than to be censured in their
own persons - and I really think it very natural, for my part.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Do you, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, of course: the young lady&rsquo;s proficiency and elegance
is of more consequence to the governess than her own, as well as to
the world.&nbsp; If she wishes to prosper in her vocation she must devote
all her energies to her business: all her ideas and all her ambition
will tend to the accomplishment of that one object.&nbsp; When we wish
to decide upon the merits of a governess, we naturally look at the young
ladies she professes to have educated, and judge accordingly.&nbsp;
The <i>judicious</i> governess knows this: she knows that, while she
lives in obscurity herself, her pupils&rsquo; virtues and defects will
be open to every eye; and that, unless she loses sight of herself in
their cultivation, she need not hope for success.&nbsp; You see, Miss
Grey, it is just the same as any other trade or profession: they that
wish to prosper must devote themselves body and soul to their calling;
and if they begin to yield to indolence or self-indulgence they are
speedily distanced by wiser competitors: there is little to choose between
a person that ruins her pupils by neglect, and one that corrupts them
by her example.&nbsp; You will excuse my dropping these little hints:
you know it is all for your own good.&nbsp; Many ladies would speak
to you much more strongly; and many would not trouble themselves to
speak at all, but quietly look out for a substitute.&nbsp; That, of
course, would be the <i>easiest</i> plan: but I know the advantages
of a place like this to a person in your situation; and I have no desire
to part with you, as I am sure you would do very well if you will only
think of these things and try to exert yourself a <i>little</i> more:
then, I am convinced, you would <i>soon</i> acquire that delicate tact
which alone is wanting to give you a proper influence over the mind
of your pupil.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I was about to give the lady some idea of the fallacy of her expectations;
but she sailed away as soon as she had concluded her speech.&nbsp; Having
said what she wished, it was no part of her plan to await my answer:
it was my business to hear, and not to speak.<br>
<br>
However, as I have said, Matilda at length yielded in some degree to
her mother&rsquo;s authority (pity it had not been exerted before);
and being thus deprived of almost every source of amusement, there was
nothing for it but to take long rides with the groom and long walks
with the governess, and to visit the cottages and farmhouses on her
father&rsquo;s estate, to kill time in chatting with the old men and
women that inhabited them.&nbsp; In one of these walks, it was our chance
to meet Mr. Weston.&nbsp; This was what I had long desired; but now,
for a moment, I wished either he or I were away: I felt my heart throb
so violently that I dreaded lest some outward signs of emotion should
appear; but I think he hardly glanced at me, and I was soon calm enough.&nbsp;
After a brief salutation to both, he asked Matilda if she had lately
heard from her sister.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied she.&nbsp; &lsquo;She was at Paris when she
wrote, and very well, and very happy.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
She spoke the last word emphatically, and with a glance impertinently
sly.&nbsp; He did not seem to notice it, but replied, with equal emphasis,
and very seriously -<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I hope she will continue to be so.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Do you think it likely?&rsquo; I ventured to inquire: for Matilda
had started off in pursuit of her dog, that was chasing a leveret.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I cannot tell,&rsquo; replied he.&nbsp; &lsquo;Sir Thomas may
be a better man than I suppose; but, from all I have heard and seen,
it seems a pity that one so young and gay, and - and interesting, to
express many things by one word - whose greatest, if not her only fault,
appears to be thoughtlessness - no trifling fault to be sure, since
it renders the possessor liable to almost every other, and exposes him
to so many temptations - but it seems a pity that she should be thrown
away on such a man.&nbsp; It was her mother&rsquo;s wish, I suppose?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes; and her own too, I think, for she always laughed at my attempts
to dissuade her from the step.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You did attempt it?&nbsp; Then, at least, you will have the satisfaction
of knowing that it is no fault of yours, if any harm should come of
it.&nbsp; As for Mrs. Murray, I don&rsquo;t know how she can justify
her conduct: if I had sufficient acquaintance with her, I&rsquo;d ask
her.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;It seems unnatural: but some people think rank and wealth the
chief good; and, if they can secure that for their children, they think
they have done their duty.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;True: but is it not strange that persons of experience, who have
been married themselves, should judge so falsely?&rsquo;&nbsp; Matilda
now came panting back, with the lacerated body of the young hare in
her hand.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Was it your intention to kill that hare, or to save it, Miss
Murray?&rsquo; asked Mr. Weston, apparently puzzled at her gleeful countenance.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I pretended to want to save it,&rsquo; she answered, honestly
enough, &lsquo;as it was so glaringly out of season; but I was better
pleased to see it lolled.&nbsp; However, you can both witness that I
couldn&rsquo;t help it: Prince was determined to have her; and he clutched
her by the back, and killed her in a minute!&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t it a
noble chase?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Very! for a young lady after a leveret.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
There was a quiet sarcasm in the tone of his reply which was not lost
upon her; she shrugged her shoulders, and, turning away with a significant
&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; asked me how I had enjoyed the fun.&nbsp; I replied
that I saw no fun in the matter; but admitted that I had not observed
the transaction very narrowly.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t you see how it doubled - just like an old hare?
and didn&rsquo;t you hear it scream?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m happy to say I did not.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;It cried out just like a child.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Poor little thing!&nbsp; What will you do with it?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Come along - I shall leave it in the first house we come to.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t want to take it home, for fear papa should scold me for
letting the dog kill it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Mr. Weston was now gone, and we too went on our way; but as we returned,
after having deposited the hare in a farm-house, and demolished some
spice-cake and currant-wine in exchange, we met him returning also from
the execution of his mission, whatever it might be.&nbsp; He carried
in his hand a cluster of beautiful bluebells, which he offered to me;
observing, with a smile, that though he had seen so little of me for
the last two months, he had not forgotten that bluebells were numbered
among my favourite flowers.&nbsp; It was done as a simple act of goodwill,
without compliment or remarkable courtesy, or any look that could be
construed into &lsquo;reverential, tender adoration&rsquo; (<i>vide</i>
Rosalie Murray); but still, it was something to find my unimportant
saying so well remembered: it was something that he had noticed so accurately
the time I had ceased to be visible.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I was told,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that you were a perfect bookworm,
Miss Grey: so completely absorbed in your studies that you were lost
to every other pleasure.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, and it&rsquo;s quite true!&rsquo; cried Matilda.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, Mr. Weston: don&rsquo;t believe it: it&rsquo;s a scandalous
libel.&nbsp; These young ladies are too fond of making random assertions
at the expense of their friends; and you ought to be careful how you
listen to them.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I hope <i>this</i> assertion is groundless, at any rate.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Why?&nbsp; Do you particularly object to ladies studying?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No; but I object to anyone so devoting himself or herself to
study, as to lose sight of everything else.&nbsp; Except under peculiar
circumstances, I consider very close and constant study as a waste of
time, and an injury to the mind as well as the body.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, I have neither the time nor the inclination for such transgressions.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
We parted again.<br>
<br>
Well! what is there remarkable in all this?&nbsp; Why have I recorded
it?&nbsp; Because, reader, it was important enough to give me a cheerful
evening, a night of pleasing dreams, and a morning of felicitous hopes.&nbsp;
Shallow-brained cheerfulness, foolish dreams, unfounded hopes, you would
say; and I will not venture to deny it: suspicions to that effect arose
too frequently in my own mind.&nbsp; But our wishes are like tinder:
the flint and steel of circumstances are continually striking out sparks,
which vanish immediately, unless they chance to fall upon the tinder
of our wishes; then, they instantly ignite, and the flame of hope is
kindled in a moment.<br>
<br>
But alas! that very morning, my flickering flame of hope was dismally
quenched by a letter from my mother, which spoke so seriously of my
father&rsquo;s increasing illness, that I feared there was little or
no chance of his recovery; and, close at hand as the holidays were,
I almost trembled lest they should come too late for me to meet him
in this world.&nbsp; Two days after, a letter from Mary told me his
life was despaired of, and his end seemed fast approaching.&nbsp; Then,
immediately, I sought permission to anticipate the vacation, and go
without delay.&nbsp; Mrs. Murray stared, and wondered at the unwonted
energy and boldness with which I urged the request, and thought there
was no occasion to hurry; but finally gave me leave: stating, however,
that there was &lsquo;no need to be in such agitation about the matter
- it might prove a false alarm after all; and if not - why, it was only
in the common course of nature: we must all die some time; and I was
not to suppose myself the only afflicted person in the world;&rsquo;
and concluding with saying I might have the phaeton to take me to O-.&nbsp;
&lsquo;And instead of <i>repining</i>, Miss Grey, be thankful for the
<i>privileges</i> you enjoy.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s many a poor clergyman
whose family would be plunged into ruin by the event of his death; but
you, you see, have influential friends ready to continue their patronage,
and to show you every consideration.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I thanked her for her &lsquo;consideration,&rsquo; and flew to my room
to make some hurried preparations for my departure.&nbsp; My bonnet
and shawl being on, and a few things hastily crammed into my largest
trunk, I descended.&nbsp; But I might have done the work more leisurely,
for no one else was in a hurry; and I had still a considerable time
to wait for the phaeton.&nbsp; At length it came to the door, and I
was off: but, oh, what a dreary journey was that! how utterly different
from my former passages homewards!&nbsp; Being too late for the last
coach to -, I had to hire a cab for ten miles, and then a car to take
me over the rugged hills.<br>
<br>
It was half-past ten before I reached home.&nbsp; They were not in bed.<br>
<br>
My mother and sister both met me in the passage - sad - silent - pale!&nbsp;
I was so much shocked and terror-stricken that I could not speak, to
ask the information I so much longed yet dreaded to obtain.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Agnes!&rsquo; said my mother, struggling to repress some strong
emotion.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, Agnes!&rsquo; cried Mary, and burst into tears.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;How is he?&rsquo; I asked, gasping for the answer.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Dead!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
It was the reply I had anticipated: but the shock seemed none the less
tremendous.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XIX - THE LETTER<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My father&rsquo;s mortal remains had been consigned to the tomb; and
we, with sad faces and sombre garments, sat lingering over the frugal
breakfast-table, revolving plans for our future life.&nbsp; My mother&rsquo;s
strong mind had not given way beneath even this affliction: her spirit,
though crushed, was not broken.&nbsp; Mary&rsquo;s wish was that I should
go back to Horton Lodge, and that our mother should come and live with
her and Mr. Richardson at the vicarage: she affirmed that he wished
it no less than herself, and that such an arrangement could not fail
to benefit all parties; for my mother&rsquo;s society and experience
would be of inestimable value to them, and they would do all they could
to make her happy.&nbsp; But no arguments or entreaties could prevail:
my mother was determined not to go.&nbsp; Not that she questioned, for
a moment, the kind wishes and intentions of her daughter; but she affirmed
that so long as God spared her health and strength, she would make use
of them to earn her own livelihood, and be chargeable to no one; whether
her dependence would be felt as a burden or not.&nbsp; If she could
afford to reside as a lodger in - vicarage, she would choose that house
before all others as the place of her abode; but not being so circumstanced,
she would never come under its roof, except as an occasional visitor:
unless sickness or calamity should render her assistance really needful,
or until age or infirmity made her incapable of maintaining herself.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, Mary,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;if Richardson and you have
anything to spare, you must lay it aside for your family; and Agnes
and I must gather honey for ourselves.&nbsp; Thanks to my having had
daughters to educate, I have not forgotten my accomplishments.&nbsp;
God willing, I will check this vain repining,&rsquo; she said, while
the tears coursed one another down her cheeks in spite of her efforts;
but she wiped them away, and resolutely shaking back her head, continued,
&lsquo;I will exert myself, and look out for a small house, commodiously
situated in some populous but healthy district, where we will take a
few young ladies to board and educate - if we can get them - and as
many day pupils as will come, or as we can manage to instruct.&nbsp;
Your father&rsquo;s relations and old friends will be able to send us
some pupils, or to assist us with their recommendations, no doubt: I
shall not apply to my own.&nbsp; What say you to it, Agnes? will you
be willing to leave your present situation and try?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Quite willing, mamma; and the money I have saved will do to furnish
the house.&nbsp; It shall be taken from the bank directly.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;When it is wanted: we must get the house, and settle on preliminaries
first.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Mary offered to lend the little she possessed; but my mother declined
it, saying that we must begin on an economical plan; and she hoped that
the whole or part of mine, added to what we could get by the sale of
the furniture, and what little our dear papa had contrived to lay aside
for her since the debts were paid, would be sufficient to last us till
Christmas; when, it was hoped, something would accrue from our united
labours.&nbsp; It was finally settled that this should be our plan;
and that inquiries and preparations should immediately be set on foot;
and while my mother busied herself with these, I should return to Horton
Lodge at the close of my four weeks&rsquo; vacation, and give notice
for my final departure when things were in train for the speedy commencement
of our school.<br>
<br>
We were discussing these affairs on the morning I have mentioned, about
a fortnight after my father&rsquo;s death, when a letter was brought
in for my mother, on beholding which the colour mounted to her face
- lately pale enough with anxious watchings and excessive sorrow.&nbsp;
&lsquo;From my father!&rsquo; murmured she, as she hastily tore off
the cover.&nbsp; It was many years since she had heard from any of her
own relations before.&nbsp; Naturally wondering what the letter might
contain, I watched her countenance while she read it, and was somewhat
surprised to see her bite her lip and knit her brows as if in anger.&nbsp;
When she had done, she somewhat irreverently cast it on the table, saying
with a scornful smile, - &lsquo;Your grandpapa has been so kind as to
write to me.&nbsp; He says he has no doubt I have long repented of my
&ldquo;unfortunate marriage,&rdquo; and if I will only acknowledge this,
and confess I was wrong in neglecting his advice, and that I have justly
suffered for it, he will make a lady of me once again - if that be possible
after my long degradation - and remember my girls in his will.&nbsp;
Get my desk, Agnes, and send these things away: I will answer the letter
directly.&nbsp; But first, as I may be depriving you both of a legacy,
it is just that I should tell you what I mean to say.&nbsp; I shall
say that he is mistaken in supposing that I can regret the birth of
my daughters (who have been the pride of my life, and are likely to
be the comfort of my old age), or the thirty years I have passed in
the company of my best and dearest friend; - that, had our misfortunes
been three times as great as they were (unless they had been of my bringing
on), I should still the more rejoice to have shared them with your father,
and administered what consolation I was able; and, had his sufferings
in illness been ten times what they wore, I could not regret having
watched over and laboured to relieve them; - that, if he had married
a richer wife, misfortunes and trials would no doubt have come upon
him still; while I am egotist enough to imagine that no other woman
could have cheered him through them so well: not that I am superior
to the rest, but I was made for him, and he for me; and I can no more
repent the hours, days, years of happiness we have spent together, and
which neither could have had without the other, than I can the privilege
of having been his nurse in sickness, and his comfort in affliction.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Will this do, children? - or shall I say we are all very sorry
for what has happened during the last thirty years, and my daughters
wish they had never been born; but since they have had that misfortune,
they will be thankful for any trifle their grandpapa will be kind enough
to bestow?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Of course, we both applauded our mother&rsquo;s resolution; Mary cleared
away the breakfast things; I brought the desk; the letter was quickly
written and despatched; and, from that day, we heard no more of our
grandfather, till we saw his death announced in the newspaper a considerable
time after - all his worldly possessions, of course, being left to our
wealthy unknown cousins.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XX - THE FAREWELL<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
A house in A---, the fashionable watering-place, was hired for our seminary;
and a promise of two or three pupils was obtained to commence with.&nbsp;
I returned to Horton Lodge about the middle of July, leaving my mother
to conclude the bargain for the house, to obtain more pupils, to sell
off the furniture of our old abode, and to fit out the new one.<br>
<br>
We often pity the poor, because they have no leisure to mourn their
departed relatives, and necessity obliges them to labour through their
severest afflictions: but is not active employment the best remedy for
overwhelming sorrow - the surest antidote for despair?&nbsp; It may
be a rough comforter: it may seem hard to be harassed with the cares
of life when we have no relish for its enjoyments; to be goaded to labour
when the heart is ready to break, and the vexed spirit implores for
rest only to weep in silence: but is not labour better than the rest
we covet? and are not those petty, tormenting cares less hurtful than
a continual brooding over the great affliction that oppresses us?&nbsp;
Besides, we cannot have cares, and anxieties, and toil, without hope
- if it be but the hope of fulfilling our joyless task, accomplishing
some needful project, or escaping some further annoyance.&nbsp; At any
rate, I was glad my mother had so much employment for every faculty
of her action-loving frame.&nbsp; Our kind neighbours lamented that
she, once so exalted in wealth and station, should be reduced to such
extremity in her time of sorrow; but I am persuaded that she would have
suffered thrice as much had she been left in affluence, with liberty
to remain in that house, the scene of her early happiness and late affliction,
and no stern necessity to prevent her from incessantly brooding over
and lamenting her bereavement.<br>
<br>
I will not dilate upon the feelings with which I left the old house,
the well-known garden, the little village church - then doubly dear
to me, because my father, who, for thirty years, had taught and prayed
within its walls, lay slumbering now beneath its flags - and the old
bare hills, delightful in their very desolation, with the narrow vales
between, smiling in green wood and sparkling water - the house where
I was born, the scene of all my early associations, the place where
throughout life my earthly affections had been centred; - and left them
to return no more!&nbsp; True, I was going back to Horton Lodge, where,
amid many evils, one source of pleasure yet remained: but it was pleasure
mingled with excessive pain; and my stay, alas! was limited to six weeks.&nbsp;
And even of that precious time, day after day slipped by and I did not
see him: except at church, I never saw him for a fortnight after my
return.&nbsp; It seemed a long time to me: and, as I was often out with
my rambling pupil, of course hopes would keep rising, and disappointments
would ensue; and then, I would say to my own heart, &lsquo;Here is a
convincing proof - if you would but have the sense to see it, or the
candour to acknowledge it - that he does not care for you.&nbsp; If
he only thought <i>half</i> as much about you as you do about him, he
would have contrived to meet you many times ere this: you must know
that, by consulting your own feelings.&nbsp; Therefore, have done with
this nonsense: you have no ground for hope: dismiss, at once, these
hurtful thoughts and foolish wishes from your mind, and turn to your
own duty, and the dull blank life that lies before you.&nbsp; You might
have known such happiness was not for you.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
But I saw him at last.&nbsp; He came suddenly upon me as I was crossing
a field in returning from a visit to Nancy Brown, which I had taken
the opportunity of paying while Matilda Murray was riding her matchless
mare.&nbsp; He must have heard of the heavy loss I had sustained: he
expressed no sympathy, offered no condolence: but almost the first words
he uttered were, - &lsquo;How is your mother?&rsquo;&nbsp; And this
was no matter-of-course question, for I never told him that I had a
mother: he must have learned the fact from others, if he knew it at
all; and, besides, there was sincere goodwill, and even deep, touching,
unobtrusive sympathy in the tone and manner of the inquiry.&nbsp; I
thanked him with due civility, and told him she was as well as could
be expected.&nbsp; &lsquo;What will she do?&rsquo; was the next question.&nbsp;
Many would have deemed it an impertinent one, and given an evasive reply;
but such an idea never entered my head, and I gave a brief but plain
statement of my mother&rsquo;s plans and prospects.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Then you will leave this place shortly?&rsquo; said he.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, in a month.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
He paused a minute, as if in thought.&nbsp; When he spoke again, I hoped
it would be to express his concern at my departure; but it was only
to say, - &lsquo;I should think you will be willing enough to go?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes - for some things,&rsquo; I replied.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;For <i>some</i> things only - I wonder what should make you regret
it?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I was annoyed at this in some degree; because it embarrassed me: I had
only one reason for regretting it; and that was a profound secret, which
he had no business to trouble me about.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said I - &lsquo;why should you suppose that I dislike
the place?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You told me so yourself,&rsquo; was the decisive reply.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You said, at least, that you could not live contentedly, without
a friend; and that you had no friend here, and no possibility of making
one - and, besides, I know you <i>must</i> dislike it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But if you remember rightly, I said, or meant to say, I could
not live contentedly without a friend in the world: I was not so unreasonable
as to require one always near me.&nbsp; I think I could be happy in
a house full of enemies, if - &rsquo; but no; that sentence must not
be continued - I paused, and hastily added, - &lsquo;And, besides, we
cannot well leave a place where we have lived for two or three years,
without some feeling of regret.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Will you regret to part with Miss Murray, your sole remaining
pupil and companion?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I dare say I shall in some degree: it was not without sorrow
I parted with her sister.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I can imagine that.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, Miss Matilda is quite as good - better in one respect.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;What is that?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;She&rsquo;s honest.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And the other is not?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I should not call her <i>dis</i>honest; but it must be confessed
she&rsquo;s a little artful.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;<i>Artful</i> is she? - I saw she was giddy and vain - and now,&rsquo;
he added, after a pause, &lsquo;I can well believe she was artful too;
but so excessively so as to assume an aspect of extreme simplicity and
unguarded openness.&nbsp; Yes,&rsquo; continued he, musingly, &lsquo;that
accounts for some little things that puzzled me a trifle before.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
After that, he turned the conversation to more general subjects.&nbsp;
He did not leave me till we had nearly reached the park-gates: he had
certainly stepped a little out of his way to accompany me so far, for
he now went back and disappeared down Moss Lane, the entrance of which
we had passed some time before.&nbsp; Assuredly I did not regret this
circumstance: if sorrow had any place in my heart, it was that he was
gone at last - that he was no longer walking by my side, and that that
short interval of delightful intercourse was at an end.&nbsp; He had
not breathed a word of love, or dropped one hint of tenderness or affection,
and yet I had been supremely happy.&nbsp; To be near him, to hear him
talk as he did talk, and to feel that he thought me worthy to be so
spoken to - capable of understanding and duly appreciating such discourse
- was enough.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, Edward Weston, I could indeed be happy in a house full of
enemies, if I had but one friend, who truly, deeply, and faithfully
loved me; and if that friend were you - though we might be far apart
- seldom to hear from each other, still more seldom to meet - though
toil, and trouble, and vexation might surround me, still - it would
be too much happiness for me to dream of!&nbsp; Yet who can tell,&rsquo;
said I within myself, as I proceeded up the park, - &lsquo;who can tell
what this one month may bring forth?&nbsp; I have lived nearly three-and-twenty
years, and I have suffered much, and tasted little pleasure yet; is
it likely my life all through will be so clouded?&nbsp; Is it not possible
that God may hear my prayers, disperse these gloomy shadows, and grant
me some beams of heaven&rsquo;s sunshine yet?&nbsp; Will He entirely
deny to me those blessings which are so freely given to others, who
neither ask them nor acknowledge them when received?&nbsp; May I not
still hope and trust?&nbsp; I did hope and trust for a while: but, alas,
alas! the time ebbed away: one week followed another, and, excepting
one distant glimpse and two transient meetings - during which scarcely
anything was said - while I was walking with Miss Matilda, I saw nothing
of him: except, of course, at church.<br>
<br>
And now, the last Sunday was come, and the last service.&nbsp; I was
often on the point of melting into tears during the sermon - the last
I was to hear from him: the best I should hear from anyone, I was well
assured.&nbsp; It was over - the congregation were departing; and I
must follow.&nbsp; I had then seen him, and heard his voice, too, probably
for the last time.&nbsp; In the churchyard, Matilda was pounced upon
by the two Misses Green.&nbsp; They had many inquiries to make about
her sister, and I know not what besides.&nbsp; I only wished they would
have done, that we might hasten back to Horton Lodge: I longed to seek
the retirement of my own room, or some sequestered nook in the grounds,
that I might deliver myself up to my feelings - to weep my last farewell,
and lament my false hopes and vain delusions.&nbsp; Only this once,
and then adieu to fruitless dreaming - thenceforth, only sober, solid,
sad reality should occupy my mind.&nbsp; But while I thus resolved,
a low voice close beside me said - &lsquo;I suppose you are going this
week, Miss Grey?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; I
was very much startled; and had I been at all hysterically inclined,
I certainly should have committed myself in some way then.&nbsp; Thank
God, I was not.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Weston, &lsquo;I want to bid you good-bye
- it is not likely I shall see you again before you go.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Good-bye, Mr. Weston,&rsquo; I said.&nbsp; Oh, how I struggled
to say it calmly!&nbsp; I gave him my hand.&nbsp; He retained it a few
seconds in his.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;It is possible we may meet again,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;will
it be of any consequence to you whether we do or not?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, I should be very glad to see you again.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I <i>could</i> say no less.&nbsp; He kindly pressed my hand, and went.&nbsp;
Now, I was happy again - though more inclined to burst into tears than
ever.&nbsp; If I had been forced to speak at that moment, a succession
of sobs would have inevitably ensued; and as it was, I could not keep
the water out of my eyes.&nbsp; I walked along with Miss Murray, turning
aside my face, and neglecting to notice several successive remarks,
till she bawled out that I was either deaf or stupid; and then (having
recovered my self-possession), as one awakened from a fit of abstraction,
I suddenly looked up and asked what she had been saying.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXI - THE SCHOOL<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I left Horton Lodge, and went to join my mother in our new abode at
A-.&nbsp; I found her well in health, resigned in spirit, and even cheerful,
though subdued and sober, in her general demeanour.&nbsp; We had only
three boarders and half a dozen day-pupils to commence with; but by
due care and diligence we hoped ere long to increase the number of both.<br>
<br>
I set myself with befitting energy to discharge the duties of this new
mode of life.&nbsp; I call it <i>new</i>, for there was, indeed, a considerable
difference between working with my mother in a school of our own, and
working as a hireling among strangers, despised and trampled upon by
old and young; and for the first few weeks I was by no means unhappy.&nbsp;
&lsquo;It is possible we may meet again,&rsquo; and &lsquo;will it be
of any consequence to you whether we do or not?&rsquo; - Those words
still rang in my ear and rested on my heart: they were my secret solace
and support.&nbsp; &lsquo;I shall see him again. - He will come; or
he will write.&rsquo;&nbsp; No promise, in fact, was too bright or too
extravagant for Hope to whisper in my ear.&nbsp; I did not believe half
of what she told me: I pretended to laugh at it all; but I was far more
credulous than I myself supposed; otherwise, why did my heart leap up
when a knock was heard at the front door, and the maid, who opened it,
came to tell my mother a gentleman wished to see her? and why was I
out of humour for the rest of the day, because it proved to be a music-master
come to offer his services to our school? and what stopped my breath
for a moment, when the postman having brought a couple of letters, my
mother said, &lsquo;Here, Agnes, this is for you,&rsquo; and threw one
of them to me? and what made the hot blood rush into my face when I
saw it was directed in a gentleman&rsquo;s hand? and why - oh! why did
that cold, sickening sense of disappointment fall upon me, when I had
torn open the cover and found it was <i>only</i> a letter from Mary,
which, for some reason or other, her husband had directed for her?<br>
<br>
Was it then come to this - that I should be <i>disappointed</i> to receive
a letter from my only sister: and because it was not written by a comparative
stranger?&nbsp; Dear Mary! and she had written it so kindly - and thinking
I should be so pleased to have it! - I was not worthy to read it!&nbsp;
And I believe, in my indignation against myself, I should have put it
aside till I had schooled myself into a better frame of mind, and was
become more deserving of the honour and privilege of its perusal: but
there was my mother looking on, and wishful to know what news it contained;
so I read it and delivered it to her, and then went into the schoolroom
to attend to the pupils: but amidst the cares of copies and sums - in
the intervals of correcting errors here, and reproving derelictions
of duty there, I was inwardly taking myself to task with far sterner
severity.&nbsp; &lsquo;What a fool you must be,&rsquo; said my head
to my heart, or my sterner to my softer self; - &lsquo;how could you
ever dream that he would write to you?&nbsp; What grounds have you for
such a hope - or that he will see you, or give himself any trouble about
you - or even think of you again?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;What grounds?&rsquo;
- and then Hope set before me that last, short interview, and repeated
the words I had so faithfully treasured in my memory.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,
and what was there in that? - Who ever hung his hopes upon so frail
a twig?&nbsp; What was there in those words that any common acquaintance
might not say to another?&nbsp; Of course, it was possible you might
meet again: he might have said so if you had been going to New Zealand;
but that did not imply any <i>intention</i> of seeing you - and then,
as to the question that followed, anyone might ask that: and how did
you answer? - Merely with a stupid, commonplace reply, such as you would
have given to Master Murray, or anyone else you had been on tolerably
civil terms with.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;But, then,&rsquo; persisted Hope,
&lsquo;the tone and manner in which he spoke.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,
that is nonsense! he always speaks impressively; and at that moment
there were the Greens and Miss Matilda Murray just before, and other
people passing by, and he was obliged to stand close beside you, and
to speak very low, unless he wished everybody to hear what he said,
which - though it was nothing at all particular - of course, he would
rather not.&rsquo;&nbsp; But then, above all, that emphatic, yet gentle
pressure of the hand, which seemed to say, &lsquo;<i>Trust</i> me;&rsquo;
and many other things besides - too delightful, almost too flattering,
to be repeated even to one&rsquo;s self.&nbsp; &lsquo;Egregious folly
- too absurd to require contradiction - mere inventions of the imagination,
which you ought to be ashamed of.&nbsp; If you would but consider your
own unattractive exterior, your unamiable reserve, your foolish diffidence
- which must make you appear cold, dull, awkward, and perhaps ill-tempered
too; - if you had but rightly considered these from the beginning, you
would never have harboured such presumptuous thoughts: and now that
you have been so foolish, pray repent and amend, and let us have no
more of it!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I cannot say that I implicitly obeyed my own injunctions: but such reasoning
as this became more and more effective as time wore on, and nothing
was seen or heard of Mr. Weston; until, at last, I gave up hoping, for
even my heart acknowledged it was all in vain.&nbsp; But still, I would
think of him: I would cherish his image in my mind; and treasure every
word, look, and gesture that my memory could retain; and brood over
his excellences and his peculiarities, and, in fact, all I had seen,
heard, or imagined respecting him.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Agnes, this sea air and change of scene do you no good, I think:
I never saw you look so wretched.&nbsp; It must be that you sit too
much, and allow the cares of the schoolroom to worry you.&nbsp; You
must learn to take things easy, and to be more active and cheerful;
you must take exercise whenever you can get it, and leave the most tiresome
duties to me: they will only serve to exercise my patience, and, perhaps,
try my temper a little.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
So said my mother, as we sat at work one morning during the Easter holidays.&nbsp;
I assured her that my employments were not at all oppressive; that I
was well; or, if there was anything amiss, it would be gone as soon
as the trying months of spring were over: when summer came I should
be as strong and hearty as she could wish to see me: but inwardly her
observation startled me.&nbsp; I knew my strength was declining, my
appetite had failed, and I was grown listless and desponding; - and
if, indeed, he could never care for me, and I could never see him more
- if I was forbidden to minister to his happiness - forbidden, for ever,
to taste the joys of love, to bless, and to be blessed - then, life
must be a burden, and if my heavenly Father would call me away, I should
be glad to rest.&nbsp; But it would not do to die and leave my mother.&nbsp;
Selfish, unworthy daughter, to forget her for a moment!&nbsp; Was not
her happiness committed in a great measure to my charge? - and the welfare
of our young pupils too?&nbsp; Should I shrink from the work that God
had set before me, because it was not fitted to my taste?&nbsp; Did
not He know best what I should do, and where I ought to labour? - and
should I long to quit His service before I had finished my task, and
expect to enter into His rest without having laboured to earn it?&nbsp;
&lsquo;No; by His help I will arise and address myself diligently to
my appointed duty.&nbsp; If happiness in this world is not for me, I
will endeavour to promote the welfare of those around me, and my reward
shall be hereafter.&rsquo;&nbsp; So said I in my heart; and from that
hour I only permitted my thoughts to wander to Edward Weston - or at
least to dwell upon him now and then - as a treat for rare occasions:
and, whether it was really the approach of summer or the effect of these
good resolutions, or the lapse of time, or all together, tranquillity
of mind was soon restored; and bodily health and vigour began likewise,
slowly, but surely, to return.<br>
<br>
Early in June, I received a letter from Lady Ashby, late Miss Murray.&nbsp;
She had written to me twice or thrice before, from the different stages
of her bridal tour, always in good spirits, and professing to be very
happy.&nbsp; I wondered every time that she had not forgotten me, in
the midst of so much gaiety and variety of scene.&nbsp; At length, however,
there was a pause; and it seemed she had forgotten me, for upwards of
seven months passed away and no letter.&nbsp; Of course, I did not break
my heart about <i>that</i>, though I often wondered how she was getting
on; and when this last epistle so unexpectedly arrived, I was glad enough
to receive it.&nbsp; It was dated from Ashby Park, where she was come
to settle down at last, having previously divided her time between the
continent and the metropolis.&nbsp; She made many apologies for having
neglected me so long, assured me she had not forgotten me, and had often
intended to write, &amp;c. &amp;c., but had always been prevented by
something.&nbsp; She acknowledged that she had been leading a very dissipated
life, and I should think her very wicked and very thoughtless; but,
notwithstanding that, she thought a great deal, and, among other things,
that she should vastly like to see me.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have been several
days here already,&rsquo; wrote she.&nbsp; &lsquo;We have not a single
friend with us, and are likely to be very dull.&nbsp; You know I never
had a fancy for living with my husband like two turtles in a nest, were
he the most delightful creature that ever wore a coat; so do take pity
upon me and come.&nbsp; I suppose your Midsummer holidays commence in
June, the same as other people&rsquo;s; therefore you cannot plead want
of time; and you must and shall come - in fact, I shall die if you don&rsquo;t.&nbsp;
I want you to visit me as a friend, and stay a long time.&nbsp; There
is nobody with me, as I told you before, but Sir Thomas and old Lady
Ashby: but you needn&rsquo;t mind them - they&rsquo;ll trouble us but
little with their company.&nbsp; And you shall have a room to yourself,
whenever you like to retire to it, and plenty of books to read when
my company is not sufficiently amusing.&nbsp; I forget whether you like
babies; if you do, you may have the pleasure of seeing mine - the most
charming child in the world, no doubt; and all the more so, that I am
not troubled with nursing it - I was determined I wouldn&rsquo;t be
bothered with that.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it is a girl, and Sir Thomas
has never forgiven me: but, however, if you will only come, I promise
you shall be its governess as soon as it can speak; and you shall bring
it up in the way it should go, and make a better woman of it than its
mamma.&nbsp; And you shall see my poodle, too: a splendid little charmer
imported from Paris: and two fine Italian paintings of great value -
I forget the artist.&nbsp; Doubtless you will be able to discover prodigious
beauties in them, which you must point out to me, as I only admire by
hearsay; and many elegant curiosities besides, which I purchased at
Rome and elsewhere; and, finally, you shall see my new home - the splendid
house and grounds I used to covet so greatly.&nbsp; Alas! how far the
promise of anticipation exceeds the pleasure of possession!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
a fine sentiment!&nbsp; I assure you I am become quite a grave old matron:
pray come, if it be only to witness the wonderful change.&nbsp; Write
by return of post, and tell me when your vacation commences, and say
that you will come the day after, and stay till the day before it closes
- in mercy to<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yours affectionately,<br>
<br>
&lsquo;ROSALIE ASHBY.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
I showed this strange epistle to my mother, and consulted her on what
I ought to do.&nbsp; She advised me to go; and I went - willing enough
to see Lady Ashby, and her baby, too, and to do anything I could to
benefit her, by consolation or advice; for I imagined she must be unhappy,
or she would not have applied to me thus - but feeling, as may readily
be conceived, that, in accepting the invitation, I made a great sacrifice
for her, and did violence to my feelings in many ways, instead of being
delighted with the honourable distinction of being entreated by the
baronet&rsquo;s lady to visit her as a friend.&nbsp; However, I determined
my visit should be only for a few days at most; and I will not deny
that I derived some consolation from the idea that, as Ashby Park was
not very far from Horton, I might possibly see Mr. Weston, or, at least,
hear something about him.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXII - THE VISIT<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Ashby Park was certainly a very delightful residence.&nbsp; The mansion
was stately without, commodious and elegant within; the park was spacious
and beautiful, chiefly on account of its magnificent old trees, its
stately herds of deer, its broad sheet of water, and the ancient woods
that stretched beyond it: for there was no broken ground to give variety
to the landscape, and but very little of that undulating swell which
adds so greatly to the charm of park scenery.&nbsp; And so, this was
the place Rosalie Murray had so longed to call her own, that she must
have a share of it, on whatever terms it might be offered - whatever
price was to be paid for the title of mistress, and whoever was to be
her partner in the honour and bliss of such a possession!&nbsp; Well
I am not disposed to censure her now.<br>
<br>
She received me very kindly; and, though I was a poor clergyman&rsquo;s
daughter, a governess, and a schoolmistress, she welcomed me with unaffected
pleasure to her home; and - what surprised me rather - took some pains
to make my visit agreeable.&nbsp; I could see, it is true, that she
expected me to be greatly struck with the magnificence that surrounded
her; and, I confess, I was rather annoyed at her evident efforts to
reassure me, and prevent me from being overwhelmed by so much grandeur
- too much awed at the idea of encountering her husband and mother-in-law,
or too much ashamed of my own humble appearance.&nbsp; I was not ashamed
of it at all; for, though plain, I had taken good care not to shabby
or mean, and should have been pretty considerably at my ease, if my
condescending hostess had not taken such manifest pains to make me so;
and, as for the magnificence that surrounded her, nothing that met my
eyes struck me or affected me half so much as her own altered appearance.&nbsp;
Whether from the influence of fashionable dissipation, or some other
evil, a space of little more than twelve months had had the effect that
might be expected from as many years, in reducing the plumpness of her
form, the freshness of her complexion, the vivacity of her movements,
and the exuberance of her spirits.<br>
<br>
I wished to know if she was unhappy; but I felt it was not my province
to inquire: I might endeavour to win her confidence; but, if she chose
to conceal her matrimonial cares from me, I would trouble her with no
obtrusive questions.&nbsp; I, therefore, at first, confined myself to
a few general inquiries about her health and welfare, and a few commendations
on the beauty of the park, and of the little girl that should have been
a boy: a small delicate infant of seven or eight weeks old, whom its
mother seemed to regard with no remarkable degree of interest or affection,
though full as much as I expected her to show.<br>
<br>
Shortly after my arrival, she commissioned her maid to conduct me to
my room and see that I had everything I wanted; it was a small, unpretending,
but sufficiently comfortable apartment.&nbsp; When I descended thence
- having divested myself of all travelling encumbrances, and arranged
my toilet with due consideration for the feelings of my lady hostess,
she conducted me herself to the room I was to occupy when I chose to
be alone, or when she was engaged with visitors, or obliged to be with
her mother-in-law, or otherwise prevented, as she said, from enjoying
the pleasure of my society.&nbsp; It was a quiet, tidy little sitting-room;
and I was not sorry to be provided with such a harbour of refuge.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And some time,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I will show you the library:
I never examined its shelves, but, I daresay, it is full of wise books;
and you may go and burrow among them whenever you please.&nbsp; And
now you shall have some tea - it will soon be dinner-time, but I thought,
as you were accustomed to dine at one, you would perhaps like better
to have a cup of tea about this time, and to dine when we lunch: and
then, you know, you can have your tea in this room, and that will save
you from having to dine with Lady Ashby and Sir Thomas: which would
be rather awkward - at least, not awkward, but rather - a - you know
what I mean.&nbsp; I thought you mightn&rsquo;t like it so well - especially
as we may have other ladies and gentlemen to dine with us occasionally.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;I would much rather have it
as you say, and, if you have no objection, I should prefer having all
my meals in this room.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Why so?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Because, I imagine, it would be more agreeable to Lady Ashby
and Sir Thomas.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Nothing of the kind.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;At any rate it would be more agreeable to me.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
She made some faint objections, but soon conceded; and I could see that
the proposal was a considerable relief to her.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Now, come into the drawing-room,&rsquo; said she.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
the dressing bell; but I won&rsquo;t go yet: it&rsquo;s no use dressing
when there&rsquo;s no one to see you; and I want to have a little discourse.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
The drawing-room was certainly an imposing apartment, and very elegantly
furnished; but I saw its young mistress glance towards me as we entered,
as if to notice how I was impressed by the spectacle, and accordingly
I determined to preserve an aspect of stony indifference, as if I saw
nothing at all remarkable.&nbsp; But this was only for a moment: immediately
conscience whispered, &lsquo;Why should I disappoint her to save my
pride?&nbsp; No - rather let me sacrifice my pride to give her a little
innocent gratification.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I honestly looked round, and
told her it was a noble room, and very tastefully furnished.&nbsp; She
said little, but I saw she was pleased.<br>
<br>
She showed me her fat French poodle, that lay curled up on a silk cushion,
and the two fine Italian paintings: which, however, she would not give
me time to examine, but, saying I must look at them some other day,
insisted upon my admiring the little jewelled watch she had purchased
in Geneva; and then she took me round the room to point out sundry articles
of <i>vertu</i> she had brought from Italy: an elegant little timepiece,
and several busts, small graceful figures, and vases, all beautifully
carved in white marble.&nbsp; She spoke of these with animation, and
heard my admiring comments with a smile of pleasure: that soon, however,
vanished, and was followed by a melancholy sigh; as if in consideration
of the insufficiency of all such baubles to the happiness of the human
heart, and their woeful inability to supply its insatiate demands.<br>
<br>
Then, stretching herself upon a couch, she motioned me to a capacious
easy-chair that stood opposite - not before the fire, but before a wide
open window; for it was summer, be it remembered; a sweet, warm evening
in the latter half of June.&nbsp; I sat for a moment in silence, enjoying
the still, pure air, and the delightful prospect of the park that lay
before me, rich in verdure and foliage, and basking in yellow sunshine,
relieved by the long shadows of declining day.&nbsp; But I must take
advantage of this pause: I had inquiries to make, and, like the substance
of a lady&rsquo;s postscript, the most important must come last.&nbsp;
So I began with asking after Mr. and Mrs. Murray, and Miss Matilda and
the young gentlemen.<br>
<br>
I was told that papa had the gout, which made him very ferocious; and
that he would not give up his choice wines, and his substantial dinners
and suppers, and had quarrelled with his physician, because the latter
had dared to say that no medicine could cure him while he lived so freely;
that mamma and the rest were well.&nbsp; Matilda was still wild and
reckless, but she had got a fashionable governess, and was considerably
improved in her manners, and soon to be introduced to the world; and
John and Charles (now at home for the holidays) were, by all accounts,
&lsquo;fine, bold, unruly, mischievous boys.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And how are the other people getting on?&rsquo; said I - &lsquo;the
Greens, for instance?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Ah! Mr. Green is heart-broken, you know,&rsquo; replied she,
with a languid smile: &lsquo;he hasn&rsquo;t got over his disappointment
yet, and never will, I suppose.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s doomed to be an old
bachelor; and his sisters are doing their best to get married.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And the Melthams?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re jogging on as usual, I suppose: but I know
very little about any of them - except Harry,&rsquo; said she, blushing
slightly, and smiling again.&nbsp; &lsquo;I saw a great deal of him
while we were in London; for, as soon as he heard we were there, he
came up under pretence of visiting his brother, and either followed
me, like a shadow, wherever I went, or met me, like a reflection, at
every turn.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t look so shocked, Miss Grey; I was
very discreet, I assure you, but, you know, one can&rsquo;t help being
admired.&nbsp; Poor fellow!&nbsp; He was not my only worshipper; though
he was certainly the most conspicuous, and, I think, the most devoted
among them all.&nbsp; And that detestable - ahem - and Sir Thomas chose
to take offence at him - or my profuse expenditure, or something - I
don&rsquo;t exactly know what - and hurried me down to the country at
a moment&rsquo;s notice; where I&rsquo;m to play the hermit, I suppose,
for life.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
And she bit her lip, and frowned vindictively upon the fair domain she
had once so coveted to call her own.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And Mr. Hatfield,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;what is become of him?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Again she brightened up, and answered gaily - &lsquo;Oh! he made up
to an elderly spinster, and married her, not long since; weighing her
heavy purse against her faded charms, and expecting to find that solace
in gold which was denied him in love - ha, ha!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, and I think that&rsquo;s all - except Mr. Weston: what
is he doing?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s gone from
Horton.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;How long since? and where is he gone to?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I know nothing about him,&rsquo; replied she, yawning - &lsquo;except
that he went about a month ago - I never asked where&rsquo; (I would
have asked whether it was to a living or merely another curacy, but
thought it better not); &lsquo;and the people made a great rout about
his leaving,&rsquo; continued she, &lsquo;much to Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s
displeasure; for Hatfield didn&rsquo;t like him, because he had too
much influence with the common people, and because he was not sufficiently
tractable and submissive to him - and for some other unpardonable sins,
I don&rsquo;t know what.&nbsp; But now I positively must go and dress:
the second bell will ring directly, and if I come to dinner in this
guise, I shall never hear the end of it from Lady Ashby.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
a strange thing one can&rsquo;t be mistress in one&rsquo;s own house!&nbsp;
Just ring the bell, and I&rsquo;ll send for my maid, and tell them to
get you some tea.&nbsp; Only think of that intolerable woman - &rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Who - your maid?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No; - my mother-in-law - and my unfortunate mistake!&nbsp; Instead
of letting her take herself off to some other house, as she offered
to do when I married, I was fool enough to ask her to live here still,
and direct the affairs of the house for me; because, in the first place,
I hoped we should spend the greater part of the year, in town, and in
the second place, being so young and inexperienced, I was frightened
at the idea of having a houseful of servants to manage, and dinners
to order, and parties to entertain, and all the rest of it, and I thought
she might assist me with her experience; never dreaming she would prove
a usurper, a tyrant, an incubus, a spy, and everything else that&rsquo;s
detestable.&nbsp; I wish she was dead!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
She then turned to give her orders to the footman, who had been standing
bolt upright within the door for the last half minute, and had heard
the latter part of her animadversions; and, of course, made his own
reflections upon them, notwithstanding the inflexible, wooden countenance
he thought proper to preserve in the drawing-room.&nbsp; On my remarking
afterwards that he must have heard her, she replied - &lsquo;Oh, no
matter!&nbsp; I never care about the footmen; they&rsquo;re mere automatons:
it&rsquo;s nothing to them what their superiors say or do; they won&rsquo;t
dare to repeat it; and as to what they think - if they presume to think
at all - of course, nobody cares for that.&nbsp; It would be a pretty
thing indeed, it we were to be tongue-tied by our servants!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
So saying, she ran off to make her hasty toilet, leaving me to pilot
my way back to my sitting-room, where, in due time, I was served with
a cup of tea.&nbsp; After that, I sat musing on Lady Ashby&rsquo;s past
and present condition; and on what little information I had obtained
respecting Mr. Weston, and the small chance there was of ever seeing
or hearing anything more of him throughout my quiet, drab-colour life:
which, henceforth, seemed to offer no alternative between positive rainy
days, and days of dull grey clouds without downfall.&nbsp; At length,
however, I began to weary of my thoughts, and to wish I knew where to
find the library my hostess had spoken of; and to wonder whether I was
to remain there doing nothing till bed-time.<br>
<br>
As I was not rich enough to possess a watch, I could not tell how time
was passing, except by observing the slowly lengthening shadows from
the window; which presented a side view, including a corner of the park,
a clump of trees whose topmost branches had been colonized by an innumerable
company of noisy rooks, and a high wall with a massive wooden gate:
no doubt communicating with the stable-yard, as a broad carriage-road
swept up to it from the park.&nbsp; The shadow of this wall soon took
posession of the whole of the ground as far as I could see, forcing
the golden sunlight to retreat inch by inch, and at last take refuge
in the very tops of the trees.&nbsp; Ere long, even they were left in
shadow - the shadow of the distant hills, or of the earth itself; and,
in sympathy for the busy citizens of the rookery, I regretted to see
their habitation, so lately bathed in glorious light, reduced to the
sombre, work-a-day hue of the lower world, or of my own world within.&nbsp;
For a moment, such birds as soared above the rest might still receive
the lustre on their wings, which imparted to their sable plumage the
hue and brilliance of deep red gold; at last, that too departed.&nbsp;
Twilight came stealing on; the rooks became more quiet; I became more
weary, and wished I were going home to-morrow.&nbsp; At length it grew
dark; and I was thinking of ringing for a candle, and betaking myself
to bed, when my hostess appeared, with many apologies for having neglected
me so long, and laying all the blame upon that &lsquo;nasty old woman,&rsquo;
as she called her mother-in-law.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;If I didn&rsquo;t sit with her in the drawing-room while Sir
Thomas is taking his wine,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;she would never forgive
me; and then, if I leave the room the instant he comes - as I have done
once or twice - it is an unpardonable offence against her dear Thomas.&nbsp;
<i>She</i> never showed such disrespect to <i>her</i> husband: and as
for affection, wives never think of that now-a-days, she supposes: but
things were different in <i>her</i> time - as if there was any good
to be done by staying in the room, when he does nothing but grumble
and scold when he&rsquo;s in a bad humour, talk disgusting nonsense
when he&rsquo;s in a good one, and go to sleep on the sofa when he&rsquo;s
too stupid for either; which is most frequently the case now, when he
has nothing to do but to sot over his wine.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But could you not try to occupy his mind with something better;
and engage him to give up such habits?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure you have
powers of persuasion, and qualifications for amusing a gentleman, which
many ladies would be glad to possess.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And so you think I would lay myself out for his amusement!&nbsp;
No: that&rsquo;s not <i>my</i> idea of a wife.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the
husband&rsquo;s part to please the wife, not hers to please him; and
if he isn&rsquo;t satisfied with her as she is - and thankful to possess
her too - he isn&rsquo;t worthy of her, that&rsquo;s all.&nbsp; And
as for persuasion, I assure you I shan&rsquo;t trouble myself with that:
I&rsquo;ve enough to do to bear with him as he is, without attempting
to work a reform.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m sorry I left you so long alone,
Miss Grey.&nbsp; How have you passed the time?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Chiefly in watching the rooks.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Mercy, how dull you must have been!&nbsp; I really must show
you the library; and you must ring for everything you want, just as
you would in an inn, and make yourself comfortable.&nbsp; I have selfish
reasons for wishing to make you happy, because I want you to stay with
me, and not fulfil your horrid threat of running away in a day or two.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, don&rsquo;t let me keep you out of the drawing-room any
longer to-night, for at present I am tired and wish to go to bed.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXIII - THE PARK<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I came down a little before eight, next morning, as I knew by the striking
of a distant clock.&nbsp; There was no appearance of breakfast.&nbsp;
I waited above an hour before it came, still vainly longing for access
to the library; and, after that lonely repast was concluded, I waited
again about an hour and a half in great suspense and discomfort, uncertain
what to do.&nbsp; At length Lady Ashby came to bid me good-morning.&nbsp;
She informed me she had only just breakfasted, and now wanted me to
take an early walk with her in the park.&nbsp; She asked how long I
had been up, and on receiving my answer, expressed the deepest regret,
and again promised to show me the library.&nbsp; I suggested she had
better do so at once, and then there would be no further trouble either
with remembering or forgetting.&nbsp; She complied, on condition that
I would not think of reading, or bothering with the books now; for she
wanted to show me the gardens, and take a walk in the park with me,
before it became too hot for enjoyment; which, indeed, was nearly the
case already.&nbsp; Of course I readily assented; and we took our walk
accordingly.<br>
<br>
As we were strolling in the park, talking of what my companion had seen
and heard during her travelling experience, a gentleman on horseback
rode up and passed us.&nbsp; As he turned, in passing, and stared me
full in the face, I had a good opportunity of seeing what he was like.&nbsp;
He was tall, thin, and wasted, with a slight stoop in the shoulders,
a pale face, but somewhat blotchy, and disagreeably red about the eyelids,
plain features, and a general appearance of languor and flatness, relieved
by a sinister expression in the mouth and the dull, soulless eyes.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I detest that man!&rsquo; whispered Lady Ashby, with bitter emphasis,
as he slowly trotted by.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Who is it?&rsquo; I asked, unwilling to suppose that she should
so speak of her husband.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Sir Thomas Ashby,&rsquo; she replied, with dreary composure.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And do you <i>detest</i> him, Miss Murray?&rsquo; said I, for
I was too much shocked to remember her name at the moment.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, I do, Miss Grey, and despise him too; and if you knew him
you would not blame me.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But you knew what he was before you married him.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No; I only thought so: I did not half know him really.&nbsp;
I know you warned me against it, and I wish I had listened to you: but
it&rsquo;s too late to regret that now.&nbsp; And besides, mamma ought
to have known better than either of us, and she never said anything
against it - quite the contrary.&nbsp; And then I thought he adored
me, and would let me have my own way: he did pretend to do so at first,
but now he does not care a bit about me.&nbsp; Yet I should not care
for that: he might do as he pleased, if I might only be free to amuse
myself and to stay in London, or have a few friends down here: but <i>he
will</i> do as he pleases, and I must be a prisoner and a slave.&nbsp;
The moment he saw I could enjoy myself without him, and that others
knew my value better than himself, the selfish wretch began to accuse
me of coquetry and extravagance; and to abuse Harry Meltham, whose shoes
he was not worthy to clean.&nbsp; And then he must needs have me down
in the country, to lead the life of a nun, lest I should dishonour him
or bring him to ruin; as if he had not been ten times worse every way,
with his betting-book, and his gaming-table, and his opera-girls, and
his Lady This and Mrs. That - yes, and his bottles of wine, and glasses
of brandy-and-water too!&nbsp; Oh, I would give ten thousand worlds
to be Mss Murray again!&nbsp; It is <i>too</i> bad to feel life, health,
and beauty wasting away, unfelt and unenjoyed, for such a brute as that!&rsquo;
exclaimed she, fairly bursting into tears in the bitterness of her vexation.<br>
<br>
Of course, I pitied her exceedingly; as well for her false idea of happiness
and disregard of duty, as for the wretched partner with whom her fate
was linked.&nbsp; I said what I could to comfort her, and offered such
counsels as I thought she most required: advising her, first, by gentle
reasoning, by kindness, example, and persuasion, to try to ameliorate
her husband; and then, when she had done all she could, if she still
found him incorrigible, to endeavour to abstract herself from him -
to wrap herself up in her own integrity, and trouble herself as little
about him as possible.&nbsp; I exhorted her to seek consolation in doing
her duty to God and man, to put her trust in Heaven, and solace herself
with the care and nurture of her little daughter; assuring her she would
be amply rewarded by witnessing its progress in strength and wisdom,
and receiving its genuine affection.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But I can&rsquo;t devote myself entirely to a child,&rsquo; said
she; &lsquo;it may die - which is not at all improbable.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But, with care, many a delicate infant has become a strong man
or woman.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But it may grow so intolerably like its father that I shall hate
it.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;That is not likely; it is a little girl, and strongly resembles
its mother.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No matter; I should like it better if it were a boy - only that
its father will leave it no inheritance that he can possibly squander
away.&nbsp; What pleasure can I have in seeing a girl grow up to eclipse
me, and enjoy those pleasures that I am for ever debarred from?&nbsp;
But supposing I could be so generous as to take delight in this, still
it is <i>only</i> a child; and I can&rsquo;t centre all my hopes in
a child: that is only one degree better than devoting oneself to a dog.&nbsp;
And as for all the wisdom and goodness you have been trying to instil
into me - that is all very right and proper, I daresay, and if I were
some twenty years older, I might fructify by it: but people must enjoy
themselves when they are young; and if others won&rsquo;t let them -
why, they must hate them for it!&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;The best way to enjoy yourself is to do what is right and hate
nobody.&nbsp; The end of Religion is not to teach us how to die, but
how to live; and the earlier you become wise and good, the more of happiness
you secure.&nbsp; And now, Lady Ashby, I have one more piece of advice
to offer you, which is, that you will not make an enemy of your mother-in-law.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t get into the way of holding her at arms&rsquo; length, and
regarding her with jealous distrust.&nbsp; I never saw her, but I have
heard good as well as evil respecting her; and I imagine that, though
cold and haughty in her general demeanour, and even exacting in her
requirements, she has strong affections for those who can reach them;
and, though so blindly attached to her son, she is not without good
principles, or incapable of hearing reason.&nbsp; If you would but conciliate
her a little, and adopt a friendly, open manner - and even confide your
grievances to her - real grievances, such as you have a right to complain
of - it is my firm belief that she would, in time, become your faithful
friend, and a comfort and support to you, instead of the incubus you
describe her.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I fear my advice had little effect upon
the unfortunate young lady; and, finding I could render myself so little
serviceable, my residence at Ashby Park became doubly painful.&nbsp;
But still, I must stay out that day and the following one, as I had
promised to do so: though, resisting all entreaties and inducements
to prolong my visit further, I insisted upon departing the next morning;
affirming that my mother would be lonely without me, and that she impatiently
expected my return.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it was with a heavy heart that
I bade adieu to poor Lady Ashby, and left her in her princely home.&nbsp;
It was no slight additional proof of her unhappiness, that she should
so cling to the consolation of my presence, and earnestly desire the
company of one whose general tastes and ideas were so little congenial
to her own - whom she had completely forgotten in her hour of prosperity,
and whose presence would be rather a nuisance than a pleasure, if she
could but have half her heart&rsquo;s desire.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXIV - THE SANDS<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Our school was not situated in the heart of the town: on entering A---
from the north-west there is a row of respectable-looking houses, on
each side of the broad, white road, with narrow slips of garden-ground
before them, Venetian blinds to the windows, and a flight of steps leading
to each trim, brass-handled door.&nbsp; In one of the largest of these
habitations dwelt my mother and I, with such young ladies as our friends
and the public chose to commit to our charge.&nbsp; Consequently, we
were a considerable distance from the sea, and divided from it by a
labyrinth of streets and houses.&nbsp; But the sea was my delight; and
I would often gladly pierce the town to obtain the pleasure of a walk
beside it, whether with the pupils, or alone with my mother during the
vacations.&nbsp; It was delightful to me at all times and seasons, but
especially in the wild commotion of a rough sea-breeze, and in the brilliant
freshness of a summer morning.<br>
<br>
I awoke early on the third morning after my return from Ashby Park -
the sun was shining through the blind, and I thought how pleasant it
would be to pass through the quiet town and take a solitary ramble on
the sands while half the world was in bed.&nbsp; I was not long in forming
the resolution, nor slow to act upon it.&nbsp; Of course I would not
disturb my mother, so I stole noiselessly downstairs, and quietly unfastened
the door.&nbsp; I was dressed and out, when the church clock struck
a quarter to six.&nbsp; There was a feeling of freshness and vigour
in the very streets; and when I got free of the town, when my foot was
on the sands and my face towards the broad, bright bay, no language
can describe the effect of the deep, clear azure of the sky and ocean,
the bright morning sunshine on the semicircular barrier of craggy cliffs
surmounted by green swelling hills, and on the smooth, wide sands, and
the low rocks out at sea - looking, with their clothing of weeds and
moss, like little grass-grown islands - and above all, on the brilliant,
sparkling waves.&nbsp; And then, the unspeakable purity - and freshness
of the air!&nbsp; There was just enough heat to enhance the value of
the breeze, and just enough wind to keep the whole sea in motion, to
make the waves come bounding to the shore, foaming and sparkling, as
if wild with glee.&nbsp; Nothing else was stirring - no living creature
was visible besides myself.&nbsp; My footsteps were the first to press
the firm, unbroken sands; - nothing before had trampled them since last
night&rsquo;s flowing tide had obliterated the deepest marks of yesterday,
and left them fair and even, except where the subsiding water had left
behind it the traces of dimpled pools and little running streams.<br>
<br>
Refreshed, delighted, invigorated, I walked along, forgetting all my
cares, feeling as if I had wings to my feet, and could go at least forty
miles without fatigue, and experiencing a sense of exhilaration to which
I had been an entire stranger since the days of early youth.&nbsp; About
half-past six, however, the grooms began to come down to air their masters&rsquo;
horses - first one, and then another, till there were some dozen horses
and five or six riders: but that need not trouble me, for they would
not come as far as the low rocks which I was now approaching.&nbsp;
When I had reached these, and walked over the moist, slippery sea-weed
(at the risk of floundering into one of the numerous pools of clear,
salt water that lay between them), to a little mossy promontory with
the sea splashing round it, I looked back again to see who next was
stirring.&nbsp; Still, there were only the early grooms with their horses,
and one gentleman with a little dark speck of a dog running before him,
and one water-cart coming out of the town to get water for the baths.&nbsp;
In another minute or two, the distant bathing machines would begin to
move, and then the elderly gentlemen of regular habits and sober quaker
ladies would be coming to take their salutary morning walks.&nbsp; But
however interesting such a scene might be, I could not wait to witness
it, for the sun and the sea so dazzled my eyes in that direction, that
I could but afford one glance; and then I turned again to delight myself
with the sight and the sound of the sea, dashing against my promontory
- with no prodigious force, for the swell was broken by the tangled
sea-weed and the unseen rocks beneath; otherwise I should soon have
been deluged with spray.&nbsp; But the tide was coming in; the water
was rising; the gulfs and lakes were filling; the straits were widening:
it was time to seek some safer footing; so I walked, skipped, and stumbled
back to the smooth, wide sands, and resolved to proceed to a certain
bold projection in the cliffs, and then return.<br>
<br>
Presently, I heard a snuffling sound behind me and then a dog came frisking
and wriggling to my feet.&nbsp; It was my own Snap - the little dark,
wire-haired terrier!&nbsp; When I spoke his name, he leapt up in my
face and yelled for joy.&nbsp; Almost as much delighted as himself,
I caught the little creature in my arms, and kissed him repeatedly.&nbsp;
But how came he to be there?&nbsp; He could not have dropped from the
sky, or come all that way alone: it must be either his master, the rat-catcher,
or somebody else that had brought him; so, repressing my extravagant
caresses, and endeavouring to repress his likewise, I looked round,
and beheld - Mr. Weston!<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Your dog remembers you well, Miss Grey,&rsquo; said he, warmly
grasping the hand I offered him without clearly knowing what I was about.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You rise early.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Not often so early as this,&rsquo; I replied, with amazing composure,
considering all the circumstances of the case.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;How far do you purpose to extend your walk?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I was thinking of returning - it must be almost time, I think.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
He consulted his watch - a gold one now - and told me it was only five
minutes past seven.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But, doubtless, you have had a long enough walk,&rsquo; said
he, turning towards the town, to which I now proceeded leisurely to
retrace my steps; and he walked beside me.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;In what part of the town do you live?&rsquo; asked he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I never could discover.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Never could discover?&nbsp; Had he endeavoured to do so then?&nbsp;
I told him the place of our abode.&nbsp; He asked how we prospered in
our affairs.&nbsp; I told him we were doing very well - that we had
had a considerable addition to our pupils after the Christmas vacation,
and expected a still further increase at the close of this.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You must be an accomplished instructor,&rsquo; he observed.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No, it is my mother,&rsquo; I replied; &lsquo;she manages things
so well, and is so active, and clever, and kind.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I should like to know your mother.&nbsp; Will you introduce me
to her some time, if I call?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, willingly.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And will you allow me the privilege of an old friend, of looking
in upon you now and then?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, if - I suppose so.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
This was a very foolish answer, but the truth was, I considered that
I had no right to invite anyone to my mother&rsquo;s house without her
knowledge; and if I had said, &lsquo;Yes, if my mother does not object,&rsquo;
it would appear as if by his question I understood more than was expected;
so, <i>supposing</i> she would not, I added, &lsquo;I suppose so:&rsquo;
but of course I should have said something more sensible and more polite,
if I had had my wits about me.&nbsp; We continued our walk for a minute
in silence; which, however, was shortly relieved (no small relief to
me) by Mr. Weston commenting upon the brightness of the morning and
the beauty of the bay, and then upon the advantages A--- possessed over
many other fashionable places of resort.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t ask what brings me to A--- &rsquo; said he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You can&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;m rich enough to come for my
own pleasure.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I heard you had left Horton.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t hear, then, that I had got the living of F-?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
F--- was a village about two miles distant from A-.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;we live so completely out of the world,
even here, that news seldom reaches me through any quarter; except through
the medium of the - <i>Gazette</i>.&nbsp; But I hope you like your new
parish; and that I may congratulate you on the acquisition?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I expect to like my parish better a year or two hence, when I
have worked certain reforms I have set my heart upon - or, at least,
progressed some steps towards such an achievement.&nbsp; But you may
congratulate me now; for I find it very agreeable to <i>have</i> a parish
all to myself, with nobody to interfere with me - to thwart my plans
or cripple my exertions: and besides, I have a respectable house in
a rather pleasant neighbourhood, and three hundred pounds a year; and,
in fact, I have nothing but solitude to complain of, and nothing but
a companion to wish for.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
He looked at me as he concluded: and the flash of his dark eyes seemed
to set my face on fire; greatly to my own discomfiture, for to evince
confusion at such a juncture was intolerable.&nbsp; I made an effort,
therefore, to remedy the evil, and disclaim all personal application
of the remark by a hasty, ill-expressed reply, to the effect that, if
he waited till he was well known in the neighbourhood, he might have
numerous opportunities for supplying his want among the residents of
F--- and its vicinity, or the visitors of A---, if he required so ample
a choice: not considering the compliment implied by such an assertion,
till his answer made me aware of it.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I am not so presumptuous as to believe that,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;though you tell it me; but if it were so, I am rather particular
in my notions of a companion for life, and perhaps I might not find
one to suit me among the ladies you mention.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;If you require perfection, you never will.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I do not - I have no right to require it, as being so far from
perfect myself.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
Here the conversation was interrupted by a water-cart lumbering past
us, for we were now come to the busy part of the sands; and, for the
next eight or ten minutes, between carts and horses, and asses, and
men, there was little room for social intercourse, till we had turned
our backs upon the sea, and begun to ascend the precipitous road leading
into the town.&nbsp; Here my companion offered me his arm, which I accepted,
though not with the intention of using it as a support.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t often come on to the sands, I think,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;for I have walked there many times, both morning and evening,
since I came, and never seen you till now; and several times, in passing
through the town, too, I have looked about for your school - but I did
not think of the - Road; and once or twice I made inquiries, but without
obtaining the requisite information.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
When we had surmounted the acclivity, I was about to withdraw my arm
from his, but by a slight tightening of the elbow was tacitly informed
that such was not his will, and accordingly desisted.&nbsp; Discoursing
on different subjects, we entered the town, and passed through several
streets.&nbsp; I saw that he was going out of his way to accompany me,
notwithstanding the long walk that was yet before him; and, fearing
that he might be inconveniencing himself from motives of politeness,
I observed - &lsquo;I fear I am taking you out of your way, Mr. Weston
- I believe the road to F--- lies quite in another direction.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you at the end of the next street,&rsquo; said
he.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;And when will you come to see mamma?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;To-morrow - God willing.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
The end of the next street was nearly the conclusion of my journey.&nbsp;
He stopped there, however, bid me good-morning, and called Snap, who
seemed a little doubtful whether to follow his old mistress or his new
master, but trotted away upon being summoned by the latter.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t offer to restore him to you, Miss Grey,&rsquo;
said Mr. Weston, smiling, &lsquo;because I like him.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want him,&rsquo; replied I, &lsquo;now that
he has a good master; I&rsquo;m quite satisfied.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You take it for granted that I am a good one, then?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
The man and the dog departed, and I returned home, full of gratitude
to heaven for so much bliss, and praying that my hopes might not again
be crushed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
CHAPTER XXV - CONCLUSION<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, Agnes, you must not take such long walks again before breakfast,&rsquo;
said my mother, observing that I drank an extra cup of coffee and ate
nothing - pleading the heat of the weather, and the fatigue of my long
walk as an excuse.&nbsp; I certainly did feel feverish and tired too.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You always do things by extremes: now, if you had taken a <i>short</i>
walk every morning, and would continue to do so, it would do you good.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Well, mamma, I will.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;But this is worse than lying in bed or bending over your books:
you have quite put yourself into a fever.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t do it again,&rsquo; said I.<br>
<br>
I was racking my brains with thinking how to tell her about Mr. Weston,
for she must know he was coming to-morrow.&nbsp; However, I waited till
the breakfast things were removed, and I was more calm and cool; and
then, having sat down to my drawing, I began - &lsquo;I met an old friend
on the sands to-day, mamma.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;An old friend!&nbsp; Who could it be?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Two old friends, indeed.&nbsp; One was a dog;&rsquo; and then
I reminded her of Snap, whose history I had recounted before, and related
the incident of his sudden appearance and remarkable recognition; &lsquo;and
the other,&rsquo; continued I, &lsquo;was Mr. Weston, the curate of
Horton.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Mr. Weston!&nbsp; I never heard of him before.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes, you have: I&rsquo;ve mentioned him several times, I believe:
but you don&rsquo;t remember.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard you speak of Mr. Hatfield.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Mr. Hatfield was the rector, and Mr. Weston the curate: I used
to mention him sometimes in contradistinction to Mr. Hatfield, as being
a more efficient clergyman.&nbsp; However, he was on the sands this
morning with the dog - he had bought it, I suppose, from the rat-catcher;
and he knew me as well as it did - probably through its means: and I
had a little conversation with him, in the course of which, as he asked
about our school, I was led to say something about you, and your good
management; and he said he should like to know you, and asked if I would
introduce him to you, if he should take the liberty of calling to-morrow;
so I said I would.&nbsp; Was I right?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Of course.&nbsp; What kind of a man is he?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;A very <i>respectable</i> man, I think: but you will see him
to-morrow.&nbsp; He is the new vicar of F---, and as he has only been
there a few weeks, I suppose he has made no friends yet, and wants a
little society.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
The morrow came.&nbsp; What a fever of anxiety and expectation I was
in from breakfast till noon - at which time he made his appearance!&nbsp;
Having introduced him to my mother, I took my work to the window, and
sat down to await the result of the interview.&nbsp; They got on extremely
well together - greatly to my satisfaction, for I had felt very anxious
about what my mother would think of him.&nbsp; He did not stay long
that time: but when he rose to take leave, she said she should be happy
to see him, whenever he might find it convenient to call again; and
when he was gone, I was gratified by hearing her say, - &lsquo;Well!&nbsp;
I think he&rsquo;s a very sensible man.&nbsp; But why did you sit back
there, Agnes,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;and talk so little?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Because you talked so well, mamma, I thought you required no
assistance from me: and, besides, he was your visitor, not mine.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
After that, he often called upon us - several times in the course of
a week.&nbsp; He generally addressed most of his conversation to my
mother: and no wonder, for she could converse.&nbsp; I almost envied
the unfettered, vigorous fluency of her discourse, and the strong sense
evinced by everything she said - and yet, I did not; for, though I occasionally
regretted my own deficiencies for his sake, it gave me very great pleasure
to sit and hear the two beings I loved and honoured above every one
else in the world, discoursing together so amicably, so wisely, and
so well.&nbsp; I was not always silent, however; nor was I at all neglected.&nbsp;
I was quite as much noticed as I would wish to be: there was no lack
of kind words and kinder looks, no end of delicate attentions, too fine
and subtle to be grasped by words, and therefore indescribable - but
deeply felt at heart.<br>
<br>
Ceremony was quickly dropped between us: Mr. Weston came as an expected
guest, welcome at all times, and never deranging the economy of our
household affairs.&nbsp; He even called me &lsquo;Agnes:&rsquo; the
name had been timidly spoken at first, but, finding it gave no offence
in any quarter, he seemed greatly to prefer that appellation to &lsquo;Miss
Grey;&rsquo; and so did I.&nbsp; How tedious and gloomy were those days
in which he did not come!&nbsp; And yet not miserable; for I had still
the remembrance of the last visit and the hope of the next to cheer
me.&nbsp; But when two or three days passed without my seeing him, I
certainly felt very anxious - absurdly, unreasonably so; for, of course,
he had his own business and the affairs of his parish to attend to.&nbsp;
And I dreaded the close of the holidays, when <i>my</i> business also
would begin, and I should be sometimes unable to see him, and sometimes
- when my mother was in the schoolroom - obliged to be with him alone:
a position I did not at all desire, in the house; though to meet him
out of doors, and walk beside him, had proved by no means disagreeable.<br>
<br>
One evening, however, in the last week of the vacation, he arrived -
unexpectedly: for a heavy and protracted thunder-shower during the afternoon
had almost destroyed my hopes of seeing him that day; but now the storm
was over, and the sun was shining brightly.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;A beautiful evening, Mrs. Grey!&rsquo; said he, as he entered.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Agnes, I want you to take a walk with me to - &rsquo; (he named
a certain part of the coast - a bold hill on the land side, and towards
the sea a steep precipice, from the summit of which a glorious view
is to be had).&nbsp; &lsquo;The rain has laid the dust, and cooled and
cleared the air, and the prospect will be magnificent.&nbsp; Will you
come?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Can I go, mamma?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes; to be sure.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I went to get ready, and was down again in a few minutes; though, of
course, I took a little more pains with my attire than if I had merely
been going out on some shopping expedition alone.&nbsp; The thunder-shower
had certainly had a most beneficial effect upon the weather, and the
evening was most delightful.&nbsp; Mr. Weston would have me to take
his arm; he said little during our passage through the crowded streets,
but walked very fast, and appeared grave and abstracted.&nbsp; I wondered
what was the matter, and felt an indefinite dread that something unpleasant
was on his mind; and vague surmises, concerning what it might be, troubled
me not a little, and made me grave and silent enough.&nbsp; But these
fantasies vanished upon reaching the quiet outskirts of the town; for
as soon as we came within sight of the venerable old church, and the
- hill, with the deep blue beyond it, I found my companion was cheerful
enough.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve been walking too fast for you, Agnes,&rsquo;
said he: &lsquo;in my impatience to be rid of the town, I forgot to
consult your convenience; but now we&rsquo;ll walk as slowly as you
please.&nbsp; I see, by those light clouds in the west, there will be
a brilliant sunset, and we shall be in time to witness its effect upon
the sea, at the most moderate rate of progression.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
When we had got about half-way up the hill, we fell into silence again;
which, as usual, he was the first to break.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;My house is desolate yet, Miss Grey,&rsquo; he smilingly observed,
&lsquo;and I am acquainted now with all the ladies in my parish, and
several in this town too; and many others I know by sight and by report;
but not one of them will suit me for a companion; in fact, there is
only one person in the world that will: and that is yourself; and I
want to know your decision?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Are you in earnest, Mr. Weston?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;In earnest!&nbsp; How could you think I should jest on such a
subject?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
He laid his hand on mine, that rested on his arm: he must have felt
it tremble - but it was no great matter now.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I hope I have not been too precipitate,&rsquo; he said, in a
serious tone.&nbsp; &lsquo;You must have known that it was not my way
to flatter and talk soft nonsense, or even to speak the admiration that
I felt; and that a single word or glance of mine meant more than the
honied phrases and fervent protestations of most other men.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
I said something about not liking to leave my mother, and doing nothing
without her consent.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;I settled everything with Mrs. Grey, while you were putting on
your bonnet,&rsquo; replied he.&nbsp; &lsquo;She said I might have her
consent, if I could obtain yours; and I asked her, in case I should
be so happy, to come and live with us - for I was sure you would like
it better.&nbsp; But she refused, saying she could now afford to employ
an assistant, and would continue the school till she could purchase
an annuity sufficient to maintain her in comfortable lodgings; and,
meantime, she would spend her vacations alternately with us and your
sister, and should be quite contented if you were happy.&nbsp; And so
now I have overruled your objections on her account.&nbsp; Have you
any other?&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;No - none.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
&lsquo;You love me then?&rsquo; said be, fervently pressing my hand.<br>
<br>
&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;<br>
<br>
<br>
Here I pause.&nbsp; My Diary, from which I have compiled these pages,
goes but little further.&nbsp; I could go on for years, but I will content
myself with adding, that I shall never forget that glorious summer evening,
and always remember with delight that steep hill, and the edge of the
precipice where we stood together, watching the splendid sunset mirrored
in the restless world of waters at our feet - with hearts filled with
gratitude to heaven, and happiness, and love - almost too full for speech.<br>
<br>
A few weeks after that, when my mother had supplied herself with an
assistant, I became the wife of Edward Weston; and never have found
cause to repent it, and am certain that I never shall.&nbsp; We have
had trials, and we know that we must have them again; but we bear them
well together, and endeavour to fortify ourselves and each other against
the final separation - that greatest of all afflictions to the survivor.&nbsp;
But, if we keep in mind the glorious heaven beyond, where both may meet
again, and sin and sorrow are unknown, surely that too may be borne;
and, meantime, we endeavour to live to the glory of Him who has scattered
so many blessings in our path.<br>
<br>
Edward, by his strenuous exertions, has worked surprising reforms in
his parish, and is esteemed and loved by its inhabitants - as he deserves;
for whatever his faults may be as a man (and no one is entirely without),
I defy anybody to blame him as a pastor, a husband, or a father.<br>
<br>
Our children, Edward, Agnes, and little Mary, promise well; their education,
for the time being, is chiefly committed to me; and they shall want
no good thing that a mother&rsquo;s care can give.&nbsp; Our modest
income is amply sufficient for our requirements: and by practising the
economy we learnt in harder times, and never attempting to imitate our
richer neighbours, we manage not only to enjoy comfort and contentment
ourselves, but to have every year something to lay by for our children,
and something to give to those who need it.<br>
<br>
And now I think I have said sufficient.<br>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext04 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04

Or /etext03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are

donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this eBook electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the

     if you wish, distribute this eBook in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,

     processing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The eBook, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the eBook (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the

[2]  Honor the eBook refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Foundation of 20% of the
     gross profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation"
     the 60 days following each date you prepare (or were
     legally required to prepare) your annual (or equivalent
     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
