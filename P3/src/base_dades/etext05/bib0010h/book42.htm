<h1>Book 42 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luke</h1>

<p>42:001:001 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;declaration of those things which are most surely believed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among us,</p>

<p>42:001:002 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</p>

<p>42:001:003 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all things from the very first, to write unto thee in order,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most excellent Theophilus,</p>

<p>42:001:004 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou hast been instructed.</p>

<p>42:001:005 THERE was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</p>

<p>42:001:006 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</p>

<p>42:001:007 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they both were now well stricken in years.</p>

<p>42:001:008 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;office before God in the order of his course,</p>

<p>42:001:009 According to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</p>

<p>42:001:010 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the time of incense.</p>

<p>42:001:011 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the right side of the altar of incense.</p>

<p>42:001:012 And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon him.</p>

<p>42:001:013 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thou shalt call his name John.</p>

<p>42:001:014 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at his birth.</p>

<p>42:001:015 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.</p>

<p>42:001:016 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their God.</p>

<p>42:001:017 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prepared for the Lord.</p>

<p>42:001:018 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.</p>

<p>42:001:019 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to shew thee these glad tidings.</p>

<p>42:001:020 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the day that these things shall be performed, because thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;season.</p>

<p>42:001:021 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tarried so long in the temple.</p>

<p>42:001:022 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beckoned unto them, and remained speechless.</p>

<p>42:001:023 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</p>

<p>42:001:024 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;herself five months, saying,</p>

<p>42:001:025 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on me, to take away my reproach among men.</p>

<p>42:001:026 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</p>

<p>42:001:027 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.</p>

<p>42:001:028 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;women.</p>

<p>42:001:029 And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and cast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.</p>

<p>42:001:030 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found favour with God.</p>

<p>42:001:031 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</p>

<p>42:001:032 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David:</p>

<p>42:001:033 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his kingdom there shall be no end.</p>

<p>42:001:034 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know not a man?</p>

<p>42:001:035 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee shall be called the Son of God.</p>

<p>42:001:036 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was called barren.</p>

<p>42:001:037 For with God nothing shall be impossible.</p>

<p>42:001:038 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</p>

<p>42:001:039 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with haste, into a city of Juda;</p>

<p>42:001:040 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elisabeth.</p>

<p>42:001:041 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the Holy Ghost:</p>

<p>42:001:042 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</p>

<p>42:001:043 And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come to me?</p>

<p>42:001:044 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</p>

<p>42:001:045 And blessed is she that believed: for there shall be a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.</p>

<p>42:001:046 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,</p>

<p>42:001:047 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</p>

<p>42:001:048 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</p>

<p>42:001:049 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is his name.</p>

<p>42:001:050 And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generation.</p>

<p>42:001:051 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proud in the imagination of their hearts.</p>

<p>42:001:052 He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of low degree.</p>

<p>42:001:053 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath sent empty away.</p>

<p>42:001:054 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mercy;</p>

<p>42:001:055 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever.</p>

<p>42:001:056 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her own house.</p>

<p>42:001:057 Now Elisabeth's full time came that she should be delivered;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and she brought forth a son.</p>

<p>42:001:058 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shewed great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</p>

<p>42:001:059 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name of his father.</p>

<p>42:001:060 And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called John.</p>

<p>42:001:061 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called by this name.</p>

<p>42:001:062 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called.</p>

<p>42:001:063 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is John. And they marvelled all.</p>

<p>42:001:064 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he spake, and praised God.</p>

<p>42:001:065 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country of Judaea.</p>

<p>42:001:066 And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lord was with him.</p>

<p>42:001:067 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophesied, saying,</p>

<p>42:001:068 Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;redeemed his people,</p>

<p>42:001:069 And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his servant David;</p>

<p>42:001:070 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since the world began:</p>

<p>42:001:071 That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that hate us;</p>

<p>42:001:072 To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his holy covenant;</p>

<p>42:001:073 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,</p>

<p>42:001:074 That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,</p>

<p>42:001:075 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life.</p>

<p>42:001:076 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ways;</p>

<p>42:001:077 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remission of their sins,</p>

<p>42:001:078 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from on high hath visited us,</p>

<p>42:001:079 To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</p>

<p>42:001:080 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deserts till the day of his shewing unto Israel.</p>

<p>42:002:001 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taxed.</p>

<p>42:002:002 (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syria.)</p>

<p>42:002:003 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.</p>

<p>42:002:004 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)</p>

<p>42:002:005 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child.</p>

<p>42:002:006 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accomplished that she should be delivered.</p>

<p>42:002:007 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no room for them in the inn.</p>

<p>42:002:008 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;field, keeping watch over their flock by night.</p>

<p>42:002:009 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.</p>

<p>42:002:010 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</p>

<p>42:002:011 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is Christ the Lord.</p>

<p>42:002:012 And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</p>

<p>42:002:013 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heavenly host praising God, and saying,</p>

<p>42:002:014 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toward men.</p>

<p>42:002:015 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which the Lord hath made known unto us.</p>

<p>42:002:016 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;babe lying in a manger.</p>

<p>42:002:017 And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which was told them concerning this child.</p>

<p>42:002:018 And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;told them by the shepherds.</p>

<p>42:002:019 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart.</p>

<p>42:002:020 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them.</p>

<p>42:002:021 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</p>

<p>42:002:022 And when the days of her purification according to the law of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;present him to the Lord;</p>

<p>42:002:023 (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)</p>

<p>42:002:024 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pigeons.</p>

<p>42:002:025 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him.</p>

<p>42:002:026 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ.</p>

<p>42:002:027 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;custom of the law,</p>

<p>42:002:028 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,</p>

<p>42:002:029 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to thy word:</p>

<p>42:002:030 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,</p>

<p>42:002:031 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;</p>

<p>42:002:032 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel.</p>

<p>42:002:033 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spoken of him.</p>

<p>42:002:034 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;</p>

<p>42:002:035 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</p>

<p>42:002:036 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with an husband seven years from her virginity;</p>

<p>42:002:037 And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prayers night and day.</p>

<p>42:002:038 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>42:002:039 And when they had performed all things according to the law of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nazareth.</p>

<p>42:002:040 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</p>

<p>42:002:041 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the passover.</p>

<p>42:002:042 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the custom of the feast.</p>

<p>42:002:043 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mother knew not of it.</p>

<p>42:002:044 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day's journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;acquaintance.</p>

<p>42:002:045 And when they found him not, they turned back again to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem, seeking him.</p>

<p>42:002:046 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, and asking them questions.</p>

<p>42:002:047 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and answers.</p>

<p>42:002:048 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</p>

<p>42:002:049 And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not that I must be about my Father's business?</p>

<p>42:002:050 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them.</p>

<p>42:002:051 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her heart.</p>

<p>42:002:052 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God and man.</p>

<p>42:003:001 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tetrarch of Abilene,</p>

<p>42:003:002 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</p>

<p>42:003:003 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;</p>

<p>42:003:004 As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>

<p>42:003:005 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rough ways shall be made smooth;</p>

<p>42:003:006 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</p>

<p>42:003:007 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the wrath to come?</p>

<p>42:003:008 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up children unto Abraham.</p>

<p>42:003:009 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down, and cast into the fire.</p>

<p>42:003:010 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?</p>

<p>42:003:011 He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him do likewise.</p>

<p>42:003:012 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master, what shall we do?</p>

<p>42:003:013 And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appointed you.</p>

<p>42:003:014 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.</p>

<p>42:003:015 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not;</p>

<p>42:003:016 John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Holy Ghost and with fire:</p>

<p>42:003:017 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.</p>

<p>42:003:018 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people.</p>

<p>42:003:019 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother Philip's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done,</p>

<p>42:003:020 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.</p>

<p>42:003:021 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,</p>

<p>42:003:022 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.</p>

<p>42:003:023 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heli,</p>

<p>42:003:027 Which was the son of Joanna, which was the son of Rhesa, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was the son of Zorobabel, which was the son of Salathiel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which was the son of Neri,</p>

<p>42:003:028 Which was the son of Melchi, which was the son of Addi, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was the son of Cosam, which was the son of Elmodam, which was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Er,</p>

<p>42:003:029 Which was the son of Jose, which was the son of Eliezer, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was the son of Jorim, which was the son of Matthat, which was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Levi,</p>

<p>42:003:030 Which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Eliakim,</p>

<p>42:003:031 Which was the son of Melea, which was the son of Menan, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was the son of Mattatha, which was the son of Nathan, which<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was the son of Booz, which was the son of Salmon, which was<br>

<p>42:003:033 Which was the son of Aminadab, which was the son of Aram,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which was the son of Esrom, which was the son of Phares, which<br>

<p>42:003:034 Which was the son of Jacob, which was the son of Isaac, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was the son of Abraham, which was the son of Thara, which was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Nachor,</p>

<p>42:003:035 Which was the son of Saruch, which was the son of Ragau, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was the son of Phalec, which was the son of Heber, which was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Sala,</p>

<p>42:003:036 Which was the son of Cainan, which was the son of Arphaxad,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which was the son of Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Lamech,</p>

<p>42:003:037 Which was the son of Mathusala, which was the son of Enoch,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which was the son of Jared, which was the son of Maleleel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which was the son of Cainan,</p>

<p>42:003:038 Which was the son of Enos, which was the son of Seth, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was the son of Adam, which was the son of God.</p>

<p>42:004:001 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,</p>

<p>42:004:002 Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hungered.</p>

<p>42:004:003 And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command this stone that it be made bread.</p>

<p>42:004:004 And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.</p>

<p>42:004:005 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</p>

<p>42:004:006 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whomsoever I will I give it.</p>

<p>42:004:007 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.</p>

<p>42:004:008 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and him only shalt thou serve.</p>

<p>42:004:009 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thyself down from hence:</p>

<p>42:004:010 For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to keep thee:</p>

<p>42:004:011 And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou dash thy foot against a stone.</p>

<p>42:004:012 And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tempt the Lord thy God.</p>

<p>42:004:013 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from him for a season.</p>

<p>42:004:014 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there went out a fame of him through all the region round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about.</p>

<p>42:004:015 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.</p>

<p>42:004:016 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stood up for to read.</p>

<p>42:004:017 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where it was written,</p>

<p>42:004:018 The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are bruised,</p>

<p>42:004:019 To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.</p>

<p>42:004:020 And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;synagogue were fastened on him.</p>

<p>42:004:021 And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fulfilled in your ears.</p>

<p>42:004:022 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph's son?</p>

<p>42:004:023 And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.</p>

<p>42:004:024 And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his own country.</p>

<p>42:004:025 But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;months, when great famine was throughout all the land;</p>

<p>42:004:026 But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow.</p>

<p>42:004:027 And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syrian.</p>

<p>42:004:028 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were filled with wrath,</p>

<p>42:004:029 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might cast him down headlong.</p>

<p>42:004:030 But he passing through the midst of them went his way,</p>

<p>42:004:031 And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the sabbath days.</p>

<p>42:004:032 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with power.</p>

<p>42:004:033 And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,</p>

<p>42:004:034 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;art; the Holy One of God.</p>

<p>42:004:035 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of him, and hurt him not.</p>

<p>42:004:036 And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What a word is this! for with authority and power he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out.</p>

<p>42:004:037 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;round about.</p>

<p>42:004:038 And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they besought him for her.</p>

<p>42:004:039 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.</p>

<p>42:004:040 Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on every one of them, and healed them.</p>

<p>42:004:041 And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ.</p>

<p>42:004:042 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he should not depart from them.</p>

<p>42:004:043 And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other cities also: for therefore am I sent.</p>

<p>42:004:044 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.</p>

<p>42:005:001 And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret,</p>

<p>42:005:002 And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gone out of them, and were washing their nets.</p>

<p>42:005:003 And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon's, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship.</p>

<p>42:005:004 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught.</p>

<p>42:005:005 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will let down the net.</p>

<p>42:005:006 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of fishes: and their net brake.</p>

<p>42:005:007 And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.</p>

<p>42:005:008 When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord.</p>

<p>42:005:009 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;draught of the fishes which they had taken:</p>

<p>42:005:010 And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from henceforth thou shalt catch men.</p>

<p>42:005:011 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all, and followed him.</p>

<p>42:005:012 And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clean.</p>

<p>42:005:013 And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.</p>

<p>42:005:014 And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p>

<p>42:005:015 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him of their infirmities.</p>

<p>42:005:016 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed.</p>

<p>42:005:017 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.</p>

<p>42:005:018 And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before him.</p>

<p>42:005:019 And when they could not find by what way they might bring him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before Jesus.</p>

<p>42:005:020 And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are forgiven thee.</p>

<p>42:005:021 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God alone?</p>

<p>42:005:022 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them, What reason ye in your hearts?</p>

<p>42:005:023 Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say, Rise up and walk?</p>

<p>42:005:024 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house.</p>

<p>42:005:025 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God.</p>

<p>42:005:026 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.</p>

<p>42:005:027 And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, Follow me.</p>

<p>42:005:028 And he left all, rose up, and followed him.</p>

<p>42:005:029 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with them.</p>

<p>42:005:030 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sinners?</p>

<p>42:005:031 And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not a physician; but they that are sick.</p>

<p>42:005:032 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>

<p>42:005:033 And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharisees; but thine eat and drink?</p>

<p>42:005:034 And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</p>

<p>42:005:035 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</p>

<p>42:005:036 And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agreeth not with the old.</p>

<p>42:005:037 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall perish.</p>

<p>42:005:038 But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preserved.</p>

<p>42:005:039 No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he saith, The old is better.</p>

<p>42:006:001 And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands.</p>

<p>42:006:002 And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?</p>

<p>42:006:003 And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which were with him;</p>

<p>42:006:004 How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?</p>

<p>42:006:005 And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sabbath.</p>

<p>42:006:006 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand was withered.</p>

<p>42:006:007 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heal on the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against him.</p>

<p>42:006:008 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arose and stood forth.</p>

<p>42:006:009 Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing; Is it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life, or to destroy it?</p>

<p>42:006:010 And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restored whole as the other.</p>

<p>42:006:011 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another what they might do to Jesus.</p>

<p>42:006:012 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.</p>

<p>42:006:013 And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples: and of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles;</p>

<p>42:006:014 Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,</p>

<p>42:006:015 Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called Zelotes,</p>

<p>42:006:016 And Judas the brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was the traitor.</p>

<p>42:006:017 And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diseases;</p>

<p>42:006:018 And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;healed.</p>

<p>42:006:019 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;virtue out of him, and healed them all.</p>

<p>42:006:020 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>42:006:021 Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.</p>

<p>42:006:022 Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.</p>

<p>42:006:023 Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fathers unto the prophets.</p>

<p>42:006:024 But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consolation.</p>

<p>42:006:025 Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.</p>

<p>42:006:026 Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their fathers to the false prophets.</p>

<p>42:006:027 But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them which hate you,</p>

<p>42:006:028 Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despitefully use you.</p>

<p>42:006:029 And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy coat also.</p>

<p>42:006:030 Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away thy goods ask them not again.</p>

<p>42:006:031 And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likewise.</p>

<p>42:006:032 For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sinners also love those that love them.</p>

<p>42:006:033 And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have ye? for sinners also do even the same.</p>

<p>42:006:034 And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again.</p>

<p>42:006:035 But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unthankful and to the evil.</p>

<p>42:006:036 Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.</p>

<p>42:006:037 Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:</p>

<p>42:006:038 Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it shall be measured to you again.</p>

<p>42:006:039 And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?</p>

<p>42:006:040 The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perfect shall be as his master.</p>

<p>42:006:041 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</p>

<p>42:006:042 Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye.</p>

<p>42:006:043 For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</p>

<p>42:006:044 For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.</p>

<p>42:006:045 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.</p>

<p>42:006:046 And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say?</p>

<p>42:006:047 Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, I will shew you to whom he is like:</p>

<p>42:006:048 He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it: for it was founded upon a rock.</p>

<p>42:006:049 But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ruin of that house was great.</p>

<p>42:007:001 Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people, he entered into Capernaum.</p>

<p>42:007:002 And a certain centurion's servant, who was dear unto him, was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sick, and ready to die.</p>

<p>42:007:003 And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</p>

<p>42:007:004 And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</p>

<p>42:007:005 For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</p>

<p>42:007:006 Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shouldest enter under my roof:</p>

<p>42:007:007 Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</p>

<p>42:007:008 For I also am a man set under authority, having under me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he doeth it.</p>

<p>42:007:009 When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</p>

<p>42:007:010 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant whole that had been sick.</p>

<p>42:007:011 And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people.</p>

<p>42:007:012 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</p>

<p>42:007:013 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto her, Weep not.</p>

<p>42:007:014 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</p>

<p>42:007:015 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delivered him to his mother.</p>

<p>42:007:016 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visited his people.</p>

<p>42:007:017 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throughout all the region round about.</p>

<p>42:007:018 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</p>

<p>42:007:019 And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another?</p>

<p>42:007:020 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look we for another?</p>

<p>42:007:021 And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gave sight.</p>

<p>42:007:022 Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</p>

<p>42:007:023 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p>

<p>42:007:024 And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</p>

<p>42:007:025 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;live delicately, are in kings' courts.</p>

<p>42:007:026 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, and much more than a prophet.</p>

<p>42:007:027 This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>

<p>42:007:028 For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</p>

<p>42:007:029 And all the people that heard him, and the publicans,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</p>

<p>42:007:030 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against themselves, being not baptized of him.</p>

<p>42:007:031 And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this generation? and to what are they like?</p>

<p>42:007:032 They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not wept.</p>

<p>42:007:033 For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</p>

<p>42:007:034 The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sinners!</p>

<p>42:007:035 But wisdom is justified of all her children.</p>

<p>42:007:036 And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him. And he went into the Pharisee's house, and sat down to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meat.</p>

<p>42:007:037 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an alabaster box of ointment,</p>

<p>42:007:038 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ointment.</p>

<p>42:007:039 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him: for she is a sinner.</p>

<p>42:007:040 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</p>

<p>42:007:041 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</p>

<p>42:007:042 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</p>

<p>42:007:043 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</p>

<p>42:007:044 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wiped them with the hairs of her head.</p>

<p>42:007:045 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</p>

<p>42:007:046 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anointed my feet with ointment.</p>

<p>42:007:047 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same loveth little.</p>

<p>42:007:048 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</p>

<p>42:007:049 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</p>

<p>42:007:050 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peace.</p>

<p>42:008:001 And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city and village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,</p>

<p>42:008:002 And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devils,</p>

<p>42:008:003 And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod's steward, and Susanna, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many others, which ministered unto him of their substance.</p>

<p>42:008:004 And when much people were gathered together, and were come to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him out of every city, he spake by a parable:</p>

<p>42:008:005 A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;air devoured it.</p>

<p>42:008:006 And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;withered away, because it lacked moisture.</p>

<p>42:008:007 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and choked it.</p>

<p>42:008:008 And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p>42:008:009 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be?</p>

<p>42:008:010 And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might not see, and hearing they might not understand.</p>

<p>42:008:011 Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</p>

<p>42:008:012 Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should believe and be saved.</p>

<p>42:008:013 They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</p>

<p>42:008:014 And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</p>

<p>42:008:015 But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fruit with patience.</p>

<p>42:008:016 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light.</p>

<p>42:008:017 For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abroad.</p>

<p>42:008:018 Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken even that which he seemeth to have.</p>

<p>42:008:019 Then came to him his mother and his brethren, and could not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come at him for the press.</p>

<p>42:008:020 And it was told him by certain which said, Thy mother and thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brethren stand without, desiring to see thee.</p>

<p>42:008:021 And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are these which hear the word of God, and do it.</p>

<p>42:008:022 Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</p>

<p>42:008:023 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in jeopardy.</p>

<p>42:008:024 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we perish. Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</p>

<p>42:008:025 And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this! for he commandeth even the winds and water, and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obey him.</p>

<p>42:008:026 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over against Galilee.</p>

<p>42:008:027 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.</p>

<p>42:008:028 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.</p>

<p>42:008:029 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man. For oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with chains and in fetters; and he brake the bands, and was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;driven of the devil into the wilderness.)</p>

<p>42:008:030 And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Legion: because many devils were entered into him.</p>

<p>42:008:031 And they besought him that he would not command them to go out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the deep.</p>

<p>42:008:032 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mountain: and they besought him that he would suffer them to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enter into them. And he suffered them.</p>

<p>42:008:033 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lake, and were choked.</p>

<p>42:008:034 When they that fed them saw what was done, they fled, and went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and told it in the city and in the country.</p>

<p>42:008:035 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and found the man, out of whom the devils were departed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they were afraid.</p>

<p>42:008:036 They also which saw it told them by what means he that was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possessed of the devils was healed.</p>

<p>42:008:037 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about besought him to depart from them; for they were taken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with great fear: and he went up into the ship, and returned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back again.</p>

<p>42:008:038 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying,</p>

<p>42:008:039 Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done unto thee. And he went his way, and published throughout<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the whole city how great things Jesus had done unto him.</p>

<p>42:008:040 And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gladly received him: for they were all waiting for him.</p>

<p>42:008:041 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus' feet, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;besought him that he would come into his house:</p>

<p>42:008:042 For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she lay a dying. But as he went the people thronged him.</p>

<p>42:008:043 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spent all her living upon physicians, neither could be healed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of any,</p>

<p>42:008:044 Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immediately her issue of blood stanched.</p>

<p>42:008:045 And Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</p>

<p>42:008:046 And Jesus said, Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;virtue is gone out of me.</p>

<p>42:008:047 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how she was healed immediately.</p>

<p>42:008:048 And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath made thee whole; go in peace.</p>

<p>42:008:049 While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;synagogue's house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trouble not the Master.</p>

<p>42:008:050 But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe only, and she shall be made whole.</p>

<p>42:008:051 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the maiden.</p>

<p>42:008:052 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weep not; she is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not dead, but sleepeth.</p>

<p>42:008:053 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.</p>

<p>42:008:054 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Maid, arise.</p>

<p>42:008:055 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commanded to give her meat.</p>

<p>42:008:056 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should tell no man what was done.</p>

<p>42:009:001 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power and authority over all devils, and to cure diseases.</p>

<p>42:009:002 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sick.</p>

<p>42:009:003 And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two coats apiece.</p>

<p>42:009:004 And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depart.</p>

<p>42:009:005 And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against them.</p>

<p>42:009:006 And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gospel, and healing every where.</p>

<p>42:009:007 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was risen from the dead;</p>

<p>42:009:008 And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the old prophets was risen again.</p>

<p>42:009:009 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear such things? And he desired to see him.</p>

<p>42:009:010 And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they had done. And he took them, and went aside privately into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</p>

<p>42:009:011 And the people, when they knew it, followed him: and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;healed them that had need of healing.</p>

<p>42:009:012 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the towns and country round about, and lodge, and get<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;victuals: for we are here in a desert place.</p>

<p>42:009:013 But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go and buy meat for all this people.</p>

<p>42:009:014 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples, Make them sit down by fifties in a company.</p>

<p>42:009:015 And they did so, and made them all sit down.</p>

<p>42:009:016 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples to set before the multitude.</p>

<p>42:009:017 And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.</p>

<p>42:009:018 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were with him: and he asked them, saying, Whom say the people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I am?</p>

<p>42:009:019 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and others say, that one of the old prophets is risen again.</p>

<p>42:009:020 He said unto them, But whom say ye that I am? Peter answering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, The Christ of God.</p>

<p>42:009:021 And he straitly charged them, and commanded them to tell no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man that thing;</p>

<p>42:009:022 Saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slain, and be raised the third day.</p>

<p>42:009:023 And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</p>

<p>42:009:024 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.</p>

<p>42:009:025 For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lose himself, or be cast away?</p>

<p>42:009:026 For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels.</p>

<p>42:009:027 But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>42:009:028 And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he took Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to pray.</p>

<p>42:009:029 And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his raiment was white and glistering.</p>

<p>42:009:030 And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Elias:</p>

<p>42:009:031 Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should accomplish at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>42:009:032 But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that stood with him.</p>

<p>42:009:033 And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one for Elias: not knowing what he said.</p>

<p>42:009:034 While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</p>

<p>42:009:035 And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beloved Son: hear him.</p>

<p>42:009:036 And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things which they had seen.</p>

<p>42:009:037 And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down from the hill, much people met him.</p>

<p>42:009:038 And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child.</p>

<p>42:009:039 And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;departeth from him.</p>

<p>42:009:040 And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not.</p>

<p>42:009:041 And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hither.</p>

<p>42:009:042 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child, and delivered him again to his father.</p>

<p>42:009:043 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto his disciples,</p>

<p>42:009:044 Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be delivered into the hands of men.</p>

<p>42:009:045 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying.</p>

<p>42:009:046 Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be greatest.</p>

<p>42:009:047 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child, and set him by him,</p>

<p>42:009:048 And said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be great.</p>

<p>42:009:049 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devils in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not with us.</p>

<p>42:009:050 And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against us is for us.</p>

<p>42:009:051 And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</p>

<p>42:009:052 And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>42:009:053 And they did not receive him, because his face was as though<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he would go to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>42:009:054 And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and consume them, even as Elias did?</p>

<p>42:009:055 But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manner of spirit ye are of.</p>

<p>42:009:056 For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save them. And they went to another village.</p>

<p>42:009:057 And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goest.</p>

<p>42:009:058 And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;head.</p>

<p>42:009:059 And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me first to go and bury my father.</p>

<p>42:009:060 Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and preach the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>42:009:061 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.</p>

<p>42:009:062 And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>42:010:001 After these things the LORD appointed other seventy also, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent them two and two before his face into every city and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place, whither he himself would come.</p>

<p>42:010:002 Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.</p>

<p>42:010:003 Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.</p>

<p>42:010:004 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the way.</p>

<p>42:010:005 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this house.</p>

<p>42:010:006 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it: if not, it shall turn to you again.</p>

<p>42:010:007 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from house to house.</p>

<p>42:010:008 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such things as are set before you:</p>

<p>42:010:009 And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.</p>

<p>42:010:010 But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say,</p>

<p>42:010:011 Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.</p>

<p>42:010:012 But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day for Sodom, than for that city.</p>

<p>42:010:013 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sackcloth and ashes.</p>

<p>42:010:014 But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judgment, than for you.</p>

<p>42:010:015 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thrust down to hell.</p>

<p>42:010:016 He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>42:010:017 And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the devils are subject unto us through thy name.</p>

<p>42:010:018 And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven.</p>

<p>42:010:019 Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall by any means hurt you.</p>

<p>42:010:020 Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written in heaven.</p>

<p>42:010:021 In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.</p>

<p>42:010:022 All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.</p>

<p>42:010:023 And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see:</p>

<p>42:010:024 For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</p>

<p>42:010:025 And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</p>

<p>42:010:026 He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou?</p>

<p>42:010:027 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.</p>

<p>42:010:028 And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou shalt live.</p>

<p>42:010:029 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is my neighbour?</p>

<p>42:010:030 And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half dead.</p>

<p>42:010:031 And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.</p>

<p>42:010:032 And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looked on him, and passed by on the other side.</p>

<p>42:010:033 But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and when he saw him, he had compassion on him,</p>

<p>42:010:034 And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and took care of him.</p>

<p>42:010:035 And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repay thee.</p>

<p>42:010:036 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him that fell among the thieves?</p>

<p>42:010:037 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, Go, and do thou likewise.</p>

<p>42:010:038 Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into her house.</p>

<p>42:010:039 And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feet, and heard his word.</p>

<p>42:010:040 But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.</p>

<p>42:010:041 And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;careful and troubled about many things:</p>

<p>42:010:042 But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which shall not be taken away from her.</p>

<p>42:011:001 And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.</p>

<p>42:011:002 And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done, as in heaven, so in earth.</p>

<p>42:011:003 Give us day by day our daily bread.</p>

<p>42:011:004 And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us from evil.</p>

<p>42:011:005 And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me three loaves;</p>

<p>42:011:006 For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing to set before him?</p>

<p>42:011:007 And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rise and give thee.</p>

<p>42:011:008 I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and give him as many as he needeth.</p>

<p>42:011:009 And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</p>

<p>42:011:010 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</p>

<p>42:011:011 If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give him a serpent?</p>

<p>42:011:012 Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?</p>

<p>42:011:013 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</p>

<p>42:011:014 And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people wondered.</p>

<p>42:011:015 But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the chief of the devils.</p>

<p>42:011:016 And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.</p>

<p>42:011:017 But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;divided against a house falleth.</p>

<p>42:011:018 If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beelzebub.</p>

<p>42:011:019 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.</p>

<p>42:011:020 But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom of God is come upon you.</p>

<p>42:011:021 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peace:</p>

<p>42:011:022 But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;divideth his spoils.</p>

<p>42:011:023 He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not with me scattereth.</p>

<p>42:011:024 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will return unto my house whence I came out.</p>

<p>42:011:025 And when he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.</p>

<p>42:011:026 Then goeth he, and taketh to him seven other spirits more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the last state of that man is worse than the first.</p>

<p>42:011:027 And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sucked.</p>

<p>42:011:028 But he said, Yea rather, blessed are they that hear the word<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God, and keep it.</p>

<p>42:011:029 And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.</p>

<p>42:011:030 For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son of man be to this generation.</p>

<p>42:011:031 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</p>

<p>42:011:032 The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</p>

<p>42:011:033 No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth it in a secret<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which come in may see the light.</p>

<p>42:011:034 The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.</p>

<p>42:011:035 Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;darkness.</p>

<p>42:011:036 If thy whole body therefore be full of light, having no part<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shining of a candle doth give thee light.</p>

<p>42:011:037 And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.</p>

<p>42:011:038 And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first washed before dinner.</p>

<p>42:011:039 And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;full of ravening and wickedness.</p>

<p>42:011:040 Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is within also?</p>

<p>42:011:041 But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all things are clean unto you.</p>

<p>42:011:042 But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;undone.</p>

<p>42:011:043 Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.</p>

<p>42:011:044 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not aware of them.</p>

<p>42:011:045 Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thus saying thou reproachest us also.</p>

<p>42:011:046 And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the burdens with one of your fingers.</p>

<p>42:011:047 Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your fathers killed them.</p>

<p>42:011:048 Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.</p>

<p>42:011:049 Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persecute:</p>

<p>42:011:050 That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;</p>

<p>42:011:051 From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perished between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, It shall be required of this generation.</p>

<p>42:011:052 Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entering in ye hindered.</p>

<p>42:011:053 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak of many things:</p>

<p>42:011:054 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouth, that they might accuse him.</p>

<p>42:012:001 In the mean time, when there were gathered together an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</p>

<p>42:012:002 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither hid, that shall not be known.</p>

<p>42:012:003 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.</p>

<p>42:012:004 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the body, and after that have no more that they can do.</p>

<p>42:012:005 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto you, Fear him.</p>

<p>42:012:006 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them is forgotten before God?</p>

<p>42:012:007 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.</p>

<p>42:012:008 Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God:</p>

<p>42:012:009 But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angels of God.</p>

<p>42:012:010 And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Holy Ghost it shall not be forgiven.</p>

<p>42:012:011 And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:</p>

<p>42:012:012 For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ought to say.</p>

<p>42:012:013 And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.</p>

<p>42:012:014 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over you?</p>

<p>42:012:015 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which he possesseth.</p>

<p>42:012:016 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certain rich man brought forth plentifully:</p>

<p>42:012:017 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?</p>

<p>42:012:018 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goods.</p>

<p>42:012:019 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.</p>

<p>42:012:020 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hast provided?</p>

<p>42:012:021 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toward God.</p>

<p>42:012:022 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;body, what ye shall put on.</p>

<p>42:012:023 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.</p>

<p>42:012:024 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much more are ye better than the fowls?</p>

<p>42:012:025 And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one cubit?</p>

<p>42:012:026 If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take ye thought for the rest?</p>

<p>42:012:027 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not arrayed like one of these.</p>

<p>42:012:028 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clothe you, O ye of little faith?</p>

<p>42:012:029 And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither be ye of doubtful mind.</p>

<p>42:012:030 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.</p>

<p>42:012:031 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be added unto you.</p>

<p>42:012:032 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to give you the kingdom.</p>

<p>42:012:033 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.</p>

<p>42:012:034 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>

<p>42:012:035 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;</p>

<p>42:012:036 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knocketh, they may open unto him immediately.</p>

<p>42:012:037 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forth and serve them.</p>

<p>42:012:038 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.</p>

<p>42:012:039 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suffered his house to be broken through.</p>

<p>42:012:040 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hour when ye think not.</p>

<p>42:012:041 Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto us, or even to all?</p>

<p>42:012:042 And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them their portion of meat in due season?</p>

<p>42:012:043 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find so doing.</p>

<p>42:012:044 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that he hath.</p>

<p>42:012:045 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;</p>

<p>42:012:046 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unbelievers.</p>

<p>42:012:047 And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with many stripes.</p>

<p>42:012:048 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;committed much, of him they will ask the more.</p>

<p>42:012:049 I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;already kindled?</p>

<p>42:012:050 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;straitened till it be accomplished!</p>

<p>42:012:051 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay; but rather division:</p>

<p>42:012:052 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three against two, and two against three.</p>

<p>42:012:053 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;law.</p>

<p>42:012:054 And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is.</p>

<p>42:012:055 And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heat; and it cometh to pass.</p>

<p>42:012:056 Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?</p>

<p>42:012:057 Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?</p>

<p>42:012:058 When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into prison.</p>

<p>42:012:059 I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the very last mite.</p>

<p>42:013:001 There were present at that season some that told him of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sacrifices.</p>

<p>42:013:002 And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suffered such things?</p>

<p>42:013:003 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perish.</p>

<p>42:013:004 Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwelt in Jerusalem?</p>

<p>42:013:005 I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perish.</p>

<p>42:013:006 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and found none.</p>

<p>42:013:007 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?</p>

<p>42:013:008 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:</p>

<p>42:013:009 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt cut it down.</p>

<p>42:013:010 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.</p>

<p>42:013:011 And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lift up herself.</p>

<p>42:013:012 And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.</p>

<p>42:013:013 And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;straight, and glorified God.</p>

<p>42:013:014 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sabbath day.</p>

<p>42:013:015 The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the stall, and lead him away to watering?</p>

<p>42:013:016 And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this bond on the sabbath day?</p>

<p>42:013:017 And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things that were done by him.</p>

<p>42:013:018 Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whereunto shall I resemble it?</p>

<p>42:013:019 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.</p>

<p>42:013:020 And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?</p>

<p>42:013:021 It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</p>

<p>42:013:022 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;journeying toward Jerusalem.</p>

<p>42:013:023 Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he said unto them,</p>

<p>42:013:024 Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</p>

<p>42:013:025 When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:</p>

<p>42:013:026 Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.</p>

<p>42:013:027 But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.</p>

<p>42:013:028 There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.</p>

<p>42:013:029 And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom of God.</p>

<p>42:013:030 And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are first which shall be last.</p>

<p>42:013:031 The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee.</p>

<p>42:013:032 And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;third day I shall be perfected.</p>

<p>42:013:033 Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem.</p>

<p>42:013:034 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under her wings, and ye would not!</p>

<p>42:013:035 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>42:014:001 And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chief Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;watched him.</p>

<p>42:014:002 And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dropsy.</p>

<p>42:014:003 And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?</p>

<p>42:014:004 And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let him go;</p>

<p>42:014:005 And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the sabbath day?</p>

<p>42:014:006 And they could not answer him again to these things.</p>

<p>42:014:007 And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them.</p>

<p>42:014:008 When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bidden of him;</p>

<p>42:014:009 And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.</p>

<p>42:014:010 But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presence of them that sit at meat with thee.</p>

<p>42:014:011 For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>

<p>42:014:012 Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee.</p>

<p>42:014:013 But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lame, the blind:</p>

<p>42:014:014 And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.</p>

<p>42:014:015 And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>42:014:016 Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bade many:</p>

<p>42:014:017 And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bidden, Come; for all things are now ready.</p>

<p>42:014:018 And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused.</p>

<p>42:014:019 And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prove them: I pray thee have me excused.</p>

<p>42:014:020 And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot come.</p>

<p>42:014:021 So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blind.</p>

<p>42:014:022 And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and yet there is room.</p>

<p>42:014:023 And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filled.</p>

<p>42:014:024 For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall taste of my supper.</p>

<p>42:014:025 And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto them,</p>

<p>42:014:026 If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.</p>

<p>42:014:027 And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot be my disciple.</p>

<p>42:014:028 For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finish it?</p>

<p>42:014:029 Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,</p>

<p>42:014:030 Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.</p>

<p>42:014:031 Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand?</p>

<p>42:014:032 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.</p>

<p>42:014:033 So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.</p>

<p>42:014:034 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall it be seasoned?</p>

<p>42:014:035 It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p>42:015:001 Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear him.</p>

<p>42:015:002 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.</p>

<p>42:015:003 And he spake this parable unto them, saying,</p>

<p>42:015:004 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and go after that which is lost, until he find it?</p>

<p>42:015:005 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rejoicing.</p>

<p>42:015:006 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found my sheep which was lost.</p>

<p>42:015:007 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persons, which need no repentance.</p>

<p>42:015:008 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diligently till she find it?</p>

<p>42:015:009 And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the piece which I had lost.</p>

<p>42:015:010 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.</p>

<p>42:015:011 And he said, A certain man had two sons:</p>

<p>42:015:012 And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them his living.</p>

<p>42:015:013 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;substance with riotous living.</p>

<p>42:015:014 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land; and he began to be in want.</p>

<p>42:015:015 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</p>

<p>42:015:016 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.</p>

<p>42:015:017 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with hunger!</p>

<p>42:015:018 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,</p>

<p>42:015:019 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy hired servants.</p>

<p>42:015:020 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.</p>

<p>42:015:021 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy son.</p>

<p>42:015:022 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on his feet:</p>

<p>42:015:023 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and be merry:</p>

<p>42:015:024 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is found. And they began to be merry.</p>

<p>42:015:025 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.</p>

<p>42:015:026 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meant.</p>

<p>42:015:027 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sound.</p>

<p>42:015:028 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father out, and intreated him.</p>

<p>42:015:029 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make merry with my friends:</p>

<p>42:015:030 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</p>

<p>42:015:031 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have is thine.</p>

<p>42:015:032 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found.</p>

<p>42:016:001 And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he had wasted his goods.</p>

<p>42:016:002 And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mayest be no longer steward.</p>

<p>42:016:003 Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am ashamed.</p>

<p>42:016:004 I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</p>

<p>42:016:005 So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</p>

<p>42:016:006 And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</p>

<p>42:016:007 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bill, and write fourscore.</p>

<p>42:016:008 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wiser than the children of light.</p>

<p>42:016:009 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into everlasting habitations.</p>

<p>42:016:010 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much.</p>

<p>42:016:011 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?</p>

<p>42:016:012 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</p>

<p>42:016:013 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</p>

<p>42:016:014 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things: and they derided him.</p>

<p>42:016:015 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</p>

<p>42:016:016 The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.</p>

<p>42:016:017 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the law to fail.</p>

<p>42:016:018 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away from her husband committeth adultery.</p>

<p>42:016:019 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</p>

<p>42:016:020 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at his gate, full of sores,</p>

<p>42:016:021 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</p>

<p>42:016:022 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was buried;</p>

<p>42:016:023 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</p>

<p>42:016:024 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</p>

<p>42:016:025 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</p>

<p>42:016:026 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.</p>

<p>42:016:027 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wouldest send him to my father's house:</p>

<p>42:016:028 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they also come into this place of torment.</p>

<p>42:016:029 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them hear them.</p>

<p>42:016:030 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the dead, they will repent.</p>

<p>42:016:031 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</p>

<p>42:017:001 Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!</p>

<p>42:017:002 It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of these little ones.</p>

<p>42:017:003 Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.</p>

<p>42:017:004 And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou shalt forgive him.</p>

<p>42:017:005 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.</p>

<p>42:017:006 And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you.</p>

<p>42:017:007 But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go and sit down to meat?</p>

<p>42:017:008 And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?</p>

<p>42:017:009 Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commanded him? I trow not.</p>

<p>42:017:010 So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done that which was our duty to do.</p>

<p>42:017:011 And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</p>

<p>42:017:012 And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men that were lepers, which stood afar off:</p>

<p>42:017:013 And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mercy on us.</p>

<p>42:017:014 And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were cleansed.</p>

<p>42:017:015 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with a loud voice glorified God,</p>

<p>42:017:016 And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was a Samaritan.</p>

<p>42:017:017 And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where are the nine?</p>

<p>42:017:018 There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this stranger.</p>

<p>42:017:019 And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee whole.</p>

<p>42:017:020 And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cometh not with observation:</p>

<p>42:017:021 Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kingdom of God is within you.</p>

<p>42:017:022 And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not see it.</p>

<p>42:017:023 And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after them, nor follow them.</p>

<p>42:017:024 For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall also the Son of man be in his day.</p>

<p>42:017:025 But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generation.</p>

<p>42:017:026 And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days of the Son of man.</p>

<p>42:017:027 They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the flood came, and destroyed them all.</p>

<p>42:017:028 Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;</p>

<p>42:017:029 But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.</p>

<p>42:017:030 Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;revealed.</p>

<p>42:017:031 In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</p>

<p>42:017:032 Remember Lot's wife.</p>

<p>42:017:033 Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.</p>

<p>42:017:034 I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</p>

<p>42:017:035 Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the other left.</p>

<p>42:017:036 Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other left.</p>

<p>42:017:037 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gathered together.</p>

<p>42:018:001 And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always to pray, and not to faint;</p>

<p>42:018:002 Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither regarded man:</p>

<p>42:018:003 And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.</p>

<p>42:018:004 And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;</p>

<p>42:018:005 Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by her continual coming she weary me.</p>

<p>42:018:006 And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.</p>

<p>42:018:007 And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night unto him, though he bear long with them?</p>

<p>42:018:008 I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</p>

<p>42:018:009 And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</p>

<p>42:018:010 Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the other a publican.</p>

<p>42:018:011 The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adulterers, or even as this publican.</p>

<p>42:018:012 I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</p>

<p>42:018:013 And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God be merciful to me a sinner.</p>

<p>42:018:014 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</p>

<p>42:018:015 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</p>

<p>42:018:016 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Suffer little<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>42:018:017 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</p>

<p>42:018:018 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do to inherit eternal life?</p>

<p>42:018:019 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good, save one, that is, God.</p>

<p>42:018:020 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father and thy mother.</p>

<p>42:018:021 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</p>

<p>42:018:022 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven: and come, follow me.</p>

<p>42:018:023 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rich.</p>

<p>42:018:024 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God!</p>

<p>42:018:025 For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>42:018:026 And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?</p>

<p>42:018:027 And he said, The things which are impossible with men are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible with God.</p>

<p>42:018:028 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.</p>

<p>42:018:029 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children, for the kingdom of God's sake,</p>

<p>42:018:030 Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the world to come life everlasting.</p>

<p>42:018:031 Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</p>

<p>42:018:032 For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:</p>

<p>42:018:033 And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;third day he shall rise again.</p>

<p>42:018:034 And they understood none of these things: and this saying was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.</p>

<p>42:018:035 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certain blind man sat by the way side begging:</p>

<p>42:018:036 And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.</p>

<p>42:018:037 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.</p>

<p>42:018:038 And he cried, saying, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>42:018:039 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of David,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have mercy on me.</p>

<p>42:018:040 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he was come near, he asked him,</p>

<p>42:018:041 Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, that I may receive my sight.</p>

<p>42:018:042 And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saved thee.</p>

<p>42:018:043 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;praise unto God.</p>

<p>42:019:001 And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.</p>

<p>42:019:002 And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chief among the publicans, and he was rich.</p>

<p>42:019:003 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;press, because he was little of stature.</p>

<p>42:019:004 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him: for he was to pass that way.</p>

<p>42:019:005 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to day I must abide at thy house.</p>

<p>42:019:006 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</p>

<p>42:019:007 And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.</p>

<p>42:019:008 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord: Behold, Lord, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fourfold.</p>

<p>42:019:009 And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</p>

<p>42:019:010 For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lost.</p>

<p>42:019:011 And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.</p>

<p>42:019:012 He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</p>

<p>42:019:013 And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and said unto them, Occupy till I come.</p>

<p>42:019:014 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.</p>

<p>42:019:015 And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know how much every man had gained by trading.</p>

<p>42:019:016 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pounds.</p>

<p>42:019:017 And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ten cities.</p>

<p>42:019:018 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pounds.</p>

<p>42:019:019 And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.</p>

<p>42:019:020 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which I have kept laid up in a napkin:</p>

<p>42:019:021 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;didst not sow.</p>

<p>42:019:022 And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not sow:</p>

<p>42:019:023 Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my coming I might have required mine own with usury?</p>

<p>42:019:024 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and give it to him that hath ten pounds.</p>

<p>42:019:025 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)</p>

<p>42:019:026 For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken away from him.</p>

<p>42:019:027 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.</p>

<p>42:019:028 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem.</p>

<p>42:019:029 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his disciples,</p>

<p>42:019:030 Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.</p>

<p>42:019:031 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him.</p>

<p>42:019:032 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had said unto them.</p>

<p>42:019:033 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them, Why loose ye the colt?</p>

<p>42:019:034 And they said, The Lord hath need of him.</p>

<p>42:019:035 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon.</p>

<p>42:019:036 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.</p>

<p>42:019:037 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;works that they had seen;</p>

<p>42:019:038 Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</p>

<p>42:019:039 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.</p>

<p>42:019:040 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</p>

<p>42:019:041 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it,</p>

<p>42:019:042 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hid from thine eyes.</p>

<p>42:019:043 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee in on every side,</p>

<p>42:019:044 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</p>

<p>42:019:045 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sold therein, and them that bought;</p>

<p>42:019:046 Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p>

<p>42:019:047 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</p>

<p>42:019:048 And could not find what they might do: for all the people were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very attentive to hear him.</p>

<p>42:020:001 And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,</p>

<p>42:020:002 And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?</p>

<p>42:020:003 And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing; and answer me:</p>

<p>42:020:004 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?</p>

<p>42:020:005 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?</p>

<p>42:020:006 But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they be persuaded that John was a prophet.</p>

<p>42:020:007 And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was.</p>

<p>42:020:008 And Jesus said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do these things.</p>

<p>42:020:009 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went into a far country for a long time.</p>

<p>42:020:010 And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.</p>

<p>42:020:011 And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.</p>

<p>42:020:012 And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him out.</p>

<p>42:020:013 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they see him.</p>

<p>42:020:014 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the inheritance may be ours.</p>

<p>42:020:015 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?</p>

<p>42:020:016 He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forbid.</p>

<p>42:020:017 And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;become the head of the corner?</p>

<p>42:020:018 Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</p>

<p>42:020:019 And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.</p>

<p>42:020:020 And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the governor.</p>

<p>42:020:021 And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any, but teachest the way of God truly:</p>

<p>42:020:022 Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no?</p>

<p>42:020:023 But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tempt ye me?</p>

<p>42:020:024 Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered and said, Caesar's.</p>

<p>42:020:025 And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.</p>

<p>42:020:026 And they could not take hold of his words before the people:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.</p>

<p>42:020:027 Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is any resurrection; and they asked him,</p>

<p>42:020:028 Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man's brother die,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p>

<p>42:020:029 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wife, and died without children.</p>

<p>42:020:030 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</p>

<p>42:020:031 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they left no children, and died.</p>

<p>42:020:032 Last of all the woman died also.</p>

<p>42:020:033 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven had her to wife.</p>

<p>42:020:034 And Jesus answering said unto them, The children of this world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marry, and are given in marriage:</p>

<p>42:020:035 But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given in marriage:</p>

<p>42:020:036 Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resurrection.</p>

<p>42:020:037 Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</p>

<p>42:020:038 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;live unto him.</p>

<p>42:020:039 Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well said.</p>

<p>42:020:040 And after that they durst not ask him any question at all.</p>

<p>42:020:041 And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son?</p>

<p>42:020:042 And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</p>

<p>42:020:043 Till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p>

<p>42:020:044 David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?</p>

<p>42:020:045 Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples,</p>

<p>42:020:046 Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;</p>

<p>42:020:047 Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same shall receive greater damnation.</p>

<p>42:021:001 And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the treasury.</p>

<p>42:021:002 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mites.</p>

<p>42:021:003 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath cast in more than they all:</p>

<p>42:021:004 For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offerings of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;living that she had.</p>

<p>42:021:005 And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goodly stones and gifts, he said,</p>

<p>42:021:006 As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not be thrown down.</p>

<p>42:021:007 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come to pass?</p>

<p>42:021:008 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;near: go ye not therefore after them.</p>

<p>42:021:009 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrified: for these things must first come to pass; but the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end is not by and by.</p>

<p>42:021:010 Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom against kingdom:</p>

<p>42:021:011 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there be from heaven.</p>

<p>42:021:012 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my name's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sake.</p>

<p>42:021:013 And it shall turn to you for a testimony.</p>

<p>42:021:014 Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what ye shall answer:</p>

<p>42:021:015 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.</p>

<p>42:021:016 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put to death.</p>

<p>42:021:017 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake.</p>

<p>42:021:018 But there shall not an hair of your head perish.</p>

<p>42:021:019 In your patience possess ye your souls.</p>

<p>42:021:020 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know that the desolation thereof is nigh.</p>

<p>42:021:021 Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them that are in the countries enter thereinto.</p>

<p>42:021:022 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written may be fulfilled.</p>

<p>42:021:023 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land, and wrath upon this people.</p>

<p>42:021:024 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fulfilled.</p>

<p>42:021:025 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;</p>

<p>42:021:026 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven shall be shaken.</p>

<p>42:021:027 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power and great glory.</p>

<p>42:021:028 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.</p>

<p>42:021:029 And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the trees;</p>

<p>42:021:030 When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that summer is now nigh at hand.</p>

<p>42:021:031 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.</p>

<p>42:021:032 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;till all be fulfilled.</p>

<p>42:021:033 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away.</p>

<p>42:021:034 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.</p>

<p>42:021:035 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;face of the whole earth.</p>

<p>42:021:036 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to stand before the Son of man.</p>

<p>42:021:037 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mount of Olives.</p>

<p>42:021:038 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temple, for to hear him.</p>

<p>42:022:001 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Passover.</p>

<p>42:022:002 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him; for they feared the people.</p>

<p>42:022:003 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of the twelve.</p>

<p>42:022:004 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;captains, how he might betray him unto them.</p>

<p>42:022:005 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.</p>

<p>42:022:006 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them in the absence of the multitude.</p>

<p>42:022:007 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be killed.</p>

<p>42:022:008 And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passover, that we may eat.</p>

<p>42:022:009 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?</p>

<p>42:022:010 And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;follow him into the house where he entereth in.</p>

<p>42:022:011 And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the passover with my disciples?</p>

<p>42:022:012 And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ready.</p>

<p>42:022:013 And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made ready the passover.</p>

<p>42:022:014 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apostles with him.</p>

<p>42:022:015 And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passover with you before I suffer:</p>

<p>42:022:016 For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>42:022:017 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;divide it among yourselves:</p>

<p>42:022:018 For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until the kingdom of God shall come.</p>

<p>42:022:019 And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this do in remembrance of me.</p>

<p>42:022:020 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.</p>

<p>42:022:021 But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the table.</p>

<p>42:022:022 And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto that man by whom he is betrayed!</p>

<p>42:022:023 And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was that should do this thing.</p>

<p>42:022:024 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be accounted the greatest.</p>

<p>42:022:025 And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are called benefactors.</p>

<p>42:022:026 But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serve.</p>

<p>42:022:027 For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he that serveth.</p>

<p>42:022:028 Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations.</p>

<p>42:022:029 And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto me;</p>

<p>42:022:030 That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>

<p>42:022:031 And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</p>

<p>42:022:032 But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.</p>

<p>42:022:033 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into prison, and to death.</p>

<p>42:022:034 And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</p>

<p>42:022:035 And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they said, Nothing.</p>

<p>42:022:036 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let him sell his garment, and buy one.</p>

<p>42:022:037 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end.</p>

<p>42:022:038 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them, It is enough.</p>

<p>42:022:039 And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olives; and his disciples also followed him.</p>

<p>42:022:040 And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enter not into temptation.</p>

<p>42:022:041 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kneeled down, and prayed,</p>

<p>42:022:042 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</p>

<p>42:022:043 And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strengthening him.</p>

<p>42:022:044 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ground.</p>

<p>42:022:045 And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow,</p>

<p>42:022:046 And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into temptation.</p>

<p>42:022:047 And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;near unto Jesus to kiss him.</p>

<p>42:022:048 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a kiss?</p>

<p>42:022:049 When they which were about him saw what would follow, they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?</p>

<p>42:022:050 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;off his right ear.</p>

<p>42:022:051 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;touched his ear, and healed him.</p>

<p>42:022:052 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out, as against a thief, with swords and staves?</p>

<p>42:022:053 When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;darkness.</p>

<p>42:022:054 Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priest's house. And Peter followed afar off.</p>

<p>42:022:055 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were set down together, Peter sat down among them.</p>

<p>42:022:056 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>42:022:057 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</p>

<p>42:022:058 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</p>

<p>42:022:059 And about the space of one hour after another confidently<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he is a Galilaean.</p>

<p>42:022:060 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew.</p>

<p>42:022:061 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>

<p>42:022:062 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>42:022:063 And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him.</p>

<p>42:022:064 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee?</p>

<p>42:022:065 And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.</p>

<p>42:022:066 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their council, saying,</p>

<p>42:022:067 Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, ye will not believe:</p>

<p>42:022:068 And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go.</p>

<p>42:022:069 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power of God.</p>

<p>42:022:070 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them, Ye say that I am.</p>

<p>42:022:071 And they said, What need we any further witness? for we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ourselves have heard of his own mouth.</p>

<p>42:023:001 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilate.</p>

<p>42:023:002 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</p>

<p>42:023:003 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</p>

<p>42:023:004 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find no fault in this man.</p>

<p>42:023:005 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to this place.</p>

<p>42:023:006 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galilaean.</p>

<p>42:023:007 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem at that time.</p>

<p>42:023:008 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done by him.</p>

<p>42:023:009 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing.</p>

<p>42:023:010 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>42:023:011 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilate.</p>

<p>42:023:012 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for before they were at enmity between themselves.</p>

<p>42:023:013 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rulers and the people,</p>

<p>42:023:014 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before you, have found no fault in this man touching those<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things whereof ye accuse him:</p>

<p>42:023:015 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worthy of death is done unto him.</p>

<p>42:023:016 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</p>

<p>42:023:017 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)</p>

<p>42:023:018 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and release unto us Barabbas:</p>

<p>42:023:019 (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was cast into prison.)</p>

<p>42:023:020 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>42:023:021 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</p>

<p>42:023:022 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chastise him, and let him go.</p>

<p>42:023:023 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priests prevailed.</p>

<p>42:023:024 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</p>

<p>42:023:025 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus to their will.</p>

<p>42:023:026 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</p>

<p>42:023:027 And there followed him a great company of people, and of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;women, which also bewailed and lamented him.</p>

<p>42:023:028 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</p>

<p>42:023:029 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paps which never gave suck.</p>

<p>42:023:030 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the hills, Cover us.</p>

<p>42:023:031 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done in the dry?</p>

<p>42:023:032 And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put to death.</p>

<p>42:023:033 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right hand, and the other on the left.</p>

<p>42:023:034 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</p>

<p>42:023:035 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he be Christ, the chosen of God.</p>

<p>42:023:036 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him vinegar,</p>

<p>42:023:037 And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</p>

<p>42:023:038 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>

<p>42:023:039 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</p>

<p>42:023:040 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</p>

<p>42:023:041 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</p>

<p>42:023:042 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into thy kingdom.</p>

<p>42:023:043 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou be with me in paradise.</p>

<p>42:023:044 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the earth until the ninth hour.</p>

<p>42:023:045 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the midst.</p>

<p>42:023:046 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gave up the ghost.</p>

<p>42:023:047 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</p>

<p>42:023:048 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</p>

<p>42:023:049 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</p>

<p>42:023:050 And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was a good man, and a just:</p>

<p>42:023:051 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waited for the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>42:023:052 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</p>

<p>42:023:053 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laid.</p>

<p>42:023:054 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</p>

<p>42:023:055 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</p>

<p>42:023:056 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</p>

<p>42:024:001 Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had prepared, and certain others with them.</p>

<p>42:024:002 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</p>

<p>42:024:003 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p>

<p>42:024:004 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</p>

<p>42:024:005 And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dead?</p>

<p>42:024:006 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he was yet in Galilee,</p>

<p>42:024:007 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</p>

<p>42:024:008 And they remembered his words,</p>

<p>42:024:009 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the eleven, and to all the rest.</p>

<p>42:024:010 It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James, and other women that were with them, which told these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things unto the apostles.</p>

<p>42:024:011 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believed them not.</p>

<p>42:024:012 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</p>

<p>42:024:013 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;furlongs.</p>

<p>42:024:014 And they talked together of all these things which had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;happened.</p>

<p>42:024:015 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</p>

<p>42:024:016 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</p>

<p>42:024:017 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</p>

<p>42:024:018 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</p>

<p>42:024:019 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deed and word before God and all the people:</p>

<p>42:024:020 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;condemned to death, and have crucified him.</p>

<p>42:024:021 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these things were done.</p>

<p>42:024:022 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which were early at the sepulchre;</p>

<p>42:024:023 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alive.</p>

<p>42:024:024 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not.</p>

<p>42:024:025 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that the prophets have spoken:</p>

<p>42:024:026 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into his glory?</p>

<p>42:024:027 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>

<p>42:024:028 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made as though he would have gone further.</p>

<p>42:024:029 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tarry with them.</p>

<p>42:024:030 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</p>

<p>42:024:031 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of their sight.</p>

<p>42:024:032 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us the scriptures?</p>

<p>42:024:033 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them,</p>

<p>42:024:034 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</p>

<p>42:024:035 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known of them in breaking of bread.</p>

<p>42:024:036 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</p>

<p>42:024:037 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had seen a spirit.</p>

<p>42:024:038 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thoughts arise in your hearts?</p>

<p>42:024:039 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have.</p>

<p>42:024:040 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feet.</p>

<p>42:024:041 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them, Have ye here any meat?</p>

<p>42:024:042 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;honeycomb.</p>

<p>42:024:043 And he took it, and did eat before them.</p>

<p>42:024:044 And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</p>

<p>42:024:045 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the scriptures,</p>

<p>42:024:046 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</p>

<p>42:024:047 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>42:024:048 And ye are witnesses of these things.</p>

<p>42:024:049 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power from on high.</p>

<p>42:024:050 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands, and blessed them.</p>

<p>42:024:051 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, and carried up into heaven.</p>

<p>42:024:052 And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;joy:</p>

<p>42:024:053 And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen.</p>
