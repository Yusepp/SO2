&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sorrow.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had the dominion in Moab, and Jashubilehem. And these are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ancient things.</p>

<p>13:004:023 These were the potters, and those that dwelt among plants and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hedges: there they dwelt with the king for his work.</p>

<p>13:004:024 The sons of Simeon were, Nemuel, and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaul:</p>

<p>13:004:026 And the sons of Mishma; Hamuel his son, Zacchur his son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shimei his son.</p>

<p>13:004:027 And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters: but his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brethren had not many children, neither did all their family<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiply, like to the children of Judah.</p>

<p>13:004:028 And they dwelt at Beersheba, and Moladah, and Hazarshual,</p>

<p>13:004:029 And at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and at Tolad,</p>

<p>13:004:030 And at Bethuel, and at Hormah, and at Ziklag,</p>

<p>13:004:031 And at Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusim, and at Bethbirei, and at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaaraim. These were their cities unto the reign of David.</p>

<p>13:004:032 And their villages were, Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Ashan, five cities:</p>

<p>13:004:033 And all their villages that were round about the same cities,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto Baal. These were their habitations, and their genealogy.</p>

<p>13:004:034 And Meshobab, and Jamlech, and Joshah, the son of Amaziah,</p>

<p>13:004:035 And Joel, and Jehu the son of Josibiah, the son of Seraiah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Asiel,</p>

<p>13:004:036 And Elioenai, and Jaakobah, and Jeshohaiah, and Asaiah, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adiel, and Jesimiel, and Benaiah,</p>

<p>13:004:037 And Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah;</p>

<p>13:004:038 These mentioned by their names were princes in their families:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the house of their fathers increased greatly.</p>

<p>13:004:039 And they went to the entrance of Gedor, even unto the east<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.</p>

<p>13:004:040 And they found fat pasture and good, and the land was wide,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and quiet, and peaceable; for they of Ham had dwelt there of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old.</p>

<p>13:004:041 And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwelt in their rooms: because there was pasture there for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their flocks.</p>

<p>13:004:042 And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.</p>

<p>13:004:043 And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dwelt there unto this day.</p>

<p>13:005:001 Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the firstborn; but forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;birthright.</p>

<p>13:005:002 For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph's:)</p>

<p>13:005:003 The sons, I say, of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.</p>

<p>13:005:004 The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son,</p>

<p>13:005:005 Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son,</p>

<p>13:005:006 Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.</p>

<p>13:005:007 And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their generations was reckoned, were the chief, Jeiel, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zechariah,</p>

<p>13:005:008 And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon:</p>

<p>13:005:009 And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multiplied in the land of Gilead.</p>

<p>13:005:010 And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the east land of Gilead.</p>

<p>13:005:011 And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Bashan unto Salcah:</p>

<p>13:005:012 Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Bashan.</p>

<p>13:005:013 And their brethren of the house of their fathers were,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zia, and Heber, seven.</p>

<p>13:005:014 These are the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;</p>

<p>13:005:015 Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their fathers.</p>

<p>13:005:016 And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders.</p>

<p>13:005:017 All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.</p>

<p>13:005:018 The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, were four and forty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;war.</p>

<p>13:005:019 And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Nodab.</p>

<p>13:005:020 And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they put their trust in him.</p>

<p>13:005:021 And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.</p>

<p>13:005:022 For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.</p>

<p>13:005:023 And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land: they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and unto mount Hermon.</p>

<p>13:005:024 And these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heads of the house of their fathers.</p>

<p>13:005:025 And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God destroyed before them.</p>

<p>13:005:026 And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day.</p>

<p>13:006:001 The sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p>

<p>13:006:002 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel.</p>

<p>13:006:003 And the children of Amram; Aaron, and Moses, and Miriam. The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sons also of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>

<p>13:006:005 And Abishua begat Bukki, and Bukki begat Uzzi,</p>

<p>13:006:007 Meraioth begat Amariah, and Amariah begat Ahitub,</p>

<p>13:006:008 And Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Ahimaaz,</p>

<p>13:006:009 And Ahimaaz begat Azariah, and Azariah begat Johanan,</p>

<p>13:006:010 And Johanan begat Azariah, (he it is that executed the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priest's office in the temple that Solomon built in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem:)</p>

<p>13:006:011 And Azariah begat Amariah, and Amariah begat Ahitub,</p>

<p>13:006:012 And Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Shallum,</p>

<p>13:006:013 And Shallum begat Hilkiah, and Hilkiah begat Azariah,</p>

<p>13:006:014 And Azariah begat Seraiah, and Seraiah begat Jehozadak,</p>

<p>13:006:015 And Jehozadak went into captivity, when the LORD carried away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah and Jerusalem by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar.</p>

<p>13:006:016 The sons of Levi; Gershom, Kohath, and Merari.</p>

<p>13:006:017 And these be the names of the sons of Gershom; Libni, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shimei.</p>

<p>13:006:018 And the sons of Kohath were, Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uzziel.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fathers of the inhabitants of Geba, and they removed them to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manahath:</p>

<p>13:008:007 And Naaman, and Ahiah, and Gera, he removed them, and begat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uzza, and Ahihud.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had sent them away; Hushim and Baara were his wives.</p>

<p>13:008:009 And he begat of Hodesh his wife, Jobab, and Zibia, and Mesha,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Malcham,</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inhabitants of Aijalon, who drove away the inhabitants of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gath:</p>

<p>13:008:028 These were heads of the fathers, by their generations, chief<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men. These dwelt in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>13:008:029 And at Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon; whose wife's name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was Maachah:</p>

<p>13:008:030 And his firstborn son Abdon, and Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Micah.</p>

<p>13:008:035 And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tarea, and<br>

<p>13:008:036 And Ahaz begat Jehoadah; and Jehoadah begat Alemeth, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza,</p>

<p>13:008:037 And Moza begat Binea: Rapha was his son, Eleasah his son, Azel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his son:</p>

<p>13:008:038 And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All these were the sons of Azel.</p>

<p>13:008:039 And the sons of Eshek his brother were, Ulam his firstborn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehush the second, and Eliphelet the third.</p>

<p>13:008:040 And the sons of Ulam were mighty men of valour, archers, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had many sons, and sons' sons, an hundred and fifty. All these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are of the sons of Benjamin.</p>

<p>13:009:001 So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were carried away to Babylon for their transgression.</p>

<p>13:009:002 Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Nethinims.</p>

<p>13:009:003 And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manasseh;</p>

<p>13:009:004 Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of Judah.</p>

<p>13:009:006 And of the sons of Zerah; Jeuel, and their brethren, six<br>

<p>13:009:007 And of the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of Meshullam, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son of Hodaviah, the son of Hasenuah,</p>

<p>13:009:008 And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi, the<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Reuel, the son of Ibnijah;</p>

<p>13:009:009 And their brethren, according to their generations, nine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred and fifty and six. All these men were chief of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fathers in the house of their fathers.</p>

<p>13:009:010 And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin,</p>

<p>13:009:011 And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the house of God;</p>

<p>13:009:012 And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malchijah, and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immer;</p>

<p>13:009:013 And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the work of the service of the house of God.</p>

<p>13:009:014 And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;</p>

<p>13:009:015 And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;</p>

<p>13:009:016 And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.</p>

<p>13:009:017 And the porters were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief;</p>

<p>13:009:018 Who hitherto waited in the king's gate eastward: they were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;porters in the companies of the children of Levi.</p>

<p>13:009:019 And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry.</p>

<p>13:009:020 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time past, and the LORD was with him.</p>

<p>13:009:021 And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>

<p>13:009:022 All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in their set office.</p>

<p>13:009:023 So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wards.</p>

<p>13:009:024 In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;north, and south.</p>

<p>13:009:025 And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after seven days from time to time with them.</p>

<p>13:009:026 For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God.</p>

<p>13:009:027 And they lodged round about the house of God, because the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pertained to them.</p>

<p>13:009:028 And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they should bring them in and out by tale.</p>

<p>13:009:029 Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.</p>

<p>13:009:030 And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spices.</p>

<p>13:009:031 And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were made in the pans.</p>

<p>13:009:032 And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath.</p>

<p>13:009:033 And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were employed in that work day and night.</p>

<p>13:009:034 These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>13:009:035 And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name was Maachah:</p>

<p>13:009:036 And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ner, and Nadab.</p>

<p>13:009:037 And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.</p>

<p>13:009:038 And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren.</p>

<p>13:009:039 And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.</p>

<p>13:009:040 And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Micah.</p>

<p>13:009:041 And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Ahaz.</p>

<p>13:009:042 And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza;</p>

<p>13:009:043 And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Azel his son.</p>

<p>13:009:044 And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these were the sons of Azel.</p>

<p>13:010:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in mount Gilboa.</p>

<p>13:010:002 And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Malchishua, the sons of Saul.</p>

<p>13:010:003 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, and he was wounded of the archers.</p>

<p>13:010:004 Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.</p>

<p>13:010:005 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likewise on the sword, and died.</p>

<p>13:010:006 So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together.</p>

<p>13:010:007 And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dwelt in them.</p>

<p>13:010:008 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in mount Gilboa.</p>

<p>13:010:009 And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.</p>

<p>13:010:010 And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.</p>

<p>13:010:011 And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done to Saul,</p>

<p>13:010:012 They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven days.</p>

<p>13:010:013 So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spirit, to enquire of it;</p>

<p>13:010:014 And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.</p>

<p>13:011:001 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</p>

<p>13:011:002 And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt be ruler over my people Israel.</p>

<p>13:011:003 Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;word of the LORD by Samuel.</p>

<p>13:011:004 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.</p>

<p>13:011:005 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the city of David.</p>

<p>13:011:006 And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and was chief.</p>

<p>13:011:007 And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city of David.</p>

<p>13:011:008 And he built the city round about, even from Millo round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</p>

<p>13:011:009 So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with him.</p>

<p>13:011:010 These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerning Israel.</p>

<p>13:011:011 And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.</p>

<p>13:011:012 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was one of the three mighties.</p>

<p>13:011:013 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</p>

<p>13:011:014 And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them by a great deliverance.</p>

<p>13:011:015 Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</p>

<p>13:011:016 And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was then at Bethlehem.</p>

<p>13:011:017 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!</p>

<p>13:011:018 And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.</p>

<p>13:011:019 And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three mightiest.</p>

<p>13:011:020 And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and had a name among the three.</p>

<p>13:011:021 Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.</p>

<p>13:011:022 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day.</p>

<p>13:011:023 And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spear.</p>

<p>13:011:024 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among the three mighties.</p>

<p>13:011:025 Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the first three: and David set him over his guard.</p>

<p>13:011:026 Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</p>

<p>13:011:027 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Netophathite,</p>

<p>13:011:031 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that pertained to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,</p>

<p>13:011:032 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,</p>

<p>13:011:033 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,</p>

<p>13:011:034 The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hararite,</p>

<p>13:011:035 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,</p>

<p>13:011:036 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,</p>

<p>13:011:037 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,</p>

<p>13:011:038 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,</p>

<p>13:011:039 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joab the son of Zeruiah,</p>

<p>13:011:040 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,</p>

<p>13:011:041 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,</p>

<p>13:011:042 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reubenites, and thirty with him,</p>

<p>13:011:043 Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,</p>

<p>13:011:044 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Aroerite,</p>

<p>13:011:045 Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,</p>

<p>13:011:046 Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,</p>

<p>13:011:047 Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.</p>

<p>13:012:001 Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.</p>

<p>13:012:002 They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bow, even of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.</p>

<p>13:012:003 The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite.</p>

<p>13:012:004 And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Josabad the Gederathite,</p>

<p>13:012:005 Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shephatiah the Haruphite,</p>

<p>13:012:006 Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Korhites,</p>

<p>13:012:007 And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.</p>

<p>13:012:008 And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;roes upon the mountains;</p>

<p>13:012:009 Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,</p>

<p>13:012:010 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,</p>

<p>13:012:011 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,</p>

<p>13:012:012 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,</p>

<p>13:012:013 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.</p>

<p>13:012:014 These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand.</p>

<p>13:012:015 These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;west.</p>

<p>13:012:016 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hold unto David.</p>

<p>13:012:017 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.</p>

<p>13:012:018 Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, and made them captains of the band.</p>

<p>13:012:019 And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of our heads.</p>

<p>13:012:020 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.</p>

<p>13:012:021 And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.</p>

<p>13:012:022 For at that time day by day there came to David to help him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until it was a great host, like the host of God.</p>

<p>13:012:023 And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.</p>

<p>13:012:024 The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.</p>

<p>13:012:025 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven thousand and one hundred.</p>

<p>13:012:026 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.</p>

<p>13:012:027 And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were three thousand and seven hundred;</p>

<p>13:012:028 And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house twenty and two captains.</p>

<p>13:012:029 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ward of the house of Saul.</p>

<p>13:012:030 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their fathers.</p>

<p>13:012:031 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were expressed by name, to come and make David king.</p>

<p>13:012:032 And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were at their commandment.</p>

<p>13:012:033 Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were not of double heart.</p>

<p>13:012:034 And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and spear thirty and seven thousand.</p>

<p>13:012:035 And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;six hundred.</p>

<p>13:012:036 And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forty thousand.</p>

<p>13:012:037 And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand.</p>

<p>13:012:038 All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David king.</p>

<p>13:012:039 And there they were with David three days, eating and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.</p>

<p>13:012:040 Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.</p>

<p>13:013:001 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundreds, and with every leader.</p>

<p>13:013:002 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves unto us:</p>

<p>13:013:003 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enquired not at it in the days of Saul.</p>

<p>13:013:004 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</p>

<p>13:013:005 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kirjathjearim.</p>

<p>13:013:006 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose name is called on it.</p>

<p>13:013:007 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.</p>

<p>13:013:008 And David and all Israel played before God with all their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</p>

<p>13:013:009 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.</p>

<p>13:013:010 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;died before God.</p>

<p>13:013:011 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day.</p>

<p>13:013:012 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bring the ark of God home to me?</p>

<p>13:013:013 So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gittite.</p>

<p>13:013:014 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obededom, and all that he had.</p>

<p>13:014:001 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.</p>

<p>13:014:002 And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people Israel.</p>

<p>13:014:003 And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sons and daughters.</p>

<p>13:014:004 Now these are the names of his children which he had in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,</p>

<p>13:014:005 And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,</p>

<p>13:014:006 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</p>

<p>13:014:007 And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.</p>

<p>13:014:008 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And David heard of it, and went out against them.</p>

<p>13:014:009 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Rephaim.</p>

<p>13:014:010 And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thine hand.</p>

<p>13:014:011 So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the name of that place Baalperazim.</p>

<p>13:014:012 And when they had left their gods there, David gave a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandment, and they were burned with fire.</p>

<p>13:014:013 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;valley.</p>

<p>13:014:014 Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over against the mulberry trees.</p>

<p>13:014:015 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Philistines.</p>

<p>13:014:016 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.</p>

<p>13:014:017 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought the fear of him upon all nations.</p>

<p>13:015:001 And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.</p>

<p>13:015:002 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, and to minister unto him for ever.</p>

<p>13:015:003 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for it.</p>

<p>13:015:004 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:</p>

<p>13:015:005 Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred and twenty:</p>

<p>13:015:006 Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred and twenty:</p>

<p>13:015:007 Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief and his brethren an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred and thirty:</p>

<p>13:015:008 Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two hundred:</p>

<p>13:015:009 Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fourscore:</p>

<p>13:015:010 Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an hundred and twelve.</p>

<p>13:015:011 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Amminadab,</p>

<p>13:015:012 And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place that I have prepared for it.</p>

<p>13:015:013 For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;order.</p>

<p>13:015:014 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.</p>

<p>13:015:015 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the word of the LORD.</p>

<p>13:015:016 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voice with joy.</p>

<p>13:015:017 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;</p>

<p>13:015:018 And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.</p>

<p>13:015:019 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sound with cymbals of brass;</p>

<p>13:015:020 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alamoth;</p>

<p>13:015:021 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.</p>

<p>13:015:022 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructed about the song, because he was skilful.</p>

<p>13:015:023 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.</p>

<p>13:015:024 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.</p>

<p>13:015:025 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.</p>

<p>13:015:026 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bullocks and seven rams.</p>

<p>13:015:027 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an ephod of linen.</p>

<p>13:015:028 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harps.</p>

<p>13:015:029 And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came to the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and she despised him in her heart.</p>

<p>13:016:001 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sacrifices and peace offerings before God.</p>

<p>13:016:002 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD.</p>

<p>13:016:003 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flagon of wine.</p>

<p>13:016:004 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD God of Israel:</p>

<p>13:016:005 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;</p>

<p>13:016:006 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continually before the ark of the covenant of God.</p>

<p>13:016:007 Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.</p>

<p>13:016:008 Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deeds among the people.</p>

<p>13:016:009 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wondrous works.</p>

<p>13:016:010 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seek the LORD.</p>

<p>13:016:011 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.</p>

<p>13:016:012 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the judgments of his mouth;</p>

<p>13:016:013 O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chosen ones.</p>

<p>13:016:014 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.</p>

<p>13:016:015 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commanded to a thousand generations;</p>

<p>13:016:016 Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oath unto Isaac;</p>

<p>13:016:017 And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for an everlasting covenant,</p>

<p>13:016:018 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your inheritance;</p>

<p>13:016:019 When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.</p>

<p>13:016:020 And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to another people;</p>

<p>13:016:021 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for their sakes,</p>

<p>13:016:022 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</p>

<p>13:016:023 Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his salvation.</p>

<p>13:016:024 Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among all nations.</p>

<p>13:016:025 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be feared above all gods.</p>

<p>13:016:026 For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the heavens.</p>

<p>13:016:027 Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are in his place.</p>

<p>13:016:028 Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD glory and strength.</p>

<p>13:016:029 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of holiness.</p>

<p>13:016:030 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stable, that it be not moved.</p>

<p>13:016:031 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.</p>

<p>13:016:032 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rejoice, and all that is therein.</p>

<p>13:016:033 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.</p>

<p>13:016:034 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endureth for ever.</p>

<p>13:016:035 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.</p>

<p>13:016:036 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.</p>

<p>13:016:037 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continually, as every day's work required:</p>

<p>13:016:038 And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters:</p>

<p>13:016:039 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,</p>

<p>13:016:040 To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he commanded Israel;</p>

<p>13:016:041 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever;</p>

<p>13:016:042 And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.</p>

<p>13:016:043 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returned to bless his house.</p>

<p>13:017:001 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;curtains.</p>

<p>13:017:002 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for God is with thee.</p>

<p>13:017:003 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Nathan, saying,</p>

<p>13:017:004 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not build me an house to dwell in:</p>

<p>13:017:005 For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from one tabernacle to another.</p>

<p>13:017:006 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?</p>

<p>13:017:007 Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people Israel:</p>

<p>13:017:008 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth.</p>

<p>13:017:009 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them any more, as at the beginning,</p>

<p>13:017:010 And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house.</p>

<p>13:017:011 And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his kingdom.</p>

<p>13:017:012 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever.</p>

<p>13:017:013 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before thee:</p>

<p>13:017:014 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.</p>

<p>13:017:015 According to all these words, and according to all this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>

<p>13:017:016 And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought me hitherto?</p>

<p>13:017:017 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high degree, O LORD God.</p>

<p>13:017:018 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</p>

<p>13:017:019 O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these great things.</p>

<p>13:017:020 O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ears.</p>

<p>13:017:021 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</p>

<p>13:017:022 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.</p>

<p>13:017:023 Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for ever, and do as thou hast said.</p>

<p>13:017:024 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;established before thee.</p>

<p>13:017:025 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pray before thee.</p>

<p>13:017:026 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto thy servant:</p>

<p>13:017:027 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.</p>

<p>13:018:001 Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the hand of the Philistines.</p>

<p>13:018:002 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and brought gifts.</p>

<p>13:018:003 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.</p>

<p>13:018:004 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred chariots.</p>

<p>13:018:005 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men.</p>

<p>13:018:006 Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>

<p>13:018:007 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>13:018:008 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</p>

<p>13:018:009 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;</p>

<p>13:018:010 He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silver and brass.</p>

<p>13:018:011 Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Philistines, and from Amalek.</p>

<p>13:018:012 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the valley of salt eighteen thousand.</p>

<p>13:018:013 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he went.</p>

<p>13:018:014 So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;justice among all his people.</p>

<p>13:018:015 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Ahilud, recorder.</p>

<p>13:018:016 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;</p>

<p>13:018:017 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king.</p>

<p>13:019:001 Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>13:019:002 And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Hanun, to comfort him.</p>

<p>13:019:003 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?</p>

<p>13:019:004 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sent them away.</p>

<p>13:019:005 Then there went certain, and told David how the men were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be grown, and then return.</p>

<p>13:019:006 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Zobah.</p>

<p>13:019:007 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their cities, and came to battle.</p>

<p>13:019:008 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mighty men.</p>

<p>13:019:009 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come were by themselves in the field.</p>

<p>13:019:010 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them in array against the Syrians.</p>

<p>13:019:011 And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the children of Ammon.</p>

<p>13:019:012 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, then I will help thee.</p>

<p>13:019:013 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that which is good in his sight.</p>

<p>13:019:014 So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.</p>

<p>13:019:015 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>13:019:016 And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the host of Hadarezer went before them.</p>

<p>13:019:017 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against them. So when David had put the battle in array<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the Syrians, they fought with him.</p>

<p>13:019:018 But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.</p>

<p>13:019:019 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of Ammon any more.</p>

<p>13:020:001 And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.</p>

<p>13:020:002 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also exceeding much spoil out of the city.</p>

<p>13:020:003 And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>13:020:004 And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were subdued.</p>

<p>13:020:005 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.</p>

<p>13:020:006 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;giant.</p>

<p>13:020:007 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother slew him.</p>

<p>13:020:008 These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</p>

<p>13:021:001 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number Israel.</p>

<p>13:021:002 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of them to me, that I may know it.</p>

<p>13:021:003 And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?</p>

<p>13:021:004 Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem.</p>

<p>13:021:005 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.</p>

<p>13:021:006 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king's word was abominable to Joab.</p>

<p>13:021:007 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel.</p>

<p>13:021:008 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</p>

<p>13:021:009 And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,</p>

<p>13:021:010 Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee.</p>

<p>13:021:011 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose thee</p>

<p>13:021:012 Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>13:021:013 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but let me not fall into the hand of man.</p>

<p>13:021:014 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel seventy thousand men.</p>

<p>13:021:015 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>

<p>13:021:016 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their faces.</p>

<p>13:021:017 And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.</p>

<p>13:021:018 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>

<p>13:021:019 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name of the LORD.</p>

<p>13:021:020 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</p>

<p>13:021:021 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with his face to the ground.</p>

<p>13:021:022 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plague may be stayed from the people.</p>

<p>13:021:023 And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give it all.</p>

<p>13:021:024 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</p>

<p>13:021:025 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gold by weight.</p>

<p>13:021:026 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burnt offering.</p>

<p>13:021:027 And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again into the sheath thereof.</p>

<p>13:021:028 At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there.</p>

<p>13:021:029 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;season in the high place at Gibeon.</p>

<p>13:021:030 But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</p>

<p>13:022:001 Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.</p>

<p>13:022:002 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to build the house of God.</p>

<p>13:022:003 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abundance without weight;</p>

<p>13:022:004 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.</p>

<p>13:022:005 And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abundantly before his death.</p>

<p>13:022:006 Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an house for the LORD God of Israel.</p>

<p>13:022:007 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:</p>

<p>13:022:008 But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon the earth in my sight.</p>

<p>13:022:009 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and quietness unto Israel in his days.</p>

<p>13:022:010 He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his kingdom over Israel for ever.</p>

<p>13:022:011 Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.</p>

<p>13:022:012 Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the LORD thy God.</p>

<p>13:022:013 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor be dismayed.</p>

<p>13:022:014 Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.</p>

<p>13:022:015 Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every manner of work.</p>

<p>13:022:016 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee.</p>

<p>13:022:017 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his son, saying,</p>

<p>13:022:018 Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and before his people.</p>

<p>13:022:019 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the LORD.</p>

<p>13:023:001 So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son king over Israel.</p>

<p>13:023:002 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priests and the Levites.</p>

<p>13:023:003 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thirty and eight thousand.</p>

<p>13:023:004 Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and judges:</p>

<p>13:023:005 Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;praise therewith.</p>

<p>13:023:006 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p>

<p>13:023:007 Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.</p>

<p>13:023:008 The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joel, three.</p>

<p>13:023:009 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.</p>

<p>13:023:010 And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.</p>

<p>13:023:011 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reckoning, according to their father's house.</p>

<p>13:023:012 The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.</p>

<p>13:023:013 The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, and to bless in his name for ever.</p>

<p>13:023:014 Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tribe of Levi.</p>

<p>13:023:015 The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.</p>

<p>13:023:016 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.</p>

<p>13:023:017 And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.</p>

<p>13:023:018 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.</p>

<p>13:023:019 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.</p>

<p>13:023:020 Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.</p>

<p>13:023:021 The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eleazar, and Kish.</p>

<p>13:023:022 And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brethren the sons of Kish took them.</p>

<p>13:023:023 The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.</p>

<p>13:023:024 These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upward.</p>

<p>13:023:025 For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:</p>

<p>13:023:026 And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.</p>

<p>13:023:027 For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twenty years old and above:</p>

<p>13:023:028 Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work of the service of the house of God;</p>

<p>13:023:029 Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manner of measure and size;</p>

<p>13:023:030 And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likewise at even:</p>

<p>13:023:031 And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the order commanded unto them, continually before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD:</p>

<p>13:023:032 And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house of the LORD.</p>

<p>13:024:001 Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>

<p>13:024:002 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;office.</p>

<p>13:024:003 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offices in their service.</p>

<p>13:024:004 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the house of their fathers.</p>

<p>13:024:005 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.</p>

<p>13:024:006 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Ithamar.</p>

<p>13:024:007 Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jedaiah,</p>

<p>13:024:008 The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,</p>

<p>13:024:009 The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,</p>

<p>13:024:010 The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,</p>

<p>13:024:011 The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to Shecaniah,</p>

<p>13:024:012 The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,</p>

<p>13:024:013 The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,</p>

<p>13:024:014 The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,</p>

<p>13:024:015 The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses,</p>

<p>13:024:016 The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel,</p>

<p>13:024:017 The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gamul,</p>

<p>13:024:018 The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maaziah.</p>

<p>13:024:019 These were the orderings of them in their service to come into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.</p>

<p>13:024:025 The brother of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah;<br>

<p>13:024:026 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beno.</p>

<p>13:024:027 The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Ibri.</p>

<p>13:024:028 Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.</p>

<p>13:024:029 Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.</p>

<p>13:024:030 The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.</p>

<p>13:024:031 These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brethren.</p>

<p>13:025:001 Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahazioth:</p>

<p>13:025:005 All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sons and three daughters.</p>

<p>13:025:006 All these were under the hands of their father for song in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the service of the house of God, according to the king's order<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.</p>

<p>13:025:007 So the number of them, with their brethren that were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight.</p>

<p>13:025:008 And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;captains of the host, had dedicated.</p>

<p>13:026:027 Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the house of the LORD.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Gilead.</p>

<p>13:026:032 And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.</p>

<p>13:027:001 Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their officers that served the king in any matter of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;four thousand.</p>

<p>13:027:002 Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shephatiah the son of Maachah:</p>

<p>13:027:017 Of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of the Aaronites,<br>

<p>13:027:022 Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tribes of Israel.</p>

<p>13:027:023 But David took not the number of them from twenty years old<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like to the stars of the heavens.</p>

<p>13:027:024 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.</p>

<p>13:027:025 And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the villages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uzziah:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:</p>

<p>13:027:027 And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the<br>

<p>13:027:029 And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shaphat the son of Adlai:</p>

<p>13:027:030 Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite:</p>

<p>13:027:031 And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite. All these were the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rulers of the substance which was king David's.</p>

<p>13:027:032 Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sons:</p>

<p>13:027:033 And Ahithophel was the king's counsellor: and Hushai the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archite was the king's companion:</p>

<p>13:027:034 And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abiathar: and the general of the king's army was Joab.</p>

<p>13:028:001 And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;valiant men, unto Jerusalem.</p>

<p>13:028:002 Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the building:</p>

<p>13:028:003 But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blood.</p>

<p>13:028:004 Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me to make me king over all Israel:</p>

<p>13:028:005 And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom of the LORD over Israel.</p>

<p>13:028:006 And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be his father.</p>

<p>13:028:007 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day.</p>

<p>13:028:008 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children after you for ever.</p>

<p>13:028:009 And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for ever.</p>

<p>13:028:010 Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.</p>

<p>13:028:011 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,</p>

<p>13:028:012 And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;treasuries of the dedicated things:</p>

<p>13:028:013 Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.</p>

<p>13:028:014 He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kind of service:</p>

<p>13:028:015 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the use of every candlestick.</p>

<p>13:028:016 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:</p>

<p>13:028:017 Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silver:</p>

<p>13:028:018 And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD.</p>

<p>13:028:019 All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.</p>

<p>13:028:020 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the service of the house of the LORD.</p>

<p>13:028:021 And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy commandment.</p>

<p>13:029:001 Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but for the LORD God.</p>

<p>13:029:002 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in abundance.</p>

<p>13:029:003 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have prepared for the holy house.</p>

<p>13:029:004 Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the houses withal:</p>

<p>13:029:005 The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this day unto the LORD?</p>

<p>13:029:006 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,</p>

<p>13:029:007 And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one hundred thousand talents of iron.</p>

<p>13:029:008 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gershonite.</p>

<p>13:029:009 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</p>

<p>13:029:010 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father, for ever and ever.</p>

<p>13:029:011 Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.</p>

<p>13:029:012 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.</p>

<p>13:029:013 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name.</p>

<p>13:029:014 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</p>

<p>13:029:015 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is none abiding.</p>

<p>13:029:016 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all thine own.</p>

<p>13:029:017 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;willingly unto thee.</p>

<p>13:029:018 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:</p>

<p>13:029:019 And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made provision.</p>

<p>13:029:020 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD, and the king.</p>

<p>13:029:021 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all Israel:</p>

<p>13:029:022 And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;governor, and Zadok to be priest.</p>

<p>13:029:023 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</p>

<p>13:029:024 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king.</p>

<p>13:029:025 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been on any king before him in Israel.</p>

<p>13:029:026 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</p>

<p>13:029:027 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reigned he in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>13:029:028 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>13:029:029 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,</p>

<p>13:029:030 With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;countries.</p>
