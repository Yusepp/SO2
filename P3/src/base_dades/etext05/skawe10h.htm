<p>We are in the early stages of what promises to be an extended
debate about the future of conflict and the future of our defense
establishment. Few will deny that the winds of change are blowing
as never before, driven by a radically altered geopolitical
situation, an evolving information-oriented society, advancing
technology, and budgetary constraints. How our nation responds to
the challenge of change will determine our ability to shape the
future and defend ourselves against 21st century threats. The
major issue, however it may be manifested, involves the degree of
change that is required. Advocates, all along the spectrum from a
military technical revolution to a revolution in military affairs
to a revolution in security affairs, are making their cases.
Military institutions are by their very nature somewhat
conservative. History has shown that success has often sown the
seeds of future failure. We as a nation can ill afford to follow
in the footsteps of those who have rested on their laurels and
failed to stretch their imaginations.</p>

<p>Often, those who are the most knowledgeable and experienced
about a subject are not in the most advantageous position to
understand a new world order. Yet these same individuals are
often among the most credible voices and therefore are essential
to progress. The authors of <em>Shock and Awe</em> are a highly
accomplished and distinguished group with the credibility that
comes from years of front line experience. Thus, this work is
important not only because of the ideas contained within, but
because of the caliber and credibility of the authors.</p>

<p>ACTIS seeks to articulate and explore advanced concepts. In
sponsoring this work and in disseminating its initial results, we
hope to contribute to the ongoing dialogue about alternatives,
their promises, and their risks. As the authors note, this is a
work in progress meant not to provide definitive solutions but a
proposed perspective for considering future security needs and
strategies. To the extent that vigorous debate ensues we will be
successful.</p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="prologue"></a>Prologue</h1>

<p>The purpose of this paper is to explore alternative concepts
for structuring mission capability packages (MCPs) around which
future U. S. military forces might be configured. From the very
outset of this study group's deliberations, we agreed that the
most useful contribution we could make would be to attempt to
reach beyond what we saw as the current and commendable efforts,
largely but not entirely within the Department of Defense, to
define concepts for strategy, doctrine, operations, and force
structure to deal with a highly uncertain future. In approaching
this endeavor, we fully recognized the inherent and actual limits
and difficulties in attempting to reach beyond what may prove to
be the full extent of our grasp.</p>

<p>It is, of course, clear that U.S. military forces are
currently the most capable in the world and are likely to remain
so for a long time to come. Why then, many will ask, should we
examine and even propose major excursions and changes if the
country occupies this position of military superiority? For
reasons noted in this study, we believe that excursions are
important if only to confirm the validity of current defense
approaches. There are several overrarching realities that have
led us to this conclusion. First, while everyone recognizes that
the Cold War has ended, there is not a consensus about what this
means for more precisely defining the nature of our future
security needs. Despite this absence of both clairvoyance and a
galvanizing external danger, the United States is actively
examining new strategic options and choices. The variety of
conceptual efforts underway in the Pentagon to deal with this
uncertainty exemplifies this reality.</p>

<p>At the same time, the current dominance and superiority of
American military power, unencumbered by the danger of an
external peer competitor, have created a period of strategic
advantage during which we have the luxury of time, perhaps
measured in many years, to re-examine with a margin of safety our
defense posture. On the other hand, potential adversaries cannot
be expected to ignore this predominant military capability of the
United States and fail to try to exploit, bypass, or counter it.
In other words, faced with American military superiority in
ships, tanks, aircraft, weapons and, most importantly, in
competent fighting personnel, potential adversaries may try to
change the terms of future conflict and make as irrelevant as
possible these current U.S. advantages. We proceed at our own
risk if we dismiss this possibility.</p>

<p>Second, it is relatively clear that current U.S. military
capability will shrink. Despite the pledges of the two major
American political parties to maintain or expand the current
level of defense capability, both the force structure and defense
infrastructure are too large to be maintained at even the present
levels and within the defense budgets that are likely to be
approved. Unless a new menace materializes, defense is headed for
"less of the same." Such reductions may have no strategic
consequences. However, that is an outcome that we believe should
not be left to chance.</p>

<p>This shrinkage also means that the Pentagon's good faith
strategic reviews aimed at dealing with our future security needs
may be caught up in the defense budget debate over downsizing and
could too easily drift into becoming advocacy or marketing
documents. As the services are forced into more jealously
guarding a declining force structure, the tendency to
"stove-pipe" and compartmentalize technology and special programs
is likely to increase, thereby complicating the problem of making
full use of our extraordinary technological resources. This means
that some external thinking, removed from the bureaucratic
pressures and demands, may be essential to stimulating and
sustaining innovation.</p>

<p>Third, the American commercial-industrial base is undergoing
profound change propelled largely by the entrepreneurial nature
of the free enterprise system and the American personality.
Whether in information or materials-related technology or for
that matter in other areas too numerous to count, the nature of
competition is driving both product breadth and improvement at
rates perhaps unthinkable a decade ago. One sign of these trends
is the reality that virtually all new jobs in this country are
being created by small business. In the areas of commercial
information and related management information systems, these
changes are extraordinary and were probably unpredictable even a
few years ago.</p>

<p>On the so-called information highway, performance is
increasing dramatically and quickly while price, cost, and the
time to bring to market new generation technology are
diminishing. These positive trends are not matched yet in the
defense-industrial base. One consequence of this broad commercial
transformation is that any future set of defense choices may be
inexorably linked to and dependent on this profound, ongoing
change in the commercial sector and in learning to harness
private sector advances in technology-related products. It must
also be understood that only the United States among all states
and nations has the vastness and breadth of resources and
commercial capability to undertake the full exploitation of this
revolutionary potential.</p>

<p>Finally, it is clear that U.S. forces are engaged and deployed
worldwide, often at operating tempos as high as or higher than
during the Cold War. These demands will continue and the
diversity of assigned tasks is unlikely to contract. These forces
must be properly manned, equipped, and trained and must carry out
their missions to standards that are both high and expected by
the nation's leaders and its public. The matter of maintaining
this capability while attempting to reshape the force for a
changing future is a major and daunting challenge not to be
underestimated.</p>

<p>These structural realities are exciting and offer a major
opportunity for real revolution and change if we are able and
daring enough to exploit them. This, in turn, has led us to
develop the concept of Rapid Dominance and its attendant focus on
Shock and Awe. Rapid Dominance seeks to integrate these
multifaceted realities and facts and apply them to the common
defense at a time when uncertainty about the future is perhaps
one of the few givens. We believe the principles and ideas
underlying this concept are sufficiently compelling and different
enough from current American defense doctrine encapsulated by
"overwhelming or decisive force," "dominant battlefield
awareness," and "dominant maneuver" to warrant closer
examination.</p>

<p>Since before Sun Tzu and the earliest chroniclers of war
recorded their observations, strategists and generals have been
tantalized and confounded by the elusive goal of destroying the
adversary's will to resist before, during, and after battle.
Today, we believe that an unusual opportunity exists to determine
whether or not this long-sought strategic goal of affecting the
will, understanding, and perception of an adversary can be
brought closer to fruition. Even if this task cannot be
accomplished, we believe that, at the very minimum, such an
effort will enhance and improve the ability of our military
forces to carry out their missions more successfully through
identifying and reinforcing particular points of leverage in the
conflict and by identifying and creating additional options and
choices for employing our forces more effectively.</p>

<p>Perhaps for the first time in years, the confluence of
strategy, technology, and the genuine quest for innovation has
the potential for revolutionary change. We envisage Rapid
Dominance as the possible military expression, vanguard, and
extension of this potential for revolutionary change. The
strategic centers of gravity on which Rapid Dominance
concentrates, modified by the uniquely American ability to
integrate all this, are these junctures of strategy, technology,
and innovation which are focused on the goal of affecting and
shaping the will of the adversary. The goal of Rapid Dominance
will be to destroy or so confound the will to resist that an
adversary will have no alternative except to accept our strategic
aims and military objectives. To achieve this outcome, Rapid
Dominance must control the operational environment and through
that dominance, control what the adversary perceives,
understands, and knows, as well as control or regulate what is
not perceived, understood, or known.</p>

<p>In Rapid Dominance, it is an absolutely necessary and vital
condition to be able to defeat, disarm, or neutralize an
adversary's military power. We still must maintain the capacity
for the physical and forceful occupation of territory should
there prove to be no alternative to deploying sufficient numbers
of personnel and equipment on the ground to accomplish that
objective. Should this goal of applying our resources to
controlling, affecting, and breaking the will of an adversary to
resist remain elusive, we believe that Rapid Dominance can still
provide a variety of options and choices for dealing with the
operational demands of war and conflict.</p>

<p>To affect the will of the adversary, Rapid Dominance will
apply a variety of approaches and techniques to achieve the
necessary level of Shock and Awe at the appropriate strategic and
military leverage points. This means that psychological and
intangible, as well as physical and concrete effects beyond the
destruction of enemy forces and supporting military
infrastructure, will have to be achieved. It is in this broader
and deeper strategic application that Rapid Dominance perhaps
most fundamentally differentiates itself from current doctrine
and offers revolutionary application.</p>

<p>Flowing from the primary concentration on affecting the
adversary's will to resist through imposing a regime of Shock and
Awe to achieve strategic aims and military objectives, four
characteristics emerge that will define the Rapid Dominance
military force. These are noted and discussed in later chapters.
The four characteristics are near total or absolute knowledge and
understanding of self, adversary, and environment; rapidity and
timeliness in application; operational brilliance in execution;
and (near) total control and signature management of the entire
operational environment.</p>

<p>Whereas decisive force is inherently capabilities driven-that
is, it focuses on defeating the military capability of an
adversary and therefore tends to be scenario sensitive-Rapid
Dominance would seek to be more universal in application through
the overriding objective of affecting the adversary's will beyond
the boundaries traditionally defined by military capability
alone. In other words, where decisive force is likely to be most
relevant is against conventional military capabilities that can
be overwhelmed by American (and allied) military superiority. In
conflict or crisis conditions that depart from this idealized
scenario, the superior nature of our forces is assumed to be
sufficiently broad to prevail. Rapid Dominance would not make
this distinction in either theory or in practice.</p>

<p><em>We note for the record that should a Rapid Dominance force
actually be fielded with the requisite operational capabilities,
this force would be neither a silver bullet nor a panacea and
certainly not an antidote or preventative for a major policy
blunder, miscalculation, or mistake. It should also be fully
appreciated that situations will exist in which Rapid Dominance
(or any other doctrine) may not work or apply because of
political, strategic, or other limiting factors.</em></p>

<p>We realize some will criticize our focus on affecting an
adversary's will, perception, and understanding through Shock and
Awe on the grounds that this idea is not new and that such an
outcome may not be physically achievable or politically
desirable. On the first point, we believe the use of basic
principles of strategy can stand us in good stead even and
perhaps especially in the modern era when adversaries may not
elect to fight the United States along traditional or expected
lines. On whether this ability can and should be achieved, we
believe that question should be part of a broader
examination.</p>

<p>Finally, we argue that what is also new in this approach is
the way in which we attempt to integrate far more broadly
strategy, technology, and innovation to achieve Shock and Awe. It
is this interaction and focus which we think will provide the
most interesting results.</p>

<p>For these and other reasons, we have embarked on an ambitious
intellectual excursion in making a preliminary definition of
Rapid Dominance. For the moment, we view Rapid Dominance in the
formation stage and not as a final product. Over the next months,
we believe further steps should be taken to refine Rapid
Dominance and to develop "paper" systems and force designs that
will add crucial specificity to this concept. Then, this Rapid
Dominance force can be assessed against five sets of
questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, assuming that a Rapid Dominance force can be fielded
with the appropriate capabilities of Shock and Awe to affect and
shape the adversary's will, how would this force compare with and
improve on our ability to fight, win, and deal with a major
regional contingency (MRC)?</li>

<li>Second, what utility, if any, does Rapid Dominance and its
application of Shock and Awe imply for Operations Other Than War
(OOTW)? Where might Rapid Dominance apply in OOTW, where would it
not, and where might it offer mixed benefits?</li>

<li>Third, what are the political implications of Rapid Dominance
in both broad and specific applications and could this lead to a
form of political deterrence to underwrite future U.S. policy?
Would this political deterrence prove acceptable to allies and to
our own public?</li>

<li>Fourth, what might Rapid Dominance mean for alliances,
coalitions, and the conduct of allied and combined
operations?</li>

<li>Finally, what are the consequences of Rapid Dominance on
defense resource investment priorities and future budgets?</li>
</ul>

<p>From this examination and experimentation, we believe useful
results will flow.</p>

<p>We also would like to acknowledge the support and role of the
National Defense University in sponsoring this first effort. In
particular, we owe a huge debt of gratitude to Dr. David Alberts
of NDU whose intelligence, enthusiasm, and wisdom, as well as his
full support, have been invaluable and without which this project
would have been far less productive.</p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="intro"></a>Introduction to Rapid
Dominance</h1>

<p>The military posture and capability of the United States of
America are, today, dominant. Simply put, there is no external
adversary in the world that can successfully challenge the
extraordinary power of the American military in either regional
conflict or in "conventional" war as we know it once the United
States makes the commitment to take whatever action may be
needed. To be sure, the first phase of a crisis may be the most
difficult-if an aggressor has attacked and U.S. forces are not in
place. However, it will still be years, if not decades, before
potential adversaries will be able to deploy systems with a full
panoply of capabilities that are equivalent to or better than the
aggregate strength of the ships, aircraft, armored vehicles, and
weapons systems in our inventory. Even if an adversary could
deploy similar systems, then matching and overcoming the superb
training and preparation of American service personnel would
still be a daunting task.</p>

<p>Given this reality that our military dominance can and will
extend for some considerable time to come, provided we are
prepared to use it, why then is a re-examination of American
defense posture and doctrine important? The answers to this
question involve (1) the changing nature of the domestic and
international environments; (2) the complex nature of resolving
inter and intra-state conflict that falls outside conventional
war, including peacekeeping, and countering terrorism, crime, and
the use of weapons of mass destruction; (3) resource constraints;
(4) defense infrastructure and technical industrial bases raised
on a large, continuous infusion of funding now facing a future of
austerity; and (5) the vast uncertainties of the so-called
social, economic, and information revolutions that could check or
counter many of the nation's assumptions as well as public
support currently underwriting defense.</p>

<p>It is clear that these so-called grey areas involving
non-traditional Operations Other Than War (OOTW) and law
enforcement tasks are growing and pose difficult problems and
challenges to American military forces, especially when and where
the use of force may be inappropriate or simply may not work. The
expansion of the role of UN forces to nation-building in Somalia
and its subsequent failure comes to mind as an example of this
danger. It is also arguable that the formidable nature and huge
technological lead of American military capability could induce
an adversary to move to a strategy that attempted to circumvent
all this fighting power through other clever or agile means. The
Vietnam War is a grim reminder of the political nature of
conflict and how our power was once outflanked. Training, morale,
and readiness to fight are perishable commodities requiring both
a generous expenditure of resources and careful nurturing.</p>

<p>Thus, the greatest constraints today to retaining the most
dominant military force in the world, paradoxically, may be in
overcoming the inertia of this success. We may be our own worst
enemy.</p>

<p>During the Cold War when the danger was clear, the defense
debate was often fought over how to balance the so-called
"strategy-force structure-budget" formula. Today, that formula
has expanded to include "threat, strategy, force structure,
budget, and infrastructure." Without a "clear and present danger"
such as the Axis Powers in 1941 or, later, the Soviet Union to
coalesce public agreement on the threat, it is difficult to
construct a supporting strategy that can be effective either in
setting priorities or objectives. Hence, today's "two war" or two
nearly simultaneous Major Regional Contingency (MRC) strategy has
been criticized as strategically and financially excessive. As
noted by administration officials, the current force structure
does not meet the demands of the "two war," MRC strategy and, in
any event, the budget will not support the planned force
structure. Finally, it is widely recognized that the United
States possesses far more infrastructure such as bases and
facilities than it needs to support the current force, thereby
draining scarce resources away from fighting power. As a result,
there is a substantial defense imbalance that will erode fighting
power.</p>

<p>In designing its defense posture, the United States has
adopted the doctrine of employing "decisive or overwhelming
force." This doctrine reinforces American advantages in strategic
mobility, prepositioning, technology, training, and in fielding
integrated military systems to provide and retain superiority,
and responds to the minimum casualty and collateral damage
criteria set first in the Reagan Administration. The Revolution
in Military Affairs or RMA is cited as the phenomenon or process
by which the United States continues to exploit technology to
maintain this decisive force advantage, particularly in terms of
achieving "dominant battlefield awareness." Through this
awareness, the United States should be able to obtain perfect or
near perfect information on virtually all technical aspects of
the battlefield and therefore be able to defeat or destroy an
adversary more effectively, with fewer losses to ourselves and
with a range of capabilities from long-range precision strike to
more effective close-in weapons.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further, an example is useful to focus some
of the as yet unknowable consequences of these broader realities,
changes, and trends. The deployment of American forces to Bosnia
is a reaction to and representation of major shifts occurring in
the post-Cold War world. With these shifts, this deployment is
suggestive of what may lie ahead for the use, relevance, and
design of military force. The legacy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
and then, the start of the Cold War, caused the West to adopt
policies for containing and deterring the broad threat posed by
the Soviet Union and its ideology. Thermonuclear weapons,
complemented over time by strong conventional forces, threatened
societal damage to Russia. Conventional forces backed by tactical
nuclear weapons were later required, in part, to halt a massive
Soviet ground attack in Europe and, in part, to provide an
alternative to (immediate) use of nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Today, the First Armored Division, the principal American unit
serving in Bosnia is, in essence, the same force that fought so
well in <em>Desert Storm</em> and, for the bulk of the Cold War
along with our other units, had been designed to defend NATO
against and then defeat a numerically superior, armored and
mechanized Soviet adversary advancing across the plains of
Germany. Now these troops, as well as others from both sides of
the former Iron Curtain, are engaged in OOTW for which special
training, rules of engagement, command arrangements, and other
support structures have been put in place at short notice, few of
which were even envisaged a few years ago. These are also
operations that, because of intense, instantaneous media
coverage, can have huge domestic political impact especially if
events go wrong.</p>

<p>Whether or not this armored division is the most optimally
configured force for such an operation is not relevant for the
moment even though this unit probably was the most appropriate
for this task. However, it is prudent to examine the consequences
of changing tasks presaged by Bosnia, in which the enemy is
instability rather than an ideological or regional adversary we
are trying to contain or defeat and neutrality on our part may be
vital to the success of the mission. Do these changes mean that
we should alter our traditional approach to the doctrine for and
design of forces? If so, how? Are there alternative or more
effective ways and means to conduct these peacekeeping-related
operations? And, in this evaluation, are there alternative
doctrines we should consider to fight wars more effectively as we
envisage scenarios under the construct of the MRC?</p>

<p>With the end of the USSR and absent a hostile Russian
superpower, there is no external threat to the existence or
survival of the United States as a nation and there will not be
such an immediate threat for some time to come. This means that
there is a finite window of opportunity when there is no external
adversary threatening the total existence of American society;
that our forces are far superior to any possible military
adversary choosing to confront us directly; and that, with
innovative thought, we may be able to create a more relevant,
effective, and efficient means to ensure for the common defense
at the likely levels of future spending.</p>

<p>At the same time that the Bosnia operation is underway, the
fundamental changes occurring at home and abroad must be
addressed. The industrial and technical base of the United States
is changing profoundly. The entrepreneurial and technical
advantages of the American economy were never greater and it is
small business that is creating virtually all new jobs and
employment opportunities. Commercial technology and products are
turning over on ever shortening cycles. Performance, especially
in high-technology products, is improving and costs are being
driven downwards.</p>

<p>Sadly, the opposite trends are still found in the defense
sector, where cost is high and will create even tougher choices
among competing programs, especially as the budget shrinks. Cycle
time to field new generation capabilities is lengthening and
performance, especially in computer and information systems, is
often obsolete on delivery. The defense industrial base will
continue to compress and it is not clear that the necessary level
of efficiencies or increases in effectiveness in using this base
can be identified and implemented, suggesting further pressures
on a defense budget that is only likely to be cut.</p>

<p>Indeed, the question must be carefully examined of whether the
military platforms that served us so well in both cold and hot
wars such as tanks, fixed wing aircraft, and large surface ships
and submarines represent the most effective mix of numbers,
technology, strategic mobility, and fighting capability. Our
national preference for "attrition" and "force on forces" warfare
continues to shape the way we design and rationalize our military
capability. Therefore, it is no surprise that in dealing with the
MRC, American doctrine, in some ways, remains an extension of
Cold War force planning. While the magnitude and number of
dangerous threats to the nation have been remarkably reduced by
the demise of the USSR, we continue to use technology to fill
traditional missions better rather than to identify or produce
new and more effective solutions for achieving military and
strategic/political objectives.</p>

<p>While there is much talk about "military revolutions" and
winning the "information war," what is generally meant in this
lexicon and discussion is translated into defense programs that
relate to accessing and "fusing" information across command,
control, intelligence, surveillance, target identification, and
precision strike technologies. What is most exciting among these
revolutions is the potential to achieve "dominant battlefield
awareness," that is, achieving the capability to have
near-perfect knowledge and information of the battlefield while
depriving the adversary of that capacity and producing "systems
of systems" for this purpose.</p>

<p>The near and mid-term aims of these "revolutions" largely
remain directed at exploiting our advantages in firepower and on
fielding more effective ways of defeating an adversary's weapons
systems and infrastructure for using those systems. The doctrine
of "decisive or overwhelming force" is the conceptual and
operational underpinning for winning the next war based largely
on this force-on-force and attrition model, and winning the
information war is vital to this end. Few have asked whether the
pattern of employing more modern technology for traditional
firepower solutions is the best one and if there are alternative
ways to achieve military objectives more effectively and
efficiently. In other words, can the idea of dominant battlefield
awareness be expanded doctrinally, operationally, and in terms of
fixing on alternative military, political, or strategic
objectives?</p>

<p>Rapid Dominance, if realized as defined in this paper, would
advance the military revolution to new levels and possibly new
dimensions. Rapid Dominance extends across the entire "threat,
strategy, force structure, budget, infrastructure" formula with
broad implications for how we provide for the future common
defense. Organization and management of defense and defense
resources should not be excluded from this examination although,
in this paper, they are not discussed in detail.</p>

<p>The aim of Rapid Dominance is to affect the will, perception,
and understanding of the adversary to fit or respond to our
strategic policy ends through imposing a regime of Shock and Awe.
Clearly, the traditional military aim of destroying, defeating,
or neutralizing the adversary's military capability is a
fundamental and necessary component of Rapid Dominance. Our
intent, however, is to field a range of capabilities to induce
sufficient Shock and Awe to render the adversary impotent. This
means that physical and psychological effects must be
obtained.</p>

<p>Rapid Dominance would therefore provide the ability to
control, on an immediate basis, the entire region of operational
interest and the environment, broadly defined, in and around that
area of interest. Beyond achieving decisive force and dominant
battlefield awareness, we envisage Rapid Dominance producing a
capability that can more effectively and efficiently achieve the
stated political or military objectives underwriting the use of
force by rendering the adversary completely impotent.</p>

<p>In Rapid Dominance, "rapid" means the ability to move quickly
before an adversary can react. This notion of rapidity applies
throughout the spectrum of combat from pre-conflict deployment to
all stages of battle and conflict resolution.</p>

<p>"Dominance" means the ability to affect and dominate an
adversary's will both physically and psychologically. Physical
dominance includes the ability to destroy, disarm, disrupt,
neutralize, and to render impotent. Psychological dominance means
the ability to destroy, defeat, and neuter the will of an
adversary to resist; or convince the adversary to accept our
terms and aims short of using force. The target is the
adversary's will, perception, and understanding. The principal
mechanism for achieving this dominance is through imposing
sufficient conditions of "Shock and Awe" on the adversary to
convince or compel it to accept our strategic aims and military
objectives. Clearly, deception, confusion, misinformation, and
disinformation, perhaps in massive amounts, must be employed.</p>

<p>The key objective of Rapid Dominance is to impose this
overwhelming level of Shock and Awe against an adversary on an
immediate or sufficiently timely basis to paralyze its will to
carry on. In crude terms, Rapid Dominance would seize control of
the environment and paralyze or so overload an adversary's
perceptions and understanding of events that the enemy would be
incapable of resistance at tactical and strategic levels. An
adversary would be rendered totally impotent and vulnerable to
our actions. To the degree that non-lethal weaponry is useful, it
would be incorporated in the ability to Shock and Awe and achieve
Rapid Dominance.</p>

<p>Theoretically, the magnitude of Shock and Awe Rapid Dominance
seeks to impose (in extreme cases) is the non-nuclear equivalent
of the impact that the atomic weapons dropped on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki had on the Japanese. The Japanese were prepared for
suicidal resistance until both nuclear bombs were used. The
impact of those weapons was sufficient to transform both the
mindset of the average Japanese citizen and the outlook of the
leadership through this condition of Shock and Awe. The Japanese
simply could not comprehend the destructive power carried by a
single airplane. This incomprehension produced a state of
awe.</p>

<p>We believe that, in a parallel manner, revolutionary potential
in combining new doctrine and existing technology can produce
systems capable of yielding this level of Shock and Awe. In most
or many cases, this Shock and Awe may not necessitate imposing
the full destruction of either nuclear weapons or advanced
conventional technologies but must be underwritten by the ability
to do so.</p>

<p>Achieving Rapid Dominance by virtue of applying Shock and Awe
at the appropriate level or levels is the next step in the
evolution of a doctrine for replacing or complementing
overwhelming force. By way of comparison, we have summarized how
we view the differences between the doctrines of Rapid Dominance
and Decisive Force in terms of basic elements that apply to the
objectives, uses of force, force size, scope, speed, casualties,
and technique. We recognize that there will be debate over the
relative utility and applicability of these doctrines and readers
are encouraged to participate.</p>

<p>In considering the differences between the concepts of Rapid
Dominance and Decisive Force, it is important to define the terms
as precisely as possible.</p>

<p>The goals of achieving Rapid Dominance using Shock and Awe
must be compared with overwhelming force. "Rapid" implies the
ability to "own" the dimension of time-moving more quickly than
an opponent, operating within his decision cycle, and resolving
conflict favorably in a short period of time. "Dominance" means
the ability to control a situation totally.</p>

<p>Rapid Dominance must be all-encompassing. It will require the
means to anticipate and to counter all opposing moves. It will
involve the capability to deny an opponent things of critical
value, and to convey the unmistakable message that unconditional
compliance is the only available recourse. It will imply more
than the direct application of force. It will mean the ability to
control the environment and to master all levels of an opponent's
activities to affect will, perception, and understanding. This
could include means of communication, transportation, food
production, water supply, and other aspects of infrastructure as
well as the denial of military responses. Deception,
misinformation, and disinformation are key components in this
assault on the will and understanding of the opponent.</p>

<p>Total mastery achieved at extraordinary speed and across
tactical, strategic, and political levels will destroy the will
to resist. With Rapid Dominance, the goal is to use our power
with such compellance that even the strongest of wills will be
awed. Rapid Dominance will strive to achieve a dominance that is
so complete and victory is so swift, that an adversary's losses
in both manpower and material could be relatively light, and yet
the message is so unmistakable that resistance would be seen as
futile.</p>

<p>"Decisive Force," on the other hand, implies delivering
massive enough force to prevail. Decisive means using force with
plenty of margin for error. Force implies a traditional
"force-on-force" and attrition approach. This concept does not
exclude psychological and other complementary damage imposition
techniques to enhance the application of force; they have been
used throughout the history of warfare. But such non-destructive
means would have an ancillary role. Military force would be
applied in a purer form and targeted primarily against the
military capabilities of an opponent. Time is not always an
essential component. As in <em>Desert Shield/Storm</em>, enough
time would have to be allowed to assemble an overwhelming force.
Such a luxury is not always feasible.</p>

<p>The differences become clearer if broken down into their
essential elements:</p>

<p>Four general categories of core characteristics and
capabilities have been identified that Rapid Dominance-configured
mission capability packages must embrace. These are identified
briefly and discussed in later chapters.</p>

<p>First, Rapid Dominance seeks to maximize
<strong>knowledge</strong> of the environment, of the adversary,
and of our own forces on political, strategic, economic, and
military/operational levels. On one hand, we want to get into the
minds of the adversary far more deeply than we have in the past.
Beyond operational intelligence required for battlefield
awareness, Rapid Dominance means cultural understanding of the
adversary in ways that will affect both ours and their planning
and the outcome of the operation at all appropriate tactical and
strategic levels.</p>

<p>Second, Rapid Dominance must achieve <strong>rapidity</strong>
in the sense of timeliness. Rapid Dominance must have
capabilities that can be applied swiftly and relatively faster
than an adversary's.</p>

<p>Third, Rapid Dominance seeks to achieve total <strong>control
of the environment</strong> from complete "signature management"
of both our and the adversary's information and intelligence to
more discrete means to deceive, disguise, and misinform.</p>

<p>Fourth, Rapid Dominance aims to achieve new levels of
operational competence that can virtually institutionalize
<strong>"brilliance."</strong> In some cases, this may mean
changing the longstanding principle of military centralization
and empowering individual soldiers, sailors, and airmen to be
crucial components in applying and directing the application of
force.</p>

<p>As we move to turn this concept into specific doctrine and
capabilities for future evaluation, there is another emerging
reality to consider. If the commercial-economic sector is
transforming at the current rate and breadth, it could be that,
over the course of many years, the defense industrial base would
follow suit, or face irrelevance and extinction. Clearly, there
are certain areas in defense which will never or may never be
eliminated or replaced. Nuclear systems are a current
example.</p>

<p>Should this trend of commercial dominance play out, it may
mean that military force design and procurement will become
dependent on the private sector and commercial technology. Rapid
Dominance is a first conceptual step to deal with this
possibility.</p>

<p>The purpose of this paper is to outline the beginnings of the
concept of Rapid Dominance, its concentration on strategy,
technology and innovation, and its focus on Shock and Awe. Based
on this, subsequent steps will involve expanding mission
capability packages concepts consisting of operations harmonized
with doctrine, organization, and systems and then move on to
field prototype systems for further test and evaluation as
advanced concept technology demonstrations.</p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="ch_01"></a>Background and Basis</h1>

<p>In both relative and absolute terms, since the end of World
War II, the military strength and capability of the United States
have never been greater. Yet this condition of virtual military
superiority has created a paradox. Absent a massive threat or
massive security challenge, it is not clear that this military
advantage can (always) be translated into concrete political
terms that advance American interests. Nor is it clear that the
current structure and foundations for this extraordinary force
can be sustained for the long term without either spending more
money or imposing major changes to this structure that may exceed
the capacity of our system to accommodate. As a consequence, the
success of the current design and configuration of our forces may
ironically become self-limiting and constraining. That is not to
claim automatically that there are better military solutions or
that the current defense program is not the best our political
system can produce. It is to say, however, that we are
well-advised to pursue alternate ideas and concepts to balance
and measure against the current and planned program.</p>

<p>To stimulate and intrigue the reader, we note at the outset
that one thrust of Rapid Dominance is to expand on the doctrine
of overwhelming or decisive force in both depth and breadth. To
push the conceptual envelope, we ask two sets of broad questions:
Can a Rapid Dominance force lead, for example, to a force
structure that can win an MRC such as <em>Desert Shield</em> and
<em>Desert Storm</em> far more quickly and cheaply with far fewer
personnel than our planned force both in terms of stopping any
invasion in its tracks and then ejecting the invader? Can Rapid
Dominance produce a force structure with more effective capacity
to deal with grey areas such as OOTW?</p>

<p>Second, if achievable, can Rapid Dominance lead to a form of
political deterrence in which the capacity to make impotent or
"shut down" an adversary can actually control behavior? What are
the possible political implications of this capability and what
would this power mean for conducting coalition war and for how
our allies react and respond?</p>

<p>Because Rapid Dominance is aimed at influencing the will,
perception, and understanding of an adversary rather than simply
destroying military capability, this focus must cause us to
consider the broadest spectrum of behavior, ours and theirs, and
across all aspects of war including intelligence, training,
education, doctrine, industrial capacity, and how we organize and
manage defense.</p>

<p>We observe at first that even with the successful ending of
the Cold War, the response of the United States in re-evaluating
its national security and defense has been relatively and
understandably modest and cautious. In essence, while the size of
the force has been reduced from Cold War levels of 2.2 million
active duty troops to about 1.5 million, and the services have
been vocal in revising doctrine and strategy to reflect the end
of the Soviet threat, with the exception of emphasis on
jointness, there are few really fundamental differences in the
design and structure of the forces from even 10 or 15 years
ago.</p>

<p>Throughout the Cold War, the defense of the United States
rested on several central and widely accepted and publicly
supported propositions. The "clear and apparent danger" of the
Soviet threat was real and seen as such. The USSR was to be
contained and deterred from hostile action by a combination of
political, strategic, and military actions ranging from the
forging of a ring of alliances surrounding the USSR and its
allies to the deployment of tens of thousands of nuclear and
thermonuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Following the truce ending the Korean War, a large, standing
military force was maintained and defined by the operational
requirements of fighting the large formations of military forces
of the USSR and its allies with similar types of military forces,
albeit outnumbered. The role of allies, principally NATO, was
assumed and taken into account in planning, although the paradox
of the issue of planning for a long versus short war in a nuclear
world remained unresolved.</p>

<p>Mobilization, as in World War II, was likewise assumed if the
Cold War went hot while, at the same time, it was hoped that any
war might be ended quickly. The largely World War II defense,
industrial, and basing structure was retained along with the
intent to rely on our technological superiority to offset
numerical or geographical liabilities.</p>

<p>It was not by accident that this Cold War concept of defense
through mobilization was similar to the strategy that won the
Second World War and the literal ability of ultimately
overwhelming the enemy using the massive application of force,
technology, and associated firepower. Two decades later, Vietnam
exposed the frailty of this approach of dependence on massive
application of firepower especially when political limits were
placed on applying that firepower.</p>

<p>Currently, <em>Desert Storm</em> and the liberation of Kuwait
in 1991 have been taken as the examples that confirm the validity
of the doctrine of overwhelming or decisive force and of ensuring
that both strategic objectives and tactical methods were in
congruence. We argue that now is the time to re-examine these
premises of reliance on overwhelming or decisive force as
currently employed and deployed in the force structure if only as
a prudent check.</p>

<p>Beyond prudence, however, it is clear that without a major
threat to generate consensus and to rally the country around
defense and defense spending, the military posture of the United
States will erode as the defense budget is cut. Hence, relying in
the future on what is currently seen to be as sufficient force to
be "decisive" could easily prove unachievable and the results
problematic or worse for U.S. policy.</p>

<p>The absence of a direct and daunting external security threat
is, of course, a most obvious aspect of the difficulty in
defining the future defense posture of the nation. The United
States has long resisted maintaining a large standing military
and the Cold War years could prove an aberration to that history.
Extending this historical observation of small standing forces,
it is clear that there is no adversary on the horizon even
remotely approaching the military power of the former USSR. While
we might conjure up nominal regional contingencies against Korea
or Iraq as sensible planning scenarios for establishing the
building blocks for force structure, it will prove difficult to
sustain the current defense program over the long term without a
real threat materializing to rally and coalesce public support.
Allocating three percent or less of GDP for defense could easily
prove to be a ceiling and not a floor. It should be noted that in
Europe, defense spending is closing in on 1 to 2 percent of
GDP.</p>

<p>Ironically, as the Department of Defense seeks to come to
grips with this new world, the structural limitations and
constraints in how we develop systems and procure weapons based
on current technological and industrial capacity for producing
them will be exacerbated by downward fiscal pressure giving us
little room for mistakes and flexibility. Air, land, space, and
sea forces are currently limited in the actual numbers and types
of systems that are available for purchase and more limited in
that there are virtually no new major systems on the horizon.
That could change.</p>

<p>The M-1A-1 tank is in production only for foreign sales.
Despite the allure of the Arsenal Ship, the Navy still has only
four active classes of warships from which to replace its
capability and, for the first time this century since aircraft
entered the inventory, is without a new aircraft in development.
The Air Force can be placed in similar straits if the F-22
program is deferred or canceled because of rising cost and fiscal
constraints. Time will tell what happens to the Joint Strike
Fighter. Assumptions about reliance on technology and R&amp;D
providing insurance policies for future defense needs may prove
ill-advised if and as DOD is forced to cut back and reduce those
programs even further. Indeed, over time, commercial R&amp;D
could become the main source for procuring software and other
systems needed to upgrade today's weapons systems and for
so-called "leap-ahead" technologies that may prove elusive to
create.</p>

<p>There is also the crucial issue of revising or indeed
developing new doctrine and military thought to deal with these
changing circumstances. But, without a compelling rationale and
with the clear bureaucratic and political pressures of preparing
and defending an annual budget, more of the same (or more likely,
less of the same) becomes an almost irresistible outcome. While
the JCS or OSD or CINCs may have genuine need for jointly
packaged forces that are rapidly deployable irrespective of Army,
Navy, Marine, or Air Force labels, the services cannot be
expected to reverse the years of viewing the world through
service- specific arguments and doctrine.</p>

<p>Although the absolute danger has been dramatically reduced
with the end of the USSR, it would be the height of folly to
assume that there are no risks to the nation nor an absence of
evil-doers wishing this nation harm. It would also be
shortsighted to expect that potential adversaries are
unintelligent and would not rely on superior knowledge of their
environment and simplicity to overcome our current military and
technical superiority much as the North Vietnamese did. In
addition, as technology diffuses around, over, and under borders,
our assumptions about guarantees of permanent technological
superiority should welcome thoughtful examination.</p>

<p>Lenin asked the question, "what is to be done?" As a start,
the United States should act to exploit the several major
advantages it possesses. First, we have time. The clarity and
danger of future threats is sufficiently removed for us to take a
longer view. While we may have deferred adding to the inventory
of future systems in development, current systems possess more
than enough military capability to get us through this transition
period, even if this period were to last for more than a decade.
This does not mean we can rest on our oars; if we take advantage
of this opportunity, time is on our side. If we squander this
opportunity, then we could ultimately find ourselves in
trouble.</p>

<p>Second, the combination of American technical know-how, the
luxury of the best technically educated and trained society in
the world, and the entrepreneurial spirit of our system offers
vast potential if we are clever enough to exploit this
extraordinary resource.</p>

<p>Third, because of significant changes in law and organization
regarding the military, particularly the Goldwater-Nichols Act,
and through a willingness to examine alternatives, the Department
of Defense has actively sought new ideas and concepts. The
enhanced role of the CINCs and the acceptance of jointness are
positive illustrations. Yet, for understandable structural and
political realities noted above, assuring productive innovation
continues will not be automatic. Against these conducive signs,
vision, true joint thinking, and tactical advances still are
premium commodities to be nourished and encouraged.</p>

<p>In building an alternative intellectual concept, it is useful
to rely on successful lessons of the past. For five decades, we
have been successful in applying containment and deterrence in
the Cold War. When deterrence or diplomacy failed as in Kuwait,
then the use of force was inevitable. A first-order issue is how
can we augment or improve the use of existing military capability
should it be required.</p>

<p>Should force be needed, our proposal calls for establishing a
regime of Rapid Dominance throughout the area of strategic as
well as operational concern. By Rapid Dominance, we are seeking
the capability to dominate, control, and isolate the entire
environment in, around, over, and under the objective area as
quickly as possible, and with fewer forces than currently
envisaged, although direct insertion of forces is an important
component depending upon the tactical situation. In many cases,
this capacity need not be the traditional firepower solution of
only physically destroying an adversary's military capabilities.
Our focus is on the Clausewitzian principle of affecting the
adversary's will to resist as the first order of business,
quickly if not nearly instantaneously. A second goal would be to
stop an attack during the first stages. A third goal, should it
be achievable, would be to promote a regime of political
deterrence that might restrain aggression in the first place.</p>

<p>To accomplish the rendering an adversary incapable of action
means neutralizing the ability to command; to provide logistics;
to organize society; and to function; as well as to control,
regulate and deny the adversary of information, intelligence, and
understanding of what is and what is not happening. This means we
must control all necessary intelligence and information on our
forces-the ultimate form of stealth-and on an adversary's forces
as well and then exploit total situational awareness for rapid
action.</p>

<p>Regarding the emergence of current military thought and
doctrine, as implied earlier, warfare today may be in the early
and far less mature stages of a major revolution than is
generally assumed. It is understandable that despite major
strategic reassessments, current doctrine is still highly
influenced by Cold War tactics and strategy and perhaps by the
iron grip of the history of conflict since the early 19th
century.</p>

<p>Since Napoleon, the conduct of war between major states has
been largely dominated by combining industrial might with vast
amounts of manpower over time and space. The United States
advanced Napoleon's use of industry and mass armies in the Civil
War and our planning up to the Cold War tended to follow this
same pattern. World War II, of course, exemplified the triumph of
this industrial, mobilization, and massive use of force
approach.</p>

<p>In the evolution of U.S. military theory, it can be argued
that this model combining massive industrial might and manpower
finally ended in 1989. Although, by then, technological advances
to conventional military capabilities seemed to be approaching
the destructive power, or more precisely, the system lethality of
nuclear weapons. In other words, modern non-nuclear precision
weapons perhaps could produce effects against enemy targets
roughly comparable to the military lethality of theater-level
nuclear weapons. If this condition proves true, could this new
lethality fundamentally change the construct for designing
American doctrine and strategy? This question is at the heart of
the "precision and battlefield awareness" school of decisive
force thinking that believes that this fundamental change is in
place.</p>

<p>Since the end of the Cold War and, with it, the end of the
need to prepare our forces to fight a more or less equally
powerful adversary, the United States military has conducted two
post-Cold War crises against lesser adversaries quite differently
than it fought the Cold War. In the Panama intervention in 1990
and in Kuwait shortly thereafter, the suggestion of newer and
different methods of warfare was present. Perhaps both will turn
out to be transition campaigns, where there is much of the old,
but also signs of the new. But there are specific pieces of
evidence that should command our attention.</p>

<p>Underlying the planning for <em>Operation Just Cause</em> in
Panama and <em>Desert Shield/Storm</em> in Kuwait was the
premeditated incorporation of a series of rapid, simultaneous
attacks designed to apply decisive force. The aim was to stun,
and then rapidly defeat the enemy through a series of carefully
orchestrated land, sea, air, and special operating forces strikes
that took place nearly simultaneously across a wide battle space
and against many military targets. The purpose of these rapid,
simultaneous attacks was to produce immediate paralysis of both
the national state and its armed forces that would lead to prompt
neutralization and capitulation.</p>

<p>In both <em>Just Cause</em> and <em>Desert Storm</em>, the
United States (plus coalition forces in <em>Desert Storm</em>)
had such overwhelming military capabilities that, in retrospect,
the outcome was largely a matter of drafting a cogent and
coordinated operation plan based on using the entire system of
capabilities, and then executing that plan to produce a decisive
victory. The Haitian incursion in 1995 used similar principles of
intimidation to eliminate any real fighting. However, in
<em>Desert Storm</em> unlike Haiti, it took the U.S. and its
allies nearly 6 months to deploy over a half million troops
before the fighting began.</p>

<p>The recently published JCS Pub 3.0 and the U.S. Army's 525-5
Pamphlet reflect and exploit operational rapidity and
simultaneity. Yet, progress in these operational directions may
be in danger of faltering if only old Cold War yardsticks are
used to make future force investments and to direct studies about
future force structure and associated infrastructure. As in any
transition period, innovation must be joined by a willingness to
experiment. This means the establishment and cultivation of an
experimental apparatus to test and evaluate new concepts are
matters of importance both to foster innovation and assess its
application.</p>

<p>We build on the trends of rapidity and simultaneity and seek
to emphasize control and time. Control is necessary to force
behavioral change in adversaries to achieve strategic or
political ends. Control and then influence come from a range of
threats and outcomes, including putting at risk the targets an
adversary holds dear, to imposing a hierarchy of Shock and Awe,
to affecting will, perception, and understanding. Achieving
control may now be theoretically possible in even more compressed
or shortened time periods because of the potential superiority of
enhanced U.S. military capability and further training and
education. To obtain this level of military superiority that can
affect the adversary's will and perception, or at least achieve
the practical military consequences, a great deal of thought,
debate, and experimentation over new concepts will be needed if
only to test and validate contemporary doctrine.</p>

<p>If the political objective is to achieve a level of Shock and
Awe beyond only temporary paralysis, then further actions must
follow. The end point will be to dominate the enemy in such a way
as to achieve the desired objectives. From this concept follows
the need to shut down either a state or an organized enemy
through the rapid and simultaneous application (or threat of
application) of land, sea, air, space, and special operating
forces against the broadest spectrum of the adversary's power
base and center or centers of gravity and against the adversary's
will and perception at tactical and strategic levels.</p>

<p>In <em>Desert Storm,</em> the objectives were first to evict
Iraqi forces from Kuwait and then to restore the legitimate
government. From these objectives, more limited strategic and
political objectives followed, some for purposes of maintaining
coalition solidarity and UN-imposed sanctions. Not occupying
Baghdad was one such political limitation. These strategic
objectives led to identification of the enemy's centers of
gravity as the basis for the application of force to destroy
these centers. This planning led to the repeated, rapid, and
simultaneous use of massive force with great effect.</p>

<p>One obvious tactical objective was to eliminate Saddam
Hussein's command and control. This was accomplished by
simultaneous and massive attacks. Once command and control was
destroyed, Iraqi forces in the Kuwait Theater of Operations (KTO)
would be destroyed as quickly as possible with overwhelming force
and with minimum casualties. As General Colin Powell simply
stated, "My plan is to cut off Saddam's army and then kill
it."</p>

<p>There was no sanctuary for Iraqi forces in the KTO. They were
completely vulnerable to unrelenting and devastating attack.
Outside the KTO, targeting was more selective, not because the
means were unavailable for imposing sufficient damage but because
our military objectives were purposely limited. Given the
effectiveness of the air campaign and the overwhelming
superiority on the ground, coalition land forces required only 4
of the 41 days of the war to defeat and to eject Iraq's forces
from Kuwait.</p>

<p>Suppose a <em>Desert Storm</em>-type campaign were fought 20
years from now based on a plan that exploited the concept of
Rapid Dominance. Further assume that Iraq has improved (and
rebuilt) its military and that, in a series of simultaneous and
nearly instantaneous actions, our primary objective was still to
shut Iraq down, threaten or destroy its leadership, and isolate
and destroy its military forces as we did in 1991. However, two
decades hence, Rapid Dominance might conceivably achieve this
objective in a matter of days (or perhaps hours) and not after
the 6 months or the 500,000 troops that were required in 1990 to
1991. Rapid Dominance may even offer the prospect of stopping an
invasion in its tracks.</p>

<p>Shutting the country down would entail both the physical
destruction of appropriate infrastructure and the shutdown and
control of the flow of all vital information and associated
commerce so rapidly as to achieve a level of national shock akin
to the effect that dropping nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki had on the Japanese. Simultaneously, Iraq's armed forces
would be paralyzed with the neutralization or destruction of its
capabilities. Deception, disinformation, and misinformation would
be applied massively.</p>

<p>This level of simultaneity and Rapid Dominance must also
demonstrate to the adversary our endurance and staying power,
that is, the capability to dominate over as much time as is
necessary less an enemy mistakenly try to wait it out and use
time between attacks to recover sufficiently. If the enemy still
resisted, then conventional forms of attack would follow
resulting in the physical occupation of territory. Control is
thus best gained by the demonstrated ability to sustain the stun
effects of the initial rapid series of blows long enough to
affect the enemy's will and his means to continue. There must be
staying power effect on the enemy or they merely absorb the
blows, gain in confidence and their ability to resist, and change
tactics much as occurred during the WWII bombing campaigns and
the air war over North Vietnam.</p>

<p>Achieving these levels of Shock and Awe requires a wide
versatility and competence in employing land, sea, air, space,
and special operating forces and in investment in technology to
produce Rapid Dominance. Different methods for commanding the
battle using both hierarchical and non-hierarchical command to
control and direct our forces are likely to be required
especially given the simultaneous application of capabilities
throughout the given battle space by the full spectrum of our
forces. To use these combinations of forces will require
adjustment of current service doctrine and prescribed roles and
functions. Rapid Dominance also means looking to invest in
technologies perhaps not fully or currently captured by the Cold
War paradigm.</p>

<p>To develop the proper combination of forces and future
technology investment for Rapid Dominance, extensive
experimentation with this core concept will be required. This
exper-imentation must apply to all levels of military educational
institutions; it must be joint; it can be accelerated by
availability of recent advances in simulation technology; and it
must have operational trials in the field.</p>

<p>To advance this concept, technology and its infrastructure and
application are vital. Here, understanding several facts is
important. The U.S. today is graduating through its college and
universities system approximately 200,000 American and foreign
scientists and engineers per year. This is a great national
resource. This technology infrastructure is dimensions larger in
number and scope than the aggregate of anywhere else in the
world. Through appreciation and exploitation of this potential, a
U.S. position of pre-eminence in science and technology could be
assured for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>One adjunct of this technology revolution is in the
information and information management areas- which, in the U.S.,
are heavily commercially oriented. Future military application
may well be analogous to the impact of the internal combustion
engine and wireless radio on land, sea, and air forces in the
1920s and 1930s. The size of this technological lead between
ourselves and the rest of the world, especially in the base for
new information products and services, should widen further in
knowledge and in application. The "Silicon Valley" revolution is
likely to continue increasing computer capacity on an almost
annual basis. By the year 2005, computing power should be many
fold times today's capacity-perhaps ultimately beginning to close
in on the ability of humans to handle data flow as well as the
ability to condense and synthesize data.</p>

<p>In parallel to advances in computing power will be the ability
to transfer information into and out of the hands of individual
users. The addition of virtual reality and other technical aids
will enhance and potentially quicken individual decision-making
ability. Technologies associated with bioscience and
bioengineering are likely to be of particular importance in
enhancing these capabilities and are also an area of American
predominance. Material sciences, software, and communications are
all American strengths, and should remain so well into the next
century.</p>

<p>A significant element supporting this explosion in applied
information and other technologies is the American free
enterprise system and its entrepreneurial character. This drive
is needed to translate this technology into military hardware.
The nature of the U.S. market and its competitive basis reinforce
this element. The largest challenges may be to shape and exploit
this commercial potential and then to ensure that its enduring
advantages become fundamental in the makeup of our military
forces. Unlike the defense industrial base required during the
Cold War, this new commercial base is neither heavy nor is it a
massive industry relying on producing large things. Indeed, its
edge has depended on getting "smaller, smarter, and cheaper."</p>

<p>The fundamental technology thrust for channeling this new
American industrial base to support Rapid Dominance must be
toward the control and management of everything that is
significant to the operations bearing on the particular Area of
Interest (AOI). And we mean everything! Control of the
environment is far broader than only the objective of achieving
dominant battlefield awareness. Control means the ability to
change, to a greater or lesser degree, the "signatures" of all of
the combat forces engaged in the AOI. With this concept, the
operational frameworks in applying force across the entire
spectrum of platforms (satellites, aircraft, land vehicles,
ships) can be measured (and controlled) from many minus decibels
of cross section, to many plus decibels; communications can be
entirely covert, i.e., many dB less than the ambient environment,
or that approaching "white noise." The location of both the
individual and his unit can be measured in real time in meters,
if not feet, anywhere in the world. Through virtual reality,
movement in three-dimensional grids over hundreds of square
kilometers, offer precise location and movement control, both
during day and night in conditions of unprecedented confidence.
This occurs in real time. Denying or deceiving the adversary,
including real-time manipulation of senses and inputs, is part of
this control.</p>

<p>A Rapid Dominance-configured force would enter an AOI and
immediately control the operational/environmental signatures both
individually and in the aggregate. As needed, line and
non-line-of-sight weapons of near pin-point accuracy would be
delivered across the entire area of operation. Stealthy UAVs and
mobile robotics systems, together with decoys, would be deployed
in large numbers for surveillance, targeting, strike, and
deception and would produce their own impact of electronic Shock
and Awe on the enemy. This application of force can be done as
rapidly as political and strategic conditions demand.</p>

<p>The effects mean literally "turning on and off" the "lights"
that enable any potential aggressor to see or appreciate the
conditions and events concerning his forces and, ultimately, his
society. What is radically different in Rapid Dominance is the
comprehensive system assemblage and integration of many evolving
and even revolutionary technical advances in dominant battlefield
awareness squared-materials application, sensor and signature
control, computer and bioengineering applied to massive amounts
of data, enable weapon application with simultaneity, precision,
and lethality that to date have not been applied as a total
system. Deception, disinformation, and misinformation will become
major elements of this systemic approach.</p>

<p>The R&amp;D reality is that technology advances will likely
come from the commercial world as the DOD base continues to
shrink. It is clear that in certain areas, DOD must remain
involved where there is no private R&amp;D or to fill gaps in
R&amp;D. Warships, fighter aircraft, tanks, and missile defense
are examples. However, advances in commercial technology in the
Information Age are unlikely to be matched by DOD.</p>

<p>Of equal importance is how we train, organize, and educate our
combat officers and key enlisted personnel. Command must be
geared to achieving the best of the best-not the best among the
good. Assimilating in real time the vast amount of information
and putting information to use will no doubt lead to major
changes in the composition, competence, and authority of (even
and especially) individual military unit commanders perhaps to
the squad or private soldier level.</p>

<p>Of course, even with the most perfect information, an
unqualified, inexperienced, or unprepared military commander may
not win except with extraordinary luck or an incompetent foe.
And, we repeat that there are cases where NO military force may
be able to succeed if the objectives are unobtainable. The match
of the entrepreneurial individual with the potential of the
technology base is key. Optimizing and integrating all elements
into a total system is a certain way to exploit the opportunity
that we can perceive becoming more visible in the coming
years.</p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="ch_02"></a>Shock and Awe</h1>

<p>The basis for Rapid Dominance rests in the ability to affect
the will, perception, and understanding of the adversary through
imposing sufficient Shock and Awe to achieve the necessary
political, strategic, and operational goals of the conflict or
crisis that led to the use of force. War, of course, in the
broadest sense has been characterized by Clausewitz to include
substantial elements of "fog, friction, and fear." In the
Clausewitzian view, "shock and awe" were necessary effects
arising from application of military power and were aimed at
destroying the will of an adversary to resist. Earlier and
similar observations had been made by the great Chinese military
writer Sun Tzu around 500 B.C. Sun Tzu observed that disarming an
adversary before battle was joined was the most effective outcome
a commander could achieve. Sun Tzu was well aware of the crucial
importance of achieving Shock and Awe prior to, during, and in
ending battle. He also observed that "war is deception," implying
that Shock and Awe were greatly leveraged through clever, if not
brilliant, employment of force.</p>

<p>In Rapid Dominance, the aim of affecting the adversary's will,
understanding, and perception through achieving Shock and Awe is
multifaceted. To identify and present these facets, we need first
to examine the different aspects of and mechanisms by which Shock
and Awe affect an adversary. One recalls from old photographs and
movie or television screens, the comatose and glazed expressions
of survivors of the great bombardments of World War I and the
attendant horrors and death of trench warfare. These images and
expressions of shock transcend race, culture, and history.
Indeed, TV coverage of <em>Desert Storm</em> vividly portrayed
Iraqi soldiers registering these effects of battlefield Shock and
Awe.</p>

<p>In our excursion, we seek to determine whether and how Shock
and Awe can become sufficiently intimidating and compelling
factors to force or otherwise convince an adversary to accept our
will in the Clausewitzian sense, such that the strategic aims and
military objectives of the campaign will achieve a political end.
Then, Shock and Awe are linked to the four core characteristics
that define Rapid Dominance: knowledge, rapidity, brilliance, and
control.</p>

<p>The first step in this process is to establish a hierarchy of
different types, models, and examples of Shock and Awe in order
to identify the principal mechanisms, aims, and aspects that
differentiate each model as unique or important. At this stage,
historical examples are offered. However, in subsequent stages, a
task will be to identify current and future examples to show the
effects of Shock and Awe. From this identification, the next step
in this methodology is to develop alternative mission capability
packages consisting of a concept of operations doctrine, tactics,
force structure, organizations, and systems to analyze and
determine how best each form or variant of Shock and Awe might be
achieved. To repeat, intimidation and compliance are the outputs
we seek to obtain by the threat of use or by the actual
application of our alternative force package. Then the mission
capability package is examined in conditions of both MRCs and
OOTW.</p>

<p>For discussion purposes, nine examples representing differing
historical types, variants, and characteristics of Shock and Awe
have been derived. These examples are not exclusive categories
and overlap exists between and among them. The first example is
"Overwhelming Force," the doctrine and concept shaping today's
American force structure. The aims of this doctrine are to apply
massive or overwhelming force as quickly as possible on an
adversary in order to disarm, incapacitate, or render the enemy
militarily impotent with as few casualties and losses to
ourselves and to non-combatants as possible. The superiority of
American forces, technically and operationally, is crucial to
successful application.</p>

<p>There are several major criticisms and potential weaknesses of
this approach. The first is its obvious reliance on large numbers
of highly capable (and expensive) platforms such as the M-1 tank,
F-14,15, and 18 aircraft and CVN/DDG-51/SSN-688 ships designed
principally to be used jointly or individually to destroy and
attrite other forces and supporting capability. In other words,
this example has principally been derived from force-on-forces
attrition relationships even though command and control,
logistical, and supporting forces cannot be disaggregated from
this doctrine.</p>

<p>The other major shortcoming of a force-on-force or a
platform-on-platform attrition basis is that with declining
numbers of worthy and well enough equipped adversaries against
whom to apply this doctrine, justifying it to a questioning
Congress and public will prove more difficult. While it is clear
that "system of systems" and other alternative military concepts
are under consideration, for the time being, these have not
replaced the current platform and force-on-force attrition
orientation. It should be noted, there will be no doctrinal
alternatives unless ample effort is made to provide a
comprehensive and detailed examination of possible
alternatives.</p>

<p>Second, this approach is based on ultimately projecting large
amounts of force. This requires significant logistical lift and
the time to transport the necessary forces. Rapidity may not
always follow, especially when it is necessary to deliver large
quantities of decisive force to remote or distant regions. Third,
the costs of maintaining a sufficiently decisive force may
outstrip the money provided to pay for the numbers of highly
capable forces needed. Finally, at a time when the commercial
marketplace is increasing the performance of its products while
also lowering price and cycle time to field newer generations
systems, the opposite trends are still endemic in the defense
sector. This will compound the tension between quality and
quantity already cited. None of these shortcomings is necessarily
fatal. However, none should be dismissed without fuller
understanding.</p>

<p>Certainly, Rapid Dominance seeks to achieve certain objectives
that are similar to those of current doctrine. A major
distinction is that Rapid Dominance envisages a wider application
of force across a broader spectrum of leverage points to impose
Shock and Awe. This breadth should lead to a more comprehensive
and integrated interaction among all the specific components and
units that produce aggregate military capability and must include
training and education, as well as new ways to exploit our
technical and industrial capacity. It is possible that in these
resource, technical, and commercial industrial areas that Rapid
Dominance may provide particular utility that otherwise may
constrain the effectiveness of Decisive Force.</p>

<p>The second example is "Hiroshima and Nagasaki" noted earlier.
The intent here is to impose a regime of Shock and Awe through
delivery of instant, nearly incomprehensible levels of massive
destruction directed at influencing society writ large, meaning
its leadership and public, rather than targeting directly against
military or strategic objectives even with relatively few numbers
or systems. The employment of this capability against society and
its values, called "counter-value" in the nuclear deterrent
jargon, is massively destructive strikes directly at the public
will of the adversary to resist and, ideally or theoretically,
would instantly or quickly incapacitate that will over the space
of a few hours or days.</p>

<p>The major flaws and shortcomings are severalfold and rest in
determining whether this magnitude and speed of destruction can
actually be achieved using non-nuclear systems to render an
adversary impotent; to destroy quickly the will to resist within
acceptable and probably unachievably low levels of societal
destruction; and whether a political decision would be taken in
any case to use this type of capability given the magnitude of
the consequences and the risk of failure.</p>

<p>It can be argued that in the bombing campaign of <em>Desert
Storm</em>, similar objectives were envisioned. The differences
between this example and <em>Desert Storm</em> are through the
totality of a society that would be affected by a massive and
indiscriminate regime of destruction and the speed of imposing
those strikes as occurred to those Japanese cities. This example
of shock, awe, and intimidation rests on the proposition that
such effects must occur in very short periods of time.</p>

<p>The next example is "Massive Bombardment." This category of
Shock and Awe applies massive and, perhaps today, relatively
precise destructive power largely against military targets and
related sectors over time. It is unlikely to produce an immediate
effect on the will of the adversary to resist. In a sense, this
is an endurance contest in which the enemy is finally broken
through exhaustion. However, it is the cumulative effect of this
application of destruction power that will ultimately impose
sufficient Shock and Awe, as well as perhaps destroy the physical
means to resist, that an adversary will be forced to accept
whatever terms may be imposed. As noted, trench warfare of the
First World War, the strategic bombing campaign in Europe of the
Second World War (which was not effective in this regard), and
related B-52 raids in Vietnam and especially over the New Year
period of 1972-73, illustrate the application of massive
bombardment.</p>

<p>Massive Bombardment, directed at largely military-strategic
targets, is indeed an aspect of applying "Overwhelming Force,"
even though political constraints make this example most unlikely
to be repeated in the future. There is also the option of
applying massive destruction against purely civilian or
"counter-value" targets such as the firebombing of Tokyo in World
War II when unconditionality marks the terms of surrender. It is
the cumulative impact of destruction on the endurance and
capacity of the adversary that ultimately affects the will to
resist that is the central foundation of this example.</p>

<p>The shortcoming with this example is clear, and rests in the
question of political feasibility and acceptability, and what
circumstances would be necessary to dictate and permit use of
massive bombardment. Outright invasion and aggression such as
Iraq's attack against Kuwait could clearly qualify as reasons to
justify using this level of Shock and Awe. However, as with
Overwhelming Force, this response is not time-sensitive and would
require massive application of force for some duration as well as
political support.</p>

<p>Fourth is the "Blitzkreig" example. In real Blitzkreig, Shock
and Awe were not achieved through the massive application of
firepower across a broad front nor through the delivery of
massive levels of force. Instead, the intent was to apply
precise, surgical amounts of tightly focused force to achieve
maximum leverage but with total economies of scale. The German
Wehrmacht's Blitzkreig was not a massive attack across a very
broad front, although the opponent may have been deceived into
believing that. Instead, the enemy's line was probed in multiple
locations and, wherever it could be most easily penetrated,
attack was concentrated in a narrow salient. The image is that of
the shaped charge, penetrating through a relatively tiny hole in
a tank's armor and then exploding outwardly to achieve a maximum
cone of damage against the unarmored or less protected
innards.</p>

<p>To the degree that this example of achieving Shock and Awe is
directed against military targets, it requires skill if not
brilliance in execution, or nearly total incompetence in the
adversary. The adversary, finding front lines broken and the rear
vulnerable, panics, surrenders, or both. Hitler's campaign in
France and Holland and the seizure of the Dutch forts and the
occupation of Crete in 1940 are obvious illustrations. The use of
Special Operations forces in significant numbers is an adjunct to
imposing this level of Shock and Awe.</p>

<p><em>Desert Storm</em> could have been a classic Blitzkreig
maneuver if the attack were mounted without the long preparatory
bombardment and was concentrated in a single sector-either the
"left hook" or the Marine attack "up the middle," and with total
surprise. The major differences between the operation in Kuwait
and Germany's capture of France in 1940 were that the allies in
Saudi Arabia had complete military and technical superiority
unlike the Germans and that, once under attack, Iraq's front line
collapsed virtually everywhere, giving the coalition license to
pick and choose the points for penetration and then dominate the
battle with fire and maneuver. The lesson for future adversaries
about the Blitzkreig example and the United States is that they
will face in us an opponent able to employ technically superior
forces with brilliance, speed, and vast leverage in achieving
Shock and Awe through the precise application of force.</p>

<p>It must also be noted that there are certainly situations such
as guerilla war where this or most means of employing force to
obtain Shock and Awe may simply prove inapplicable. For example,
the German Blitzkreig would have performed with the greatest
difficulty in the Vietnam War, where enemy forces had relatively
few lines to be penetrated or selectively savaged by this type of
warfare.</p>

<p>The shortcomings of Blitzkrieg ironically rest in its
strengths. Can brilliance and superiority be maintained? Is there
a flexible enough infrastructure to ensure training to that
standard, and can the supporting industrial base continue to
produce at acceptable costs the systems to maintain this
operational and technical superiority? Rapid Dominance requires a
positive answer to these questions, at least theoretically.</p>

<p>The fifth example is named after the Chinese
philosopher-warrior, Sun Tzu. The "Sun Tzu" example is based on
selective, instant decapitation of military or societal targets
to achieve Shock and Awe. This discrete or precise nature of
applying force differentiates this from Hiroshima and Massive
Destruction examples. Sun Tzu was brought before Ho Lu, the King
of Wu, who had read all of Sun Tzu's thirteen chapters on war and
proposed a test of Sun's military skills. Ho asked if the rules
applied to women. When the answer was yes, the king challenged
Sun Tzu to turn the royal concubines into a marching troop. The
concubines merely laughed at Sun Tzu until he had the head cut
off the head concubine. The ladies still could not bring
themselves to take the master's orders seriously. So, Sun Tzu had
the head cut off a second concubine. From that point on, so the
story goes, the ladies learned to march with the precision of a
drill team.</p>

<p>The objectives of this example are to achieve Shock and Awe
and hence compliance or capitulation through very selective,
utterly brutal and ruthless, and rapid application of force to
intimidate. The fundamental values or lives are the principal
targets and the aim is to convince the majority that resistance
is futile by targeting and harming the few. Both society and the
military are the targets. In a sense, Sun Tzu attempts to achieve
Hiroshima levels of Shock and Awe but through far more selective
and informed targeting. Decapitation is merely one instrument.
This model can easily fall outside the cultural heritage and
values of the U.S. for it to be useful without major refinement.
Shutting down an adversary's ability to "see" or to communicate
is another variant but without many historical examples to show
useful wartime applications.</p>

<p>A subset of the Sun Tzu example is the view that war is
deception. In this subset, the attempt is to deceive the enemy
into what we wish the enemy to perceive and thereby trick,
cajole, induce, or force the adversary. The thrust or target is
the perception, understanding, and knowledge of the adversary. In
some ways, the ancient Trojan Horse is an early example of
deception. However, as we will see, the deception model may have
new foundations in the technological innovations that are
occurring and in our ability to control the environment.</p>

<p>The shortcomings with Sun Tzu are similar to those of the
Massive Destruction and the Blitzkreig examples. It is
questionable that a decision to employ American force this
ruthlessly in quasi- or real assassination will ever be made by
the U.S. Further, the standard to maintain the ability to perform
these missions is high and dependent on both resources and on
supporting intelligence, especially human intelligence-not an
American strong point.</p>

<p>Britain's Special Air Service provides the SAS example and is
distinct from the Blitzkreig or Sun Tzu categories because it
focuses on depriving an adversary of its senses in order to
impose Shock and Awe. The image here is the hostage rescue team
employing stun grenades to incapacitate an adversary, but on a
far larger scale. The stun grenade produces blinding light and
deafening noise. The result shocks and confuses the adversary and
makes him senseless. The aim in this example of achieving Shock
and Awe is to produce so much light and sound or the converse, to
deprive the adversary of all senses, and therefore to disable and
to disarm. Without senses, the adversary becomes impotent and
entirely vulnerable.</p>

<p>A huge "battlefield" stun grenade that encompasses large areas
is a dramatic if unachievable illustration. Perhaps a high
altitude nuclear detonation that blacks out virtually all
electronic and electrical equipment better describes the intended
effect regardless of likelihood of use. Depriving the enemy, in
specific areas, of the ability to communicate, observe, and to
interact is a more reasonable and perhaps more achievable
variant. This deprival of senses, including all electronics and
substitution of false signals or data to create this feeling of
impotence, is another variant. Above all, Shock and Awe are
imposed instantly and the mechanism or target is deprivation of
the senses.</p>

<p>The shortcomings of the SAS approach mirror in part
shortcomings of other approaches. Technological solutions are
crucial but may not be conceivable outside the EMP effects of
nuclear weapons. Intelligence is clearly vital. Without precise
knowledge of who and what are to be stunned, this example will
not work.</p>

<p>The sixth example of applying Shock and Awe is the "Haitian"
example (or to the purist, the Potemkin Village example). It is
based on imposing Shock and Awe through a show of force and
indeed through deception, misinformation, and disinformation and
is different from the U.S. intervention in Haiti in 1995. In the
early 1800s, native Haitians were seeking to extricate their
country from French control. The Haitian leaders staged a martial
parade for the visiting French military contingent and marched,
reportedly, a hand full of battalions repeatedly in review. The
French were deceived into believing that the native forces
numbered in the tens of thousands and concluded that French
military action was futile and that its forces would be
overwhelmed. As a result, the Haitians were able to achieve their
freedom without firing a shot.</p>

<p>To be sure, there are points of similarity between the Haitian
example and the others. Deception, disinformation, and guile are
more crucial in this regime. However, the target or focus is the
will and perception of the intended target. Perhaps the Sun Tzu
category comes closest to this one except that while Sun Tzu is
selective in applying force, it is clear that imposing actual
pain and shock are essential ingredients and deception,
disin-formation, and guile are secondary. Demonstrative uses of
force are also important. The issue is how to determine what
demonstrations will affect the perceptions of the intended target
in line with the overall political aims.</p>

<p>The weakness of this form of Shock and Awe is its major
dependency on intelligence. One must be certain that the will and
perceptions of the adversary can be manipulated. The classic
misfire is the adversary who is not impressed and, instead, is
further provoked to action by the unintended actions of the
aggressor. Saddam Hussein and the Iraqis' invasion of Kuwait
demonstrate when this Potemkin Village model can backfire. Saddam
simply let his bluff be called.</p>

<p>The next example is that of "The Roman Legions." Achieving
Shock and Awe rests in the ability to deter and overpower an
adversary through the adversary's perception and fear of his
vulnerability and our own invincibility, even though applying
ultimate retribution could take a considerable period of time.
The target set encompasses both military and societal values. In
occupying a vast empire stretching from the Atlantic to the Red
Sea, Rome could deploy relatively small number of forces to
secure each of these territories. In the first place, Roman
forces were far superior to native forces individually and
collectively. In the second place, if an untoward act occurred,
the perpetrator could rest assured that Roman vengeance
ultimately would take place. This was similar to British "Gunboat
Diplomacy" of the nineteenth century when the British fleet would
return to the scene of any crime against the crown and extract
its retribution through the wholesale destruction of offending
villages.</p>

<p>There were several vital factors in Rome's ability to achieve
Shock and Awe. The invincibility of its Legions, or the
perception of that prowess, and the inevitability of retribution
were among the most significant factors. In other words,
reprisals and the use of force to exact a severe punishment, as
well as the certainty that this sword of Damocles would descend,
were essential ingredients. The distinction between this category
and the others is the ex post facto nature of achieving Shock and
Awe. In the other categories, there is the need for seizing the
initiative and applying con-temporaneous force to achieve Shock
and Awe. With the Roman example, the Shock and Awe have already
been achieved. It is the breakdown of this regime or the rise of
new and as yet unbowed adversaries that leads to the reactive use
of force.</p>

<p>The major shortcoming is the assumption of the inevitability
of reprisals and the capacity to take punitive action. That is
not and may not always be the case with the United States,
although we can attempt to make others believe it will be. The
takeover of the Embassy in Tehran by dissident "students" in 1979
and American impotence in the aftermath are suggestive of the
shortcoming. That aside, the example or perception of the
invincibility of American military power is not a bad one to
embellish.</p>

<p>The next category for achieving Shock and Awe is termed the
Decay and Default model and is based on the imposition of
societal breakdown over a lengthy period but without the
application of massive destruction. This example is obviously not
rapid but cumulative. In this example, both military and societal
values are targets. Selective and focused force is applied. It is
the long-term corrosive effects of the continuing breakdown in
the system and society that ultimately compels an adversary to
surrender or to accept terms. Shock and Awe are therefore not
immediate either in application or in producing the end result.
Economic embargoes, long-term policies that harass and aggravate
the adversary, and other types of punitive actions that do not
threaten the entire society but apply pressure as in the Chinese
water torture, a drop at a time, are the mechanisms. Finally, the
preoccupation with the decay and disruption of society produces a
variant of Shock and Awe in the form of frustration collapsing
the will to resist.</p>

<p>The significant weakness of this approach is time duration. In
many cases, the time required to impose such a regime of Shock
and Awe is unacceptably long or simply cannot be achieved by
conventional or politically acceptable means.</p>

<p>The final example is that of "The Royal Canadian Mounted
Police," whose unofficial motto was "never send a man where you
can send a bullet." The distinction between this example and the
others is that this example is even more selective than Sun Tzu
and implies that standoff capabilities as opposed to forces in
place can achieve the required objectives. There should not be
too fine a point, however, in belaboring differences with the
other examples in this regard over standoff. A stealthy aircraft
bombing unimpededly is not distinct from a cruise missile fired
at 1,000 miles regarding the effect of ordnance on target.</p>

<p>A few observations about these examples offer insights on
which to test and evaluate means of applying Rapid Dominance. It
is clear that the targets in each category include military,
civilian, industrial, infrastructure, and societal components of
a country or group. In certain cases, time is the crucial
consideration in imposing Shock and Awe and in most of the
examples, emphasis is on a rapid or sudden imposition of Shock
and Awe. However, in several examples, the effects of Shock and
Awe must be and are cumulative. They are either achieved over
time or achieved through earlier conditioning and experiences.
Not all of these categories are dependent on technology or on new
technological breakthroughs. What is relatively new or different
is the extent to which brilliance and competence in using force,
in understanding where an adversary's weak points lie and in
executing military operations with deftness, are vital. While
this recognition is not new, emphasis is crucial on exploiting
brilliance and therefore on the presumption that brilliance may
be taught or institutionalized and is not a function only of
gifted individuals.</p>

<p>There is also a key distinction between selective or precise
and massive application of force. Technology, in the form of
"zero CEP" weapons, may provide the seemingly contradictory
capability of systems that are both precise and have the net
consequence of imposing massive disruption, destruction, or
damage. This damage goes beyond the loss of power grids and other
easily identifiable industrial targeting sets. Loss of all
communications can have a massively destructive impact even
though physical destruction can be relatively limited.</p>

<p>In some of the examples, the objective is to apply brutal
levels of power and force to achieve Shock and Awe. In the
attempt to keep war "immaculate," at least in limiting collateral
damage, one point should not be forgotten. Above all, war is a
nasty business or, as Sherman put it, "war is hell." While there
are surely humanitarian considerations that cannot or should not
be ignored, the ability to Shock and Awe ultimately rests in the
ability to frighten, scare, intimidate, and disarm. The
Clausewitzian dictum concerning the violent nature of war is
dismissed only at our peril.</p>

<p>For a policy maker in the White House or Pentagon and the
concerned Member of Congress with responsibility for providing
for the common defense, what lessons emerge from these examples
and hierarchies? First, there are always broader sets of
operational concepts and constructs available for achieving
political objectives than may be realized. Not all of these
alternatives are necessarily better or feasible. However, the
examples suggest that further intellectual and conceptual effort
is a worthwhile investment in dealing with national security
options in the future.</p>

<p>Second, time becomes an opportunity as well as a constraint in
generating new thinking. In many past cases, time was generally
viewed as an adversary. We had to race against several clocks to
arrive "firstest with the mostest," to prevent an enemy from
advancing, or to ensure we had ample forces on station should
they be required. Rapid Dominance would alleviate many of these
constraints as we would have the capacity to deploy effective
forces far more quickly. Therefore, in this case, we can view
time as an ally. The political issue rests in longstanding
arguments to limit the President from having the capacity to
deploy or use force quickly, thereby involving the nation without
conferring with full consultation with Congress. While this is an
obvious point, it should not eliminate alternative types of force
packages derived from Rapid Dominance from full consideration and
experimentation. Indeed, our experience with nuclear weapons and
emergency release procedures shows that delegating instant
presidential authority can be handled responsibly.</p>

<p>Responding to the precise, rapid, and massive criteria of
several models, it is clear that one capability not presently in
the arsenal is a "zero-CEP" weapon, meaning one that is precise
and timely. It is also clear that, while deception, guile, and
brilliance are important attributes in war, there are no
guarantees that they can be institutionalized in any military
force.</p>

<p>Another capability that Rapid Dominance would stress relates
to the Sun Tzu example. Suppose there are "EMP-like" or High
Powered Microwave (HPM) systems that can be fielded and provide
broad ability to incapacitate even a relatively primitive
society. In using these weapons, the nerve centers of that
society would be attacked rather than using this illustrative
system to achieve hard target kill because there were few hard
targets. To be sure, HPM and EMP-like systems have been and are
being carefully researched.</p>

<p>Finally, to return to the idea that deception, disinformation,
and misinformation are crucial aspects of waging war, Rapid
Dominance would seek to achieve several further capabilities. By
using complete signature management, larger formations could be
made to look like smaller and smaller formations made to seem
larger. At sea, carrier battle groups could be disguised and
smaller warships could be made to appear as large formations.
This signature management would apply across the entire spectrum
of the senses and not just radar or electronic ranges. Indeed,
gaining the ability to regulate what information and intelligence
are both available and not available to the adversary is a key
aim. This is more than denial or deception. It is control in the
fullest sense of the word.</p>

<p>The next step is to match the four significant characteristics
that define Rapid Dominance- knowledge, rapidity, brilliance, and
control-with Shock and Awe against achievable military objectives
in order to derive suitable strategies and doctrines, configure
forces and force packages accordingly, and determine those
integrated systems and innovative uses of technologies and
capabilities that will provide the necessary means to achieve
these objectives in conditions that include both the MRC and
OOTW.</p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="ch_03"></a>Strategic, Policy, and
Operational Application</h1>

<p>In assessing the future utility and applicability of Rapid
Dominance, it is crucial to consider the political context in
which force is likely to be employed. As we enter the next
century, the probability is low that an overriding, massive,
direct threat posed by a peer-competitor to the U.S. will emerge
in the near term. Without compelling reasons, public tolerance
toward American sacrifice abroad will remain low and may even
decrease. This reluctance on the part of Americans to tolerate
pain is directly correlated to perceptions of threat to U.S.
interests. Without a clear and present danger, the definition of
national interest may remain narrow.</p>

<p>Americans have always appreciated rapid and decisive military
solutions. But, many challenges or crises in the future are
likely to be marginal to U.S. interests and therefore may not be
resolvable before American political staying power is exhausted.
In this period, political micro-management and fine tuning are
likely to be even more prevalent as administrations respond to
public sentiments for minimizing casualties and, without a threat
or compelling reason, U.S. involvement.</p>

<p>Future actions and measures may likely reflect "politically
correct" alternatives. In 1991, the Gulf War came close to
presenting the nearly optimal situation for prosecution to a
decisive and irreversible conclusion. Such a course, however, was
not politically feasible because it would have shattered the
allied coalition while exceeding the authority of the UN mandate.
Military operations that impact across a whole population or
cause "innocent civilians" to suffer (e.g., some economic
sanctions, collateral damage from raids) also are likely to be
only politically acceptable in aggravated situations. For
example, if economic sanctions cause malnutrition or other health
problems or collateral damage from bombing or shelling impacts
hospitals, schools, orphanages, or refugee camps, the policy may
be the ultimate victim.</p>

<p>The U.S. military is more likely to find itself in a
supporting foreign policy role with discrete missions that are
only one facet of a larger political context. This context is
almost certainly going to expand into militarily grey areas of
OOTW, including those impinging on law enforcement and ensuring
political stability. Forces may be called upon to deal with or
control situations on the margin rather than to achieve total
submission or defeat of an opponent. The prevailing political
preference is likely to continue to be to try to bound these
complex challenges through fine tuning, artificial constructs,
and discretely limited tasks, often performed in the midst of
internal conflict. Economic sanctions (e.g., Serbia, Iraq), "no
fly" zones (e.g., Southern and Northern Iraq and Bosnia), "safe
havens" (e.g., Bosnia), humanitarian relief delivered by "all
means necessary" (e.g., Somalia, Bosnia), and embassy protection
and evacuation (e.g., Liberia in 1991 and again in 1996) are the
kinds of OOTW tasks more likely to be assigned by policy makers.
Such tasks tend to be inconclusive and of long duration. They
also increase vulnerability to terrorist attack such as the
bombing of the Kolbah Barracks in Riyadh in June 1996.</p>

<p>Americans prefer not to intervene, especially when the direct
threat to the U.S. is ambiguous, tenuous, or difficult to define.
Therefore, when intervention is necessary there is likely to be
both a political and practical imperative to have allied or
international involvement or at least the political cover of the
UN, NATO, or appropriate NGOs.</p>

<p>As more states (and sub-national groups) acquire nuclear,
chemical, and biological weapons of mass destruction (WMD)
capabilities and longer range delivery means, the ability for
rogues to inflict pain will increase as will the ability to
ratchet up the political risks. WMD can easily complicate our
ability to influence positive and constructive behavior of
possessors. Because of the threat of retaliation, WMD
capabilities may become politically acceptable targets provided
collateral damage to civilians is minimized. Preemption may
become a more realistic option along the lines of Israel's
strikes against Syria's nuclear reactors in 1982. It is, however,
a responsible state's worst nightmare to have successfully struck
a chemical, biological, or nuclear production facility with
precision only to learn the next day that hundreds of civilians
have been killed due to the inadvertent release of chemical,
biological, or nuclear materials.</p>

<p>There must also be an appropriate political context that
justifies the use of preemptive force, as opposed to less
destructive or non-lethal types of sanctions (e.g., responses to
terrorism in the case of Libya, invasion of Kuwait by Iraq,
exports of WMD to a threatening country such as Iran, the North
Korean threat to South Korea and Japan).</p>

<p>The U.S. will, nevertheless, need to maintain the capability
to deter and defeat both strategic and other direct threats to
its vital interests, preferably on a decisive basis. In an
unsettled, less structured, and volatile world, the ability to
use force with precision, effectiveness, impunity, and, when
needed, rapidity, will still be a powerful influence on
cooperation, stability, and, where relevant, submission.</p>

<p>Imposing Rapid Dominance on a nation, group, or situation, if
achievable, will be a highly desirable and relevant asset in this
turbulent period. Bosnia offers an example. At the outset of the
breakup of Yugoslavia, if we had had this type of capability,
without potentially high costs, to counter effectively the widely
predicted invasion of Bosnia, the U.S. strategy for dealing with
that tangled and messy situation might have been much different.
Thousands of lives might have been spared. In other grey or
marginal situations Rapid Dominance could make the difference
between a politically acceptable response or inadequate action
with consequences similar to what happened in Bosnia.</p>

<p>In considering how Rapid Dominance might apply and might be
used, it is first important to know what it is that we want to
achieve with military force. We need to consider whether the
application of force will allow us to influence and control an
adversary's will or merely exacerbate a bad situation. Therefore,
it is essential to know what is of value to that adversary. An
objective, realistic, and in-depth situational grasp will be
essential to such an understanding. For example, disarming or
destroying may produce unintended consequences. For a
conventional foe that values its military and depends on
technology, Rapid Dominance should be particularly effective and
persuasive. In the case of less developed nations, however, the
opportunity for exercising influence in this way and against
military formations may be considerably less and must be
carefully assessed.</p>

<p>As noted, in cases of marginal direct threats to U.S.
security, the cost in casualties needs to be low. To be
effective, we must take away an opponent's ability to make it
cost us in terms of casualty levels we consider intolerable. In
applying Rapid Dominance we also must be defending something
which is of value to us. The lower the value in terms of our
national interests, the lower the price we are likely to be
willing to pay.</p>

<p>In MRC situations, we need to have the capability to defeat,
destroy, or incapacitate an opponent. On the other hand, in OOTW,
other non-military factors are likely to be involved and goals
made more limited. For example, it may be necessary to intimidate
or capture the leadership in order to restore order or reverse an
action, or it may simply be necessary to anticipate, prevent, and
counter opposition to conduct of a more limited mission (e.g.,
feeding the starving or protecting innocent people from
genocide).</p>

<p>In U.S. planning for OOTW, it is a virtual given that risk
will be minimized and there will be a discrete and proportional
use of force with minimal collateral damage. This means that
there must be a belief that a mission can be accomplished and is
worth the resources necessary to do so. Before initiating action
in these often confusing situations, objectives must be clearly
established and, once engaged, there should be a willingness to
persevere through the inevitable rough patches.</p>

<p>Whether in an MRC or in OOTW, we first will need to know what
we want to achieve with Rapid Dominance. This is a task for
political leadership which is informed with military advice
concerning what is feasible, what is not, and what is uncertain.
The extent of the mission must be clearly defined. Is it to
defeat an enemy so it will no longer pose a threat? Do we only
need to stop an adversary from carrying out a particular act?
Must we control a situation entirely or only sufficiently to be
able to carry out a specific mission? Can we really affect the
adversary's will?</p>

<p>Recent events give us examples of outcomes likely to be
relevant in the future. MRCs call for the full spectrum of
outcomes-from reversing military action (e.g., the invasion of
Kuwait); to establishing a government more acceptable to the U.S.
and the world, probably using military coercion (Haiti, Panama);
to eliminating a threat to the U.S. or its allies. We may want to
persuade an adversary to cease an aggression or act of
interference or otherwise change behavior we cannot accept or
tolerate. Political expectations in MRCs are for the effective
use of force and for rapid success or at least steady progress.
Casualties should be moderate or at least acceptable, with the
threshold of American pain dependent on the directness of the
threat to U.S. interests and with the degree of compellance
appropriate to the political rationale.</p>

<p>OOTW present a different set of challenges. These challenges
are likely to require discrete dominance of specific
circumstances rather than total dominance. The general tasks may
include a wide variety of requirements. For example, it may be
necessary to try to prevent or stop genocide (e.g., Rwanda) and
ethnic cleansing (e.g., Bosnia). The task may be to cooperate
with a humanitarian relief effort (e.g., prevention of starvation
in Somalia or Bosnia). The goal of employing force may be free
and fair elections (e.g., Cambodia, Bosnia). The requirement
could be to destroy a limited objective (e.g., an above-ground or
underground chemical weapons plant or documented nuclear weapons
facilities developed by hostile or unfriendly states).</p>

<p>Other tasks could simply be to preserve international rights
(e.g., protecting the neutral shipping of the western oil flow in
the Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war). A more testing challenge
might be to accomplish a limited political goal (e.g., gesture to
deal with Israeli incursion in Lebanon in 1982). We undoubtedly
will face the future requirement to reverse a potential threat to
Americans or to a region of importance with a limited military
action (e.g., in Grenada in 1983 or the Mayaguez rescue in
Cambodia in 1975). Discrete moves to bolster preventive diplomacy
and/or overt measures to demonstrate preparedness to assist
(e.g., forces sent to Sudan to support Chad under threat of
invasion from Libya and recent Navy operations in the Taiwan
Strait) will still be relevant.</p>

<p>Countering terrorism also will be part of a continuing agenda
(hostage rescue-e.g., Iran, Lebanon; hijacking-e.g., <em>Achille
Lauro</em>; deterrent to further moves-e.g., the Higgins
operation, Libyan raids, missile attack on Iraq after the threat
to former President Bush). We may also need to interdict weapons,
terrorists, or other discrete cargoes moving between nations
(e.g., North Korean missile shipments to Iran, Iranian and Libyan
arms exchanges).</p>

<p>Economic sanctions are likely to continue to be a preferable
political alternative or a necessary political prelude to an
offensive military step (e.g., implemented as the first step in
actions to counter Libyan-sponsored terrorism; tried first as an
alternative to war with Iraq; used ineffectively against the
Serbs to try to convince them not to continue to support Bosnian
Serb aggression; and tried with Haiti as an unsuccessful
alternative to occupation). Our past experience has been that we
seldom have had decisive or immediate results from these economic
measures, sanctions, and embargoes. Considerable time is required
to have impact and we have not been particularly efficient in
controlling the leakage and spillover in these situations.
Sanctions almost always require full international cooperation
which cannot be assumed or guaranteed. In Bosnia, of course, some
portions of the arms embargo were deliberately allowed to be
permeable and the U.S. turned a blind eye to Iran's support of
the Bosnians.</p>

<p>Past experience also has taught us some relevant lessons about
the potential of Shock and Awe. Improvements in the capabilities
enhancing these outcomes could make a decisive difference in
dealing with future challenges. History also cautions us as well
that there will be restraints in employing Rapid Dominance and
that there are fundamental differences in MRC and OOTW
applications.</p>

<p>Shock and Awe, when properly applied, have been very effective
in the past. They will be effective in the future, even when
applied in limited ways that do not reflect the more encompassing
impact envisioned by Rapid Dominance. There are many examples of
how a very limited application of force made a significant
difference through the mechanisms of Shock and Awe. Experiences,
including successes and failures, illustrate some of the
potential of Rapid Dominance if implemented effectively.</p>

<p>The Vietnam War provides certain lessons. When B-52 strikes,
which made the ground rumble, were added to the equation during
the Christmas 1972 bombing of Hanoi, dragging negotiations with
the North Vietnamese on a peace agreement moved swiftly to an
acceptable conclusion. Daily reports following the controversial
B-52 "carpet" bombing raids in Cambodia talked of North
Vietnamese/Vietcong soldiers wandering around in a daze due to
shock and concussion. Both B-52s and naval gunfire, especially
from 16 inch guns of a battleship, had a similar impact on
invading North Vietnamese troop concentrations. The mining of
Haiphong Harbor, although initiated late in the war, was equally
effective in immediately stopping shipping in and out of North
Vietnam.</p>

<p>When President Nixon wanted to deal with the perplexing
problems of our POWs and failing domestic morale, as well as take
away substantial political leverage from the North Vietnamese, he
directed the raid to rescue prisoners jailed just outside Hanoi.
The raid itself was well executed. American forces reached and
searched the prison and returned safely. But no Americans were
freed because a last minute transfer of the POWs from the prison
had not been detected. If there had been prisoners still there to
be rescued, the operation would have been a highly dramatic and
influential event. The point is that accurate and timely
intelligence remains crucial.</p>

<p>There seems to be little doubt that the combined F-111 and
naval air strike against Libya in 1986 in response to the
discotheque terrorist attack in Germany gave Gadhafi pause. The
perception that he personally might be targeted appeared to get
Gadhafi's attention.</p>

<p>When our troops were having difficulty dislodging Grenadian
soldiers from their main fortress, Marine tanks were sailed
around the island to confront them. At the sight of tank guns,
the seemingly stubborn occupants surrendered almost immediately
without a fight.</p>

<p>The cease fire in the bloody Iran-Iraq war was quick to follow
after the commencement of daily Iraqi long-range rocket
bombardments of Tehran that amounted to a reign of terror. Given
that both sides were exhausted at that point, a show of force
could have been convincing. Strong U.S. action in response to
Iran's mining of neutral waters may also have had a sobering
effect on the mullahs. Not only were Iran's vulnerable
oil-producing platforms in the Gulf boarded and destroyed with
impunity by the U.S., but Iranian naval forces that had come out
to challenge the U.S. Navy were destroyed. Iraq's reign of
terror, and the strong American message to Iran, possibly helped
end the war.</p>

<p>In our troublesome stay in Somalia, AC-130 gunships earned
immediate respect from potential troublemakers with their ability
to see wide areas night or day, remain on station for hours as
night patrols, and strike with precision and relative impunity.
The methodical drone of AC-130s circling in the air was enough to
restore some order, although a few civilians found the noise
unsettling. In another situation, the aftermath of systematic UN
efforts to destroy faction leader Mohamed Aideed's illegal arms
facilities generated an unexpected reaction from other warlords,
including those colluding with him, which was to volunteer to
hand over their own weapons storage areas. For a fleeting moment,
Shock and Awe created an important opportunity.</p>

<p>During the many vagaries of the Bosnia tragedy, it would
appear that when NATO accurately delivered potent doses of air
power, rather than occasional pin pricks, the Serbs seemed
finally to understand that an appearance of cooperation rather
than defiance was in their interest. This NATO message in the
form of air power, of course, was strengthened by the
effectiveness of the accompanying Croatian/Muslim
counter-offensive and the fatigue of Bosnian Serb fighters.
Sustaining the shock effect with forces on the ground was a
necessary combination to gain the staying power effect to change
the will of the Serbs. It was not accomplished by air alone.
Timing remains important.</p>

<p>Past failures also offer examples of how Rapid Dominance might
have made a difference in reacting to those difficult situations.
Rapid Dominance might have provided a better response to those
setbacks or might have offered a more effective alternative that
would have avoided the vulnerabilities in those situations in the
first place (e.g., Bay of Pigs, Iran embassy rescue in 1980,
Lebanon Marine barracks bombing in 1983, response to the Pueblo
seizure by North Korea in 1968, and the reaction to the downed
helicopters during the Ranger raid in Somalia).</p>

<p>We should also learn from other states who have demonstrated
effective application of the characteristics of Rapid Dominance.
Israel's rout of Syria's air force and missile defenses in
Lebanon's Baaka Valley shows how dramatic success can have
political spillover. On the other hand, Japan's surprise attack
on Pearl Harbor produced the reverse effects of Shock and Awe and
had the unintended consequence of galvanizing the U.S. into
action.</p>

<p>Even without a Rapid Dominance capability or when facing a
more technologically dependent opponent, it is clear from these
examples and many others in recent U.S. experiences that certain
improvements in capabilities would provide us with greater
flexibility in the future. This is especially true in OOTW
situations, which require a multiplicity of effective instruments
at our disposal. It is also true that certain operations such as
peacekeeping tend to be manpower intensive.</p>

<p>If we are to stay ahead of an adversary and deny things of
value to that adversary, dynamic, accurate, and integrated
intelligence is essential. Intelligence needs to move to levels
unprecedented in scope, timeliness, accuracy, and availability in
real time. The Gulf War, despite its success, showed classic
limitations in intelligence. Even though we had nearly every
intelligence asset designed to deal with the USSR available for
use, we were unable to detect the full extent of Iraq's WMD
capability; unable to find mobile missile launchers even with a
major expenditure of on-scene assets; in some cases, we could
only "see" kilometers in front of our advancing forces; and we
mistakenly attacked targets we thought were legitimate but had
civilians inside. In some instances, only reliable human
intelligence may provide the necessary information (for example,
in order to understand what is happening in deep underground
facilities).</p>

<p>Another important capability we should try to achieve in the
future is the ability to intimidate, capture, convince, or
significantly influence the perceptions and understanding of
individual troublemakers. This need has been demonstrated
repeatedly in recent years (e.g., Gadhafi in Libya, Aideed in
Somalia, Saddam Hussein in Iraq, Noreiga in Panama). Such a
perception is particularly relevant when the problem appears not
to be caused by a unified population but by the ambitions of
individual leaders who have intimidated or killed off any likely
internal opposition. Such a capability requires effective
real-time intelligence and a variety of methods for accomplishing
the task (from exceptionally precise weapons to effective
"snatch" operations).</p>

<p>In a world in which non-lethal sanctions are a political
imperative, we will continue to need the ability to shut down all
commerce into and out of any country from shipping, air, rail,
and roads. We ought to be able to do this in a much more
thorough, decisive, and shocking way than we have in the past.
The ability to apply pressure or cause acquiescence employing
non-lethal means also will be important in some circumstances.
Weapons that shock and awe, stun and paralyze, but do not kill in
significant numbers may be the only ones that are politically
acceptable in the future. This also means that crowd control with
minimum violence may be needed. In certain circumstances, the
costs of having to resort to lethal force may be too politically
expensive in terms of local support as well as support in the
U.S. and internationally.</p>

<p>As is already well recognized, we need to be able to shut down
key electronic communications to, from, and within a country (or
within a specific sub-group or faction). We also need the ability
to control radio and television within a country. It is
important, however, in all cases, to be able to deny an
adversary's ability to communicate and to have our own means of
reaching the population with appropriate messages.</p>

<p>In addition to being able to eliminate military capabilities
selectively, including weapons systems, overt and covert
stockpiles, fuel, WMD, and related logistics, we will need to
have the capability selectively to incapacitate, neutralize, or
destroy other things considered of great value to opponents.
Increased targeting precision will compound effectiveness as well
as help to avoid the political pitfalls of using force such as
the inevitable, unintended collateral damage that has been the
pattern of the past.</p>

<p>More surgical and carefully crafted applications of force,
however, will only partially reduce the restraints and limits on
utilizing Rapid Dominance in MRCs and OOTW. There are substantial
differences in the political constraints likely to be imposed in
dealing with MRCs and with OOTW. For example, there is much
greater latitude to use dominant force and Shock and Awe in MRCs
than in OOTW.</p>

<p>In MRC situations, we are often likely to face conventional
powers which are well organized, well equipped, and broadly
dependent on technology. Although more powerful, these developed
states are also likely to be especially vulnerable to a
technologically sophisticated approach such as Rapid Dominance as
long as we maintain this military edge and the ability to
neutralize their military systems. Even in the most compelling
circumstance where a Rapid Dominance force is used, however,
support from other nations will be politically desirable.</p>

<p>In most circumstances there will be limits to the targets of
value to an adversary which can be destroyed as well as to the
numbers and types of weapons that can be employed. For example,
the political circumstances in which nuclear weapons could be
employed are quite limited. In both MRCs and OOTW, certain
actions are politically as well as morally unacceptable except in
extreme cases. Such restrictions are likely to apply to targets
affecting control of access to food, water, and clean air, and to
destruction of religious and cultural centers, even if there is
low collateral damage.</p>

<p>In OOTW situations, we are much more vulnerable to criticism
of using excessive force, especially if there is civilian or
collateral damage. The concept of proportionality is likely to
remain an operative principle in U.S. policy and may be taken to
extremes, especially if the marginal nature of a situation leads
to a marginal and ineffective response. Some people, both
military and civilian, even argue that superior technology should
not be employed in such situations and that an adversary should
be fought on his own terms. While such arguments should be
rejected, they nonetheless sometimes have a political influence
that must be considered. We should always use technology to
minimize our casualties, give us every advantage, reduce
collateral damage, and make us look more formidable. At the same
time, there needs to be sufficient provocation to warrant
destruction or denial. Our actions must always be consistent with
our own system of values.</p>

<p>The "rapid" component of Rapid Dominance is one of the most
appealing aspects of the concept, both politically and
militarily. The ability to take action that is timely and
decisive multiplies substantially the chances of ultimate
success. Action needs to be taken precisely when it will have
greatest impact. Often initial public outrage and political
support for action in response to a provocation subsides if a
prolonged buildup is necessary in order to prepare to take
action.</p>

<p>The ability to react faster than an adversary, to assimilate
information and act on it effectively, is also an important
advantage. In a NATO region-wide dynamic computer war game a few
years ago, it was clear that the simulated enemy was advancing
faster than the defensive chain of command could make counter
moves. The tradition of sending decisions up the line was simply
too slow to cope with the dynamic challenge posed by the
adversary. Commanders on scene lacked the authority to respond
and adjust to rapidly changing situations. The exercise
graphically demonstrated to the country involved the need to
institute fundamental command and control streamlining. It also
demonstrated the advantages of being able to make local decisions
in real time while still effectively coordinating and optimizing
the overall effort.</p>

<p>The Navy's "command by negation" concept evolved in the 1980s
in order to deal with the rapidity of the air/missile threat and
the need to integrate dynamically the offensive and defensive
missile, air, sea, and undersea capabilities of a battle group
and its joint components (e.g., AWACs). This concept was one way
of solving the time problem while keeping the overall commander
in the picture. The commander could then intervene and modify
actions as necessary to conform to the broader strategy. This
type of control was helped by the evolution of electronic links
and secure communications and the availability of satellites.</p>

<p>Commanders employing Rapid Dominance will need to orchestrate
it using similar principles, while applying greater selective
ability to turn on and off a variety of systems, sensors, and
devices influencing the whole operational picture. Technology
should also give commanders a much better grasp of what is
evolving during a battle. Just as the American military of today
has made "owning the night" part of its tactical advantage,
"owning" the dimension of time will be critical to the success of
Rapid Dominance.</p>

<p>In conceptual terms, the following is suggestive of a future
force configuration and the design of a mission capability
package (MCP) based on Rapid Dominance.</p>

<h2>Operational Construct</h2>

<p>Rapid Dominance is based on affecting the adversary's will,
perception, and knowledge through imposing sufficient Shock and
Awe to overcome resistance, allowing us to achieve our aims. Four
characteristics are vital: knowledge, rapidity, brilliance, and
control of the environment.</p>

<p>Application of all or of selective capabilities within the
Rapid Dominance systems of systems will then decisively direct
the application of military/defense resources and produce the
requisite outcome. Rapid Dominance envisages the execution of
specific actions in real or near real time to counter actions or
intentions deemed detrimental to U.S. interests. On the high end
of conflict, Rapid Dominance would introduce a reaction of Shock
and Awe in areas of highest value to the threatening individual,
group, or state. In many cases, prior understanding of the power
of Rapid Dominance would act as a deterrent to the objectionable
action. When used, Rapid Dominance would ensure favorable early
resolution of issues with minimal loss of lives and collateral
damage. The concept theoretically should be able to impact
adversarial situations that apply across the board to high, mid,
low, no, or minimal technology threats.</p>

<p>Rapid Dominance expands the art of joint combined arms war
fighting capabilities to a new level. Rapid Dominance requires a
sophisticated, interconnected, and interoperable grid of netted
intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, communications
systems, data analysis, and real-time deliverable actionable
information to the shooter. This network must provide total
situational awareness and supporting nodal analysis that enables
U.S. forces to act inside the adversary's decision loop in a
manner that on the high end produces Shock and Awe among the
threat parties. Properly detailed nodal analysis of this
knowledge grid will enable the shutting down of specific
functions or all essential functions near simultaneously. This
will often times be netted pieces of data where the sum of the
parts gives the answer and the battlefield advantage to the force
possessing this rapidly netted information.</p>

<p>The "rapid" part of the equation becomes the ability to get
real-time actionable targeting information to the appropriate
shooter, whether the shooter is a tank division, an individual
tank, an artillery battery, an individual rifle man, a naval
battle group, an individual ship, an air wing/squadron, or an
aircraft in flight. This means the need to have the right shooter
in the right place; locating and identifying the target correctly
and quickly; allocating and assigning targets rapidly; getting
the "shoot" order or general authority to the shooter; and then
assessing the battle damage accurately.</p>

<p>At whatever the unit level, Shock and Awe are provided by the
speed and effectiveness of this cycle. Then, the ability to do
this simultaneously throughout the battlefield creates a
strategic Shock and Awe on the opposing forces, their leadership,
and populous. This simultaneity and concurrency are central
tenets of imposing Shock and Awe. When the video results of these
attacks are broadcast in real time worldwide on CNN, the positive
impact on coalition support and negative impact on potential
threat support can be decisive.</p>

<p>The first priority of a doctrine of Rapid Dominance should be
to deter, alter, or affect the will and therefore those actions
that are either unacceptable to U.S. national security interests
or endanger the democratic community of states and access to free
markets. These political objectives are generally those
envisioned in the major and lower regional conflict scenarios
(MRC &amp; LRC). Should deterrence fail, the application of Rapid
Dominance in these circumstances should create sufficient Shock
and Awe to the immediate threat forces and leadership as well as
provide a clear message for other potential threat partners. The
doctrine of Rapid Dominance would not be limited to MRC and LRC
scenarios. It has applications in a variety of areas such as
countering WMD, terrorism, and perhaps other tasks. The challenge
is that should deterrence fail, the execution of a response based
on Rapid Dominance must be proportional to the threat, yet
decisive enough to convey the right degree of Shock and Awe.
Rapid Dominance cannot solve all or even most of the world's
problems. We repeat our disclaimer that this is not a silver
bullet. However, Rapid Dominance and its capacity for achieving
Shock and Awe could be applied for egregious threats or
violations of international law, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Direct military threats to the territory of the U.S., its
friends, and allies;</li>

<li>Blatant aggression involving a large state crushing a small
state;</li>

<li>Rogue leader/state sponsored terrorism/use of WMD;</li>

<li>Egregious violations of human rights on a large scale;
and</li>

<li>Threat to essential world markets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly, the Information Highway is crossing all sovereign
borders and penetrating even the most closed societies. The
inequities and benefits in all societies are becoming known to
the masses as well as the power brokers. The requirement for
Rapid Dominance to develop sophisticated capabilities to
penetrate the Information Highway and create road blocks as well
as control inputs/outputs to the highway both overtly and
covertly is fundamental to the concept.</p>

<p>These same techniques also apply to law enforcement agencies
targeting international crime and drug cartels using the highway.
Closer interagency cooperations and coordination between military
and law enforcement activities and capabilities must be
established. Experience with the military involvement in the drug
war revealed considerable cultural differences between these
organizations. Overcoming these cultural differences among
organizations is not easy. The required trust and confidence for
sharing sensitive information and support between these agencies
and the military needs to be developed further. Interagency
coordination and cooperation must be raised to a new level of
sophistication. Some laws may need to be changed. War in
Cyberspace does not recognize domestic or foreign boundaries. In
this environment the subjects of Information Warfare and
Information In Warfare take on new meaning and require focused
development. We must become proficient within this
environment.</p>

<h2>Operational Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
<li>The enemy picks the time and place to initiate the conflict
(i.e., we are surprised).</li>

<li>We then attain control of the initiative through superior
speed, knowledge, and capacity to act and react.</li>

<li>Our forces are perceived to be invincible; engagements must
convince the enemy there is no hope.</li>

<li>Combat must be unrelenting and omnipresent at times, places,
and tempo of choosing.</li>

<li>Allied operations must be thoroughly integrated, from
political objectives through combat to include psychological
warfare.</li>

<li>The enemy must be hit in those areas of greatest importance
to him and devastated by the ferocity and swiftness of our
attack.</li>
</ul>

<p>From these assumptions, certain operational criteria follow
that help to define a Rapid Dominance Force with more specificity
in improving:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intelligence, indications, and warning on an aggressor's
actions</li>

<li>The length of time required for a decision to react</li>

<li>Decisive responses at various levels and times after the
crises or conflict begins to develop:

<ul>
<li>Respond in 1 to 3 days with air and missile strikes and
special forces</li>

<li>Respond in 5 to 10 days with more massive power up to and
including a joint task force of corps size</li>

<li>Respond in 10 to 30 days with a second corps</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Rapid Dominance MCP</h2>

<p>As a next step, we need to sketch out what a Rapid Dominance
Force might look like for a corps-sized air, ground, sea, and
space joint task force supported by necessary intelligence assets
that can impose sufficient Shock and Awe to break the will of the
adversary. First, this force will emphasize capabilities to
maximize the core characteristics of knowledge of self,
adversary, and environment; rapidity; brilliance in execution;
and control of the environment.</p>

<p>Knowledge means more than dominant battlefield awareness. It
means understanding the adversary's mind and anticipating his
reactions. It means targeting those things that will produce the
intended Shock and Awe. And, it means having feedback and good,
timely battle assessment to enable knowledge to be used
dynamically as well as to know how our forces will react.</p>

<p>Rapidity means moving and acting as quickly as necessary and
always on a timely basis. Rapidity can be instant or as
required.</p>

<p>Brilliance in operations means achieving the highest standards
of operational competence and, through a superiority of
knowledge, maintaining the ability to impose Shock and Awe
through continuously surprising and psychologically and
physically breaking the adversary's will to resist. This will
require training and exercising of joint land, sea, air, space,
and special forces to new standards of excellence and competence.
It is mainly in training where the difference lies in achieving
operational brilliance. This desired standard of performance can
be achieved by making innovations to permit new levels of
battlefield fidelity for training units and developing
leaders.</p>

<p>Control of the environment would include complete signature
control on the entire battle area out to hundreds of miles. We
would control our signatures as well as what we wanted the
adversary to see or hear and what we do not want the enemy to
know. Destruction of the adversary's systems would begin with
long-range stealthy, or "stand-off" Zero CEP weapons, extend to
FOG-M type battlefield weapons to close-in systems. Small units
would be able to call in "fires" for 360 degrees on a nearly
instant basis.</p>

<p>Attacks from all aspects would be complemented by deception,
disinformation, surveillance, targeting, and killing. "Pulse"
weapons would be used to disarm and actively deceive the enemy
through disrupting and attacking all aspects of the adversary's
electronics, information, and C4I infrastructure. It is this "lay
down" of total power across all areas in rapid and simultaneous
actions that would impose the Shock and Awe.</p>

<p>The remainder, roughly a third of this Joint Task Force, would
consist of traditional platforms including conventional ground,
air, and amphibious forces, naval battle group forces, and the
necessary supporting logistical, C4I, medical and other
capabilities and ground forces to conduct and sustain
conventional or traditional operations if needed and to support
or defend traditionally vulnerable targets such as ports, roads,
and other infrastructure.</p>

<p>Tactical employment is, of course, dependent on the conditions
of the MRC. In general, the most rapidly deployable units of this
corps, the future equivalent of the Eighteenth Airborne Corps,
would be sent to secure or reinforce a limited area into which
the remainder of the force would flow. This AOR would be
self-protected. Our goal is that perhaps a Rapid Dominance force
of as few as 2,000 troops could successfully defend against an
enemy of 10-20,000 in an MRC and that a full corps can be
deployed within 5 to 10 days.</p>

<p>These units would arrive quickly and, as directed, begin
disarming, destroying, and disabling the enemy's military
wherewithal using "stand-off" capabilities. Forward-based or
long-range reconnaissance units could be employed/supported by
UAVs and overhead surveillance.</p>

<p>Units would be forward deployed in accordance with their time
phased plan. These units would be used either to complete the
attack or to carry it to the adversary, occupy selective
territory physically, or carry out the requirements of the
post-war occupation campaign. Should traditional forces be
needed, they would of course be available.</p>

<p>Protection and self-defense would partly be provided by
controlling the environment. In effect, we would cast a cloak
around the adversary and permit the adversary to see and know
what we alone provided. This would leave an adversary blind,
deaf, and dumb. With superior and rapid firepower, the blinded,
deafened enemy would be destroyed and defeated as we saw fit.
This would maximize Shock and Awe and help break the adversary's
will.</p>

<p>In OOTW, the Rapid Dominance JTF might function as follows.
First, the ability to deploy dominant force rapidly to attack or
threaten to attack appropriate targets could be brought to bear
without involving manpower-intense or manned sensors and weapons.
Second, once deployed, since self-defense is likely to be
required against small arms, mines, and shoulder carried or
mortar weapons, certainly some form of "armor" or protective
vehicles and shelters would be necessary. However, through the
UAVs, C4I, and virtual reality systems, as well as through
signature management and other Shock and Awe weapons including
High Powered Microwave (HPM) and "stun-like" systems, this force
would have more than dominant battlefield awareness.</p>

<p>There are, of course, caveats. Unless strategic or policy
objectives are in line with operational capabilities, military
force is unlikely to be a useful instrument. It is also unlikely
that any operational construct, no matter how brilliantly
conceived, could overcome such a disconnect. Vietnam and Somalia
remind us of these limitations.</p>

<p>The assimilation of intelligence-strategically, culturally,
and operationally-is a central thrust and component of the
knowledge aspect of Rapid Dominance. Our forces must not only
fight smarter; these forces, at all or most levels, must be
educated and trained differently with far more emphasis on
intelligence, broadly defined. This knowledge, when applied
rapidly under conditions of brilliance and in a controlled
environment, is a centerpiece of Rapid Dominance.</p>

<p>There must be full comprehension of the adversary across
strategic, political, military, cultural, intellectual, and
perceptual lines. This understanding must go beyond how an
adversary might use military force. Those crucial values that
motivate and underlie a nation or a group must be understood if
the appropriate level of Shock and Awe is to be achieved.</p>

<p>There are also obvious questions that must be answered. Does
Rapid Dominance apply only or mostly to the high end of the
conflict spectrum involving more traditional applications of
force to achieve political objectives, as envisioned in the MRC
and LRC scenarios? Yet to be explored is the degree to which a
concept of Rapid Dominance with Shock and Awe applies to OOTW,
countering terrorism against U.S. interests, controlling rogue
states/leaders, etc. What are the political and military
prerequisites to apply Rapid Dominance? Are they applicable and
realistically achievable in the increasingly complex interaction
of national non-government organizations (PVOs/NGOs) present
worldwide to provide health and humanitarian care to refugees and
other disenfranchised people? Would the concept of Rapid
Dominance with a degree of Shock and Awe offend and generate
counterproductive public relations backlash from those who
believe force should only be used as a last resort and then with
a measurable degree of proportionality?</p>

<p>At this point, we can only raise questions and expect to have
them answered at a later date. This line of questions, concerns,
and issues as well as a host of others, needs to be examined up
front and answered in the Rapid Dominance concept development
process. We must be careful that we do not overvisualize Rapid
Dominance versus the reality of credible/affordable capabilities
to execute the concept. Rapid Dominance must still confront the
fog of war. Decisions will still be made based on judgment and
confidence in the intelligence provided, the estimate of threat
intentions, knowledge of true center of gravity targets, and
confidence in our own force capabilities to inflict Shock and
Awe. In fact, the key will be the ability to penetrate this fog
with increased clarity and to control events now unmanageable
through more rapid gathering, analyzing, and distributing
actionable information. Complicating the issue is the fact that
the U.S. has not clearly defined its role in the post-Cold War
era. As the world's only credible superpower, the U.S. cannot
avoid a leadership role but neither can it avoid the focused
criticism applied to all leaders. This is the classical "damned
if you do and damned if you don't" syndrome.</p>

<p>At this stage, the concept of Rapid Dominance is a work in
progress. It needs to be "operationalized." By designing a
nominal MCP and fitting with it paper systems and capabilities,
we can explore the answers to many of the questions we raised
above. Three steps are needed to proceed down the road on the way
to a real capability. First, feasibility of the requisite
technical capabilities needs to be established. Second, wargaming
of the MCP must be done. Third, and perhaps most difficult,
deriving the means for implementing the most promising aspects of
Rapid Dominance must occur.</p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="ch_04"></a>An Outline for System
Innovation and Technological Integration</h1>

<p>Achieving Shock and Awe is central to Rapid Dominance, and
therefore must serve as the key organizing principle for any
rigorous examination and exploitation of system concepts and
technologies for Rapid Dominance. Understanding the interplay
between technology and doctrine is not only or simply a
straightforward matter of establishing operational requirements
and then seeking to attain them through invention and design. It
is a complex and interactive process of experimentation and
discovery wherein intellect, hard work, endurance, and innovation
must drive the use of technology. Rather than make changes,
however significant, to modifying current capabilities or
building newer, similar ones, Rapid Dominance seeks to identify
and field systems specifically designed to achieve Shock and
Awe-systems that may break the mold much as the Model T Ford once
did years ago.</p>

<p>The genetic decoders in bioengineering laboratories,
computer-aided design tools used by engineers, vast database
management systems in place in corporate offices,
computer-controlled machines enabling composite materials, and
the countless academic, business, and personal computers are all
evidence of the prominent and ever increasing role information
technologies have assumed in modern economies. Many of the
technologies underlying the Information Age are being spearheaded
by U.S. small business and its entrepreneurial culture.
Certainly, from the huge consumer electronics firms in Japan to
software development businesses in India, the rest of the world
participates and competes. But few can deny that U.S. industry
provides the leadership in and is the preeminent developer of
information technologies as they are most broadly defined. This
leadership position, properly leveraged, provides the United
States with an ever increasing military advantage over competing
nations.</p>

<p>Leveraging technology requires more than merely incorporating
it into U.S. forces; it is likely to include a significant
redesign of both forces and leadership to embrace these rapidly
evolving technologies. Many of the technologies that will support
Rapid Dominance are already discernible. Unlike the impact of
nuclear weapons, it is unlikely that a single technology or
system will emerge to produce Rapid Dominance. It will only be
attainable through the broadest integration of strategic
concepts, doctrine, operational needs, technological advances,
system design, and appropriate organization of command, control,
training and education. And only a large, immensely capable
country such as the U.S. may be able to achieve this.</p>

<p>Rapid Dominance seeks to integrate this confluence of
strategy, technology, and innovation. Four core characteristics
were defined earlier as crucial:</p>

<ul>
<li>Complete knowledge of self, adversary, and the
environment;</li>

<li>Rapidity;</li>

<li>Brilliance of execution; and</li>

<li>Control of the environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>What follows is illustrative rather than exhaustive of how
technology can be used in a broad system approach. Many of these
technologies currently are being addressed within the defense
community. Analysts, military strategists, acquisition planners,
and even "futurists" are wrestling with the meaning and
consequences of the Information Age. Our focus on systems and
technologies begins with these four characteristics.</p>

<h2>Knowledge of Self, Adversary, and Environment</h2>

<p>In the modern threat environment, it is difficult to estimate
where the next crisis may occur, let alone the next war. Even 5
years ago, who would have foreseen the significant involvement of
the U.S. military in places like Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, Bosnia,
and the South China Sea? To which hot spots can we expect to see
U.S. troops deployed over the next 5 years? Over the next 20? In
this section we argue that, in addition to improving our force
capabilities, the U.S. must develop an intelligence repository
far more extensive than during the Cold War, covering virtually
all the important regions and organizational structures
throughout the world.</p>

<p>During the Cold War, intelligence agencies focused more on a
bipolar world and built sizable organizations to collect
information on "the other side." This same intelligence
structure, in the main, is in place today facing a multipolar
world, where any number of power structures-whether they be
states, international organizations, or even small groups of
individuals-must be monitored with an understanding that extends
to their leadership, culture, economic direction, and military
capability.</p>

<p>As the technologies relevant to knowing the adversary and his
environment are examined, an emerging theme is the clear shift
from technology developments that once resided within our
government to those driven by commercial demands. For example,
the information technologies used by U.S. intelligence agencies
are of such complexity, importance, and expense that they are
referred to as "national assets" and are developed and managed by
large, dedicated organizations. Even here, commercial companies
are rapidly encroaching on what once seemed to be an unassailable
market position in Earth observation systems. One may already
purchase synthetic aperture radar interferometry images from any
number of sources, and panchromatic visual images with one meter
resolution will soon be available over the counter for remarkably
little cost. Indeed, the only real barrier to this burgeoning
market is the understandable concerns that governments have with
allowing such technology to be widely available. In areas such as
encryption and data security, commercial developers are more
likely to reach limits of government acceptance before those of
technological capability.</p>

<p>With untold billions invested in communications systems, even
the most modern U.S. military communication systems often compare
poorly with commercial systems. While this has long been the case
for fielded systems, it is becoming true for even the most
sophisticated research and development programs being undertaken
by defense organizations.</p>

<p>As a case in point, one may consider a program recently
initiated by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) called Battlefield Awareness and Data Dissemination
(BADD). At the heart of this program, large amounts of data are
collected within a vast database residing on commercial computers
and enterprise management systems. This information is then
disseminated to the troops through the commercial Global
Broadcast System (GBS) onto "set-top" boxes, an enabling
technology that was developed commercially. Even with this
leveraging of private industry, there is a real question as to
whether DARPA will be able to field a system that would compete
well with surprisingly similar commercial systems. Internet
channels planned by media industry giants such as BSkyB will
offer multi-megabit, interactive, digital data connections to the
Net merely as an enticement for subscribers to enroll for their
full digital broadcasting service (200 to 300 channels of digital
video and sound). Understanding that there is much more to BADD
than the little discussed here, one still almost wonders whether
DARPA could simply buy a subscription and connect it to an
appropriate, commercial, network management system. More to the
point, if even well funded and aggressive technology development
organizations such as DARPA find it difficult to remain ahead of
commercial advancements, there may be a fundamental lesson to be
learned regarding the management of defense-related
technologies.</p>

<h2>Knowledge and Intelligence</h2>

<p>"Intelligence" is comprised of five categories of knowledge
and understanding: a society's leadership; culture and values;
the strategic, political, economic, and physical environment;
military capabilities and orders of battle; and comprehensive
battlefield information. Examples of technologies and system
approaches of potential relevance in these areas are discussed
below.</p>

<p>Understanding potential adversaries, coalition partners, and
involved neutral countries implies an infrastructure for
acquiring an in-depth knowledge about cultures, leadership
values, and other driving factors that allow us, when needed and
on a timely basis, to get "into their minds." Applicable
technologies include automated language translators, interactive
and autonomous computer simulations, advanced database systems
for organizing and understanding data and transactions of
individuals and institutions, and computerized educational
systems for training and learning these skills.</p>

<p>Collecting sufficient and timely environmental information is
crucial to Rapid Dominance. Logistics, demographics, and
infrastructure are broad areas of collection along with
geography, road/rail/ship lanes, utility sites and corridors,
manufacturing, government sites, military and paramilitary
facilities, population demographics, economic and financial
pressure points (such as oil wells or gold mines), and major dams
and bridges. Technologies used to provide environmental awareness
include traditional means such as satellites that can be
augmented with dynamic sensor management tools for optimizing
observation routines. The vast quantities of data that reside on
the world's computer networks, if properly exploited, provide
another rich source of information. Data mining tools, such as
Web crawlers, gatherers, brokers, and repositories that pull and
organize data from public networks, will be essential to building
a more complete picture of potential adversaries. Since not all
databases and host computers are cooperative with these methods,
offensive information warfare tools will be required to obtain
specific pieces of information that are vital for national
security purposes.</p>

<p>Once data are collected, they must be processed and
disseminated and then stored for future access. Enterprise data
storage and retrieval systems that are capable of working with
many terrabytes (1,000 gigabytes) of information are already
commonplace. Since it is impossible for humans to comprehend such
vast quantities of information without some assistance, data
exploitation tools (filters, fusion, automatic target
recognition, image understanding, etc.) will be crucial
technologies. Finally, the information, once processed, will be
of little use if not disseminated to the right people in a timely
fashion. "Intelligent data" dissemination and wide bandwidth
communications are examples of essential technologies emerging in
this area.</p>

<p>In addition to knowledge about regions and locations where
U.S. force may be applied, it is important to maintain vigilance
and up-to-date knowledge on specific "hot spots" and to have
sufficient flexibility within the system to shift attention
rapidly to new areas. Systems addressing this more time-sensitive
set of tasks would include light, quickly deployable satellites,
high altitude and endurance unmanned aerial vehicles, manned
platforms, and unattended ground sensors.</p>

<p>As a crisis unfolds and the insertion of U.S. troops or other
military action becomes more probable, information needs and the
number of information consumers both increase dramatically.
Information that must be collected and correlated include
targeting, battle damage assessment (BDA), weather, terrain,
infrastructure, tracking of special targets, logistics, position
and status of our own troops, identification friend or foe (IFF),
and status of material. It is vitally important that sufficient
sensor systems work in all weather conditions and at night to
maintain the "operations tempo" required by Rapid Dominance.</p>

<p>Battlefield awareness requires three information technologies:
collection, fusion, and dissemination of real-time actionable
information to a shooter. Rapid Dominance requires an
unprecedented level of real-time information collection that will
be provided by sensor systems such as space platforms, UAVs,
unattended ground sensors, and advanced manned reconnaissance
platforms. In addition, the entire infosphere of the adversary
will be monitored not only for classic information such as
operational commands but also to determine the shock effect being
created by Rapid Dominance operations. Collecting data from
cooperative sources such as one's own troops, allies, and
friendly non-combatants is also critical. While <em>Operation
Desert Storm</em> showed the value of self-location sensors such
as GPS, the friendly fire casualties demonstrated that there is
still work to be done in terms of giving each commander and
soldier sufficient information to operate effectively. Much of
this information, such as the physiological status of individual
combatants, is not currently collected, and much of what is
sensed is not properly disseminated.</p>

<p>It would be hard to overstate the importance of information
dissemination within Rapid Dominance. Administering Shock and Awe
requires a spectrum of attacks that the adversary is unable to
fathom, but our own forces must operate effectively, even
aggressively, within an environment that could easily lead to
serious information bottlenecks and overload. Commercial
technologies will be key to the U.S. developing a structure to
effectively disseminate information. Already, commercial
communications technologies such as global broadcast satellites
and protocols like those underlying the Internet have been used
as stop gaps by the U.S. military in major deployments.</p>

<p>Merely transmitting the right information at the right time
will not be sufficient for operations enabling Rapid Dominance.
Information will need to be fused to create knowledge-based
displays. The technologies that will be important in this area go
beyond the data fusion algorithms currently in place and should
leverage heavily off of technologies in fields such as computer
image generation, virtual reality, and advanced simulation.</p>

<h2>Rapidity</h2>

<p>In a technology sense, rapidity includes the speed of
operational planning, determining appropriate action, deployment,
and employment all focused toward minimizing response time. Three
factors combine to make military planning far more difficult
today than in the Cold War era. First, there is great uncertainty
early on in the location of a conflict, who the adversary may be,
and with whom one may be allied. Second, there is normally very
little time available for planning, with the military sometimes
having only weeks or days before committing troops to an
unanticipated mission. Third, vastly more information is
available to the planner, which is both a blessing and a curse.
Several technologies that partially define Intelligent Dynamic
Planning will make it easier for the commander to plan Rapid
Dominance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Model based planning</li>

<li>Machine intelligence</li>

<li>Dynamic planning based upon feedback and new information</li>

<li>Selectively automated decision aides (commanders
associate)</li>

<li>Imbedded rehearsal and training</li>

<li>Brilliance in Execution</li>
</ul>

<p>It is impossible to institutionalize brilliance. However, the
standard can be set. The Dynamic Planning noted above is part of
the capability for this characteristic as are the systems and
technologies discussed below.</p>

<h3>Technologies Critical to Achieving Brilliance in Rapid
Dominance</h3>

<p>For shock to be administered with minimum collateral damage,
key targets of value must be neutralized or destroyed, and the
enemy must be made to feel completely helpless and unable to
consider a meaningful response. Furthermore, the enemy's
confusion must be complete, adding to a general impression of
impotence. Most importantly, strategic targets, military forces,
leadership and key societal resources must be located, tracked,
and targeted. This will require substantial sensor,
computational, and communication technologies. Designated targets
must be destroyed rapidly and with assurance. Finally, the status
and position of friendly forces must be known at all times, and
the logistics supporting them must be sufficiently flexible to
allow for rapid movement, reconfiguration, and decentralization
of location.</p>

<p>Several technologies that can help in this are discussed
below, as divided into the following subsections: sensors,
computational systems, communications and system integration.</p>

<h3>Sensor Technologies</h3>

<p>Sensor technologies are grouped into four areas: active,
passive, imbedded, and processing.</p>

<p><em>Active sensors:</em> By far, the most important of the
energy-emitting sensors is radar. Among the best all-weather
capabilities of any type of sensor, the role for and capabilities
of radar have steadily increased since the Second World War.
Radar systems are used for early warning, air defense, air asset
management, air traffic control, naval fleet defense, detection
and tracking of moving ground targets, missile targeting, missile
terminal guidance, terrain data development, and weather
prediction. For Rapid Dominance, radars and other active sensors
must operate with low probability of intercept. Particularly with
stealthy systems, this will present a unique challenge to
military systems where one may not expect a great amount of
"spin-on" from the commercial sector. It is vitally important to
be able to sense the enemy under all conditions and environments.
Sensors must penetrate foliage and walls and detect threats such
as underground and underwater mines.</p>

<p>There are many other important active sensor classes, three of
which are active acoustics, lidar and magnetic anomaly detectors.
Broadband underwater active acoustics could address pressing
needs such as shallow-water anti-submarine warfare and mine
detection (both buried and silt covered). The practical
application of lidar is a relatively recent development enabled
by advances in laser, power management, and data processing
technologies. Lidar can be used for fire control, weapon
guidance, foliage penetration (vegetation is translucent in the
near infrared (NIR) regime), and target imaging/recognition.
Lidar detects shape directly and shape fluctuations such as
vibration and motion and has proven very hard to spoof. Magnetic
anomaly detectors will continue to find application in areas of
anti-mine and anti-submarine warfare and in screening for weapons
at security checkpoints and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Electronic emissions are of themselves a liability only where
they create a signature of use to an enemy. The ability to emit
energy, yet in ways that are less discernible, should be an
attractive avenue to explore for the future. The coordinated
application of many sensor platforms, some of which may be
completely passive, in conjunction with emitting sensors is a
potentially major area of exploration.</p>

<p><em>Passive sensors:</em> Among the passive sensor types, the
most important for U.S. forces is forward-looking infrared
(FLIR). FLIR technology has allowed the U.S. to "own the night,"
as was handily displayed in <em>Operation Desert Storm</em>. Some
of the significant technology advancements underway in this area
include multiple wavelength sensors, very large focal planes, and
the increasing performance of uncooled sensors. Particularly in
the area of uncooled sensors, commercial developments are
underway that promise to drastically reduce the cost of competent
IR sensors.</p>

<p>Other passive sensor technologies of note include
hyperspectral visible/NIR collection and processing and
inexpensive, scatterable, unattended ground sensors (acoustic,
seismic, "hot spot," etc.). Hyperspectral imaging allows target
searches to be conducted in the frequency domain, as opposed to
the spatial domain as is the norm today. This provides a powerful
new input for automatic target recognition (ATR) systems, is
useful for addressing low observables (LO), and is especially
important for remote imaging assets.</p>

<p>Unattended ground sensors allow critical areas to be monitored
continually. For example, the actual area of operations for Scuds
in ODS was relatively small, but it was very difficult for
then-current sensing systems to oversee. Technologies being
developed in the area of microelectromechanical systems, in
particular, hold promise for enabling capable and inexpensive
sensor fields.</p>

<p><em>Imbedded sensors:</em> Monitoring the position and status
of Blue and friendly forces and assets is of equal importance in
tracking the enemy. GPS presented a tremendous advantage to
troops in ODS. This capability needs to be extended down to the
individual soldier, and the status of all critical material and
personnel needs to be tracked.</p>

<p><em>Sensor signal processing:</em> Finally, the signals from
modern sensors are of limited use without proper processing and
presentation to the user. This area will be developed further in
the computational technologies section. Technologies that are
historically grouped with sensor systems include automatic target
recognition, imbedded multisensor fusion and correlation, and
displays.</p>

<h3>Computational Technologies</h3>

<p>The capabilities of the integrated circuit (IC), and in
particular the microprocessor, continue to increase unabated.
Certainly, physical limits must be approached at some point, but
each looming barrier has so far been met by technological
innovation. Nevertheless, should the march of IC improvements
slow somewhat, the software and networking technologies that are
being developed at an accelerating pace will permit the vision of
Rapid Dominance to become of ever increasing utility.</p>

<p>Rapid Dominance requires the collection, management, and fast
access of enormous quantities of information. Technologies that
will enable this include computational hardware advances such as
increasingly powerful workstations, reduced-cost image
generators, massively parallel machines, compact displays,
reduced-cost memory devices (i.e., DRAM, RAID, and optical
jukeboxes) client/server-specific database engines,
reconfigurable simulation cells, "wearable" PCs, advanced
human-computer interface (HCI) techniques (i.e., voice interfaces
and those coming to define "virtual reality"), and PCMCIA
technology for peripherals (i.e., digital comms boards,
miniaturized hard drives, and modems).</p>

<p>Software advances will be even more critical for Rapid
Dominance. Areas of importance include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Network data engines</li>

<li>Object-oriented architectures</li>

<li>Advanced modeling and simulation</li>

<li>Machine intelligence</li>

<li>Automatic target recognition</li>

<li>Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools</li>
</ul>

<p>Network technologies are just now emerging but are being
driven at a frenzied pace in the commercial marketplace. A
variety of advanced tools beyond "hot link" browsing are being
introduced daily. Data browsers, brokers, gatherers, and network
repositories are being released, as demonstrated by products like
<em>Harvester</em> and <em>Netscape's Catalog Server</em>.
Platform independent languages such as JAVA and their associated
virtual computational engines promise the same network
flexibility for programs that is now enjoyed by data.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important area of technology development for
Rapid Dominance is the development of practical object-oriented
architectures and protocols. Protocols such as CORBA, OLE, ALSP,
HLA and DIS<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> are changing the face of
computing, making it much easier to link programs and databases,
and access and correlate information that was previously
"entombed" within its legacy application.</p>

<p>One interesting application area migrating toward an
object-oriented approach is geospatial databases. In the past,
geospatial data were stored as either raster-based or vector
information, and significant processing was required for users to
make queries regarding roads, areas, or objects such as building
sites. A new approach, called a spatial database engine, creates
intuitive objects from standard geospatial databases and uses
commercial databases to add attributes to the objects. This is a
very powerful technique that allows geospatial data, a key
element of warfighting, to be managed quickly and efficiently
using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software. It is
particularly useful for distributed databases such as one would
find on a network.</p>

<p>Modeling and simulation is also benefiting from
object-oriented technologies. Simulations were once stand-alone
codes. If one wanted to simulate a joint battle, one began with
an existing model (i.e., land combat) and then modified it to
include other components (i.e., aircraft and ships). Similarly,
if a new technology were to be modeled, new code normally had to
be written, even in cases where good, validated, stand-alone
technology models existed. The obvious drawbacks to this approach
are that it is costly, often produces inferior simulations for
the new additions, and quickly results in extremely large codes
with commensurate large code management problems. Object-oriented
approaches allow models and simulations to be linked to form a
richer environment for examining new technologies and joint force
structures.</p>

<p>Linking force-on-force simulations with design tools such as
computer-aided design (CAD) programs and physics-based
simulations presents a new type of tool referred to as
simulation-based design. Once fully realized, this capability
will allow new technologies to be much more easily evaluated,
introducing a source for greater efficiency into today's somewhat
haphazard acquisition system.</p>

<p>Simulations based on object-oriented architectures also
promise more flexibility that will enable scenarios and
unexpected situations to be made as inputs and simulated rapidly,
forming the core for a battlefield visualization system capable
of modeling "what if" situations. Outputs from these simulations
could be used for mission rehearsal. Even today, pilots and
special operations forces often "fly through" crude,
three-dimensional renderings of a mission area to familiarize
themselves with information such as surface-to-air missile (SAM)
sites and landmarks.</p>

<p>The promise of computational technologies brings with it
potential vulnerabilities that must be protected against threats.
In a world where information plays a vital role in warfare,
information collection and processing tools will become targets.
Defenses against information warfare must be developed. The
threat is real and is growing especially in the commercial and
private sectors. Even today, malicious hackers devise
data-destroying viruses and distribute them through a plethora of
electronic media; numerous sites on the Net are dedicated to the
discussion and development of offensive computer viruses, with
ample tools for even the novice to download and employ. Moreover,
computer crimes cost the world economy billions of dollars
annually. Although information warfare poses serious threats, the
realm of information is where operations underlying Rapid
Dominance most reside, and the enemy will find himself fully
engaged should he choose to fight on our terms. Rapid Dominance
is essentially information warfare on a grand scale in all
dimensions of offensive, defensive and leveraging effective use
of available information.</p>

<h3>Communication Technologies</h3>

<p>One of the modern communication devices being fielded within
U.S. forces today is the SINGCARS radio. With a data rate of
somewhat less than 10 kbps, SINGCARS is woefully inadequate for
supporting Rapid Dominance. However, more appropriate
technologies are emerging:</p>

<ul>
<li>GBS and other satellite broadcast services</li>

<li>Wider bandwidth, digital communication protocols</li>

<li>Asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switches</li>

<li>Advanced comm relay platforms (UAV, Lightsat, Iridium,
etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>GBS, for example, figures prominently in the BADD (battlefield
awareness and data dissemination) program that aims at providing
close to 30 Mbps of data broadcast bandwidth. This will be
supported by multi-terrabyte databases, advanced data browsers,
and query managers, and will be linked to the Joint Tactical
Internet.</p>

<p>Networking must also be supported by communications
technologies. The basic problem of a battlefield network is that
while some nodes may support very large data pipes, a number of
nodes will be operating at SINGCARS data rates. This led to the
BADD notion of one-way data broadcasting via GBS of large data
files (such as UAV video and overhead imagery) and very low
bandwidth data querying back to the data sources.</p>

<p>Modern communications will tend to be more multimedia-based,
which is particularly important for Rapid Dominance, where
decisions must be made quickly based upon very large quantities
of data, some of which will be collected and transmitted in real
time. Technologies such as digital video teleconferencing,
virtual whiteboards, and even 3D virtual environments where
commanders may participate in collaborative planning sessions
will become important.</p>

<p>Finally, battlefield communications must be secure and, where
feasible, non-observable to the enemy.</p>

<h2>Control of the Environment</h2>

<p>The actual attack of targets in order to induce Shock and Awe
may, in some sense, be considered a subset of controlling the
enemy's perception. It will not always be necessary to destroy
numerous targets in order to induce shock. However, it would be
vitally important to give the appearance that there are no safe
havens from attack, and that any target may be attacked at any
time with impunity and force. Furthermore, as discussed earlier,
confusion must be imposed on the adversary by supplying only
information which will shape the adversary's perceptions and help
break his will. Finally, the enemy must be displaced from
selected key positions, for if he is allowed to occupy those
areas that he considers strategically important, it is difficult
to imagine how his shock could be complete.</p>

<p>Controlling an enemy's perception of the battlespace includes
manipulating his view of the threat, his own troops and status,
and the environment in which he operates. This will be
accomplished by selectively denying knowledge to the enemy while
presenting him with information that is either misleading or
serves our purposes. Sensing and feedback of an enemy
leadership's perception of the situation will be critical.</p>

<p>Technologies of interest here include those that allow systems
and entire force units to modify their signature from being very
stealthy to being completely obvious. An ability to attack enemy
information systems will also be critical, encompassing system
technologies from laser-based counter sensor weapons to embedded
computer viruses, commonly referred to as Trojan Horses. In all
cases, the goal will be to deny the enemy any information that
would be useful to him and to impose a construct of deception and
misinformation at all levels of operations.</p>

<p>Clearly, technologies necessary to achieve battlefield
awareness already mentioned will be crucial in allowing a
"perception attack" (a form of information warfare) to be
successfully carried out. The need and requirements for
Battlefield Damage Assessment (BDA) will increase dramatically.
It will be necessary to understand not only whether a target was
killed but also how enemy leadership, troops, and society viewed
this destruction.</p>

<p>So far, primarily information technologies have been
discussed. Obviously, there will continue to be requirements for
numerous other types of systems. Among the more important system
technologies critical to achieving control of the environment
include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Weapons platforms with stealth technology</li>

<li>Weapons systems</li>

<li>Robotic systems</li>
</ul>

<h3>Weapons platforms</h3>

<p>One of the fundamental rationales for weapons platforms is to
move people and ordinance to within an effective range of the
target. Centuries before smart weapons and robotic systems, this
reasoning was understood intuitively. Since ordinance must still
be placed on the target, weapons platforms such as described
below still demand consideration.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stealthy bombers and strike aircraft either land or sea
platform based</li>

<li>Arsenal ships</li>

<li>Submarines with conventional cruise missiles</li>

<li>Stealthy land vehicles</li>

<li>Stealthy observation/attack helicopters</li>
</ul>

<p>Stealth, combined with stand off, will contribute strongly to
the protection of manned systems on the modern battlefield and
will also be used extensively for other, high-value unmanned
systems. However, protection of the force is inherent within the
concept of Rapid Dominance, and it will rely upon the control of
information and the enemy's perception of events, stealth being
one of the elements enabling this control.</p>

<h3>Weapons systems</h3>

<p>Smart munitions will be required on the future battlefield.
Linked with information technologies, the combination will allow
killing any target that can be identified. The main element Rapid
Dominance requires of weapons systems is the ability to be
rapidly focused on objectives as identified and targeted by
commanders using the information management systems already
discussed. Commanders will require the flexibility to call
massive, precision strikes or to attack individual, high-priority
targets with near zero CEP. This implies a mixture of weapons
comprised of systems such as those mentioned below.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cruise missiles</li>

<li>Zero CEP, long-range cruise missile ("President's
weapon")</li>

<li>Stand-off submunition platforms</li>

<li>Smart submunitions</li>

<li>Brilliant submunitions</li>

<li>Wide area smart mines</li>

<li>Long-range and short-range surface attack missiles</li>
</ul>

<h3>Robotic systems</h3>

<p>Robotic systems are an important area of consideration within
Rapid Dominance. First, selected robotic systems will enable the
force by making it more responsive in concentrating sensors and
weapons. Second, they will make fighting a 24-hour battle
feasible even with reduced manpower within the force structure.
Third, robotic systems can provide force presence even in areas
considered too dangerous for a large manned element. Finally,
since the ultimate operational goal of Rapid Dominance is to
create shock, one may consider the effect that fighting robotic
systems may have on the enemy.</p>

<p>In examining the utility of robotic systems within Rapid
Dominance, one must first consider that, by any measure, robotic
systems have not lived up to the optimistic expectations placed
on them in the past. From the overburdening of the Aquilla UAV to
the massive and poorly planned investment in robotics made by
General Motors in the early 1980s, robotics has been an area of
unfulfilled promises. However, the reasons for a string of
spectacular failures lie more with planners' faulty attempts to
understand and incorporate the technology than by egregious
shortcomings of the technology itself. Robots have been seen as
replacements for manned systems rather than extremely complicated
and capable machines suitable for a set of tightly defined tasks.
Robotic systems, or taskable machines as some are beginning to
refer to them, hold promise for the future simply because they
represent the intersection of a myriad of fast-moving technology
areas such as information technologies, communications,
microelectronics, micro-electromechanical systems, simulation,
and computer-aided design and manufacturing. In some sense,
taskable machines are the physical embodiment of information
technologies. It may well be that in the future the joke will be,
"Never send a robot to do a man's job." But even so, there will
be ample jobs for taskable machines and the society that learns
to properly design, build, control, and integrate these systems
into their force structure will gain significant advantage over
any potential opponent.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The technologies and systems presented in this section are not
extraordinary nor do they comprise a complete list. Indeed,
entire fields such as materials, bioengineering, and
microelectronics are left for future consideration, although they
are of obvious and vital importance. Also not addressed here are
the training, education, and organizational implications required
under a regime of Rapid Dominance. Given the overriding
importance of information collection and management, these will
need to be addressed across the defense community as it is most
broadly defined.</p>

<p>Rapid Dominance combines a doctrine and operational concept
that challenges the current process of how new technologies
invented in the commercial sector are incorporated into defense,
and provides an affirmative methodology for research,
development, and system integration. We must learn to exploit the
potential of these technologies even though, in many cases, this
development process in the private sector is profoundly
independent from how we conduct the business of defense. It is
this environment of innovative upheaval that any useful
foundation for strategic and operational thought must address.
Rapid Dominance capitalizes on, and may even require, this rapid
and chaotic development of technology.</p>

<p>We believe that what will distinguish Rapid Dominance from
other doctrines is first that it uses an intellectual construct
to drive innovation and innovation to drive exploiting and
integrating technology into new and perhaps somewhat differently
constructed systems. Second, it is the comprehensive quality of
Rapid Dominance in which strategies, doctrine, technology,
systems, operations, training, organization, and education are
dealt with together that may make the most significant
difference. But, as the reader will discern, specific
identification and design of Rapid Dominance systems is part of
the next step.</p>

<p><sup><a name="BM1">1</a></sup> CORBA (common object request
broker architecture), OLE (object linking and embedding), ALSP
(aggregate level simulation protocol), HLA (high-level
architecture), DIS (Distributed Interactive Simulation). These
are all protocols or the architectures defining protocols that,
in part, enable disparate software and/or hardware components to
be linked or otherwise share information and logical
elements.</p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="ch_05"></a>Future Directions</h1>

<p>At this stage, Rapid Dominance is an intellectual construct
based on these key points. First, Rapid Dominance has evolved
from the collective professional, policy, and operational
experience of the study group covering the last four decades.
This experience ran from Vietnam to <em>Desert Storm</em> and
from serving with operational units in the field to being part of
the decision-making process in the Oval Office in Washington. It
also included immersion in technology and systems from
thermonuclear weapons to advanced weapons software.</p>

<p>Second, Rapid Dominance seeks to exploit the unique juncture
of strategy, technology, and innovation created by the end of the
Cold War and to establish an alternative foundation for military
doctrine and force structure.</p>

<p>Third, Rapid Dominance draws on the strategic uses of force as
envisaged by Sun Tzu and Clausewitz to overpower or affect the
will, perception, and understanding of the adversary for
strategic aims and military objectives. But, in Rapid Dominance,
the principal mechanism for affecting the adversary's will is
through the imposition of a regime of Shock and Awe sufficient to
achieve the aims of policy. It is this relationship with and
reliance on Shock and Awe that differentiates Rapid Dominance
from attrition, maneuver, and other military doctrines including
overwhelming force.</p>

<p>Shock and Awe impact on psychological, perceptual, and
physical levels. At one level, destroying an adversary's military
force leaving the enemy impotent and vulnerable may provide the
necessary Shock and Awe. At another level, the certainty of this
outcome may cause an adversary to accept our terms well short of
conflict. In the great middle ground, the appropriate balance of
Shock and Awe must cause the perception and anticipation of
certain defeat and the threat and fear of action that may shut
down all or part of the adversary's society or render his ability
to fight useless short of complete physical destruction.</p>

<p>Finally, in order to impose enough Shock and Awe to affect an
adversary's will, four core characteristics of a Rapid
Dominance-configured force were defined. First, complete
knowledge and understanding of self, of the adversary, and of the
environment are essential. This knowledge and understanding
exceed the expectations of dominant battlefield awareness and DBA
becomes a subset of Rapid Dominance.</p>

<p>Rather like the wise investor and not the speculator who is
only familiar with a particular company and not the stock market
in general, the Rapid Dominance force must have complete
knowledge and understanding of many likely adversaries and
regions. This requirement for knowledge and understanding will
place a huge, new burden on the military forces and necessitate
fundamental changes in policy, organization, training, education,
structure, and equipage.</p>

<p>Second is rapidity. Rapidity combines speed, timeliness, and
agility and the ability to sustain control after the initial
shock. Rapidity enables us to act as quickly as needed and always
more quickly than the adversary can react or take
counter-actions. Rapidity is also an antidote to surprise. If we
cannot anticipate surprise, or are surprised, rapidity provides a
correcting capacity to neutralize the effects of that
surprise.</p>

<p>Third, and most provocatively, is setting the standard of
operations and execution in terms of brilliance. The consequences
and implications of setting brilliance as the standard and
achieving it are profound. Reconfiguration of command authority
and organization possibly to decentrali-zation down to individual
troops must follow. Allowing and encouraging an operational
doctrine of the "first to respond" will set the tempo provided
that effective de-confliction of friendly on friendly engagements
has been assured.</p>

<p>This, of course, means that complete revision of doctrine,
training, and organization will be required. The matter is not
just "fighting smarter." It is learning to fight at even higher
standards of skill and competence.</p>

<p>Fourth is control of the environment. Control is defined in
the broadest sense: physical control of the land, air, sea, and
space and control of the "ether" in which information is passed
and received. This requires signature management throughout the
full conflict spectrum-deception, disinformation, verification,
information control, and target management-all with rapidity in
both physical and psychological impact. By depriving an adversary
of the physical use of time, space, and the ether, we play on the
adversary's will and offer the prospect of certain destruction
should resistance follow.</p>

<p>The next step in this process must be specifically defining
this Rapid Dominance force in terms of force structure,
capabilities, doctrine, organization, and order of battle. We
have begun this effort and are focusing on a joint task force
sized somewhere between a reinforced division and a full corps
(i.e., a strength of 75,000 - 200,000). We also have the aim of
being able to deploy this force within 5 to 10 days of the order
to move and, of course, will be able to send smaller force
packages on a nearly instantaneous basis. We appreciate the
mobility and logistical implications of this requirement.</p>

<p>Once we design this "paper" force and equip it with "paper"
systems, we must evaluate it against the five basic questions and
tests we noted in the Prologue.</p>

<p>The first test of this Rapid Dominance force will be against
the MRC. The comparison, in the broadest sense, must be with the
programmed force and whatever emerges from the Quadrennial
Defense Review of 1997. We will need to examine closely how and
where and why Rapid Dominance and Shock and Awe work and where
they do not. At the very least, we expect that this will help
strengthen the current force and improve current capabilities. Of
course, it is our hope that this test will validate Rapid
Dominance as a legitimate doctrine.</p>

<p>Second, the Rapid Dominance force must be tested across the
entire spectrum of OOTW. These are the most difficult tests
because, in some of them, no force may be suitable and no force
may work.</p>

<p>Third, the test of determining the political consequences of
Rapid Dominance must be conducted. On one hand, if this force
capability can be achieved and Shock and Awe administered to
affect an adversary's will, can a form of political deterrence be
created? In the most approximate sense, and we emphasize
approximate, the analogy with nuclear deterrence might be drawn.
An adversary may be persuaded or deterred from taking action in
the first instance. On the other hand, this capacity may be seen
as politically unusable and allies and others within the United
States may not be fully trusting of the possessor always to
employ this force responsibly.</p>

<p>Fourth is the test of the implications of Rapid Dominance for
alliances and for waging coalition warfare. Our allies are
already concerned that the United States is leaving them far
behind in military technology and capability. If we possess this
force and our allies or partners do not, how do we fight
together? Our view is that this can be worked out through
technology sharing and perhaps new divisions of labor and mission
specialization. However, these are important points to be
considered.</p>

<p>Finally, what does all this mean for resource investments in
defense?</p>

<p>It is also likely that because Rapid Dominance will cause
profound consequences, the iron grip of the political bureaucracy
will make a fair examination difficult. It is no accident that
other attempts at change, especially those that ask for or are
tainted with reform, have had a short life span. It is
interesting to note in this regard that the President's
Commission on Intelligence and its fine report that recommended
changes and refinements to the U.S. intelligence community,
despite a very positive initial reception, led to only a few
meaningful actions.</p>

<p>This discussion leads to two final points. We are all too well
aware that any strategy and force structure have vulnerabilities
and potential weaknesses. The experiences that this study group
collectively had in Vietnam makes this concern very strongly
held. We observe that in the private sector, the vulnerability of
information systems is real and is being exploited. A former
director of the FBI has told us that in New York, for example,
the number one recruiting target for organized crime is the
teenage computer whiz. We think that this "hacking," writ large
in the private sector, must be assumed as part of the defense
problem. Hence, sensitivity to vulnerabilities must be even
greater, perhaps ironically, than it was during the Cold War,
because exploitation can come from many more sources in the
future.</p>

<p>Second, wags may criticize Rapid Dominance as attempting to
create a "Mission Impossible Force." To be sure, we emphasize and
demand brilliance as the operational goal. However, we also know
that the military today is seen as a leading example of the best
American society has to offer. We wish to build on this reality.
We note the experience and the performance, albeit under highly
unusual circumstances, of <em>Desert Storm</em>. We see no reason
why that level of performance cannot be made a permanent part of
the fabric of the American military.</p>

<p>Because we have entered a period of transition in which we
enjoy a dominant military position and a greatly reduced window
of vulnerability, this is the right time for experimentation and
demonstration. Rapid Dominance is still a concept and a work in
progress, not a final road map or blueprint. But the concept does
warrant, in our view, a commitment to explore and an opportunity
that could lead to dramatically better capabilities.</p>

<p>We believe that through Rapid Dominance and the commitment to
examine the entire range of defense across all components and
aspects, a revolution is possible. If Rapid Dominance can be
harnessed in an affordable and efficient way and an operational
capability fielded to impose sufficient Shock and Awe to affect
an adversary's will, then this will be the real Revolution in
Military Affairs. We ask those who are intrigued by this prospect
to join us.</p>

<h2 align="center">Thoughts on Rapid Dominance</h2>

<p align="center"><strong>by Admiral Bud Edney, USN
(Ret.)</strong></p>

<p>Why the need for a concept of Rapid Dominance? The answer lies
in the combined realities of modern technology, economics, and
politics.</p>

<h3>Technology</h3>

<p>The evolution or revolution of information technology is
impacting everything we do and how we do it on a worldwide basis.
The far-reaching effects of the resulting information highway
that crosses all boundaries are already impacting the strategic
decisions, economics, and politics of the world of nation states.
Borders are no defense for the penetration of information even in
highly controlled or authoritarian societies. Similarly, the
exploration and use of high technology in space, together with
the advent of sophisticated highly accurate ballistic and cruise
missiles, means borders between states are not as important for
strategic and impenetrable defenses in depth as they used to be.
The rapid advancements in telecommunications technology, combined
with the exploration and use of space vehicles to saturate a
world hungry for information, means that leaders can no longer
shield their people from the outside world. Thus information will
penetrate whatever curtain or wall that is erected in a futile
attempt to block it out. New centers of gravity are being created
as are new vulnerability choke points. The country or power
structure that harnesses the capabilities and dimensions of the
information revolution as it applies to issues of national
security will remain in control of its own destiny. The United
States possesses a qualitative and quantitative lead that, when
combined with a properly focused and coordinated (harmonized)
industry, defense, and national security policy, should ensure
success for the foreseeable future. Harnessing information
technology and applying it to new strategic and doctrinal thought
in application of military force is the essence of Rapid
Dominance.</p>

<h3>Economics</h3>

<p>With the end of the Cold War and the dismantling of the Soviet
Union, there is no major power capable of destroying the U.S.
mainland. Given this absence of devastating threat, defense
expenditures will continue to be squeezed to address more
pressing domestic priorities. Voter demands for a balanced
budget, national health care, social security reform, educational
reform, family values, crime and drug use reduction, lower taxes,
etc., will combine to put increasing pressure on the defense
bottom line in the out years. The result will be a steady decline
in war fighting readiness and force structure that will place our
security interests at risk unless we leverage our technology
leadership to achieve military advantage with lower force levels
but increased war fighting effectiveness. This is also the
essence of Rapid Dominance.</p>

<h3>Politics</h3>

<p>The reality of current politics is that the trauma of Vietnam,
the results of the Gulf War, and our status as the only remaining
superpower after the Cold War equate to some new constraints
(real or perceived) on the application of military force to
support our foreign policy. These political sensitivities need to
be understood up front and include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The U.S. is not the world's policeman</li>

<li>Involvement of U.S. Forces must be justified as essential to
vital U.S. security interests</li>

<li>Support of Congress and People is a necessary
prerequisite</li>

<li>Avoid commitment of ground forces</li>

<li>Offer instead U.S. intelligence, air lift, sea lift,
logistics support, etc.</li>

<li>Avoid risk of loss of U.S. lives at almost all costs</li>

<li>Ensure decisive force applied for mission assigned</li>

<li>Rules of Engagement allow U.S. forces to defend themselves
aggressively</li>

<li>Minimize civilian casualties, loss of life, and collateral
damage</li>

<li>Specify achievable mission objectives up front with an end in
the not-too-distant future sight before committing</li>

<li>U.S. led coalition force preferred-U.S. Forces remain under
U.S. Command. These political restraints may limit the
application of Rapid Dominance to Major and Minor Regional
Conflicts. This is an issue that needs further exploration and
analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is Rapid Dominance?</h3>

<p>Rapid Dominance is the full use of capabilities within a
system of systems that can decisively impact events requiring the
application of military/defense resources through affecting the
adversary's will. Rapid Dominance envisions execution in real or
near real time to counter actions or intentions deemed
detrimental to U.S. interests. On one end of the spectrum, Rapid
Dominance would introduce a regime of Shock and Awe in areas of
high value to the threatening individual, group, or state. In
many cases the prior knowledge of credible U.S. Rapid Dominance
capabilities would act as a deterrent. Rapid Dominance would
ensure favorable early resolution of issues at minimal loss of
lives and collateral damage. The concept ideally should be able
to impact adversarial situations that apply across the board,
addressing high-, mid-, low-, and no-technology threats. Some of
these aims may not be achievable given the political and
technology constraints, but need to be explored.</p>

<p>Rapid Dominance expands the art of joint combined arms war
fighting capabilities to a new level. Rapid Dominance requires a
sophisticated, interconnected, and interoperable grid of netted
intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, communications
systems, and data analysis to deliver in real time, actionable
information to the shooter. This network must provide total
situational awareness and nodal analysis that enables U.S. forces
to act inside the adversary's decision loop in a manner that on
the high end produces Shock and Awe among the threat parties.
Properly detailed nodal analysis of this grid of knowledge and
vulnerability will enable the shutting down of specific or all
essential functions nearly simultaneously. We expect that through
these netted pieces of data, often, the sum of the parts will
yield profound battlefield advantages to the possessor. The
"Rapid" part of the equation becomes the ability to get real time
actionable targeting information to the shooter, whether the
shooter is a tank division, an individual tank, an artillery
battery, an individual rifleman, a naval battle group, an
individual ship, an air wing/squadron, or an aircraft in flight.
At whatever unit level, Shock and Awe are magnified by the speed
and effectiveness of targeting. The ability to achieve Rapid
Dominance simultaneously throughout the battlefield will create
strategic Shock and Awe on the opposing forces, their leadership,
and society. When the video results of these attacks are
broadcast real time worldwide on CNN, the positive impact on
coalition support and negative impact on potential threat support
can be decisive.</p>

<p>The top priority of Rapid Dominance should be to deter, alter,
or affect those actions that are either unacceptable to U.S.
national security interests or endanger the democratic community
of states and access to free markets. These political objectives
are generally those envisioned in the major and lesser regional
conflict scenarios (MRC &amp; LRC). Should deterrence fail, the
application of Rapid Dominance should create sufficient Shock and
Awe to intimidate the enemy forces and leadership as well as
provide a clear message for other potential aggressors. Rapid
Dominance would not be limited to MRC and LRC scenarios. It has
application in a variety of areas, including countering WMD,
terrorism, and other political problems. The challenge is that
should deterrence fail, the execution of a response based on
Rapid Dominance must be proportional to the threat yet decisive
enough to convey the appropriate degree of Shock and Awe. Rapid
Dominance cannot solve all or even most of the world's problems.
It initially appears that Rapid Dominance should be applied
sparingly for egregious threats or violations of international
law, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blatant aggression involving a large state crushing a small
state</li>

<li>Rogue leader/state sponsored terrorism/use of WMD</li>

<li>Egregious violations of human rights on a large scale</li>

<li>Threat to essential world markets</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly the Information Highway is crossing all sovereign
borders and penetrating even the most closed societies. The
inequities and benefits in closed societies are becoming known to
both the public as well as the bosses. The requirement for Rapid
Dominance to develop sophisticated capabilities to penetrate the
Information Highway and create road blocks as well as control
input/outputs to the highway both overtly and covertly is
fundamental to the concept.</p>

<p>These same techniques also apply to law enforcement agencies
targeting international crime and drug cartels using the highway.
Closer interagency cooperation and coordination between military
and law enforcement activities and capabilities must be
established. Experience with the military involvement in the drug
war revealed considerable cultural differences between these
organizations. Overcoming these cultural differences is not easy.
The required trust and confidence for sharing sensitive
information and support between these agencies and the military
needs to be developed further. Interagency coordination and
cooperation must be raised to a new level of sophistication. Some
laws may need to be changed. War in Cyberspace does not recognize
domestic versus foreign boundaries. In this environment the
subjects of Information Warfare and Information In Warfare take
on new meaning and require focused development. We must become
proficient within this environment.</p>

<p>This breakdown of traditional boundaries requires a great deal
more thought with regard to the issues of security,
vulnerabilities (their's and our's), and the concept of Rapid
Dominance. Does Rapid Dominance apply only or mostly to the high
end of the spectrum, involving more traditional applications of
force to achieve political objectives as envisioned in the MRC
and LRC scenarios? Yet to be explored is the degree to which a
concept of Rapid Dominance applies to OOTW, countering terrorism
against U.S. interests, controlling rogue states/leaders, etc.
What are the political and military prerequisites to apply Rapid
Dominance? Are they applicable and realistically achievable in
the increasingly complex interaction of national governments/law
enforcement organizations and international as well as local
private venture or non-government organizations (PVOs/NGOs)
present worldwide to provide health and humanitarian care to
refugees and other disenfranchised people? Would the concept of
Rapid Dominance offend and generate a counterproductive public
relations backlash from those who believe force should only be
used as a last resort and then with a measurable degree of
proportionality?</p>

<p>At this point, one can only raise these types of issues to be
addressed at a later date. This line of questions, concerns, and
issues, as well as a host of others, needs to be raised up front
during the concept development phase of the development of
specific Mission Capability Package concepts. We must be careful
that we do not overvisualize Rapid Dominance versus the reality
of credible/affordable capabilities to execute the concept. Rapid
Dominance does not eliminate the fog of war. Decisions will still
be made on the leader's judgment and confidence in the
intelligence provided, the estimate of threat intentions,
knowledge of true center of gravity targets, and confidence in
our own force capabilities to inflict Shock and Awe. In fact, the
ability to penetrate this fog is the key to Rapid Dominance.
Complicating the issue is the fact that the U.S. has not clearly
defined its role in the post-Cold War era. As the world's only
credible superpower, the U.S. can not avoid a leadership role,
but neither can it avoid the focused criticism applied to all
leaders. We are in the classical "damned if we do and damned if
we don't" syndrome. One of the serious side effects of Rapid
Dominance could be that if you adapt a strategy of Rapid
Dominance and succeed, you may now own the problem and be
responsible for the solution. Do we know the funding tail to such
a policy and are we as a nation ready to accept this cost when/if
Rapid Dominance is applied in situations that are less than of
vital interest? This subject needs further development beyond the
limitations of this book.</p>

<h3>Rapid Dominance and The Future Battlefield</h3>

<p>What will the battlefield of the future really look like? The
<em>Desert Storm</em> conflict indicated to many who analyzed it
that the real focus of battle will no longer be force on force as
we have traditionally considered it. By the time the Allied
Forces engaged the opposing Iraq forces, the enemy force for all
practical purposes had already been demoralized and smashed. This
was accomplished by establishing air superiority followed by a
carefully orchestrated campaign of precision air strikes
(including Tomahawk missiles). The Iraqi ground forces were
isolated by cutting off logistic support, severing communications
with its leadership, and stinging them with the Shock and Awe
achieved by B-52 strikes on the entrenched Iraqi forces in the
open desert. Shock and awe were introduced in the manner that
stealth aircraft penetrated enemy air defenses and surgically
attacked center of gravity targets with impunity. Shock and awe
were also present in the degree that coalition forces owned the
night and could rapidly maneuver large units in terrain thought
to be foreign, imposing, and unforgiving for the predominantly
U.S. forces. Instead, as Colin Powell noted, the Coalition Forces
cut off the head and life lines to the Iraqi Army in the field
and then set about killing it. The fact that a democratically led
coalition could choose not to massacre the remnants of Iraq's
army during its panic-induced retreat underscores that we knew
how much power we had and could employ restraint. The impact of
real-time video media coverage of these events, beamed
simultaneously into government headquarters and civilian living
rooms worldwide, is a phenomenon that impacted events on the
battlefield and further highlighted the compassion of that
decision. In dealing with a "butcher" we could not fall to that
level.</p>

<p>The battlefield of the future will not be a neat 200x200 mile
box where you will know everything that is going on inside the
box (although that would be an extremely helpful first step). The
battlefield of the future will encompass every pressure point
that controls or influences the elements of the battle. In
examining this battlefield and the application of force and Shock
and Awe, we seek to mass devastatingly accurate and simultaneous
firepower on critical nodes/targets that count for the mission at
hand, rather than necessarily having to mass large armies in the
field to engage one another. Clearly, the Gulf War raised warfare
to a new level with the demonstrated effectiveness and
application of air to ground/water and surface to ground/water
launched precision guided weapons. No longer will commanders
count sorties and tonnage of ordnance dropped, but rather targets
destroyed per sortie! Note: there may well be an issue of
affordability here. We may not be able to get 1) high tech, 2)
MRC/OOTW, and 3) large armies. This does not eliminate the
requirement for sufficient force in the field to defend against
an all-out assault or eject another force and occupy the
contested land to ensure the objectives of conflict are carried
out. Air power can punish, simultaneously destroy center of
gravity targets, and so demoralize the opposing forces that land
campaign objectives can be achieved with smaller forces. In some
cases, the Shock and Awe achieved by the air campaign may result
in an early cessation of conflict before the land campaign is
necessary. This is more likely against a modernized, developed
state than an underdeveloped government.</p>

<p>The confluence of several technologies, including all aspects
of stealth aircraft, satellite global positioning, improved
weapon targeting and terminal guidance, cruise missile
technology, space relayed command &amp; control, real-time
surveillance from space, the introduction of JSTARS, and massive
application of night vision techniques, are the first phase of
these changes. With elements of this technology now more and more
on the open market to whomever has the cash or friends, the
advantage of obtaining greater situational awareness and
real-time processing of available data cannot be taken for
granted.</p>

<p>In future environments, and short of all-out war, it is clear
that political and military decision making will have to
establish close control of the actionable information distributed
to shooters in the field. It is legitimate to ask why Israeli
forces that had air superiority, UAV surveillance, and extremely
accurate firepower capabilities in the most recent incursion into
Southern Lebanon against Hezbolla terrorist attacks had to
respond with an artillery barrage to one Kaytusha rocket fired
from close to a known UN encampment. When this artillery response
resulted in killing more than 100 refugees fleeing the Israeli
operation, the result was a public relations disaster and mission
failure for the stated limited Israeli objectives. This
represents a case of ill-conceived application of Rapid Dominance
that resulted in counter-productive Shock and Awe generating
adverse public opinion focused against Israel. This was also a
case of applying high technology and state controlled Rapid
Dominance against a low-technology guerrilla warfare force.
Clearly the Hezbolla appeared to win more than they lost in this
exchange. The lessons learned from this tragic incident as well
as the applicability of Rapid Dominance techniques in this
environment need further study. The massing and movement of
refugees in large numbers is a reality and a planning factor that
must be dealt with up front. The fact that the value of life
itself is viewed differently by warring factions must also be
considered. If one side willingly uses refugees as a shield and
the other is trying to protect their lives, then operations to
achieve Rapid Dominance require clear (and perhaps restrictive)
rules of engagement in the field. The rapidity of response may
not always be the right tactic and an escalation of targeting
different centers of gravity rather than responding directly to
events in the field promises to be more effective. The theory of
Rapid Dominance clearly needs further development, gaming, and
simulation. Each decision to apply Rapid Dominance will be
unique, complex, risky, and different than the previous one.
Knowledge and information on the battlefield as well as that
concerning center of gravity targets will be incomplete even with
a goal of total situational awareness.</p>

<h3>Instruments to Achieve Shock and Awe</h3>

<p>Shock and awe are actions that create fears, dangers, and
destruction that are incompre-hensible to the people at large,
specific elements/sectors of the threat society, or the
leadership. Nature in the form of tornadoes, hurricanes,
earthquakes, floods, uncontrolled fires, famine, and disease can
engender Shock and Awe. The ultimate military application of
Shock and Awe was the use of two atomic weapons against Japan in
WWII. The Shock and Awe that resulted from the use of these
weapons not only brought an abrupt end to the war with Japan
(through unconditional surrender), but have deterred the further
use of these weapons for over 50 years. Not unexpectedly, these
events did not stop the proliferation or increase in the
destructive power of these weapons by a factor of ten. The
holocaust was a state policy of Shock and Awe that stunned the
world in its brutality and inhumanity. Yet it has not deterred
the world from executing or tolerating atrocities of equal
brutality and inhumanity (Cambodia, Syria, Rwanda, etc.). Similar
applications of Shock and Awe have differing toleration levels
and impacts depending on the environment and political system
against which it is applied. As an example, the massive bombing
raids of WWII by Germany and the U.S. did not result in a
sufficient level of Shock and Awe to end the fighting. The fear
of the unknown created by the atomic attacks rather than their
actual destruction was the deciding factor in that theater. The
B-52 raids in Vietnam provided localized elements of Shock and
Awe, but until applied to the capital city of Hanoi, had no
impact toward war termination. When applied in concentrated
repetitive strikes in November/December of 1972 under
<em>Operation Rolling Thunder III</em>, the cease fire followed
in short order. In fact, throughout history there have been
weapons and tactics designed to create varying degrees of Shock
and Awe. While there has always been shock, awe, and fear
associated with warfare, unless the fear or losses are focused
and great enough, a quick cessation of hostilities under
favorable terms is not certain. How to apply elements of Shock
and Awe against rogue states, terrorist elements, international
drug and crime cartels, as well as in the more traditional MRCs
and LRCs needs much further study and analysis. Shock and awe, to
reach the level required to achieve Rapid Dominance, must also
bring fear to those who are in charge. It must be applied
quickly, decisively, and preferably with impunity (such as
stealth bombing with air superiority). The element of impunity,
that is the other side is powerless to stop the damage, is a key
element of this strategy. If on the other hand attacks are
directed at the general public a backlash could be unleased
because of the excessive and brutal losses of innocent
civilians.</p>

<p>Much more study and analysis is needed to identify and examine
the pros and cons of a policy that initiates a doctrine of Shock
and Awe for limited objectives rather than responds in kind to a
provocation. What are the limits of the doctrine of Shock and
Awe? What circumstances merit the application? Can Shock and Awe
be used to achieve limited objectives with little or no risk of
life to allied forces or innocent civilians? Can true center of
gravity targets be identified for ideological/terrorist groups?
Can levels of Shock and Awe be categorized by effectiveness and
priority of weapons systems? If so, what are the key enabling
technologies? What types of Shock and Awe would be both
impressive and generate high returns? A few desirable
capabilities from a former CINC's perspective are listed
below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blow up an entire mine field simultaneously in its entirety
immediately after it had been laid.</li>

<li>Destroy the mine laden mine-laying vehicles at their loading
point.</li>

<li>Destroy in real time terrorist training camps or publicity
generating threats such as the recent display of 70 bomb laden
suicide terrorists pledging to wreak havoc worldwide. (This
probably requires inside penetration of the targeted
organization).</li>

<li>Destroy simultaneously all/selective WMD launchers,
storage/production facilities of a rogue state.</li>

<li>Selectively target rogue terrorist leaders as was apparently
done by the Russians in Chechnya recently when they killed the
top rebel leader by detecting and homing in on his satellite
phone conversation (helicopter rocket attack).</li>

<li>Stop, divert, capture the cash flow to terrorist
elements.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Thoughts on Applications of Shock and Awe</h3>

<p>It is the use of Shock and Awe to achieve Rapid Dominance that
is so fascinating and has the greatest potential for leverage if
it can be harnessed in a variety of situations. This basis for
Rapid Dominance requires a clearer under-standing of what our end
objectives are than we usually have when we stumble into the use
of military force, often it seems by default and at the last
possible minute. At this point, I have more questions than
answers. How does Rapid Dominance differ by the goals and
missions assigned? What are the key elements to apply Rapid
Dominance for each envisioned threat? What are the most likely
threats for the next 20 years? Is Rapid Dominance applicable to
all these threats? Can we separate Rapid Dominance into
categories with and without Shock and Awe?</p>

<p>In addition to answering these and other questions, it seems
to me it would be helpful to generate a list of desirable
capabilities that would help me select a response option. This
list of capabilities would be useful to focus (1) scarce R&amp;D
dollars to fill in the holes with technology, (2) intelligence
and surveillance collection priorities, (3) innovative thought to
further develop the concept (War College papers and Wargaming
series), and (4) development of CINC plans and requirements to
meet these capabilities. Examples of such capabilities are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deploying highly effective TBMD and Cruise Missile
Defense.</li>

<li>Severing all/selective communications between leadership and
field as well as selective elements by call in the field.</li>

<li>Intercepting and transmitting revised orders to selective
threat field units.</li>

<li>Projecting false radar pictures on selective key threat
scopes.</li>

<li>Inserting fouled fuel in threat storage facilities that
generates engine failures.</li>

<li>Inserting metal/material fatigue to failure attachments on
key threat systems.</li>

<li>Identifying specific location and determining strength and
material of protected targets of value.</li>

<li>Developing dial a setting ordnance capable of destroying all
hardened targets.</li>

<li>Detecting and tracting (destroying at will) all targets of
value including mobile targets.</li>

<li>Detecting and targeting key threat launch systems before
launch.</li>

<li>Detecting plot and simultaneously destroying an employed mine
field (land &amp; sea).</li>

<li>Making threat submarine movements transparent to targeting at
will.</li>
</ul>

<p>Obviously, such a wish list should be prioritized and tailored
to the limits of achievable near/mid-term technology and
affordability. This may not even be the right type of
capabilities one might want. That is, we may need a totally
non-standard list. My judgment is that we should develop one or
two black "silver bullet" capabilities, if we get too far afield,
the system will not be able to digest the recommendations.
However, the concept of Rapid Dominance requires stepping to a
new level of getting inside the opposition's decision loop. Rapid
Dominance at the ultimate level would enable stopping, diverting,
or changing the decision process and decision executing
machinery/systems either preemptively or reactively in time to
ensure core U.S. security requirements are met.</p>

<h3>Rapid Dominance Infrastructure</h3>

<p>The current direction and speed of downsizing and acquisition
reform is adequate for the type of forces and capabilities
necessary to implement a Rapid Dominance strategy. I would like
to reserve comments in this area until the project is further
developed. We do not need to raise reasons to discard the concept
as too hard before it is sufficiently defined. I have the feeling
that bringing these conceptual capabilities to realities within a
system of systems is neither cheap nor easy. There is still too
much waste and inefficiency in our defense acquisition process as
well as in the overlap between service requirements and
capabilities. Rapid Dominance will not be service-unique and
requires a synergistic approach from planning to execution.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>The implications of the ongoing revolution in
telecommunications and information processing as it applies to
our national security interests dictate that we need new
imaginative concepts of operation to ensure the efficacy of our
international leadership in a multipolar world. With technology
upgrading capabilities by factors of 10 or more every 18 months,
we can no longer afford to have concepts of operations wait for
the technology to reach the field. The concept of Rapid Dominance
requires innovative thought and different directions than that
imbedded in our military hierarchy. We need to introduce the
concept at all levels of military professional education and
training. The best results of this effort will be generated from
the younger minds brought up on the leading edge of the
information revolution. The challenge is to engage those minds in
the solution and to take the risks required to fund priorities
enabling the development of this capability now. Such a cultural
change is not easy. One thing is certain-business as usual will
not get us there. The window of opportunity will close faster
than we think.</p>

<h2 align="center">Defense Alternatives: Forces Required</h2>

<p align="center"><strong>by General Chuck Horner, USAF
(Ret.)</strong></p>

<p>The end of the Cold War will require a review of United States
National Security Policy and a concomitant change in our National
Defense Strategy. This strategy will respond to the changes in
the world's security environment, including the dissolution of
the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact, the evolution in U.S. security
alliances such as NATO and NORAD, the increased and unique threat
posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and
the widening of the spectrum of conflict which will challenge the
peace and security of our nation and its allies.</p>

<p>The causes of conflict and the modes which threats to our
security interests will take have multiplied with the end of the
Cold War. The nuclear weapons of the Cold War remain and will
remain for some considerable time, even though there is a growing
appreciation as to the declining utility of these devices. For
sure there will be continuing pressure throughout the world to
eliminate the presence of nuclear weapons in conjunction with
efforts to halt the production, stockpiling, and deployment of
chemical and biological weapons. It is likely that START II will
be followed by START III and IV, as nations who claim ownership
of nuclear weapons realize ownership has a high cost and marginal
payoff. However, progress will be slow due to the immense
importance of achieving symmetry during nuclear disarmament and
the cumbersome and exacting safeguards associated with the
disarmament process. Therefore, for the foreseeable future the
threat of nuclear war must be addressed even though it will be
less likely than before. The spectrum of national security
challenges will expand as the threat of nuclear annihilation
subsides.</p>

<p>The decisive victory achieved by the coalition forces over
Iraq during <em>Desert Storm</em> should give future aggressors
of major regional conflict cause to pause. While this does not
mean that the threat of conventional warfare has vanished, it
does mean that the national leader intending to use major
conflict to achieve political aims must carefully craft strategy
that will avoid the opportunity for confrontation with a large
coalition force lead by the United States. Such a strategy might
include surprise attack; short intense military action; the
threat or use of nuclear, biological and/or chemical weapons;
advanced surveillance measures and precision munitions; and
warfare carried out on a fragmented battlefield which includes
attacks on the capitals of other nations by means of ballistic
missiles or unconventional warfare forces. This will be warfare
for which the United States is ill trained and ill equipped.</p>

<p>Other challenges to the world's security will take many forms
to which the military forces of the United States can play a
constructive role. These are commonly referred to as Operations
Other Than War, even though they may include the use of force to
achieve desired political goals. They include the increasingly
familiar peacemaking, peacekeeping, show of force, and
humanitarian relief efforts. Success in these operations may well
require retraining, re-equipping, or reorganizing our military
forces. Each mission should be evaluated with respect to what is
required to accomplish its unique challenges. However, the basic
doctrine, training, or equipage of the military forces should be
based on what is required to fight the residual Cold War, as well
as deal with the growing demands of a major regional
conflict.</p>

<p>The political goals upon which our national security strategy
should be crafted are fairly straightforward. First, we should
seek to preserve and invigorate the role of leadership the United
States has maintained since the end of World War II, or the end
of the Cold War (you take your pick). Second, and not apart from
the first goal, the United States must be sufficiently strong to
prevent or deter use of effective military power against us. It
is not inconceivable that our so-called superpower status could
be defeated in battle by a crafty and well-prepared adversary.
Witness what happened to the powerful victors of WW II in
Vietnam. Third, U.S. military forces must be of sufficient size,
configuration, and readiness to bring a major conventional
conflict to a successful termination. It goes without saying that
during this process we need to reduce nuclear weapons to numbers
that do not threaten the virtual destruction of the world.
Nuclear deterrence forces also must remain in place. Fourth and
lastly, our military forces must be capable of responding to all
the other tasks and functions for which the national command
authority calls upon the military. This first of challenges
should be used to define the military forces we field, how we
train them, and the methods we use to employ them.</p>

<p>The strategic geographic depth the United States enjoys,
bounded by two oceans on the east and west and non-threatening
nations to the north and south, means that our nation is somewhat
immune from attack, other than by means of infiltration such as a
terrorist, or from the skies by means of long-range aircraft, and
cruise or ballistic missiles. We will require some actions and
defenses which address these threats, but the major portion of
our national defense effort must be placed on building and
sustaining offensive forces for combat in environments other than
our own soil. This dictates that our projection forces must be
capable of rapidly responding to an unforeseen crisis anywhere in
the world, keeping in mind that quick, decisive surprise favors
our potential enemies. Given that we have proven unable to
predict the outbreak of conflict in the past, these forces must
also be ready at all times to carry out combat operations in most
any place. There will not be time to modernize their equipment or
train reserve force units. They must be capable of projecting and
sustaining their military power over long distances and operating
in the environment of the enemy's choosing. Last but not least,
when required, they must be capable of decisive combat, not by
attrition of the enemy force in head-to-head combat as was our
nature in past wars, but by Shock and Awe so that conflict
resolution is achieved with a maximum of success at the minimum
loss of life in the shortest time. These characteristics for our
projection force cannot be achieved easily, as the processes that
defined our Cold War doctrines, force structures, equipment, and
ways of doing business are loath to change.</p>

<p>The Services' and joint requirements oversight processes that
define the equipment provided our military forces place emphasis
on force structure and the traditional roles for those forces.
This inertia can freeze our land, sea, air, and space
capabilities at current or near current levels, but may prove
inadequate to carry out new strategies. There are few incentives
for a Service or the Joint Staff to reward innovation or
divestiture of roles or missions in order to change the character
and mix of land, sea, air, and space forces and to prepare them
to fight the battles we must envisage for the twenty-first
century.</p>

<p>For example, the Services claim lessons learned from
<em>Desert Storm</em> which reinforce late twentieth century ways
of fighting and ignore the troublesome aspects which loom in the
future and threaten our traditional view of the battlefield. Many
acclaim the role of precision weapons for our forces, but ignore
the threat they pose if they are in the hands of the enemy. What
would be the lessons learned if several hundred canisters of live
Sensor Fused Weapons were released by a red force ballistic
missile on the 24th Division during a Fort Irwin engagement?
Certainly there would be profound changes in tactics, doctrine,
and equipment indicated for the surviving U.S. Army force. What
if radar homing Surface to Air Missiles were employed by the red
force during a Red Flag exercise in the Nevada desert, not using
centralized Soviet tactics/doctrine, but instead using
decentralized yet cooperative engagement operations as would be
used by our best and brightest if unleashed from their stagnant
doctrines? I doubt that the Air Force would be spending millions
of dollars trying to build electronic countermeasures to hide the
large number of expensive and very non-stealthy aircraft they
continue to build, such as the F-15E.</p>

<p>Imagine the shock on our populace if a single cruise missile
were actually allowed to score a direct hit on the Carl Vinson
aircraft carrier during a Solid Shield joint exercise with the
attendant loss of life numbering in the 4,000 to 5,000 range. You
would think the maritime force would reexamine the method it
provides air power from the sea, vital yet today too
vulnerable.</p>

<p>How many times do we hear that the space forces are configured
to provide intelligence from overhead only to find in Iraq or
Bosnia that the front line forces receive products that are old,
inaccurate and altered to keep our Soviet foes from gaining
knowledge of our capabilities? Perhaps we if we would dual hat
the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency to the position
of J-2, or even Commander-in-Chief of a regional unified command,
there would be vast improvements in the tasking, evaluation, and
delivery of space-derived intelligence to regional combat forces.
Then we might see full understanding of the increasing role of
space forces and implement change to make them more relevant to
our national security strategies of the next century. Innovation,
not size, must be sought because we do not have the resources to
do both. Moreover, large forces drive our operational level
strategy to force-on-force engagements in the attrition warfare
model of the last century with its attendant causalities and
destruction of equipment. George Patton's dictum still stands
that directed his troops not to die for their country, but to get
the other SOB to die for his.</p>

<p>Military operations will also place less emphasis on dying and
destruction. The ever-present television camera ensures that the
horrors of war are broadcast worldwide. War's immorality should
some day lead to its banishment. Unfortunately, that day is
probably a long way away. Nonetheless, weapons of war and their
employment tactics must minimize death and destruction. This is
not a call for non-lethal weapons; it is a call for military
forces to get right to the heart of the enemy and conclude
operations as rapidly and efficiently as they possibly can given
their equipment, training, and doctrine. This means there must be
wide flexibility in how they may function. Military operations
will be across a wide spectrum of warfare and will demand
flexibility. Modern war will require our military leadership to
navigate through a changing spectrum of political constraints and
ever changing political goals as each scenario unfolds. We must
make our forces capable of dampening the capacity of the enemy to
use force by controlling the conflict rapidly even when
surprised. We failed to do that tactically in <em>Desert
Storm</em> in the case of the SCUD missile attacks, but were
fortunate that the Iraqis were equally inept at taking political
advantage of this card they held and skillfully employed on the
battlefield. We must also look for efficiency before we even join
in battle.</p>

<p>Defense spending has declined as a percent of federal outlays
since the end of the Cold War. Given the leadership role the
United States plays in the world, one could think a reasonable
sum to devote to defense might be three percent of our gross
national product, certainly an amount much smaller than what an
average family expends for its security by means of life, health,
causality, car, medical insurance, and retirement benefits. Given
the prospect of long-term, constant funding, the Department of
Defense could then give more thought to how to build the most
modern, efficient military force within the dollars available. We
would no longer define our forces against some mythical threat or
scenario which generates impetus to protect force size rather
than quality. The Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and space
forces would be required to build a team based on a salary cap.
You might be willing to pay big bucks for a B-2 superstar
quarterback, but you will also need lower cost and capable
riflemen or destroyers to block and tackle. Most of all, you
would reward the Service or Agency who would innovate to provide
efficiency.</p>

<p>Manpower has become the driving cost in the all-volunteer
military force. Investment cost of a ship, tank, aircraft or
satellite might be high, but it is the operations and maintenance
costs that will drive how much resources we are required to
expend to gain and maintain a given military capability. Again
turning to <em>Desert Storm</em>, the huge advantages of
overflight precision munitions dropped from stealth aircraft has
not been understood or accepted by the operations analysts who
argue what we should build or buy next. If it had been, would the
Navy have allowed the A-12 program to fail, would the Air Force
be pouring hundreds of millions if not eventually billions of
dollars into equipping forty year old B-52s with conventional
missiles, or would the Army be maintaining heavy divisions at a
personal cost of $60 billion for 35 years of ownership? Why not
build a Division force equivalent using technology and doctrine
to provide a "heavy division equivalent" force using far fewer
troops featuring speed, shock, precision fire while avoiding the
manpower costs of dollars that in peacetime include added costs
for recruitment, training, and sustaining and in war have an even
greater added cost computed in blood? Why don't we do this? The
answer is because it would require rare innovation, trust, and
support from the equally intransigent federal funding
authorities. Most importantly, the Services are not rewarded for
innovation which recognizes the contributions of another Service
or Ally.</p>

<p>Jointness has become an altar at which all military personnel
must worship even if they don't understand or believe. Defenders
of the status quo argue that there is merit in duplication or
redundancy and these arguments have some validity. The question
becomes how much overlap or redundancy between land, sea, air,
and space forces can the nation afford, and what is the
opportunity cost to the core competency of the land, sea, air, or
space force that builds and/or maintains the duplicative force
structure. A second yet vastly different question arises when
considering the unique capabilities a Service provides to support
itself and the other services. For example, how much the Air
Force should spend on airlift forces is not cast in terms of what
the envisaged requirement is for airlift, ton miles per day, to
support the mythical scenarios. The alternative sea, land, and
space lift requirements can be postulated; however, if the Navy,
Army, or Air Force do not satisfy those sea, land, and space lift
requirement, then there is a shortfall which will in turn
generate a need for more airlift!</p>

<p>During <em>Desert Storm</em>, nearly 90 percent of the
deployed equipment arrived by sea, but not in time if the Iraqis
had continued their first attack in August. A majority of
overland movement was provided by Saudi Arabian civilian trucks
and drivers, and the Army had neither the resources nor the
responsiveness to activate reserve forces needed to meet the
truck and rail support requirements of our military forces. As a
result, costly airlift was used to move forces that should have
traveled by land and sea. If added space capabilities had been
needed, there was almost no capability for the timely launch of a
satellite. Would it not be wise to index spending on land, sea,
air, and space launch on one and other, postulate lift
requirements on what the new force needs as it innovates and
slims down. The need to respond on a moment's notice adds to the
value of airlift and prepositioned ships. The outcome though
would be not to allow any of the Services to divert general
support money into core competencies and thereby shift the
jointness burden to another Service.</p>

<p>Innovate. Use the carrier to haul the army to war, and then
fly the fighters aboard after the helicopters or tanks are
unloaded. Accept the benefits of Federal Express that can be
federalized during times of national emergency as a costly, but
ready augmentation to military supply lines that has no cost
during the much longer periods of peacetime. Our nation has other
industrial capacities that also have duplicate military
capabilities. They may be 80 percent solutions, but the cost of
ownership could prohibit creation and maintenance of a military
owned and operated 100 percent solution. Iridium telephones may
not be jam-resistant or secure, but 80 percent of the time they
will satisfy the need for 2 percent of the cost. Of course, this
avoids the problem we have created for ourselves with our
medieval acquisition system.</p>

<p>Finally, we must acquire hardware of a type and at a pace that
will assure the future force capability will be enduring. We
cannot keep up with technology using our current ways of
acquiring military hardware and training our people in how to use
and maintain it. In many areas we would be better off to throw it
away when it breaks given the low cost, durability, and
reliability of modern solid state electronics. Why train
technicians? Give the troops a gold card and a telephone number
and they know how to spend money more efficiently than do our
government agencies. Make sure the equipment we do buy not only
integrates with that of other services and functions, but that it
can integrate with both older and newer equipment designated to
do the same function. The fighter aircraft secure radio must be
capable of communicating with the ground and sea based forces
command and control, as importantly it must be able to
communicate with the next generation fighter aircraft radio.</p>

<p>The added dimension is the realization that we are unlikely to
fight alone in the future. We gain valuable legitimacy from
forming coalitions, plus it makes up for the growing feeble force
structure we maintain in declining budget years. An enduring
force must also recognize the necessity to operate cooperatively
with the forces of other nations. This means we must more freely
release our technologies to foreign nations so that our military
forces can fight side by side, so that our deployment forces can
draw from stocks of others while our logistics system seeks to
catch up with the rapidly deployed combat force.</p>

<p>In the final analysis, all of this shaping and sharpening of
our military forces will be for naught if there is not an equal
change in the policy side of the equation. What good are highly
trained, efficient, capable land, sea, air, and space forces if
the implementing authorities are incapable of defining
principles, goals, and integrating strategies for their
employment? While this is not the province of the military to
solve, the military must understand how disjointed policy, weak
political leadership, or dysfunctional international cooperation
will preclude success on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Again, one of the missed lessons of <em>Desert Storm</em> was
the difficult and successful integration of international
leadership achieved by the President, Secretary of Defense,
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Congressional leaders, and
allied National Command Authorities as well as many others. It
was this leadership, coupled with the ineptness of the enemy,
that covered over the failures of our Cold War-equipped and
trained forces that fought <em>Desert Storm</em>. This does not
take anything away from the military victory, but it does make it
difficult to glean the right lessons for the future. Perhaps that
is why we are so loathe to change our forces at a time when
change is demanded by a new strategic environment and new threats
to our national security. Defining alternative forces in light of
the changed national security environment, goals and strategy
raises two questions: what kind or mix of military force and how
much best balances the requirements and funds available.</p>

<h3>Deep Strike: A Key to Shock and Awe</h3>

<p>In the world of surprise attack and withdrawal from foreign
bases, all initial responses to combat operations will be some
form of deep strike. Given strategic warning (don't bet on it)
after deployment of our military forces, Deep Strike is a term
that relates to the political boundaries or proximity to military
forces. The geography of the area of conflict will further define
deep strike. But a rule of thumb might be attacks on a target
beyond range of surface-based fires except for ballistic or
cruise missiles. More important than range is the characteristics
of the Deep Strike targets. Deep Strike targets could be
classified as ones the enemy does not wish to place at high
levels of risk. They can be characterized by the functions they
perform, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leadership</li>

<li>Command and Control (a function of leadership)</li>

<li>Control of Military Forces, especially air and space</li>

<li>Logistics and Sustainment</li>

<li>National Economic Base</li>

<li>Internal Security/Political</li>

<li>National Will, Theirs and Ours</li>
</ul>

<p>Intelligence used to nominate the targets for these strikes
must examine the functions and then define the physical objects
or people who comprise the system which is responsible for the
successful operation of the function. You define the system and
then attack the critical elements in order to achieve economy of
force. Often these target sets are difficult to define, as these
functions often represent the enemy's most valuable and therefore
protected elements. The intelligence collection associated with
each function will vary from target set to target set. Large,
fixed infrastructure, such as associated with an electrical grid,
lends itself to traditional reconnaissance and evaluation of
technical analysis. Leadership targets are better defined by
using human intelligence and subjective analysis. In all cases
success starts with innovative intelligence products, which has
not been a hallmark of United States operations. Such
intelligence products must be examined through the eyes of the
enemy, their values and concerns. Too often we apply judgments
based on our viewpoint.</p>

<p>One target system may serve the attainment of a number of
different goals. For example, attacks on the electrical power
system of the enemy may debilitate his capacity to command and
control his military forces, operate vital elements of the
economy and thus degrade the political support required to
sustain the conflict. This same target system may be attacked a
variety of ways. Most common methods would be using stealth
aircraft and cruise missiles to bomb power plants and switching
centers. Areas with isolated populations lend themselves to using
special operations forces infiltrated to destroy an isolated
power grid node for transmission of energy from one highly
populated area to another. Now it is obvious that computer
signals used to command the power grid are targets as intrusion
into the enemy's control system provides the means to simply turn
off electricity to selected areas. Attacks by all these means
achieves even greater results than the sum of its parts because
enemy responses to restore electrical power will be confused as
elements such as computer intrusion are confused with bombing
destruction.</p>

<p>The characteristics of value in attacking these important
targets systems are simultaneity, impunity, and timing. The
greatest effect will be achieved when the strikes are coordinated
in such a manner as to inflict maximum Shock and Awe on the enemy
element. This means operations must be coordinated and
orchestrated carefully and flexibly as enemy reaction to the
attack is evaluated. Moreover, presence is projected when a
combination of functions or target sets supporting a variety of
functions are struck at the same time with impunity. In order to
achieve maximum results, the attacks will need to be evaluated
quickly in order to define previously unknown elements of the
system or how the enemy perceives the impact on his system.
Finally, the attacker must be alert as to the interaction of the
functions as the effects of these Deep Strikes begin to take
hold. In order to achieve desired levels of Shock and Awe, the
attacker must know the current and projected effects of his
strikes against elements of the enemy's residual system. If the
trick is to define the system of targets needed to conduct
successful Deep Strike, it is even more important to know how to
alter the initial plan as the battle unfolds and timing becomes
everything.</p>

<p>The characteristics of forces needed to carry out Deep Strike
are long range, flexibility, precision, survivability, and speed.
Cost of the operation is a factor; however, system cost must
include peacetime operations and maintenance costs as well of the
costs during actual combat. There is also a human element in the
cost of combat operations which escalates rapidly as military
force is misused. The total cost of these operations must also
address the cost of intelligence used to support Deep Strikes.
Intelligence operations may be the most costly due to the
importance of these targets to the enemy. Alternatively, the
human intelligence associated with these attacks may be the most
inexpensive since their national importance makes them vulnerable
to knowl-edgeable dissidents.</p>

<h3>Stand-off</h3>

<p>Deep Strike is defined by distance, albeit relative distance.
Some of the target sets may lend themselves to circumstances
beyond the nation's control; for example, Seoul borders on North
Korea. Our protective oceans mean that likely conflict is
offshore. The likelihood our next adversary may have access to
surveillance, precision munitions, and long-range delivery
systems dictates that much of our operations will be at long
range, lest our forces come under attack at their ports, camps,
and bases. There will be a need for systems capable of projecting
military force from distances of 10,000KM. A sizable portion of
the force must be able to deliver ordnance of enemy targets from
ranges in excess of 5,000KM. Launching attacks from inside
1,000KM of the enemy forces will demand that friendly forces be
protected from attack by means of active and passive defenses and
dispersal. This latter constraint will preclude achieving levels
of Shock and Awe through simultaneous attack.</p>

<h3>Survivability</h3>

<p>Great cost benefits are attained if the vehicle used to
deliver the attack is reusable. Keep in mind that the force built
for the most demanding conflict must also be flexible for other
operations. Therefore, while ballistic missiles provide great
range, speed, and survivability in reaching their target, their
cost become prohibitive in large-scale operations which endure
beyond a few hours, or in smaller-scale operations where the
goals are modest and the demands on other military forces are
low. Simultaneous combat operations require a number of
expensive, expendable platforms in the opening hours of the
conflict if our response is to be timely and induce shock. Awe is
not achieved if the enemy is permitted to gain experience in
being attacked; at best you may make them numb. Alternatively,
reusable long-range survivable systems provide needed flexibility
to alter the Deep Strike plan as it unfolds. The food chain of
weapons systems ranges from the most valuable systems such as
ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and stealth bombers, to less
valuable, but useful, stealth fighter and long-range
surface-to-surface high trajectory fires.</p>

<h3>Firepower</h3>

<p>Discriminate fires are important due to the likelihood of
people and structures being in close proximity to the desired
target. It is not improbable that the national command center is
located next door to a children's hospital.</p>

<p>Discriminate fires require precision in target cordinate
identification and location. Precision does not mean "small
warhead," although there is a beneficial impact as the right
amount of explosive is placed on the target due the penalties
imposed on the delivery vehicle required to carry the warhead
long distances. All operations involving the use of firepower
must also understand and evaluate the beneficial aspects of using
non-destructive elements in conjunction with the attack to
include all aspects of the so-called information warfare.</p>

<h1 align="center"><a name="app_c"></a>Appendix C</h1>

<h2 align="center">Enduring Realities and Rapid Dominance</h2>

<p align="center"><strong>by General Fred Franks</strong></p>

<p>Rapid Dominance, as we see it, is a markedly different concept
for the use of force to gain national security ob jectives. At
its core, Rapid Dominance blends unique capabilities of land,
sea, air, space, and special operating forces. It is important to
note the vital role of jointness in using forces from all
elements and resisting the lure of gimmicks and cost-free options
that may appear within the reach of high technology but are
not.</p>

<p>Examining current joint force capabilities reveals some
enduring truths that should be used to evaluate future concepts.
Joint force commanders today benefit from the wide array of
capabilities available to the joint warfighting team. The ability
to combine and use forces from all dimensions in a variety of
powerful combinations to fit mission circumstances presents a
versatility of capabilities that makes defense by adversaries
difficult. Balance and versatility are key. Balance in
capabilities and the inherent versatility to combine them in
unpredictable, yet highly effective ways has served U.S. national
security interests well since the end of the Cold War. One has
only to look at the variety of methods employed in Panama (1989),
<em>Desert Storm</em> (1991), Somalia (1992), Rwanda (1993),
Haiti (1994), and Bosnia (1995) in both war and operations other
than war. Joint force commanders employed, and in some cases
invented, new combinations of balanced capabilities and were
willing to go beyond the confines of service doctrines to fit
mission circumstances. For example, a U.S. Army brigade of the
10th Mountain Division with helicopters replaced much of the
carrier air wing and flew off the carrier <em>Eisenhower</em>
during the Haiti operation. This force packaging capability is an
advantage unique to the U.S.</p>

<p>As we look beyond the present to future and bolder defense
concepts such as Rapid Dominance, the key will be to maintain
that balance in land, sea, air, space, and special operating
forces combinations available to the joint force commander. U.S.
military forces are now multidimensional in capabilities, able to
use force in ways unpredictable to an adversary. U.S. forces also
have enormous versatility, able to be used in war and what have
become termed operations other than war. Balance permits
that.</p>

<p>Moreover, joint force commanders, recognizing this capability,
have found ways to introduce land forces even more rapidly given
today's methods. Recently, a brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division
rapidly deployed by air from Ft. Hood, Texas, to Kuwait and was
able to fall in on equipment forward positioned and be available
for combat soon after arrival. A recent article in <em>Navy
Times</em> pointed out, "In fact, as each wave of soldiers
arrived in Kuwait, they were heading north -- combat ready --
within six hours." This was a dramatic example of the rapid
ability to combine land forces with air and sea forces using both
distant forces with those already in the theater. That
combination in that set of strategic circumstances provided a
rapid deterrent in an area of vital national security interests
to the U.S.</p>

<p>Another enduring truth is the need for staying power and
ensuring that capacity is perceived by a potential adversary.
Staying power means the ability to press the initial advantage
gained until the strategic objective is achieved. On-the-ground
presence, in addition to forces in theater, as demonstrated in
Kuwait in 1993 and again in 1996, provided commitment and staying
power to convince Iraq that it would be disastrous to consider
any form of military action. The inherent staying power of land
forces, wherever future tactical concepts may lead, makes them a
powerful contributing partner in our Rapid Dominance concept.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the issue of physical control. Control
combines with staying power to defeat the enemy's will. One of
the many lessons of <em>Desert Storm</em> is that it was not
until after land forces attacked Iraq and Kuwait that Iraqi
forces were expelled from Kuwait. Despite the awesome shock and
destructive effects of attacks f rom the air and sea, it was only
after coalition ground attacks to extend control to both Kuwait
and southeastern Iraq by defeat and destruction of defending
Iraqi forces that strategic objectives were secured. Control on
land was extended past the cease fire until such time in April as
the UN passed a permanent cease fire and sanctions resolution.
Land forces remaining in southeastern Iraq provided the staying
power and control.</p>

<p>The size, shape, and composition of forces that will fight in
all elements will assuredly change in the future. Early work done
in advanced warfighting experiments out of TRADOC's Battle Labs
beginning in 1992 and growing into the current Force XXI and
other promising capabilities as well as by the USMC at MCCDC at
Quantico are the precursors of how change may be discovered and
implemented. The challenge is to ensure that all components of
our fighting power are properly balanced and combined into the
most effective and lethal mixes of land, sea, air, space, and
special operating forces. This is the heart of the Rapid
Dominance force of the future.</p>

<p>Extension of real and perceived control over the will and
ability of any adversary to oppose or threaten us will insure and
guarantee success of initial operations, thereby maximizing Shock
and Awe. Indeed, getting forces on land rapidly and operationally
will be a major factor in achieving the enduring effects of Shock
and Awe. Certainly, as forces on land evolve and change, they
must meet the requirements of rapidity and sustainment and are
vital components of any mix of forces that seek by Shock and Awe
to stun and then rapidly dominate an adversary to achieve U.S.
national security objectives.</p>

<p>We strongly feel that we as a nation cannot stand still in
exploring defense alternatives. We must seize this time to be
bold in our thinking. More thought and hypotheses with
operational methods that break through or expand current service
doctrines are needed from a joint perspective even as services
look to the future from their own service perspective. Then there
must be rigorous experiments using both high fidelity simulations
and actual joint field trials to determine the worth of these
hypotheses to blend the wide array of technology available to the
total joint force and according to bold new concepts. The results
will determine the worth of Rapid Dominance concepts by judging
whether they will permit even more balanced, versatile, and
lethal combinations to fit known and anticipated future strategic
circumstances.</p>

End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Shock and Awe
by Harlan K. Ullman and James P. Wade

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SHOCK AND AWE ***

This file should be named skawe10h.htm or skawe10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, skawe11h.txt
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, skawe10ha.txt

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
