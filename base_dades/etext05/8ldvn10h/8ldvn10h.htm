<p>"Leonardo," wrote an English critic as far back as 1721, "was
a Man<br>
so happy in his genius, so consummate in his Profession, so<br>
accomplished in the Arts, so knowing in the Sciences, and withal,
so<br>
much esteemed by the Age wherein he lived, his Works so
highly<br>
applauded by the Ages which have succeeded, and his Name and
Memory<br>
still preserved with so much Veneration by the present Age&mdash;that,
if<br>
anything could equal the Merit of the Man, it must be the Success
he<br>
met with. Moreover, 'tis not in Painting alone, but in
Philosophy,<br>
too, that Leonardo surpassed all his Brethren of the
'Pencil.'"</p>

<p>This admirable summary of the great Florentine painter's
life's work<br>
still holds good to-day.</p>

<h2><a name="His Birth">HIS BIRTH</a></h2>

<p>Leonardo Da Vinci, the many-sided genius of the Italian
Renaissance,<br>
was born, as his name implies, at the little town of Vinci, which
is<br>
about six miles from Empoli and twenty miles west of Florence.
Vinci<br>
is still very inaccessible, and the only means of conveyance is
the<br>
cart of a general carrier and postman, who sets out on his
journey<br>
from Empoli at sunrise and sunset. Outside a house in the middle
of<br>
the main street of Vinci to-day a modern and white-washed bust of
the<br>
great artist is pointed to with much pride by the
inhabitants.<br>
Leonardo's traditional birthplace on the outskirts of the town
still<br>
exists, and serves now as the headquarters of a farmer and small
wine<br>
exporter.</p>

<p>Leonardo di Ser Piero d'Antonio di Ser Piero di Ser Guido
da<br>
Vinci&mdash;for that was his full legal name&mdash;was the natural and<br>
first-born son of Ser Piero, a country notary, who, like his
father,<br>
grandfather, and great-grandfather, followed that honourable<br>
vocation with distinction and success, and who
subsequently&mdash;when<br>
Leonardo was a youth&mdash;was appointed notary to the Signoria of<br>
Florence. Leonardo's mother was one Caterina, who afterwards
married<br>
Accabriga di Piero del Vaccha of Vinci.</p>

<p><i>Plate II.&mdash;Annunciation In the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. No. 1288. 3 ft 3 ins. By 6 ft
11 ins. (0.99 x 2.18)] Although this panel is included in the Uffizi Catalogue as
being by Leonardo, it is in all probability by his master,
Verrocchio.]</i></p>
<br><br>
<p>The date of Leonardo's birth is not known with any certainty.
His age<br>
is given as five in a taxation return made in 1457 by his
grandfather<br>
Antonio, in whose house he was educated; it is therefore
concluded<br>
that he was born in 1452. Leonardo's father Ser Piero, who
afterwards<br>
married four times, had eleven children by his third and fourth
wives.<br>
Is it unreasonable to suggest that Leonardo may have had these
numbers<br>
in mind in 1496-1498 when he was painting in his famous "Last
Supper"<br>
the figures of eleven Apostles and one outcast?</p>

<p>However, Ser Piero seems to have legitimised his "love child"
who very<br>
early showed promise of extraordinary talent and untiring
energy.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="His Early Training">HIS EARLY TRAINING</a></h2>

<p>Practically nothing is known about Leonardo's boyhood, but
Vasari<br>
informs us that Ser Piero, impressed with the remarkable
character of<br>
his son's genius, took some of his drawings to Andrea del
Verrocchio,<br>
an intimate friend, and begged him earnestly to express an
opinion on<br>
them. Verrocchio was so astonished at the power they revealed
that he<br>
advised Ser Piero to send Leonardo to study under him. Leonardo
thus<br>
entered the studio of Andrea del Verrocchio about 1469-1470. In
the<br>
workshop of that great Florentine sculptor, goldsmith, and artist
he<br>
met other craftsmen, metal workers, and youthful painters, among
whom<br>
was Botticelli, at that moment of his development a jovial<br>
_habitu&eacute;_ of the Poetical Supper Club, who had not yet
given any<br>
premonitions of becoming the poet, mystic, and visionary of
later<br>
times. There also Leonardo came into contact with that
unoriginal<br>
painter Lorenzo di Credi, his junior by seven years. He also,
no<br>
doubt, met Perugino, whom Michelangelo called "that blockhead in
art."<br>
The genius and versatility of the Vincian painter was, however,
in no<br>
way dulled by intercourse with lesser artists than himself; on
the<br>
contrary he vied with each in turn, and readily outstripped his
fellow<br>
pupils. In 1472, at the age of twenty, he was admitted into the
Guild<br>
of Florentine Painters.</p>

<p>Unfortunately very few of Leonardo's paintings have come down
to us.<br>
Indeed there do not exist a sufficient number of finished and<br>
absolutely authentic oil pictures from his own hand to afford<br>
illustrations for this short chronological sketch of his life's
work.<br>
The few that do remain, however, are of so exquisite a
quality&mdash;or<br>
were until they were "comforted" by the uninspired restorer&mdash;that
we<br>
can unreservedly accept the enthusiastic records of tradition
in<br>
respect of all his works. To rightly understand the essential<br>
characteristics of Leonardo's achievements it is necessary to<br>
regard him as a scientist quite as much as an artist, as a
philosopher<br>
no less than a painter, and as a draughtsman rather than a
colourist.<br>
There is hardly a branch of human learning to which he did not
at<br>
one time or another give his eager attention, and he was
engrossed in<br>
turn by the study of architecture&mdash;the foundation-stone of all
true<br>
art&mdash;sculpture, mathematics, engineering and music. His
versatility<br>
was unbounded, and we are apt to regret that this many-sided
genius<br>
did not realise that it is by developing his power within
certain<br>
limits that the great master is revealed. Leonardo may be
described as<br>
the most Universal Genius of Christian times-perhaps of all
time.</p>

<p>To about the year 1472 belongs the small picture of the<br>
"Annunciation," now in the Louvre, which after being the subject
of<br>
much contention among European critics has gradually won its way
to<br>
general recognition as an early work by Leonardo himself. That it
was<br>
painted in the studio of Verrocchio was always admitted, but it
was<br>
long catalogued by the Louvre authorities under the name of
Lorenzo di<br>
Credi. It is now, however, attributed to Leonardo (No. 1602 A).
Such<br>
uncertainties as to attribution were common half a century ago
when<br>
scientific art criticism was in its infancy.</p>

<p>Another painting of the "Annunciation," which is now in the
Uffizi<br>
Gallery (No. 1288) is still officially attributed to Leonardo.
This<br>
small picture, which has been considerably repainted, and is
perhaps<br>
by Andrea del Verrocchio, Leonardo's master, is the subject of
Plate<br>
II.</p>

<p>To January 1473 belongs Leonardo's earliest dated work, a
pen-and-ink<br>
drawing&mdash;"A Wide View over a Plain," now in the Uffizi. The<br>
inscription together with the date in the top left-hand corner
is<br>
reversed, and proves a remarkable characteristic of
Leonardo's<br>
handwriting&mdash;viz., that he wrote from right to left; indeed, it
has<br>
been suggested that he did this in order to make it difficult for
any<br>
one else to read the words, which were frequently committed to
paper<br>
by the aid of peculiar abbreviations.</p>

<p>Leonardo continued to work in his master's studio till about
1477. On<br>
January 1st of the following year, 1478, he was commissioned to
paint<br>
an altar-piece for the Chapel of St. Bernardo in the Palazzo
Vecchio,<br>
and he was paid twenty-five florins on account. He, however,
never<br>
carried out the work, and after waiting five years the
Signoria<br>
transferred the commission to Domenico Ghirlandajo, who also
failed to<br>
accomplish the task, which was ultimately, some seven years
later,<br>
completed by Filippino Lippi. This panel of the "Madonna
Enthroned,<br>
St. Victor, St. John Baptist, St. Bernard, and St. Zenobius,"
which is<br>
dated February 20, 1485, is now in the Uffizi.</p>

<p>That Leonardo was by this time a facile draughtsman is
evidenced by<br>
his vigorous pen-and-ink sketch&mdash;now in a private collection
in<br>
Paris&mdash;of Bernardo Bandini, who in the Pazzi Conspiracy of April
1478<br>
stabbed Giuliano de' Medici to death in the Cathedral at
Florence<br>
during High Mass. The drawing is dated December 29, 1479, the
date of<br>
Bandini's public execution in Florence.</p>

<p>In that year also, no doubt, was painted the early and, as
might be<br>
expected, unfinished "St. Jerome in the Desert," now in the
Vatican, the<br>
under-painting being in umber and _terraverte_. Its authenticity
is<br>
vouched for not only by the internal evidence of the picture
itself, but<br>
also by the similarity of treatment seen in a drawing in the
Royal<br>
Library at Windsor. Cardinal Fesch, a princely collector in Rome
in the<br>
early part of the nineteenth century, found part of the
picture&mdash;the<br>
torso&mdash;being used as a box-cover in a shop in Rome. He long
afterwards<br>
discovered in a shoemaker's shop a panel of the head which
belonged to<br>
the torso. The jointed panel was eventually purchased by Pope
Pius IX.,<br>
and added to the Vatican Collection.</p>

<p>In March 1480 Leonardo was commissioned to paint an
altar-piece for<br>
the monks of St. Donato at Scopeto, for which payment in advance
was<br>
made to him. That he intended to carry out this contract seems
most<br>
probable. He, however, never completed the picture, although it
gave<br>
rise to the supremely beautiful cartoon of the "Adoration of
the<br>
Magi," now in the Uffizi (No. 1252). As a matter of course it
is<br>
unfinished, only the under-painting and the colouring of the
figures<br>
in green on a brown ground having been executed. The rhythm of
line,<br>
the variety of attitude, the profound feeling for landscape and
an<br>
early application of chiaroscuro effect combine to render this
one of<br>
his most characteristic productions.</p>

<p>Vasari tells us that while Verrocchio was painting the
"Baptism of<br>
Christ" he allowed Leonardo to paint in one of the attendant
angels<br>
holding some vestments. This the pupil did so admirably that
his<br>
remarkable genius clearly revealed itself, the angel which
Leonardo<br>
painted being much better than the portion executed by his
master.<br>
This "Baptism of Christ," which is now in the Accademia in
Florence<br>
and is in a bad state of preservation, appears to have been a<br>
comparatively early work by Verrocchio, and to have been
painted<br>
in 1480-1482, when Leonardo would be about thirty years of
age.</p>

<p>To about this period belongs the superb drawing of the
"Warrior," now<br>
in the Malcolm Collection in the British Museum. This drawing may
have<br>
been made while Leonardo still frequented the studio of Andrea
del<br>
Verrocchio, who in 1479 was commissioned to execute the
equestrian<br>
statue of Bartolommeo Colleoni, which was completed twenty years
later<br>
and still adorns the Campo di San Giovanni e Paolo in Venice.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="First Visit to Milan">FIRST VISIT TO MILAN</a></h2>

<p>About 1482 Leonardo entered the service of Ludovico Sforza,
having<br>
first written to his future patron a full statement of his
various<br>
abilities in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Having, most illustrious lord, seen and pondered over the
experiments<br>
made by those who pass as masters in the art of inventing
instruments<br>
of war, and having satisfied myself that they in no way differ
from<br>
those in general use, I make so bold as to solicit, without
prejudice<br>
to any one, an opportunity of informing your excellency of some
of my<br>
own secrets."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="The Last Supper"></a>
<br><br>
<img alt="Plate0004.jpg (98K)" src="Plate0004.jpg" height="359" width="700">

<p><i>[PLATE IV.-THE LAST SUPPER
Refectory of St. Maria delle Grazie, Milan. About 13 feet
8 ins. h. by 26 ft. 7 ins. w. (4.16 x 8.09)]</i></p>
<br><br>


<p>He goes on to say that he can construct light bridges which
can be<br>
transported, that he can make pontoons and scaling ladders, that
he<br>
can construct cannon and mortars unlike those commonly used, as
well<br>
as catapults and other engines of war; or if the fight should
take<br>
place at sea that he can build engines which shall be suitable
alike<br>
for defence as for attack, while in time of peace he can erect
public<br>
and private buildings. Moreover, he urges that he can also
execute<br>
sculpture in marble, bronze, or clay, and, with regard to
painting,<br>
"can do as well as any one else, no matter who he may be." In<br>
conclusion, he offers to execute the proposed bronze equestrian
statue<br>
of Francesco Sforza "which shall bring glory and never-ending
honour<br>
to that illustrious house."</p>

<p>It was about 1482, the probable date of Leonardo's migration
from<br>
Florence to Milan, that he painted the "Vierge aux Rochers," now
in<br>
the Louvre (No. 1599). It is an essentially Florentine picture,
and<br>
although it has no pedigree earlier than 1625, when it was in
the<br>
Royal Collection at Fontainebleau, it is undoubtedly much earlier
and<br>
considerably more authentic than the "Virgin of the Rocks," now
in the<br>
National Gallery (Plate III.).</p>

<p>He certainly set to work about this time on the projected
statue of<br>
Francesco Sforza, but probably then made very little progress
with it.<br>
He may also in that year or the next have painted the lost
portrait of<br>
Cecilia Gallerani, one of the mistresses of Ludovico Sforza. It
has,<br>
however, been surmised that that lady's features are preserved to
us<br>
in the "Lady with a Weasel," by Leonardo's pupil Boltraffio,
which is<br>
now in the Czartoryski Collection at Cracow.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="In the East">IN THE EAST</a></h2>

<p>The absence of any record of Leonardo in Milan, or elsewhere
in Italy,<br>
between 1483 and 1487 has led critics to the conclusion, based
on<br>
documentary evidence of a somewhat complicated nature, that he
spent<br>
those years in the service of the Sultan of Egypt, travelling
in<br>
Armenia and the East as his engineer.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Back in Milan">BACK IN MILAN</a></h2>

<p>In 1487 he was again resident in Milan as general
artificer&mdash;using<br>
that term in its widest sense&mdash;to Ludovico. Among his various<br>
activities at this period must be mentioned the designs he made
for<br>
the cupola of the cathedral at Milan, and the scenery he
constructed<br>
for "Il Paradiso," which was written by Bernardo Bellincioni on
the<br>
occasion of the marriage of Gian Galeazzo with Isabella of
Aragon.<br>
About 1489-1490 he began his celebrated "Treatise on Painting"
and<br>
recommenced work on the colossal equestrian statue of
Francesco<br>
Sforza, which was doubtless the greatest of all his achievements
as a<br>
sculptor. It was, however, never cast in bronze, and was
ruthlessly<br>
destroyed by the French bowmen in April 1500, on their occupation
of<br>
Milan after the defeat of Ludovico at the battle of Novara. This
is<br>
all the more regrettable as no single authentic piece of
sculpture<br>
has come down to us from Leonardo's hand, and we can only judge
of his<br>
power in this direction from his drawings, and the
enthusiastic<br>
praise of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>This copy is usually ascribed to Marco d'Oggiono, but some
critics<br>
claim that it is by Gianpetrino. It is the same size as the
original.]</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<p>The "Virgin of the Rocks" (Plate III.), now in the National
Gallery,<br>
corresponds exactly with a painting by Leonardo which was
described by<br>
Lomazzo about 1584 as being in the Chapel of the Conception in
the<br>
Church of St. Francesco at Milan. This picture, the only
_oeuvre_<br>
in this gallery with which Leonardo's name can be connected,
was<br>
brought to England in 1777 by Gavin Hamilton, and sold by him to
the<br>
Marquess of Lansdowne, who subsequently exchanged it for
another<br>
picture in the Collection of the Earl of Suffolk at Charlton
Park,<br>
Wiltshire, from whom it was eventually purchased by the
National<br>
Gallery for &pound;9000. Signor Emilio Motta, some fifteen years
ago,<br>
unearthed in the State Archives of Milan a letter or memorial
from<br>
Giovanni Ambrogio da Predis and Leonardo da Vinci to the Duke
of<br>
Milan, praying him to intervene in a dispute, which had arisen
between<br>
the petitioners and the Brotherhood of the Conception, with
regard to<br>
the valuation of certain works of art furnished for the chapel of
the<br>
Brotherhood in the church of St. Francesco. The only logical
deduction<br>
which can be drawn from documentary evidence is that the "Vierge
aux<br>
Rochers" in the Louvre is the picture, painted about 1482,
which<br>
between 1491 and 1494 gave rise to the dispute, and that, when it
was<br>
ultimately sold by the artists for the full price asked to
some<br>
unknown buyer, the National Gallery version was executed for
a<br>
smaller price mainly by Ambrogio da Predisunder the supervision,
and<br>
with the help, of Leonardo to be placed in the Chapel of the<br>
Conception.</p>

<p>The differences between the earlier, the more authentic, and
the more<br>
characteristically Florentine "Vierge aux Rochers," in the
Louvre, and<br>
the "Virgin of the Rocks," in the National Gallery, are that in
the<br>
latter picture the hand of the angel, seated by the side of the
Infant<br>
Christ, is raised and pointed in the direction of the little St.
John<br>
the Baptist; that the St John has a reed cross and the three
principal<br>
figures have gilt nimbi, which were, however, evidently added
much<br>
later. In the National Gallery version the left hand of the
Madonna,<br>
the Christ's right hand and arm, and the forehead of St. John
the<br>
Baptist are freely restored, while a strip of the foreground
right<br>
across the whole picture is ill painted and lacks accent. The
head of<br>
the angel is, however, magnificently painted, and by Leonardo;
the<br>
panel, taken as a whole, is exceedingly beautiful and full of
charm<br>
and tenderness.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<p>Between 1496 and 1498 Leonardo painted his _chef d'oeuvre_,
the<br>
"Last Supper," (Plate IV.) for the end wall of the Refectory of
the<br>
Dominican Convent of S. Maria delle Grazie at Milan. It was
originally<br>
executed in tempera on a badly prepared stucco ground and began
to<br>
deteriorate a very few years after its completion. As early as
1556 it<br>
was half ruined. In 1652 the monks cut away a part of the
fresco<br>
including the feet of the Christ to make a doorway. In 1726
one<br>
Michelangelo Belotti, an obscure Milanese painter, received
&pound;300 for<br>
the worthless labour he bestowed on restoring it. He seems to
have<br>
employed some astringent restorative which revived the
colours<br>
temporarily, and then left them in deeper eclipse than before. In
1770<br>
the fresco was again restored by Mazza. In 1796 Napoleon's
cavalry,<br>
contrary to his express orders, turned the refectory into a
stable,<br>
and pelted the heads of the figures with dirt. Subsequently
the<br>
refectory was used to store hay, and at one time or another it
has<br>
been flooded. In 1820 the fresco was again restored, and in 1854
this<br>
restoration was effaced. In October 1908 Professor Cavenaghi
completed<br>
the delicate task of again restoring it, and has, in the opinion
of<br>
experts, now preserved it from further injury. In addition,
the<br>
devices of Ludovico and his Duchess and a considerable amount
of<br>
floral decoration by Leonardo himself have been brought to
light.</p>

<p>Leonardo has succeeded in producing the effect of the _coup
de<br>
th&eacute;&acirc;tre_ at the moment when Jesus said "One of you
shall betray<br>
me." Instantly the various apostles realise that there is a
traitor<br>
among their number, and show by their different gestures
their<br>
different passions, and reveal their different temperaments. On
the<br>
left of Christ is St. John who is overcome with grief and is<br>
interrogated by the impetuous Peter, near whom is seated
Judas<br>
Iscariot who, while affecting the calm of innocence, is quite
unable<br>
to conceal his inner feelings; he instinctively clasps the
money-bag<br>
and in so doing upsets the salt-cellar.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the Prior of the Convent complained
to<br>
Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, that Leonardo was taking too long
to<br>
paint the fresco and was causing the Convent considerable<br>
inconvenience. Leonardo had his revenge by threatening to paint
the<br>
features of the impatient Prior into the face of  Judas Iscariot.
The<br>
incident has been quaintly told in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<p>  "Padre Bandelli, then, complains of me<br>
  Because, forsooth, I have not drawn a line<br>
  Upon the Saviour's head; perhaps, then, he<br>
  Could without trouble paint that head divine.<br>
  But think, oh Signor Duca, what should be<br>
  The pure perfection of Our Saviour's face&mdash;<br>
  What sorrowing majesty, what noble grace,<br>
  At that dread moment when He brake the bread,<br>
  And those submissive words of pathos said:</p>

<p>  "'By one among you I shall be betrayed,'&mdash;<br>
  And say if 'tis an easy task to find<br>
  Even among the best that walk this Earth,<br>
  The fitting type of that divinest worth,<br>
  That has its image solely in the mind.<br>
  Vainly my pencil struggles to express<br>
  The sorrowing grandeur of such holiness.<br>
  In patient thought, in ever-seeking prayer,<br>
  I strive to shape that glorious face within,<br>
  But the soul's mirror, dulled and dimmed by sin,<br>
  Reflects not yet the perfect image there.<br>
  Can the hand do before the soul has wrought;<br>
  Is not our art the servant of our thought?</p>

<p>  "And Judas too, the basest face I see,<br>
  Will not contain his utter infamy;<br>
  Among the dregs and offal of mankind<br>
  Vainly I seek an utter wretch to find.<br>
  He who for thirty silver coins could sell<br>
  His Lord, must be the Devil's miracle.<br>
  Padre Bandelli thinks it easy is<br>
  To find the type of him who with a kiss<br>
  Betrayed his Lord. Well, what I can I'll do;<br>
  And if it please his reverence and you,<br>
  For Judas' face I'm willing to paint his."</p>

<p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>  "... I dare not paint<br>
  Till all is ordered and matured within,<br>
  Hand-work and head-work have an earthly taint,<br>
  But when the soul commands I shall begin;<br>
  On themes like these I should not dare to dwell<br>
  With our good Prior&mdash;they to him would be<br>
  Mere nonsense; he must touch and taste and see,<br>
  And facts, he says, are never mystical."</p>

<p>The copy of the "Last Supper" (Plate V.) by Marco d'Oggiono,
now in<br>
the Diploma Gallery at Burlington House, was made shortly after
the<br>
original painting was completed. It gives but a faint echo of
that<br>
sublime work "in which the ideal and the real were blended in
perfect<br>
unity." This copy was long in the possession of the Carthusians
in<br>
their Convent at Pavia, and, on the suppression of that Order
and<br>
the sale of their effects in 1793, passed into the possession of
a<br>
grocer at Milan. It was subsequently purchased for &pound;600 by
the Royal<br>
Academy on the advice of Sir Thomas Lawrence, who left no
stone<br>
unturned to acquire also the original studies for the heads of
the<br>
Apostles. Some of these in red and black chalk are now
preserved<br>
in the Royal Library at Windsor, where there are in all 145
drawings<br>
by Leonardo.</p>

<p>Several other old copies of the fresco exist, notably the one
in the<br>
Louvre. Francis I. wished to remove the whole wall of the
Refectory to<br>
Paris, but he was persuaded that that would be impossible;
the<br>
Constable de Montmorency then had a copy made for the Chapel of
the<br>
Ch&acirc;teau d'Ecouen, whence it ultimately passed to the
Louvre.</p>

<p>The singularly beautiful "Head of Christ" (Plate VI.), now in
the<br>
Brera Gallery at Milan, is the original study for the head of
the<br>
principal figure in the fresco painting of the "Last Supper."
In<br>
spite of decay and restoration it expresses "the most
elevated<br>
seriousness together with Divine Gentleness, pain on account
of<br>
the faithlessness of His disciples, a full presentiment of His
own<br>
death, and resignation to the will of His Father."</p>

<h2><a name="The Court of Milan">THE COURT OF MILAN</a></h2>

<p>Ludovico, to whom Leonardo was now court-painter, had married
Beatrice<br>
d'Este, in 1491, when she was only fifteen years of age. The
young<br>
Duchess, who at one time owned as many as eighty-four splendid
gowns,<br>
refused to wear a certain dress of woven gold, which her husband
had<br>
given her, if Cecilia Gallerani, the Sappho of her day, continued
to<br>
wear a very similar one, which presumably had been given to her
by<br>
Ludovico. Having discarded Cecilia, who, as her tastes did not
lie in<br>
the direction of the Convent, was married in 1491 to Count
Ludovico<br>
Bergamini, the Duke in 1496 became enamoured of Lucrezia
Crivelli, a<br>
lady-in-waiting to the Duchess Beatrice.</p>

<p>Leonardo, as court painter, perhaps painted a portrait, now
lost, of<br>
Lucrezia, whose features are more likely to be preserved to us in
the<br>
portrait by Ambrogio da Predis, now in the Collection of the Earl
of<br>
Roden, than in the quite unauthenticated portrait (Plate VII.),
now in<br>
the Louvre (No. 1600).</p>

<p>On January 2, 1497, Beatrice spent three hours in prayer in
the church<br>
of St. Maria delle Grazie, and the same night gave birth to a<br>
stillborn child. In a few hours she passed away, and from that
moment<br>
Ludovico was a changed man. He went daily to see her tomb, and
was<br>
quite overcome with grief.</p>

<p>In April 1498, Isabella d'Este, Beatrice's elder, more
beautiful, and<br>
more graceful sister, "at the sound of whose name all the muses
rise<br>
and do reverence" wrote to Cecilia Gallerani, or Bergamini,
asking her<br>
to lend her the portrait which Leonardo had painted of her
some<br>
fifteen years earlier, as she wished to compare it with a picture
by<br>
Giovanni Bellini. Cecilia graciously lent the picture&mdash;now
presumably<br>
lost&mdash;adding her regret that it no longer resembled her.</p>

<h2><a name="Leonardo Leaves Milan">LEONARDO LEAVES MILAN</a></h2>

<p>Among the last of Leonardo da Vinci's works in Milan towards
the end<br>
of 1499 was, probably, the superb cartoon of "The Virgin and
Child<br>
with St. Anne and St. John," now at Burlington House. Though
little<br>
known to the general public, this large drawing on _carton_,
or<br>
stiff paper, is one of the greatest of London's treasures, as
it<br>
reveals the sweeping line of Leonardo's powerful draughtsmanship.
It<br>
was in the Pompeo Leoni, Arconati, Casnedi, and Udney
Collections<br>
before passing to the Royal Academy.</p>

<p>In 1499 the stormy times in Milan foreboded the end of
Ludovico's<br>
reign. In April of that year we read of his giving a vineyard
to<br>
Leonardo; in September Ludovico had to leave Milan for the Tyrol
to<br>
raise an army, and on the 14th of the same month the city was
sold by<br>
Bernardino di Corte to the French, who occupied it from 1500 to
1512.<br>
Ludovico may well have had in mind the figure of the traitor in
the<br>
"Last Supper" when he declared that "Since the days of Judas
Iscariot<br>
there has never been so black a traitor as Bernardino di Corte."
On<br>
October 6th Louis XII. entered the city. Before the end of the
year<br>
Leonardo, realising the necessity for his speedy departure, sent
six<br>
hundred gold florins by letter of exchange to Florence to be
placed<br>
to his credit with the hospital of S. Maria Nuova.</p>

<p>In the following year, Ludovico having been defeated at
Novara,<br>
Leonardo was a homeless wanderer. He left Milan for Mantua, where
he<br>
drew a portrait in chalk of Isabella d'Este, which is now in
the<br>
Louvre. Leonardo eventually arrived in Florence about Easter
1500.<br>
After apparently working there in 1501 on a second Cartoon,
similar in<br>
most respects to the one he had executed in Milan two years
earlier,<br>
he travelled in Umbria, visiting Orvieto, Pesaro, Rimini, and
other<br>
towns, acting as engineer and architect to Cesare Borgia, for
whom he<br>
planned a navigable canal between Cesena and Porto
Cese-natico.</p>

<br><br>
<img alt="Plate0001.jpg (282K)" src="Plate0001.jpg" height="1028" width="700">
<br><br><br><br>
<p>Early in 1503 he was back again in Florence, and set to work
in<br>
earnest on the "Portrait of Mona Lisa" (Plate I.), now in the
Louvre<br>
(No. 1601). Lisa di Anton Maria di Noldo Gherardini was the
daughter<br>
of Antonio Gherardini. In 1495 she married Francesco di
Bartolommeo de<br>
Zenobi del Giocondo. It is from the surname of her husband that
she<br>
derives the name of "La Joconde," by which her portrait is
officially<br>
known in the Louvre. Vasari is probably inaccurate in saying
that<br>
Leonardo "loitered over it for four years, and finally left
it<br>
unfinished." He may have begun it in the spring of 1501 and,
probably<br>
owing to having taken service under Cesare Borgia in the
following<br>
year, put it on one side, ultimately completing it after working
on<br>
the "Battle of Anghiari" in 1504. Vasari's eulogy of this
portrait may<br>
with advantage be quoted: "Whoever shall desire to see how far
art can<br>
imitate nature may do so to perfection in this head, wherein
every<br>
peculiarity that could be depicted by the utmost subtlety of
the<br>
pencil has been faithfully reproduced. The eyes have the
lustrous<br>
brightness and moisture which is seen in life, and around them
are<br>
those pale, red, and slightly livid circles, also proper to
nature.<br>
The nose, with its beautiful and delicately roseate nostrils,
might be<br>
easily believed to be alive; the mouth, admirable in its outline,
has<br>
the lips uniting the rose-tints of their colour with those of
the<br>
face, in the utmost perfection, and the carnation of the cheek
does<br>
not appear to be painted, but truly flesh and blood. He who
looks<br>
earnestly at the pit of the throat cannot but believe that he
sees the<br>
beating of the pulses. Mona Lisa was exceedingly beautiful, and
while<br>
Leonardo was painting her portrait, he took the precaution of
keeping<br>
some one constantly near her to sing or play on instruments, or
to<br>
jest and otherwise amuse her."</p>

<p>Leonardo painted this picture in the full maturity of his
talent, and,<br>
although it is now little more than a monochrome owing to the
free and<br>
merciless restoration to which it has been at times subjected, it
must<br>
have created a wonderful impression on those who saw it in the
early<br>
years of the sixteenth century. It is difficult for the
unpractised<br>
eye to-day to form any idea of its original beauty. Leonardo has
here<br>
painted this worldly-minded woman&mdash;her portrait is much more
famous<br>
than she herself ever was&mdash;with a marvellous charm and suavity,
a<br>
finesse of expression never reached before and hardly ever
equalled<br>
since. Contrast the head of the Christ at Milan, Leonardo's
conception<br>
of divinity expressed in perfect humanity, with the subtle
and<br>
sphinx-like smile of this languorous creature.</p>

<p>The landscape background, against which Mona Lisa is posed,
recalls<br>
the severe, rather than exuberant, landscape and the dim vistas
of<br>
mountain ranges seen in the neighbourhood of his own birthplace.
The<br>
portrait was bought during the reign of Francis I. for a sum
which is<br>
to-day equal to about &pound;1800. Leonardo, by the way, does not
seem to<br>
have been really affected by any individual affection for any
woman,<br>
and, like Michelangelo and Raphael, never married.</p>

<p>In January 4, 1504, Leonardo was one of the members of the
Committee<br>
of Artists summoned to advise the Signoria as to the most
suitable<br>
site for the erection of Michelangelo's statue of "David," which
had<br>
recently been completed.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Battle of Anghiari">BATTLE OF ANGHIARI</a></h2>

<p>In the following May he was commissioned by the Signoria to
decorate<br>
one of the walls of the Council Hall of the Palazzo Vecchio.
The<br>
subject he selected was the "Battle of Anghiari." Although he<br>
completed the cartoon, the only part of the composition which
he<br>
eventually executed in colour was an incident in the
foreground<br>
which dealt with the "Battle of the Standard." One of the
many<br>
supposed copies of a study of this mural painting now hangs on
the<br>
south-east staircase in the Victoria and Albert Museum. It
depicts the<br>
Florentines under Cardinal Ludovico Mezzarota Scarampo
fighting<br>
against the Milanese under Niccol&ograve; Piccinino, the General
of Filippo<br>
Maria Visconti, on June 29, 1440.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Again in Milan">AGAIN IN MILAN</a></h2>

<p>Leonardo was back in Milan in May 1506 in the service of the
French<br>
King, for whom he executed, apparently with the help of
assistants,<br>
"the Madonna, the Infant Christ, and Saint Anne" (Plate VIII.).
The<br>
composition of this oil-painting seems to have been built up on
the<br>
second cartoon, which he had made some eight years earlier, and
which<br>
was apparently taken to France in 1516 and ultimately lost.</p>

<h2><a name="In Rome">IN ROME</a></h2>

<p>From 1513-1515 he was in Rome, where Giovanni de' Medici had
been<br>
elected Pope under the title of Leo X. He did not, however, work
for<br>
the Pope, although he resided in the Vatican, his time being
occupied<br>
in studying acoustics, anatomy, optics, geology, minerals,<br>
engineering, and geometry!</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="In France">IN FRANCE</a></h2>

<p>At last in 1516, three years before his death, Leonardo left
his<br>
native land for France, where he received from Francis I. a
princely<br>
income. His powers, however, had already begun to fail, and
he<br>
produced very little in the country of his adoption. It is,<br>
nevertheless, only in the Louvre that his achievements as a
painter<br>
can to-day be adequately studied.</p>

<br><br><br><br>
<p>On October 10, 1516, when he was resident at the Manor House
of Cloux<br>
near Amboise in Touraine with Francesco Melzi, his friend and<br>
assistant, he showed three of his pictures to the Cardinal of
Aragon,<br>
but his right hand was now paralysed, and he could "no longer
colour<br>
with that sweetness with which he was wont, although still able
to<br>
make drawings and to teach others."</p>

<p>It was no doubt in these closing years of his life that he
drew the<br>
"Portrait of Himself" in red chalk, now at Turin, which is
probably<br>
the only authentic portrait of him in existence.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="His Death">HIS DEATH</a></h2>

<p>On April 23, 1519&mdash;Easter Eve&mdash;exactly forty-five years before
the<br>
birth of Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci made his will, and on May
2 of<br>
the same year he passed away.</p>

<p>Vasari informs us that Leonardo, "having become old, lay sick
for many<br>
months, and finding himself near death and being sustained in the
arms<br>
of his servants and friends, devoutly received the Holy
Sacrament. He<br>
was then seized with a paroxysm, the forerunner of death, when
King<br>
Francis I., who was accustomed frequently and affectionately to
visit<br>
him, rose and supported his head to give him such assistance and
to do<br>
him such favour as he could in the hope of alleviating his
sufferings.<br>
The spirit of Leonardo, which was most divine, conscious that he
could<br>
attain to no greater honour, departed in the arms of the
monarch,<br>
being at that time in the seventy-fifth year of his age." The
not<br>
over-veracious chronicler, however, is here drawing largely upon
his<br>
imagination. Leonardo was only sixty-seven years of age, and the
King<br>
was in all probability on that date at St. Germain-en Laye!</p>

<p>Thus died "Mr. Lionard de Vincy, the noble Milanese,
painter,<br>
engineer, and architect to the King, State Mechanician" and
"former<br>
Professor of Painting to the Duke of Milan."</p>

<p>"May God Almighty grant him His eternal peace," wrote his
friend and<br>
assistant Francesco Melzi. "Every one laments the loss of a man
whose<br>
like Nature cannot produce a second time."</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="His Art">HIS ART</a></h2>

<p>Leonardo, whose birth antedates that of Michelangelo and
Raphael by<br>
twenty three and thirty-one years respectively, was thus in
the<br>
forefront of the Florentine Renaissance, his life coinciding
almost<br>
exactly with the best period of Tuscan painting.</p>

<p>Leonardo was the first to investigate scientifically and to
apply to<br>
art the laws of light and shade, though the preliminary
investigations<br>
of Piero della Francesca deserve to be recorded.</p>

<p>He observed with strict accuracy the subtleties of
chiaroscuro&mdash;light<br>
and shade apart from colour; but, as one critic has pointed out,
his<br>
gift of chiaroscuro cost the colour-life of many a noble
picture.<br>
Leonardo was "a tonist, not a colourist," before whom the whole
book<br>
of nature lay open.</p>

<p>It was not instability of character but versatility of mind
which<br>
caused him to undertake many things that having commenced he<br>
afterwards abandoned, and the probability is that as soon as he
saw<br>
exactly how he could solve any difficulty which presented itself,
he<br>
put on one side the merely perfunctory execution of such a
task.</p>

<p>In the Forster collection in the Victoria and Albert museum
three of<br>
Leonardo's note-books with sketches are preserved, and it is
stated<br>
that it was his practice to carry about with him, attached to
his<br>
girdle, a little book for making sketches. They prove that he
was<br>
left-handed and wrote from right to left.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="His Mind">HIS MIND</a></h2>

<p>We can readily believe the statements of Benvenuto Cellini,
the<br>
sixteenth-century Goldsmith, that Francis I. "did not believe<br>
that any other man had come into the world who had attained so
great a<br>
knowledge as Leonardo, and that not only as sculptor, painter,
and<br>
architect, for beyond that he was a profound philosopher." It
was<br>
Cellini also who contended that "Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo,
and<br>
Raphael are the Book of the World."</p>

<p>Leonardo anticipated many eminent scientists and inventors in
the<br>
methods of investigation which they adopted to solve the many
problems<br>
with which their names are coupled. Among these may be cited<br>
Copernicus' theory of the earth's movement, Lamarck's
classification<br>
of vertebrate and invertebrate animals, the laws of friction,<br>
the laws of combustion and respiration, the elevation of the<br>
continents, the laws of gravitation, the undulatory theory of
light<br>
and heat, steam as a motive power in navigation, flying machines,
the<br>
invention of the camera obscura, magnetic attraction, the use of
the<br>
stone saw, the system of canalisation, breech loading cannon,
the<br>
construction of fortifications, the circulation of the blood,
the<br>
swimming belt, the wheelbarrow, the composition of explosives,
the<br>
invention of paddle wheels, the smoke stack, the mincing machine!
It<br>
is, therefore, easy to see why he called "Mechanics the
Paradise<br>
of the Sciences."</p>

<p>Leonardo was a SUPERMAN.</p>

<h2><a name="His Spell">HIS SPELL</a></h2>

<p>The influence of Leonardo was strongly felt in Milan, where he
spent<br>
so many of the best years of his life and founded a School of<br>
painting. He was a close observer of the gradation and reflex
of<br>
light, and was capable of giving to his discoveries a practical
and<br>
aesthetic form. His strong personal character and the fascination
of<br>
his genius enthralled his followers, who were satisfied to repeat
his<br>
types, to perpetuate the "grey-hound eye," and to make use of
his<br>
little devices. Among this group of painters may be mentioned<br>
Boltraffio, who perhaps painted the "Presumed Portrait of
Lucrezia<br>
Crivelli" (Plate VII.), which is officially attributed in the
Louvre<br>
to the great master himself.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="His Descendants">HIS DESCENDANTS</a></h2>

<p>Signor Uzielli has shown that one Tommaso da Vinci, a
descendant of<br>
Domenico (one of Leonardo's brothers), was a few years ago a
peasant<br>
at Bottinacio near Montespertoli, and had then in his possession
the<br>
family papers, which now form part of the archives of the
Accademia<br>
dei Lincei at Rome. It was proved also that Tommaso had given
his<br>
eldest son "the glorious name of Leonardo."</p>

End of Project Gutenberg's Leonardo da Vinci, by Maurice W. Brockwell

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LEONARDO DA VINCI ***

This file should be named 8ldvn10h.htm or 8ldvn10h.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, 8ldvn11h.htm
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, 8ldvn10ah.htm

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
