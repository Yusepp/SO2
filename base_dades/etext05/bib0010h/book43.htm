<h1>Book 43 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John</h1>

<p>43:001:001 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Word was God.</p>

<p>43:001:002 The same was in the beginning with God.</p>

<p>43:001:003 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made that was made.</p>

<p>43:001:004 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</p>

<p>43:001:005 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comprehended it not.</p>

<p>43:001:006 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</p>

<p>43:001:007 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that all men through him might believe.</p>

<p>43:001:008 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light.</p>

<p>43:001:009 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the world.</p>

<p>43:001:010 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world knew him not.</p>

<p>43:001:011 He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</p>

<p>43:001:012 But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:</p>

<p>43:001:013 Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>

<p>43:001:014 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father,) full of grace and truth.</p>

<p>43:001:015 John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he was before me.</p>

<p>43:001:016 And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.</p>

<p>43:001:017 For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>43:001:018 No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.</p>

<p>43:001:019 And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?</p>

<p>43:001:020 And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ.</p>

<p>43:001:021 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.</p>

<p>43:001:022 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</p>

<p>43:001:023 He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.</p>

<p>43:001:024 And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.</p>

<p>43:001:025 And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet?</p>

<p>43:001:026 John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;standeth one among you, whom ye know not;</p>

<p>43:001:027 He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.</p>

<p>43:001:028 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was baptizing.</p>

<p>43:001:029 The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world.</p>

<p>43:001:030 This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preferred before me: for he was before me.</p>

<p>43:001:031 And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.</p>

<p>43:001:032 And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.</p>

<p>43:001:033 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>43:001:034 And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.</p>

<p>43:001:035 Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;</p>

<p>43:001:036 And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God!</p>

<p>43:001:037 And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus.</p>

<p>43:001:038 Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?</p>

<p>43:001:039 He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hour.</p>

<p>43:001:040 One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</p>

<p>43:001:041 He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ.</p>

<p>43:001:042 And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.</p>

<p>43:001:043 The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.</p>

<p>43:001:044 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</p>

<p>43:001:045 Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</p>

<p>43:001:046 And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</p>

<p>43:001:047 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</p>

<p>43:001:048 Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</p>

<p>43:001:049 Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God; thou art the King of Israel.</p>

<p>43:001:050 Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greater things than these.</p>

<p>43:001:051 And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</p>

<p>43:002:001 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mother of Jesus was there:</p>

<p>43:002:002 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</p>

<p>43:002:003 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have no wine.</p>

<p>43:002:004 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hour is not yet come.</p>

<p>43:002:005 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, do it.</p>

<p>43:002:006 And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;firkins apiece.</p>

<p>43:002:007 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filled them up to the brim.</p>

<p>43:002:008 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;governor of the feast. And they bare it.</p>

<p>43:002:009 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bridegroom,</p>

<p>43:002:010 And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</p>

<p>43:002:011 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</p>

<p>43:002:012 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many days.</p>

<p>43:002:013 And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem.</p>

<p>43:002:014 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doves, and the changers of money sitting:</p>

<p>43:002:015 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</p>

<p>43:002:016 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.</p>

<p>43:002:017 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thine house hath eaten me up.</p>

<p>43:002:018 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</p>

<p>43:002:019 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three days I will raise it up.</p>

<p>43:002:020 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</p>

<p>43:002:021 But he spake of the temple of his body.</p>

<p>43:002:022 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</p>

<p>43:002:023 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which he did.</p>

<p>43:002:024 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all men,</p>

<p>43:002:025 And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what was in man.</p>

<p>43:003:001 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Jews:</p>

<p>43:003:002 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</p>

<p>43:003:003 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God.</p>

<p>43:003:004 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be born?</p>

<p>43:003:005 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom of God.</p>

<p>43:003:006 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;born of the Spirit is spirit.</p>

<p>43:003:007 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</p>

<p>43:003:008 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</p>

<p>43:003:009 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</p>

<p>43:003:010 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and knowest not these things?</p>

<p>43:003:011 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</p>

<p>43:003:012 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</p>

<p>43:003:013 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</p>

<p>43:003:014 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must the Son of man be lifted up:</p>

<p>43:003:015 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eternal life.</p>

<p>43:003:016 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have everlasting life.</p>

<p>43:003:017 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that the world through him might be saved.</p>

<p>43:003:018 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</p>

<p>43:003:019 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deeds were evil.</p>

<p>43:003:020 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</p>

<p>43:003:021 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</p>

<p>43:003:022 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</p>

<p>43:003:023 And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</p>

<p>43:003:024 For John was not yet cast into prison.</p>

<p>43:003:025 Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Jews about purifying.</p>

<p>43:003:026 And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.</p>

<p>43:003:027 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be given him from heaven.</p>

<p>43:003:028 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ, but that I am sent before him.</p>

<p>43:003:029 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore is fulfilled.</p>

<p>43:003:030 He must increase, but I must decrease.</p>

<p>43:003:031 He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from heaven is above all.</p>

<p>43:003:032 And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man receiveth his testimony.</p>

<p>43:003:033 He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is true.</p>

<p>43:003:034 For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.</p>

<p>43:003:035 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand.</p>

<p>43:003:036 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God abideth on him.</p>

<p>43:004:001 When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</p>

<p>43:004:002 (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</p>

<p>43:004:003 He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</p>

<p>43:004:004 And he must needs go through Samaria.</p>

<p>43:004:005 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph.</p>

<p>43:004:006 Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sixth hour.</p>

<p>43:004:007 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto her, Give me to drink.</p>

<p>43:004:008 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</p>

<p>43:004:009 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</p>

<p>43:004:010 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;living water.</p>

<p>43:004:011 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water?</p>

<p>43:004:012 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cattle?</p>

<p>43:004:013 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water shall thirst again:</p>

<p>43:004:014 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</p>

<p>43:004:015 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thirst not, neither come hither to draw.</p>

<p>43:004:016 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</p>

<p>43:004:017 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</p>

<p>43:004:018 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</p>

<p>43:004:019 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet.</p>

<p>43:004:020 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</p>

<p>43:004:021 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worship the Father.</p>

<p>43:004:022 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;salvation is of the Jews.</p>

<p>43:004:023 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father seeketh such to worship him.</p>

<p>43:004:024 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spirit and in truth.</p>

<p>43:004:025 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</p>

<p>43:004:026 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</p>

<p>43:004:027 And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talkest thou with her?</p>

<p>43:004:028 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city, and saith to the men,</p>

<p>43:004:029 Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not this the Christ?</p>

<p>43:004:030 Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</p>

<p>43:004:031 In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eat.</p>

<p>43:004:032 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</p>

<p>43:004:033 Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought him ought to eat?</p>

<p>43:004:034 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent me, and to finish his work.</p>

<p>43:004:035 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</p>

<p>43:004:036 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rejoice together.</p>

<p>43:004:037 And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reapeth.</p>

<p>43:004:038 I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</p>

<p>43:004:039 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever I did.</p>

<p>43:004:040 So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</p>

<p>43:004:041 And many more believed because of his own word;</p>

<p>43:004:042 And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</p>

<p>43:004:043 Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</p>

<p>43:004:044 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his own country.</p>

<p>43:004:045 Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</p>

<p>43:004:046 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sick at Capernaum.</p>

<p>43:004:047 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</p>

<p>43:004:048 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will not believe.</p>

<p>43:004:049 The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</p>

<p>43:004:050 Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his way.</p>

<p>43:004:051 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, saying, Thy son liveth.</p>

<p>43:004:052 Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left him.</p>

<p>43:004:053 So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his whole house.</p>

<p>43:004:054 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come out of Judaea into Galilee.</p>

<p>43:005:001 After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem.</p>

<p>43:005:002 Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</p>

<p>43:005:003 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</p>

<p>43:005:004 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he had.</p>

<p>43:005:005 And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eight years.</p>

<p>43:005:006 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</p>

<p>43:005:007 The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coming, another steppeth down before me.</p>

<p>43:005:008 Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</p>

<p>43:005:009 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</p>

<p>43:005:010 The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</p>

<p>43:005:011 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</p>

<p>43:005:012 Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take up thy bed, and walk?</p>

<p>43:005:013 And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</p>

<p>43:005:014 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come unto thee.</p>

<p>43:005:015 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had made him whole.</p>

<p>43:005:016 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</p>

<p>43:005:017 But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work.</p>

<p>43:005:018 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, making himself equal with God.</p>

<p>43:005:019 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doeth the Son likewise.</p>

<p>43:005:020 For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that ye may marvel.</p>

<p>43:005:021 For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</p>

<p>43:005:022 For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the Son:</p>

<p>43:005:023 That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which hath sent him.</p>

<p>43:005:024 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto life.</p>

<p>43:005:025 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they that hear shall live.</p>

<p>43:005:026 For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Son to have life in himself;</p>

<p>43:005:027 And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is the Son of man.</p>

<p>43:005:028 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</p>

<p>43:005:029 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resurrection of damnation.</p>

<p>43:005:030 I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will of the Father which hath sent me.</p>

<p>43:005:031 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</p>

<p>43:005:032 There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</p>

<p>43:005:033 Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</p>

<p>43:005:034 But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that ye might be saved.</p>

<p>43:005:035 He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a season to rejoice in his light.</p>

<p>43:005:036 But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</p>

<p>43:005:037 And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his shape.</p>

<p>43:005:038 And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent, him ye believe not.</p>

<p>43:005:039 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life: and they are they which testify of me.</p>

<p>43:005:040 And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</p>

<p>43:005:041 I receive not honour from men.</p>

<p>43:005:042 But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</p>

<p>43:005:043 I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</p>

<p>43:005:044 How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seek not the honour that cometh from God only?</p>

<p>43:005:045 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.</p>

<p>43:005:046 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrote of me.</p>

<p>43:005:047 But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words?</p>

<p>43:006:001 After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the sea of Tiberias.</p>

<p>43:006:002 And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miracles which he did on them that were diseased.</p>

<p>43:006:003 And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples.</p>

<p>43:006:004 And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.</p>

<p>43:006:005 When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bread, that these may eat?</p>

<p>43:006:006 And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would do.</p>

<p>43:006:007 Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.</p>

<p>43:006:008 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him,</p>

<p>43:006:009 There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;small fishes: but what are they among so many?</p>

<p>43:006:010 And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand.</p>

<p>43:006:011 And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would.</p>

<p>43:006:012 When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.</p>

<p>43:006:013 Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remained over and above unto them that had eaten.</p>

<p>43:006:014 Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the world.</p>

<p>43:006:015 When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mountain himself alone.</p>

<p>43:006:016 And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sea,</p>

<p>43:006:017 And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>43:006:018 And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.</p>

<p>43:006:019 So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the ship: and they were afraid.</p>

<p>43:006:020 But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.</p>

<p>43:006:021 Then they willingly received him into the ship: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.</p>

<p>43:006:022 The day following, when the people which stood on the other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples were gone away alone;</p>

<p>43:006:023 (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thanks:)</p>

<p>43:006:024 When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.</p>

<p>43:006:025 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</p>

<p>43:006:026 Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did eat of the loaves, and were filled.</p>

<p>43:006:027 Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.</p>

<p>43:006:028 Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the works of God?</p>

<p>43:006:029 Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.</p>

<p>43:006:030 They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?</p>

<p>43:006:031 Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gave them bread from heaven to eat.</p>

<p>43:006:032 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;giveth you the true bread from heaven.</p>

<p>43:006:033 For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;giveth life unto the world.</p>

<p>43:006:034 Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.</p>

<p>43:006:035 And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall never thirst.</p>

<p>43:006:036 But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not.</p>

<p>43:006:037 All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</p>

<p>43:006:038 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will of him that sent me.</p>

<p>43:006:039 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it up again at the last day.</p>

<p>43:006:040 And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</p>

<p>43:006:041 The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which came down from heaven.</p>

<p>43:006:042 And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came down from heaven?</p>

<p>43:006:043 Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yourselves.</p>

<p>43:006:044 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.</p>

<p>43:006:045 It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Father, cometh unto me.</p>

<p>43:006:046 Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, he hath seen the Father.</p>

<p>43:006:047 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everlasting life.</p>

<p>43:006:048 I am that bread of life.</p>

<p>43:006:049 Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.</p>

<p>43:006:050 This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may eat thereof, and not die.</p>

<p>43:006:051 I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world.</p>

<p>43:006:052 The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this man give us his flesh to eat?</p>

<p>43:006:053 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blood, ye have no life in you.</p>

<p>43:006:054 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</p>

<p>43:006:055 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</p>

<p>43:006:056 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, and I in him.</p>

<p>43:006:057 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</p>

<p>43:006:058 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bread shall live for ever.</p>

<p>43:006:059 These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capernaum.</p>

<p>43:006:060 Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?</p>

<p>43:006:061 When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he said unto them, Doth this offend you?</p>

<p>43:006:062 What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before?</p>

<p>43:006:063 It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life.</p>

<p>43:006:064 But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should betray him.</p>

<p>43:006:065 And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.</p>

<p>43:006:066 From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more with him.</p>

<p>43:006:067 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?</p>

<p>43:006:068 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hast the words of eternal life.</p>

<p>43:006:069 And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the living God.</p>

<p>43:006:070 Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you is a devil?</p>

<p>43:006:071 He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that should betray him, being one of the twelve.</p>

<p>43:007:001 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</p>

<p>43:007:002 Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.</p>

<p>43:007:003 His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou doest.</p>

<p>43:007:004 For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shew thyself to the world.</p>

<p>43:007:005 For neither did his brethren believe in him.</p>

<p>43:007:006 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time is alway ready.</p>

<p>43:007:007 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of it, that the works thereof are evil.</p>

<p>43:007:008 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my time is not yet full come.</p>

<p>43:007:009 When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galilee.</p>

<p>43:007:010 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</p>

<p>43:007:011 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</p>

<p>43:007:012 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deceiveth the people.</p>

<p>43:007:013 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</p>

<p>43:007:014 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temple, and taught.</p>

<p>43:007:015 And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having never learned?</p>

<p>43:007:016 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his that sent me.</p>

<p>43:007:017 If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</p>

<p>43:007:018 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unrighteousness is in him.</p>

<p>43:007:019 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</p>

<p>43:007:020 The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about to kill thee?</p>

<p>43:007:021 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye all marvel.</p>

<p>43:007:022 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circumcise a man.</p>

<p>43:007:023 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</p>

<p>43:007:024 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judgment.</p>

<p>43:007:025 Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seek to kill?</p>

<p>43:007:026 But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</p>

<p>43:007:027 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no man knoweth whence he is.</p>

<p>43:007:028 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</p>

<p>43:007:029 But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</p>

<p>43:007:030 Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because his hour was not yet come.</p>

<p>43:007:031 And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath done?</p>

<p>43:007:032 The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;officers to take him.</p>

<p>43:007:033 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then I go unto him that sent me.</p>

<p>43:007:034 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thither ye cannot come.</p>

<p>43:007:035 Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</p>

<p>43:007:036 What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?</p>

<p>43:007:037 In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drink.</p>

<p>43:007:038 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</p>

<p>43:007:039 (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</p>

<p>43:007:040 Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</p>

<p>43:007:041 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come out of Galilee?</p>

<p>43:007:042 Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</p>

<p>43:007:043 So there was a division among the people because of him.</p>

<p>43:007:044 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on him.</p>

<p>43:007:045 Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</p>

<p>43:007:046 The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</p>

<p>43:007:047 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</p>

<p>43:007:048 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</p>

<p>43:007:049 But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</p>

<p>43:007:050 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being one of them,)</p>

<p>43:007:051 Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he doeth?</p>

<p>43:007:052 They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</p>

<p>43:007:053 And every man went unto his own house.</p>

<p>43:008:001 Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</p>

<p>43:008:002 And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>43:008:003 And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</p>

<p>43:008:004 They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the very act.</p>

<p>43:008:005 Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but what sayest thou?</p>

<p>43:008:006 This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ground, as though he heard them not.</p>

<p>43:008:007 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first cast a stone at her.</p>

<p>43:008:008 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</p>

<p>43:008:009 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;standing in the midst.</p>

<p>43:008:010 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no man condemned thee?</p>

<p>43:008:011 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</p>

<p>43:008:012 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but shall have the light of life.</p>

<p>43:008:013 The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thyself; thy record is not true.</p>

<p>43:008:014 Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go.</p>

<p>43:008:015 Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</p>

<p>43:008:016 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I and the Father that sent me.</p>

<p>43:008:017 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is true.</p>

<p>43:008:018 I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me beareth witness of me.</p>

<p>43:008:019 Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should have known my Father also.</p>

<p>43:008:020 These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come.</p>

<p>43:008:021 Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come.</p>

<p>43:008:022 Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whither I go, ye cannot come.</p>

<p>43:008:023 And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</p>

<p>43:008:024 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</p>

<p>43:008:025 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.</p>

<p>43:008:026 I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have heard of him.</p>

<p>43:008:027 They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</p>

<p>43:008:028 Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</p>

<p>43:008:029 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alone; for I do always those things that please him.</p>

<p>43:008:030 As he spake these words, many believed on him.</p>

<p>43:008:031 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</p>

<p>43:008:032 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free.</p>

<p>43:008:033 They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</p>

<p>43:008:034 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;committeth sin is the servant of sin.</p>

<p>43:008:035 And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abideth ever.</p>

<p>43:008:036 If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed.</p>

<p>43:008:037 I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because my word hath no place in you.</p>

<p>43:008:038 I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which ye have seen with your father.</p>

<p>43:008:039 They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the works of Abraham.</p>

<p>43:008:040 But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</p>

<p>43:008:041 Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</p>

<p>43:008:042 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myself, but he sent me.</p>

<p>43:008:043 Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear my word.</p>

<p>43:008:044 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the father of it.</p>

<p>43:008:045 And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</p>

<p>43:008:046 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do ye not believe me?</p>

<p>43:008:047 He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not, because ye are not of God.</p>

<p>43:008:048 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</p>

<p>43:008:049 Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ye do dishonour me.</p>

<p>43:008:050 And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judgeth.</p>

<p>43:008:051 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall never see death.</p>

<p>43:008:052 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</p>

<p>43:008:053 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</p>

<p>43:008:054 Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your God:</p>

<p>43:008:055 Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know him, and keep his saying.</p>

<p>43:008:056 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was glad.</p>

<p>43:008:057 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hast thou seen Abraham?</p>

<p>43:008:058 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abraham was, I am.</p>

<p>43:008:059 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of them, and so passed by.</p>

<p>43:009:001 And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;birth.</p>

<p>43:009:002 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</p>

<p>43:009:003 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</p>

<p>43:009:004 I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the night cometh, when no man can work.</p>

<p>43:009:005 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</p>

<p>43:009:006 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the clay,</p>

<p>43:009:007 And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;washed, and came seeing.</p>

<p>43:009:008 The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</p>

<p>43:009:009 Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, I am he.</p>

<p>43:009:010 Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</p>

<p>43:009:011 He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</p>

<p>43:009:012 Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</p>

<p>43:009:013 They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</p>

<p>43:009:014 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opened his eyes.</p>

<p>43:009:015 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I washed, and do see.</p>

<p>43:009:016 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;division among them.</p>

<p>43:009:017 They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</p>

<p>43:009:018 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of him that had received his sight.</p>

<p>43:009:019 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;born blind? how then doth he now see?</p>

<p>43:009:020 His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son, and that he was born blind:</p>

<p>43:009:021 But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak for himself.</p>

<p>43:009:022 These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</p>

<p>43:009:023 Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</p>

<p>43:009:024 Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</p>

<p>43:009:025 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</p>

<p>43:009:026 Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he thine eyes?</p>

<p>43:009:027 He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples?</p>

<p>43:009:028 Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are Moses' disciples.</p>

<p>43:009:029 We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not from whence he is.</p>

<p>43:009:030 The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he hath opened mine eyes.</p>

<p>43:009:031 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</p>

<p>43:009:032 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes of one that was born blind.</p>

<p>43:009:033 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</p>

<p>43:009:034 They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</p>

<p>43:009:035 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</p>

<p>43:009:036 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him?</p>

<p>43:009:037 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that talketh with thee.</p>

<p>43:009:038 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</p>

<p>43:009:039 And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they which see not might see; and that they which see might be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made blind.</p>

<p>43:009:040 And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</p>

<p>43:009:041 Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</p>

<p>43:010:001 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same is a thief and a robber.</p>

<p>43:010:002 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheep.</p>

<p>43:010:003 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</p>

<p>43:010:004 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</p>

<p>43:010:005 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they know not the voice of strangers.</p>

<p>43:010:006 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what things they were which he spake unto them.</p>

<p>43:010:007 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, I am the door of the sheep.</p>

<p>43:010:008 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheep did not hear them.</p>

<p>43:010:009 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</p>

<p>43:010:010 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might have it more abundantly.</p>

<p>43:010:011 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sheep.</p>

<p>43:010:012 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sheep.</p>

<p>43:010:013 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the sheep.</p>

<p>43:010:014 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine.</p>

<p>43:010:015 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down my life for the sheep.</p>

<p>43:010:016 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one fold, and one shepherd.</p>

<p>43:010:017 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I might take it again.</p>

<p>43:010:018 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandment have I received of my Father.</p>

<p>43:010:019 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sayings.</p>

<p>43:010:020 And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye him?</p>

<p>43:010:021 Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</p>

<p>43:010:022 And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was winter.</p>

<p>43:010:023 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.</p>

<p>43:010:024 Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us plainly.</p>

<p>43:010:025 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.</p>

<p>43:010:026 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto you.</p>

<p>43:010:027 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</p>

<p>43:010:028 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.</p>

<p>43:010:029 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.</p>

<p>43:010:030 I and my Father are one.</p>

<p>43:010:031 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</p>

<p>43:010:032 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?</p>

<p>43:010:033 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;makest thyself God.</p>

<p>43:010:034 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are gods?</p>

<p>43:010:035 If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the scripture cannot be broken;</p>

<p>43:010:036 Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God?</p>

<p>43:010:037 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</p>

<p>43:010:038 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>43:010:039 Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their hand,</p>

<p>43:010:040 And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first baptized; and there he abode.</p>

<p>43:010:041 And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all things that John spake of this man were true.</p>

<p>43:010:042 And many believed on him there.</p>

<p>43:011:001 Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;town of Mary and her sister Martha.</p>

<p>43:011:002 (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</p>

<p>43:011:003 Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom thou lovest is sick.</p>

<p>43:011:004 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glorified thereby.</p>

<p>43:011:005 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</p>

<p>43:011:006 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days still in the same place where he was.</p>

<p>43:011:007 Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judaea again.</p>

<p>43:011:008 His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stone thee; and goest thou thither again?</p>

<p>43:011:009 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;light of this world.</p>

<p>43:011:010 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no light in him.</p>

<p>43:011:011 These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep.</p>

<p>43:011:012 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</p>

<p>43:011:013 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</p>

<p>43:011:014 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</p>

<p>43:011:015 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</p>

<p>43:011:016 Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</p>

<p>43:011:017 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;four days already.</p>

<p>43:011:018 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;off:</p>

<p>43:011:019 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerning their brother.</p>

<p>43:011:020 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.</p>

<p>43:011:021 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother had not died.</p>

<p>43:011:022 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God will give it thee.</p>

<p>43:011:023 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</p>

<p>43:011:024 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resurrection at the last day.</p>

<p>43:011:025 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</p>

<p>43:011:026 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believest thou this?</p>

<p>43:011:027 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</p>

<p>43:011:028 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for thee.</p>

<p>43:011:029 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>43:011:030 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place where Martha met him.</p>

<p>43:011:031 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there.</p>

<p>43:011:032 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here, my brother had not died.</p>

<p>43:011:033 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;troubled.</p>

<p>43:011:034 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come and see.</p>

<p>43:011:035 Jesus wept.</p>

<p>43:011:036 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</p>

<p>43:011:037 And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have died?</p>

<p>43:011:038 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</p>

<p>43:011:039 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he hath been dead four days.</p>

<p>43:011:040 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</p>

<p>43:011:041 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thank thee that thou hast heard me.</p>

<p>43:011:042 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou hast sent me.</p>

<p>43:011:043 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazarus, come forth.</p>

<p>43:011:044 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</p>

<p>43:011:045 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things which Jesus did, believed on him.</p>

<p>43:011:046 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them what things Jesus had done.</p>

<p>43:011:047 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.</p>

<p>43:011:048 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</p>

<p>43:011:049 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</p>

<p>43:011:050 Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</p>

<p>43:011:051 And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</p>

<p>43:011:052 And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together in one the children of God that were scattered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abroad.</p>

<p>43:011:053 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him to death.</p>

<p>43:011:054 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</p>

<p>43:011:055 And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves.</p>

<p>43:011:056 Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the feast?</p>

<p>43:011:057 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shew it, that they might take him.</p>

<p>43:012:001 Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dead.</p>

<p>43:012:002 There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was one of them that sat at the table with him.</p>

<p>43:012:003 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</p>

<p>43:012:004 Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which should betray him,</p>

<p>43:012:005 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given to the poor?</p>

<p>43:012:006 This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</p>

<p>43:012:007 Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath she kept this.</p>

<p>43:012:008 For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always.</p>

<p>43:012:009 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</p>

<p>43:012:010 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also to death;</p>

<p>43:012:011 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believed on Jesus.</p>

<p>43:012:012 On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</p>

<p>43:012:013 Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>43:012:014 And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is written,</p>

<p>43:012:015 Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on an ass's colt.</p>

<p>43:012:016 These things understood not his disciples at the first: but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things were written of him, and that they had done these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things unto him.</p>

<p>43:012:017 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</p>

<p>43:012:018 For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he had done this miracle.</p>

<p>43:012:019 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</p>

<p>43:012:020 And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worship at the feast:</p>

<p>43:012:021 The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</p>

<p>43:012:022 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell Jesus.</p>

<p>43:012:023 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son of man should be glorified.</p>

<p>43:012:024 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bringeth forth much fruit.</p>

<p>43:012:025 He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</p>

<p>43:012:026 If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father honour.</p>

<p>43:012:027 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</p>

<p>43:012:028 Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</p>

<p>43:012:029 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</p>

<p>43:012:030 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but for your sakes.</p>

<p>43:012:031 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this world be cast out.</p>

<p>43:012:032 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto me.</p>

<p>43:012:033 This he said, signifying what death he should die.</p>

<p>43:012:034 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</p>

<p>43:012:035 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he goeth.</p>

<p>43:012:036 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did hide himself from them.</p>

<p>43:012:037 But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believed not on him:</p>

<p>43:012:038 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</p>

<p>43:012:039 Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again,</p>

<p>43:012:040 He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</p>

<p>43:012:041 These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>43:012:042 Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they should be put out of the synagogue:</p>

<p>43:012:043 For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</p>

<p>43:012:044 Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on me, but on him that sent me.</p>

<p>43:012:045 And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</p>

<p>43:012:046 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me should not abide in darkness.</p>

<p>43:012:047 And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</p>

<p>43:012:048 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judge him in the last day.</p>

<p>43:012:049 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak.</p>

<p>43:012:050 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so I speak.</p>

<p>43:013:001 Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them unto the end.</p>

<p>43:013:002 And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;</p>

<p>43:013:003 Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;</p>

<p>43:013:004 He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;towel, and girded himself.</p>

<p>43:013:005 After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was girded.</p>

<p>43:013:006 Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dost thou wash my feet?</p>

<p>43:013:007 Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now; but thou shalt know hereafter.</p>

<p>43:013:008 Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.</p>

<p>43:013:009 Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my hands and my head.</p>

<p>43:013:010 Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all.</p>

<p>43:013:011 For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not all clean.</p>

<p>43:013:012 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done to you?</p>

<p>43:013:013 Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.</p>

<p>43:013:014 If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also ought to wash one another's feet.</p>

<p>43:013:015 For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done to you.</p>

<p>43:013:016 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent him.</p>

<p>43:013:017 If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.</p>

<p>43:013:018 I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath lifted up his heel against me.</p>

<p>43:013:019 Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye may believe that I am he.</p>

<p>43:013:020 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receiveth whomsoever I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent me.</p>

<p>43:013:021 When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of you shall betray me.</p>

<p>43:013:022 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spake.</p>

<p>43:013:023 Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom Jesus loved.</p>

<p>43:013:024 Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it should be of whom he spake.</p>

<p>43:013:025 He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it?</p>

<p>43:013:026 Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</p>

<p>43:013:027 And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, That thou doest, do quickly.</p>

<p>43:013:028 Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him.</p>

<p>43:013:029 For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the feast; or, that he should give something to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poor.</p>

<p>43:013:030 He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was night.</p>

<p>43:013:031 Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</p>

<p>43:013:032 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself, and shall straightway glorify him.</p>

<p>43:013:033 Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come; so now I say to you.</p>

<p>43:013:034 A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.</p>

<p>43:013:035 By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have love one to another.</p>

<p>43:013:036 Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou shalt follow me afterwards.</p>

<p>43:013:037 Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will lay down my life for thy sake.</p>

<p>43:013:038 Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou hast denied me thrice.</p>

<p>43:014:001 Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also in me.</p>

<p>43:014:002 In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.</p>

<p>43:014:003 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also.</p>

<p>43:014:004 And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.</p>

<p>43:014:005 Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and how can we know the way?</p>

<p>43:014:006 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</p>

<p>43:014:007 If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.</p>

<p>43:014:008 Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sufficeth us.</p>

<p>43:014:009 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?</p>

<p>43:014:010 Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.</p>

<p>43:014:011 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else believe me for the very works' sake.</p>

<p>43:014:012 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall he do; because I go unto my Father.</p>

<p>43:014:013 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Father may be glorified in the Son.</p>

<p>43:014:014 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.</p>

<p>43:014:015 If ye love me, keep my commandments.</p>

<p>43:014:016 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;</p>

<p>43:014:017 Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</p>

<p>43:014:018 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.</p>

<p>43:014:019 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me: because I live, ye shall live also.</p>

<p>43:014:020 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, and I in you.</p>

<p>43:014:021 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</p>

<p>43:014:022 Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?</p>

<p>43:014:023 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, and make our abode with him.</p>

<p>43:014:024 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.</p>

<p>43:014:025 These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you.</p>

<p>43:014:026 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you.</p>

<p>43:014:027 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither let it be afraid.</p>

<p>43:014:028 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.</p>

<p>43:014:029 And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is come to pass, ye might believe.</p>

<p>43:014:030 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.</p>

<p>43:014:031 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hence.</p>

<p>43:015:001 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</p>

<p>43:015:002 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bring forth more fruit.</p>

<p>43:015:003 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you.</p>

<p>43:015:004 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abide in me.</p>

<p>43:015:005 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye can do nothing.</p>

<p>43:015:006 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they are burned.</p>

<p>43:015:007 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</p>

<p>43:015:008 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall ye be my disciples.</p>

<p>43:015:009 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in my love.</p>

<p>43:015:010 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</p>

<p>43:015:011 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in you, and that your joy might be full.</p>

<p>43:015:012 This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loved you.</p>

<p>43:015:013 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life for his friends.</p>

<p>43:015:014 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</p>

<p>43:015:015 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto you.</p>

<p>43:015:016 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father in my name, he may give it you.</p>

<p>43:015:017 These things I command you, that ye love one another.</p>

<p>43:015:018 If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hated you.</p>

<p>43:015:019 If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the world, therefore the world hateth you.</p>

<p>43:015:020 Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep yours also.</p>

<p>43:015:021 But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they know not him that sent me.</p>

<p>43:015:022 If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but now they have no cloak for their sin.</p>

<p>43:015:023 He that hateth me hateth my Father also.</p>

<p>43:015:024 If I had not done among them the works which none other man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hated both me and my Father.</p>

<p>43:015:025 But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</p>

<p>43:015:026 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Father, he shall testify of me:</p>

<p>43:015:027 And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the beginning.</p>

<p>43:016:001 These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offended.</p>

<p>43:016:002 They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God service.</p>

<p>43:016:003 And these things will they do unto you, because they have not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known the Father, nor me.</p>

<p>43:016:004 But these things have I told you, that when the time shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with you.</p>

<p>43:016:005 But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asketh me, Whither goest thou?</p>

<p>43:016:006 But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;filled your heart.</p>

<p>43:016:007 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.</p>

<p>43:016:008 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteousness, and of judgment:</p>

<p>43:016:009 Of sin, because they believe not on me;</p>

<p>43:016:010 Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more;</p>

<p>43:016:011 Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</p>

<p>43:016:012 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them now.</p>

<p>43:016:013 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shew you things to come.</p>

<p>43:016:014 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shew it unto you.</p>

<p>43:016:015 All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</p>

<p>43:016:016 A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.</p>

<p>43:016:017 Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I go to the Father?</p>

<p>43:016:018 They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while? we cannot tell what he saith.</p>

<p>43:016:019 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while, and ye shall see me?</p>

<p>43:016:020 Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your sorrow shall be turned into joy.</p>

<p>43:016:021 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the world.</p>

<p>43:016:022 And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you.</p>

<p>43:016:023 And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will give it you.</p>

<p>43:016:024 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receive, that your joy may be full.</p>

<p>43:016:025 These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall shew you plainly of the Father.</p>

<p>43:016:026 At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I will pray the Father for you:</p>

<p>43:016:027 For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have believed that I came out from God.</p>

<p>43:016:028 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</p>

<p>43:016:029 His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and speakest no proverb.</p>

<p>43:016:030 Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;camest forth from God.</p>

<p>43:016:031 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</p>

<p>43:016:032 Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.</p>

<p>43:016:033 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cheer; I have overcome the world.</p>

<p>43:017:001 These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also may glorify thee:</p>

<p>43:017:002 As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.</p>

<p>43:017:003 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</p>

<p>43:017:004 I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which thou gavest me to do.</p>

<p>43:017:005 And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</p>

<p>43:017:006 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they have kept thy word.</p>

<p>43:017:007 Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me are of thee.</p>

<p>43:017:008 For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have received them, and have known surely that I came out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</p>

<p>43:017:009 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou hast given me; for they are thine.</p>

<p>43:017:010 And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in them.</p>

<p>43:017:011 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are.</p>

<p>43:017:012 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fulfilled.</p>

<p>43:017:013 And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.</p>

<p>43:017:014 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world.</p>

<p>43:017:015 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</p>

<p>43:017:016 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</p>

<p>43:017:017 Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</p>

<p>43:017:018 As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them into the world.</p>

<p>43:017:019 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sanctified through the truth.</p>

<p>43:017:020 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe on me through their word;</p>

<p>43:017:021 That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe that thou hast sent me.</p>

<p>43:017:022 And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they may be one, even as we are one:</p>

<p>43:017:023 I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</p>

<p>43:017:024 Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the world.</p>

<p>43:017:025 O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.</p>

<p>43:017:026 And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I in them.</p>

<p>43:018:001 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which he entered, and his disciples.</p>

<p>43:018:002 And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.</p>

<p>43:018:003 Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and torches and weapons.</p>

<p>43:018:004 Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?</p>

<p>43:018:005 They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.</p>

<p>43:018:006 As soon then as he had said unto them, I am he, they went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;backward, and fell to the ground.</p>

<p>43:018:007 Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Nazareth.</p>

<p>43:018:008 Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seek me, let these go their way:</p>

<p>43:018:009 That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which thou gavest me have I lost none.</p>

<p>43:018:010 Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name was Malchus.</p>

<p>43:018:011 Then said Jesus unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</p>

<p>43:018:012 Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus, and bound him,</p>

<p>43:018:013 And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.</p>

<p>43:018:014 Now Caiaphas was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was expedient that one man should die for the people.</p>

<p>43:018:015 And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus into the palace of the high priest.</p>

<p>43:018:016 But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.</p>

<p>43:018:017 Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto Peter, Art not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.</p>

<p>43:018:018 And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.</p>

<p>43:018:019 The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doctrine.</p>

<p>43:018:020 Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resort; and in secret have I said nothing.</p>

<p>43:018:021 Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them: behold, they know what I said.</p>

<p>43:018:022 And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou the high priest so?</p>

<p>43:018:023 Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?</p>

<p>43:018:024 Now Annas had sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.</p>

<p>43:018:025 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it, and said, I am not.</p>

<p>43:018:026 One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;garden with him?</p>

<p>43:018:027 Peter then denied again: and immediately the cock crew.</p>

<p>43:018:028 Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it was early; and they themselves went not into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might eat the passover.</p>

<p>43:018:029 Pilate then went out unto them, and said, What accusation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bring ye against this man?</p>

<p>43:018:030 They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</p>

<p>43:018:031 Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not lawful for us to put any man to death:</p>

<p>43:018:032 That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;signifying what death he should die.</p>

<p>43:018:033 Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again, and called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?</p>

<p>43:018:034 Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others tell it thee of me?</p>

<p>43:018:035 Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?</p>

<p>43:018:036 Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from hence.</p>

<p>43:018:037 Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heareth my voice.</p>

<p>43:018:038 Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find in him no fault at all.</p>

<p>43:018:039 But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King of the Jews?</p>

<p>43:018:040 Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Barabbas was a robber.</p>

<p>43:019:001 Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.</p>

<p>43:019:002 And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;head, and they put on him a purple robe,</p>

<p>43:019:003 And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their hands.</p>

<p>43:019:004 Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith unto them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no fault in him.</p>

<p>43:019:005 Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purple robe. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold the man!</p>

<p>43:019:006 When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>43:019:007 The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</p>

<p>43:019:008 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afraid;</p>

<p>43:019:009 And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto Jesus,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</p>

<p>43:019:010 Then saith Pilate unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;release thee?</p>

<p>43:019:011 Jesus answered, Thou couldest have no power at all against me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except it were given thee from above: therefore he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.</p>

<p>43:019:012 And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caesar's friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against Caesar.</p>

<p>43:019:013 When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</p>

<p>43:019:014 And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King!</p>

<p>43:019:015 But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</p>

<p>43:019:016 Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they took Jesus, and led him away.</p>

<p>43:019:017 And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew Golgotha:</p>

<p>43:019:018 Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;side one, and Jesus in the midst.</p>

<p>43:019:019 And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;writing was JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>

<p>43:019:020 This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.</p>

<p>43:019:021 Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</p>

<p>43:019:022 Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</p>

<p>43:019:023 Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top throughout.</p>

<p>43:019:024 They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the soldiers did.</p>

<p>43:019:025 Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magdalene.</p>

<p>43:019:026 When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son!</p>

<p>43:019:027 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.</p>

<p>43:019:028 After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thirst.</p>

<p>43:019:029 Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouth.</p>

<p>43:019:030 When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.</p>

<p>43:019:031 The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</p>

<p>43:019:032 Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the other which was crucified with him.</p>

<p>43:019:033 But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they brake not his legs:</p>

<p>43:019:034 But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forthwith came there out blood and water.</p>

<p>43:019:035 And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.</p>

<p>43:019:036 For these things were done, that the scripture should be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</p>

<p>43:019:037 And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they pierced.</p>

<p>43:019:038 And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.</p>

<p>43:019:039 And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about an hundred pound weight.</p>

<p>43:019:040 Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</p>

<p>43:019:041 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laid.</p>

<p>43:019:042 There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.</p>

<p>43:020:001 The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away from the sepulchre.</p>

<p>43:020:002 Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken away the LORD out of the sepulchre, and we know not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where they have laid him.</p>

<p>43:020:003 Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the sepulchre.</p>

<p>43:020:004 So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.</p>

<p>43:020:005 And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lying; yet went he not in.</p>

<p>43:020:006 Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,</p>

<p>43:020:007 And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.</p>

<p>43:020:008 Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.</p>

<p>43:020:009 For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again from the dead.</p>

<p>43:020:010 Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.</p>

<p>43:020:011 But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,</p>

<p>43:020:012 And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</p>

<p>43:020:013 And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where they have laid him.</p>

<p>43:020:014 And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</p>

<p>43:020:015 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laid him, and I will take him away.</p>

<p>43:020:016 Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</p>

<p>43:020:017 Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your God.</p>

<p>43:020:018 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD, and that he had spoken these things unto her.</p>

<p>43:020:019 Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</p>

<p>43:020:020 And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.</p>

<p>43:020:021 Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath sent me, even so send I you.</p>

<p>43:020:022 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:</p>

<p>43:020:023 Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.</p>

<p>43:020:024 But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them when Jesus came.</p>

<p>43:020:025 The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe.</p>

<p>43:020:026 And after eight days again his disciples were within, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.</p>

<p>43:020:027 Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;side: and be not faithless, but believing.</p>

<p>43:020:028 And Thomas answered and said unto him, My LORD and my God.</p>

<p>43:020:029 Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have believed.</p>

<p>43:020:030 And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples, which are not written in this book:</p>

<p>43:020:031 But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through his name.</p>

<p>43:021:001 After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.</p>

<p>43:021:002 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two other of his disciples.</p>

<p>43:021:003 Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.</p>

<p>43:021:004 But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</p>

<p>43:021:005 Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered him, No.</p>

<p>43:021:006 And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</p>

<p>43:021:007 Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did cast himself into the sea.</p>

<p>43:021:008 And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dragging the net with fishes.</p>

<p>43:021:009 As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</p>

<p>43:021:010 Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caught.</p>

<p>43:021:011 Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so many, yet was not the net broken.</p>

<p>43:021:012 Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord.</p>

<p>43:021:013 Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likewise.</p>

<p>43:021:014 This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</p>

<p>43:021:015 So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feed my lambs.</p>

<p>43:021:016 He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</p>

<p>43:021:017 He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, Feed my sheep.</p>

<p>43:021:018 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;girdest thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not.</p>

<p>43:021:019 This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.</p>

<p>43:021:020 Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?</p>

<p>43:021:021 Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do?</p>

<p>43:021:022 Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what is that to thee? follow thou me.</p>

<p>43:021:023 Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that to thee?</p>

<p>43:021:024 This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.</p>

<p>43:021:025 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even the world itself could not contain the books that should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be written. Amen.</p>
