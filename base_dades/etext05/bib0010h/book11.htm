<h1>Book 11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 Kings</h1>

<p>11:001:001 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him with clothes, but he gat no heat.</p>

<p>11:001:002 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that my lord the king may get heat.</p>

<p>11:001:003 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king.</p>

<p>11:001:004 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ministered to him: but the king knew her not.</p>

<p>11:001:005 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fifty men to run before him.</p>

<p>11:001:006 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his mother bare him after Absalom.</p>

<p>11:001:007 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.</p>

<p>11:001:008 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.</p>

<p>11:001:009 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:</p>

<p>11:001:010 But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon his brother, he called not.</p>

<p>11:001:011 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?</p>

<p>11:001:012 Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon.</p>

<p>11:001:013 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?</p>

<p>11:001:014 Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.</p>

<p>11:001:015 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king.</p>

<p>11:001:016 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king said, What wouldest thou?</p>

<p>11:001:017 And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.</p>

<p>11:001:018 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou knowest it not:</p>

<p>11:001:019 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant hath he not called.</p>

<p>11:001:020 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throne of my lord the king after him.</p>

<p>11:001:021 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counted offenders.</p>

<p>11:001:022 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet also came in.</p>

<p>11:001:023 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king with his face to the ground.</p>

<p>11:001:024 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</p>

<p>11:001:025 For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king Adonijah.</p>

<p>11:001:026 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called.</p>

<p>11:001:027 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lord the king after him?</p>

<p>11:001:028 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.</p>

<p>11:001:029 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;redeemed my soul out of all distress,</p>

<p>11:001:030 Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this day.</p>

<p>11:001:031 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for ever.</p>

<p>11:001:032 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king.</p>

<p>11:001:033 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mule, and bring him down to Gihon:</p>

<p>11:001:034 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God save king Solomon.</p>

<p>11:001:035 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.</p>

<p>11:001:036 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.</p>

<p>11:001:037 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my lord king David.</p>

<p>11:001:038 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought him to Gihon.</p>

<p>11:001:039 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the people said, God save king Solomon.</p>

<p>11:001:040 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rent with the sound of them.</p>

<p>11:001:041 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being in an uproar?</p>

<p>11:001:042 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.</p>

<p>11:001:043 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king David hath made Solomon king.</p>

<p>11:001:044 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ride upon the king's mule:</p>

<p>11:001:045 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heard.</p>

<p>11:001:046 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.</p>

<p>11:001:047 And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king bowed himself upon the bed.</p>

<p>11:001:048 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine eyes even seeing it.</p>

<p>11:001:049 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rose up, and went every man his way.</p>

<p>11:001:050 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</p>

<p>11:001:051 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will not slay his servant with the sword.</p>

<p>11:001:052 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be found in him, he shall die.</p>

<p>11:001:053 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.</p>

<p>11:002:001 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charged Solomon his son, saying,</p>

<p>11:002:002 I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shew thyself a man;</p>

<p>11:002:003 And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whithersoever thou turnest thyself:</p>

<p>11:002:004 That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before me in truth with all their heart and with all their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Israel.</p>

<p>11:002:005 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in his shoes that were on his feet.</p>

<p>11:002:006 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;head go down to the grave in peace.</p>

<p>11:002:007 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.</p>

<p>11:002:008 And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put thee to death with the sword.</p>

<p>11:002:009 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;head bring thou down to the grave with blood.</p>

<p>11:002:010 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David.</p>

<p>11:002:011 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reigned he in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>11:002:012 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom was established greatly.</p>

<p>11:002:013 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peaceably.</p>

<p>11:002:014 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Say on.</p>

<p>11:002:015 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it was his from the LORD.</p>

<p>11:002:016 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, Say on.</p>

<p>11:002:017 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shunammite to wife.</p>

<p>11:002:018 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.</p>

<p>11:002:019 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand.</p>

<p>11:002:020 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mother: for I will not say thee nay.</p>

<p>11:002:021 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy brother to wife.</p>

<p>11:002:022 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</p>

<p>11:002:023 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his own life.</p>

<p>11:002:024 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this day.</p>

<p>11:002:025 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.</p>

<p>11:002:026 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;barest the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afflicted.</p>

<p>11:002:027 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</p>

<p>11:002:028 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;altar.</p>

<p>11:002:029 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon him.</p>

<p>11:002:030 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</p>

<p>11:002:031 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father.</p>

<p>11:002:032 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.</p>

<p>11:002:033 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be peace for ever from the LORD.</p>

<p>11:002:034 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wilderness.</p>

<p>11:002:035 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abiathar.</p>

<p>11:002:036 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forth thence any whither.</p>

<p>11:002:037 For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.</p>

<p>11:002:038 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Jerusalem many days.</p>

<p>11:002:039 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gath.</p>

<p>11:002:040 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servants from Gath.</p>

<p>11:002:041 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gath, and was come again.</p>

<p>11:002:042 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.</p>

<p>11:002:043 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandment that I have charged thee with?</p>

<p>11:002:044 The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wickedness upon thine own head;</p>

<p>11:002:045 And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be established before the LORD for ever.</p>

<p>11:002:046 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;established in the hand of Solomon.</p>

<p>11:003:001 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until he had made an end of building his own house, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.</p>

<p>11:003:002 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.</p>

<p>11:003:003 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;places.</p>

<p>11:003:004 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offer upon that altar.</p>

<p>11:003:005 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.</p>

<p>11:003:006 And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day.</p>

<p>11:003:007 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know not how to go out or come in.</p>

<p>11:003:008 And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for multitude.</p>

<p>11:003:009 Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;able to judge this thy so great a people?</p>

<p>11:003:010 And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing.</p>

<p>11:003:011 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;</p>

<p>11:003:012 Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto thee.</p>

<p>11:003:013 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kings like unto thee all thy days.</p>

<p>11:003:014 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lengthen thy days.</p>

<p>11:003:015 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.</p>

<p>11:003:016 Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stood before him.</p>

<p>11:003:017 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house.</p>

<p>11:003:018 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that this woman was delivered also: and we were together;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house.</p>

<p>11:003:019 And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>11:003:020 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her dead child in my bosom.</p>

<p>11:003:021 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.</p>

<p>11:003:022 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king.</p>

<p>11:003:023 Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the dead, and my son is the living.</p>

<p>11:003:024 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the king.</p>

<p>11:003:025 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half to the one, and half to the other.</p>

<p>11:003:026 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.</p>

<p>11:003:027 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.</p>

<p>11:003:028 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God was in him, to do judgment.</p>

<p>11:004:001 So king Solomon was king over all Israel.</p>

<p>11:004:002 And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zadok the priest,</p>

<p>11:004:003 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Ahilud, the recorder.</p>

<p>11:004:004 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Abiathar were the priests:</p>

<p>11:004:005 And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;friend:</p>

<p>11:004:006 And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abda was over the tribute.</p>

<p>11:004:007 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;month in a year made provision.</p>

<p>11:004:008 And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:</p>

<p>11:004:009 The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Elonbethhanan:</p>

<p>11:004:010 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the land of Hepher:</p>

<p>11:004:011 The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:</p>

<p>11:004:012 Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jokneam:</p>

<p>11:004:013 The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great cities with walls and brasen bars:</p>

<p>11:004:014 Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:</p>

<p>11:004:015 Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon to wife:</p>

<p>11:004:016 Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:</p>

<p>11:004:017 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:</p>

<p>11:004:018 Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:</p>

<p>11:004:019 Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.</p>

<p>11:004:020 Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.</p>

<p>11:004:021 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.</p>

<p>11:004:022 And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,</p>

<p>11:004:023 Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fatted fowl.</p>

<p>11:004:024 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.</p>

<p>11:004:025 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days of Solomon.</p>

<p>11:004:026 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.</p>

<p>11:004:027 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;month: they lacked nothing.</p>

<p>11:004:028 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they unto the place where the officers were, every man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to his charge.</p>

<p>11:004:029 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shore.</p>

<p>11:004:030 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.</p>

<p>11:004:031 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was in all nations round about.</p>

<p>11:004:032 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand and five.</p>

<p>11:004:033 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fishes.</p>

<p>11:004:034 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.</p>

<p>11:005:001 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.</p>

<p>11:005:002 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,</p>

<p>11:005:003 Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soles of his feet.</p>

<p>11:005:004 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.</p>

<p>11:005:005 And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build an house unto my name.</p>

<p>11:005:006 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.</p>

<p>11:005:007 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people.</p>

<p>11:005:008 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fir.</p>

<p>11:005:009 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my desire, in giving food for my household.</p>

<p>11:005:010 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all his desire.</p>

<p>11:005:011 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.</p>

<p>11:005:012 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;league together.</p>

<p>11:005:013 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was thirty thousand men.</p>

<p>11:005:014 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adoniram was over the levy.</p>

<p>11:005:015 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;</p>

<p>11:005:016 Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people that wrought in the work.</p>

<p>11:005:017 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.</p>

<p>11:005:018 And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the house.</p>

<p>11:006:001 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the children of Israel were come out of the land of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build the house of the LORD.</p>

<p>11:006:002 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.</p>

<p>11:006:003 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.</p>

<p>11:006:004 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.</p>

<p>11:006:005 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:</p>

<p>11:006:006 The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walls of the house.</p>

<p>11:006:007 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house, while it was in building.</p>

<p>11:006:008 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chamber, and out of the middle into the third.</p>

<p>11:006:009 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with beams and boards of cedar.</p>

<p>11:006:010 And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</p>

<p>11:006:011 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,</p>

<p>11:006:012 Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, which I spake unto David thy father:</p>

<p>11:006:013 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forsake my people Israel.</p>

<p>11:006:014 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</p>

<p>11:006:015 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.</p>

<p>11:006:016 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place.</p>

<p>11:006:017 And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long.</p>

<p>11:006:018 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</p>

<p>11:006:019 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</p>

<p>11:006:020 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;altar which was of cedar.</p>

<p>11:006:021 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he overlaid it with gold.</p>

<p>11:006:022 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oracle he overlaid with gold.</p>

<p>11:006:023 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each ten cubits high.</p>

<p>11:006:024 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cubits.</p>

<p>11:006:025 And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of one measure and one size.</p>

<p>11:006:026 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other cherub.</p>

<p>11:006:027 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another in the midst of the house.</p>

<p>11:006:028 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</p>

<p>11:006:029 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within and without.</p>

<p>11:006:030 And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without.</p>

<p>11:006:031 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</p>

<p>11:006:032 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and upon the palm trees.</p>

<p>11:006:033 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tree, a fourth part of the wall.</p>

<p>11:006:034 And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;folding.</p>

<p>11:006:035 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work.</p>

<p>11:006:036 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a row of cedar beams.</p>

<p>11:006:037 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laid, in the month Zif:</p>

<p>11:006:038 And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven years in building it.</p>

<p>11:007:001 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finished all his house.</p>

<p>11:007:002 He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.</p>

<p>11:007:003 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.</p>

<p>11:007:004 And there were windows in three rows, and light was against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;light in three ranks.</p>

<p>11:007:005 And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;light was against light in three ranks.</p>

<p>11:007:006 And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before them.</p>

<p>11:007:007 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;side of the floor to the other.</p>

<p>11:007:008 And his house where he dwelt had another court within the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this porch.</p>

<p>11:007:009 All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the great court.</p>

<p>11:007:010 And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</p>

<p>11:007:011 And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stones, and cedars.</p>

<p>11:007:012 And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.</p>

<p>11:007:013 And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.</p>

<p>11:007:014 He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.</p>

<p>11:007:015 For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about.</p>

<p>11:007:016 And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:</p>

<p>11:007:017 And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.</p>

<p>11:007:018 And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.</p>

<p>11:007:019 And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of lily work in the porch, four cubits.</p>

<p>11:007:020 And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;above, over against the belly which was by the network: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other chapiter.</p>

<p>11:007:021 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boaz.</p>

<p>11:007:022 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the pillars finished.</p>

<p>11:007:023 And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</p>

<p>11:007:024 And under the brim of it round about there were knops<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.</p>

<p>11:007:025 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</p>

<p>11:007:026 And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contained two thousand baths.</p>

<p>11:007:027 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cubits the height of it.</p>

<p>11:007:028 And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;borders, and the borders were between the ledges:</p>

<p>11:007:029 And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made of thin work.</p>

<p>11:007:030 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.</p>

<p>11:007:031 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with their borders, foursquare, not round.</p>

<p>11:007:032 And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was a cubit and half a cubit.</p>

<p>11:007:033 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their spokes, were all molten.</p>

<p>11:007:034 And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.</p>

<p>11:007:035 And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the borders thereof were of the same.</p>

<p>11:007:036 For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.</p>

<p>11:007:037 After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;casting, one measure, and one size.</p>

<p>11:007:038 Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ten bases one laver.</p>

<p>11:007:039 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;side of the house eastward over against the south.</p>

<p>11:007:040 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon for the house of the LORD:</p>

<p>11:007:041 The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pillars;</p>

<p>11:007:042 And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;</p>

<p>11:007:043 And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;</p>

<p>11:007:044 And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</p>

<p>11:007:045 And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD, were of bright brass.</p>

<p>11:007:046 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ground between Succoth and Zarthan.</p>

<p>11:007:047 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.</p>

<p>11:007:048 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whereupon the shewbread was,</p>

<p>11:007:049 And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lamps, and the tongs of gold,</p>

<p>11:007:050 And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.</p>

<p>11:007:051 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD.</p>

<p>11:008:001 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, which is Zion.</p>

<p>11:008:002 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seventh month.</p>

<p>11:008:003 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ark.</p>

<p>11:008:004 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up.</p>

<p>11:008:005 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numbered for multitude.</p>

<p>11:008:006 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place, even under the wings of the cherubims.</p>

<p>11:008:007 For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereof above.</p>

<p>11:008:008 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not seen without: and there they are unto this day.</p>

<p>11:008:009 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egypt.</p>

<p>11:008:010 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,</p>

<p>11:008:011 So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD.</p>

<p>11:008:012 Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thick darkness.</p>

<p>11:008:013 I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for thee to abide in for ever.</p>

<p>11:008:014 And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stood;)</p>

<p>11:008:015 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fulfilled it, saying,</p>

<p>11:008:016 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David to be over my people Israel.</p>

<p>11:008:017 And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the name of the LORD God of Israel.</p>

<p>11:008:018 And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it was in thine heart.</p>

<p>11:008:019 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto my name.</p>

<p>11:008:020 And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the name of the LORD God of Israel.</p>

<p>11:008:021 And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought them out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>11:008:022 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;toward heaven:</p>

<p>11:008:023 And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart:</p>

<p>11:008:024 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.</p>

<p>11:008:025 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before me as thou hast walked before me.</p>

<p>11:008:026 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.</p>

<p>11:008:027 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house that I have builded?</p>

<p>11:008:028 Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:</p>

<p>11:008:029 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant shall make toward this place.</p>

<p>11:008:030 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forgive.</p>

<p>11:008:031 If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;altar in this house:</p>

<p>11:008:032 Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;justifying the righteous, to give him according to his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteousness.</p>

<p>11:008:033 When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto thee in this house:</p>

<p>11:008:034 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto their fathers.</p>

<p>11:008:035 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afflictest them:</p>

<p>11:008:036 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.</p>

<p>11:008:037 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plague, whatsoever sickness there be;</p>

<p>11:008:038 What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house:</p>

<p>11:008:039 Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the children of men;)</p>

<p>11:008:040 That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land which thou gavest unto our fathers.</p>

<p>11:008:041 Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;</p>

<p>11:008:042 (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pray toward this house;</p>

<p>11:008:043 Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;builded, is called by thy name.</p>

<p>11:008:044 If thy people go out to battle against their enemy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house that I have built for thy name:</p>

<p>11:008:045 Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and maintain their cause.</p>

<p>11:008:046 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the enemy, far or near;</p>

<p>11:008:047 Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wickedness;</p>

<p>11:008:048 And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the house which I have built for thy name:</p>

<p>11:008:049 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,</p>

<p>11:008:050 And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;captive, that they may have compassion on them:</p>

<p>11:008:051 For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of iron:</p>

<p>11:008:052 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.</p>

<p>11:008:053 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egypt, O LORD God.</p>

<p>11:008:054 And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his hands spread up to heaven.</p>

<p>11:008:055 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a loud voice, saying,</p>

<p>11:008:056 Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hand of Moses his servant.</p>

<p>11:008:057 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him not leave us, nor forsake us:</p>

<p>11:008:058 That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judgments, which he commanded our fathers.</p>

<p>11:008:059 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:</p>

<p>11:008:060 That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, and that there is none else.</p>

<p>11:008:061 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day.</p>

<p>11:008:062 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the LORD.</p>

<p>11:008:063 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.</p>

<p>11:008:064 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.</p>

<p>11:008:065 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven days, even fourteen days.</p>

<p>11:008:066 On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant, and for Israel his people.</p>

<p>11:009:001 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desire which he was pleased to do,</p>

<p>11:009:002 That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appeared unto him at Gibeon.</p>

<p>11:009:003 And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.</p>

<p>11:009:004 And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my judgments:</p>

<p>11:009:005 Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.</p>

<p>11:009:006 But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worship them:</p>

<p>11:009:007 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;byword among all people:</p>

<p>11:009:008 And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?</p>

<p>11:009:009 And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this evil.</p>

<p>11:009:010 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king's house,</p>

<p>11:009:011 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the land of Galilee.</p>

<p>11:009:012 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had given him; and they pleased him not.</p>

<p>11:009:013 And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day.</p>

<p>11:009:014 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.</p>

<p>11:009:015 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gezer.</p>

<p>11:009:016 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wife.</p>

<p>11:009:017 And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,</p>

<p>11:009:018 And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,</p>

<p>11:009:019 And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the land of his dominion.</p>

<p>11:009:020 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of Israel,</p>

<p>11:009:021 Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.</p>

<p>11:009:022 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.</p>

<p>11:009:023 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that wrought in the work.</p>

<p>11:009:024 But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Millo.</p>

<p>11:009:025 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD. So he finished the house.</p>

<p>11:009:026 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edom.</p>

<p>11:009:027 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.</p>

<p>11:009:028 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.</p>

<p>11:010:001 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hard questions.</p>

<p>11:010:002 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that was in her heart.</p>

<p>11:010:003 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing hid from the king, which he told her not.</p>

<p>11:010:004 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the house that he had built,</p>

<p>11:010:005 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.</p>

<p>11:010:006 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.</p>

<p>11:010:007 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.</p>

<p>11:010:008 Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.</p>

<p>11:010:009 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;justice.</p>

<p>11:010:010 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Sheba gave to king Solomon.</p>

<p>11:010:011 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;precious stones.</p>

<p>11:010:012 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto this day.</p>

<p>11:010:013 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she and her servants.</p>

<p>11:010:014 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,</p>

<p>11:010:015 Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the governors of the country.</p>

<p>11:010:016 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred shekels of gold went to one target.</p>

<p>11:010:017 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the forest of Lebanon.</p>

<p>11:010:018 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it with the best gold.</p>

<p>11:010:019 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.</p>

<p>11:010:020 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom.</p>

<p>11:010:021 And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days of Solomon.</p>

<p>11:010:022 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.</p>

<p>11:010:023 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for wisdom.</p>

<p>11:010:024 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God had put in his heart.</p>

<p>11:010:025 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and mules, a rate year by year.</p>

<p>11:010:026 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the king at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>11:010:027 And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vale, for abundance.</p>

<p>11:010:028 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</p>

<p>11:010:029 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syria, did they bring them out by their means.</p>

<p>11:011:001 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:</p>

<p>11:011:002 Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.</p>

<p>11:011:003 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.</p>

<p>11:011:004 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father.</p>

<p>11:011:005 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</p>

<p>11:011:006 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fully after the LORD, as did David his father.</p>

<p>11:011:007 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.</p>

<p>11:011:008 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incense and sacrificed unto their gods.</p>

<p>11:011:009 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him twice,</p>

<p>11:011:010 And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commanded.</p>

<p>11:011:011 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.</p>

<p>11:011:012 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.</p>

<p>11:011:013 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.</p>

<p>11:011:014 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.</p>

<p>11:011:015 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had smitten every male in Edom;</p>

<p>11:011:016 (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he had cut off every male in Edom:)</p>

<p>11:011:017 That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child.</p>

<p>11:011:018 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him victuals, and gave him land.</p>

<p>11:011:019 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tahpenes the queen.</p>

<p>11:011:020 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.</p>

<p>11:011:021 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country.</p>

<p>11:011:022 Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.</p>

<p>11:011:023 And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:</p>

<p>11:011:024 And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.</p>

<p>11:011:025 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and reigned over Syria.</p>

<p>11:011:026 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.</p>

<p>11:011:027 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city of David his father.</p>

<p>11:011:028 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.</p>

<p>11:011:029 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two were alone in the field:</p>

<p>11:011:030 And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in twelve pieces:</p>

<p>11:011:031 And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:</p>

<p>11:011:032 (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tribes of Israel:)</p>

<p>11:011:033 Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his father.</p>

<p>11:011:034 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my statutes:</p>

<p>11:011:035 But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give it unto thee, even ten tribes.</p>

<p>11:011:036 And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have chosen me to put my name there.</p>

<p>11:011:037 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.</p>

<p>11:011:038 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.</p>

<p>11:011:039 And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever.</p>

<p>11:011:040 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Egypt until the death of Solomon.</p>

<p>11:011:041 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon?</p>

<p>11:011:042 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was forty years.</p>

<p>11:011:043 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stead.</p>

<p>11:012:001 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shechem to make him king.</p>

<p>11:012:002 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)</p>

<p>11:012:003 That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,</p>

<p>11:012:004 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.</p>

<p>11:012:005 And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again to me. And the people departed.</p>

<p>11:012:006 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye advise that I may answer this people?</p>

<p>11:012:007 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servants for ever.</p>

<p>11:012:008 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with him, and which stood before him:</p>

<p>11:012:009 And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which thy father did put upon us lighter?</p>

<p>11:012:010 And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.</p>

<p>11:012:011 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</p>

<p>11:012:012 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day.</p>

<p>11:012:013 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men's counsel that they gave him;</p>

<p>11:012:014 And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you with scorpions.</p>

<p>11:012:015 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son of Nebat.</p>

<p>11:012:016 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel departed unto their tents.</p>

<p>11:012:017 But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</p>

<p>11:012:018 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>11:012:019 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.</p>

<p>11:012:020 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come again, that they sent and called him unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only.</p>

<p>11:012:021 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</p>

<p>11:012:022 But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</p>

<p>11:012:023 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the people, saying,</p>

<p>11:012:024 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;word of the LORD.</p>

<p>11:012:025 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.</p>

<p>11:012:026 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the house of David:</p>

<p>11:012:027 If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.</p>

<p>11:012:028 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>11:012:029 And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.</p>

<p>11:012:030 And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the one, even unto Dan.</p>

<p>11:012:031 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.</p>

<p>11:012:032 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.</p>

<p>11:012:033 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incense.</p>

<p>11:013:001 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burn incense.</p>

<p>11:013:002 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee.</p>

<p>11:013:003 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.</p>

<p>11:013:004 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that he could not pull it in again to him.</p>

<p>11:013:005 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the word of the LORD.</p>

<p>11:013:006 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as it was before.</p>

<p>11:013:007 And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.</p>

<p>11:013:008 And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eat bread nor drink water in this place:</p>

<p>11:013:009 For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou camest.</p>

<p>11:013:010 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came to Bethel.</p>

<p>11:013:011 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and told him all the works that the man of God had done that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them they told also to their father.</p>

<p>11:013:012 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah.</p>

<p>11:013:013 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him the ass: and he rode thereon,</p>

<p>11:013:014 And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from Judah? And he said, I am.</p>

<p>11:013:015 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.</p>

<p>11:013:016 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place:</p>

<p>11:013:017 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way that thou camest.</p>

<p>11:013:018 He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drink water. But he lied unto him.</p>

<p>11:013:019 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drank water.</p>

<p>11:013:020 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:</p>

<p>11:013:021 And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD thy God commanded thee,</p>

<p>11:013:022 But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sepulchre of thy fathers.</p>

<p>11:013:023 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet whom he had brought back.</p>

<p>11:013:024 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the lion also stood by the carcase.</p>

<p>11:013:025 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.</p>

<p>11:013:026 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.</p>

<p>11:013:027 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saddled him.</p>

<p>11:013:028 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the carcase, nor torn the ass.</p>

<p>11:013:029 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.</p>

<p>11:013:030 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over him, saying, Alas, my brother!</p>

<p>11:013:031 And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beside his bones:</p>

<p>11:013:032 For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to pass.</p>

<p>11:013:033 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the priests of the high places.</p>

<p>11:013:034 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>11:014:001 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.</p>

<p>11:014:002 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.</p>

<p>11:014:003 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the child.</p>

<p>11:014:004 And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes were set by reason of his age.</p>

<p>11:014:005 And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;woman.</p>

<p>11:014:006 And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent to thee with heavy tidings.</p>

<p>11:014:007 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee prince over my people Israel,</p>

<p>11:014:008 And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that only which was right in mine eyes;</p>

<p>11:014:009 But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:</p>

<p>11:014:010 Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.</p>

<p>11:014:011 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the LORD hath spoken it.</p>

<p>11:014:012 Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.</p>

<p>11:014:013 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house of Jeroboam.</p>

<p>11:014:014 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now.</p>

<p>11:014:015 For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD to anger.</p>

<p>11:014:016 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.</p>

<p>11:014:017 And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;died;</p>

<p>11:014:018 And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant Ahijah the prophet.</p>

<p>11:014:019 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chronicles of the kings of Israel.</p>

<p>11:014:020 And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his stead.</p>

<p>11:014:021 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.</p>

<p>11:014:022 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;above all that their fathers had done.</p>

<p>11:014:023 For they also built them high places, and images, and groves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on every high hill, and under every green tree.</p>

<p>11:014:024 And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to all the abominations of the nations which the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD cast out before the children of Israel.</p>

<p>11:014:025 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:</p>

<p>11:014:026 And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</p>

<p>11:014:027 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kept the door of the king's house.</p>

<p>11:014:028 And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chamber.</p>

<p>11:014:029 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah?</p>

<p>11:014:030 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days.</p>

<p>11:014:031 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>11:015:001 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reigned Abijam over Judah.</p>

<p>11:015:002 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.</p>

<p>11:015:003 And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, as the heart of David his father.</p>

<p>11:015:004 Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;establish Jerusalem:</p>

<p>11:015:005 Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Hittite.</p>

<p>11:015:006 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his life.</p>

<p>11:015:007 Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.</p>

<p>11:015:008 And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>11:015:009 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa over Judah.</p>

<p>11:015:010 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.</p>

<p>11:015:011 And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did David his father.</p>

<p>11:015:012 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the idols that his fathers had made.</p>

<p>11:015:013 And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.</p>

<p>11:015:014 But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was perfect with the LORD all his days.</p>

<p>11:015:015 And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.</p>

<p>11:015:016 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their days.</p>

<p>11:015:017 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asa king of Judah.</p>

<p>11:015:018 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Damascus, saying,</p>

<p>11:015:019 There is a league between me and thee, and between my father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, that he may depart from me.</p>

<p>11:015:020 So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the land of Naphtali.</p>

<p>11:015:021 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.</p>

<p>11:015:022 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.</p>

<p>11:015:023 The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feet.</p>

<p>11:015:024 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>11:015:025 And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two years.</p>

<p>11:015:026 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sin.</p>

<p>11:015:027 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laid siege to Gibbethon.</p>

<p>11:015:028 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, and reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>11:015:029 And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:</p>

<p>11:015:030 Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD God of Israel to anger.</p>

<p>11:015:031 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel?</p>

<p>11:015:032 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their days.</p>

<p>11:015:033 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years.</p>

<p>11:015:034 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sin.</p>

<p>11:016:001 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against Baasha, saying,</p>

<p>11:016:002 Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me to anger with their sins;</p>

<p>11:016:003 Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p>

<p>11:016:004 Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eat.</p>

<p>11:016:005 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kings of Israel?</p>

<p>11:016:006 So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Elah his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>11:016:007 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.</p>

<p>11:016:008 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.</p>

<p>11:016:009 And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.</p>

<p>11:016:010 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stead.</p>

<p>11:016:011 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kinsfolks, nor of his friends.</p>

<p>11:016:012 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the prophet.</p>

<p>11:016:013 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.</p>

<p>11:016:014 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel?</p>

<p>11:016:015 In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.</p>

<p>11:016:016 And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the camp.</p>

<p>11:016:017 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they besieged Tirzah.</p>

<p>11:016:018 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king's house over him with fire, and died.</p>

<p>11:016:019 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he did, to make Israel to sin.</p>

<p>11:016:020 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kings of Israel?</p>

<p>11:016:021 Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and half followed Omri.</p>

<p>11:016:022 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reigned.</p>

<p>11:016:023 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tirzah.</p>

<p>11:016:024 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samaria.</p>

<p>11:016:025 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than all that were before him.</p>

<p>11:016:026 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.</p>

<p>11:016:027 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>

<p>11:016:028 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahab his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>11:016:029 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.</p>

<p>11:016:030 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;above all that were before him.</p>

<p>11:016:031 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.</p>

<p>11:016:032 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he had built in Samaria.</p>

<p>11:016:033 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before him.</p>

<p>11:016:034 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.</p>

<p>11:017:001 And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to my word.</p>

<p>11:017:002 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,</p>

<p>11:017:003 Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.</p>

<p>11:017:004 And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.</p>

<p>11:017:005 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.</p>

<p>11:017:006 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.</p>

<p>11:017:007 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because there had been no rain in the land.</p>

<p>11:017:008 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,</p>

<p>11:017:009 Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sustain thee.</p>

<p>11:017:010 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.</p>

<p>11:017:011 And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.</p>

<p>11:017:012 And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;die.</p>

<p>11:017:013 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.</p>

<p>11:017:014 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.</p>

<p>11:017:015 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.</p>

<p>11:017:016 And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elijah.</p>

<p>11:017:017 And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.</p>

<p>11:017:018 And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remembrance, and to slay my son?</p>

<p>11:017:019 And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;laid him upon his own bed.</p>

<p>11:017:020 And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slaying her son?</p>

<p>11:017:021 And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child's soul come into him again.</p>

<p>11:017:022 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child came into him again, and he revived.</p>

<p>11:017:023 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.</p>

<p>11:017:024 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truth.</p>

<p>11:018:001 And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.</p>

<p>11:018:002 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sore famine in Samaria.</p>

<p>11:018:003 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:</p>

<p>11:018:004 For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)</p>

<p>11:018:005 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not all the beasts.</p>

<p>11:018:006 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself.</p>

<p>11:018:007 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lord Elijah?</p>

<p>11:018:008 And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is here.</p>

<p>11:018:009 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?</p>

<p>11:018:010 As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nation, that they found thee not.</p>

<p>11:018:011 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here.</p>

<p>11:018:012 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my youth.</p>

<p>11:018:013 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water?</p>

<p>11:018:014 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here: and he shall slay me.</p>

<p>11:018:015 And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.</p>

<p>11:018:016 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meet Elijah.</p>

<p>11:018:017 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?</p>

<p>11:018:018 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.</p>

<p>11:018:019 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jezebel's table.</p>

<p>11:018:020 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophets together unto mount Carmel.</p>

<p>11:018:021 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;word.</p>

<p>11:018:022 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fifty men.</p>

<p>11:018:023 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:</p>

<p>11:018:024 And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spoken.</p>

<p>11:018:025 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.</p>

<p>11:018:026 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was made.</p>

<p>11:018:027 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sleepeth, and must be awaked.</p>

<p>11:018:028 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.</p>

<p>11:018:029 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regarded.</p>

<p>11:018:030 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the LORD that was broken down.</p>

<p>11:018:031 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:</p>

<p>11:018:032 And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contain two measures of seed.</p>

<p>11:018:033 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.</p>

<p>11:018:034 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;third time.</p>

<p>11:018:035 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trench also with water.</p>

<p>11:018:036 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I have done all these things at thy word.</p>

<p>11:018:037 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again.</p>

<p>11:018:038 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;licked up the water that was in the trench.</p>

<p>11:018:039 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.</p>

<p>11:018:040 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.</p>

<p>11:018:041 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is a sound of abundance of rain.</p>

<p>11:018:042 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put his face between his knees,</p>

<p>11:018:043 And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Go again seven times.</p>

<p>11:018:044 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and get thee down that the rain stop thee not.</p>

<p>11:018:045 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.</p>

<p>11:018:046 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</p>

<p>11:019:001 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he had slain all the prophets with the sword.</p>

<p>11:019:002 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life of one of them by to morrow about this time.</p>

<p>11:019:003 And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant there.</p>

<p>11:019:004 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.</p>

<p>11:019:005 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.</p>

<p>11:019:006 And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drink, and laid him down again.</p>

<p>11:019:007 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;too great for thee.</p>

<p>11:019:008 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God.</p>

<p>11:019:009 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, What doest thou here, Elijah?</p>

<p>11:019:010 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take it away.</p>

<p>11:019:011 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:</p>

<p>11:019:012 And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fire: and after the fire a still small voice.</p>

<p>11:019:013 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What doest thou here, Elijah?</p>

<p>11:019:014 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life, to take it away.</p>

<p>11:019:015 And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be king over Syria:</p>

<p>11:019:016 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.</p>

<p>11:019:017 And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Jehu shall Elisha slay.</p>

<p>11:019:018 Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kissed him.</p>

<p>11:019:019 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mantle upon him.</p>

<p>11:019:020 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have I done to thee?</p>

<p>11:019:021 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.</p>

<p>11:020:001 And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against it.</p>

<p>11:020:002 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,</p>

<p>11:020:003 Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children, even the goodliest, are mine.</p>

<p>11:020:004 And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.</p>

<p>11:020:005 And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy children;</p>

<p>11:020:006 Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.</p>

<p>11:020:007 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.</p>

<p>11:020:008 And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not unto him, nor consent.</p>

<p>11:020:009 Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;messengers departed, and brought him word again.</p>

<p>11:020:010 And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;handfuls for all the people that follow me.</p>

<p>11:020:011 And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;putteth it off.</p>

<p>11:020:012 And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves in array against the city.</p>

<p>11:020:013 And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.</p>

<p>11:020:014 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.</p>

<p>11:020:015 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them he numbered all the people, even all the children of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, being seven thousand.</p>

<p>11:020:016 And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kings that helped him.</p>

<p>11:020:017 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are men come out of Samaria.</p>

<p>11:020:018 And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.</p>

<p>11:020:019 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the city, and the army which followed them.</p>

<p>11:020:020 And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an horse with the horsemen.</p>

<p>11:020:021 And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.</p>

<p>11:020:022 And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against thee.</p>

<p>11:020:023 And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be stronger than they.</p>

<p>11:020:024 And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place, and put captains in their rooms:</p>

<p>11:020:025 And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.</p>

<p>11:020:026 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel.</p>

<p>11:020:027 And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;present, and went against them: and the children of Israel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syrians filled the country.</p>

<p>11:020:028 And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</p>

<p>11:020:029 And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;footmen in one day.</p>

<p>11:020:030 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chamber.</p>

<p>11:020:031 And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save thy life.</p>

<p>11:020:032 So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he yet alive? he is my brother.</p>

<p>11:020:033 Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the chariot.</p>

<p>11:020:034 And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;covenant with him, and sent him away.</p>

<p>11:020:035 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the man refused to smite him.</p>

<p>11:020:036 Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a lion found him, and slew him.</p>

<p>11:020:037 Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.</p>

<p>11:020:038 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.</p>

<p>11:020:039 And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silver.</p>

<p>11:020:040 And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thyself hast decided it.</p>

<p>11:020:041 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.</p>

<p>11:020:042 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people for his people.</p>

<p>11:020:043 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and came to Samaria.</p>

<p>11:021:001 And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;palace of Ahab king of Samaria.</p>

<p>11:021:002 And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it in money.</p>

<p>11:021:003 And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.</p>

<p>11:021:004 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and would eat no bread.</p>

<p>11:021:005 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?</p>

<p>11:021:006 And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.</p>

<p>11:021:007 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jezreelite.</p>

<p>11:021:008 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.</p>

<p>11:021:009 And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naboth on high among the people:</p>

<p>11:021:010 And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.</p>

<p>11:021:011 And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them.</p>

<p>11:021:012 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people.</p>

<p>11:021:013 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.</p>

<p>11:021:014 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dead.</p>

<p>11:021:015 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dead.</p>

<p>11:021:016 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</p>

<p>11:021:017 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</p>

<p>11:021:018 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is gone down to possess it.</p>

<p>11:021:019 And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blood, even thine.</p>

<p>11:021:020 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to work evil in the sight of the LORD.</p>

<p>11:021:021 Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,</p>

<p>11:021:022 And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made Israel to sin.</p>

<p>11:021:023 And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.</p>

<p>11:021:024 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.</p>

<p>11:021:025 But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wife stirred up.</p>

<p>11:021:026 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the children of Israel.</p>

<p>11:021:027 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</p>

<p>11:021:028 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</p>

<p>11:021:029 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house.</p>

<p>11:022:001 And they continued three years without war between Syria and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel.</p>

<p>11:022:002 And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.</p>

<p>11:022:003 And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the hand of the king of Syria?</p>

<p>11:022:004 And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horses.</p>

<p>11:022:005 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, at the word of the LORD to day.</p>

<p>11:022:006 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.</p>

<p>11:022:007 And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;besides, that we might enquire of him?</p>

<p>11:022:008 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.</p>

<p>11:022:009 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.</p>

<p>11:022:010 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophesied before them.</p>

<p>11:022:011 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syrians, until thou have consumed them.</p>

<p>11:022:012 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king's hand.</p>

<p>11:022:013 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.</p>

<p>11:022:014 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, that will I speak.</p>

<p>11:022:015 So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall deliver it into the hand of the king.</p>

<p>11:022:016 And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the LORD?</p>

<p>11:022:017 And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.</p>

<p>11:022:018 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?</p>

<p>11:022:019 And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</p>

<p>11:022:020 And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another said on that manner.</p>

<p>11:022:021 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, I will persuade him.</p>

<p>11:022:022 And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persude him, and prevail<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also: go forth, and do so.</p>

<p>11:022:023 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerning thee.</p>

<p>11:022:024 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from me to speak unto thee?</p>

<p>11:022:025 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</p>

<p>11:022:026 And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son;</p>

<p>11:022:027 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affliction, until I come in peace.</p>

<p>11:022:028 And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of you.</p>

<p>11:022:029 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up to Ramothgilead.</p>

<p>11:022:030 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;battle.</p>

<p>11:022:031 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.</p>

<p>11:022:032 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cried out.</p>

<p>11:022:033 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back from pursuing him.</p>

<p>11:022:034 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of the host; for I am wounded.</p>

<p>11:022:035 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.</p>

<p>11:022:036 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every man to his own country.</p>

<p>11:022:037 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king in Samaria.</p>

<p>11:022:038 And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.</p>

<p>11:022:039 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kings of Israel?</p>

<p>11:022:040 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his stead.</p>

<p>11:022:041 And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</p>

<p>11:022:042 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</p>

<p>11:022:043 And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.</p>

<p>11:022:044 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</p>

<p>11:022:045 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>

<p>11:022:046 And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his father Asa, he took out of the land.</p>

<p>11:022:047 There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.</p>

<p>11:022:048 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.</p>

<p>11:022:049 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would not.</p>

<p>11:022:050 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>11:022:051 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two years over Israel.</p>

<p>11:022:052 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:</p>

<p>11:022:053 For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done.</p>
