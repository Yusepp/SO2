<h1>Book 40 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew</h1>

<p>40:001:001 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Abraham.</p>

<p>40:001:002 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judas and his brethren;</p>

<p>40:001:003 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;</p>

<p>40:001:004 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naasson begat Salmon;</p>

<p>40:001:005 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Obed begat Jesse;</p>

<p>40:001:006 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;</p>

<p>40:001:007 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begat Asa;</p>

<p>40:001:008 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begat Ozias;</p>

<p>40:001:009 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begat Ezekias;</p>

<p>40:001:010 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;begat Josias;</p>

<p>40:001:011 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were carried away to Babylon:</p>

<p>40:001:012 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</p>

<p>40:001:013 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliakim begat Azor;</p>

<p>40:001:014 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliud;</p>

<p>40:001:015 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthan begat Jacob;</p>

<p>40:001:016 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus, who is called Christ.</p>

<p>40:001:017 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generations; and from David until the carrying away into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.</p>

<p>40:001:018 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>40:001:019 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make her a publick example, was minded to put her away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;privily.</p>

<p>40:001:020 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>40:001:021 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</p>

<p>40:001:022 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</p>

<p>40:001:023 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interpreted is, God with us.</p>

<p>40:001:024 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</p>

<p>40:001:025 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he called his name JESUS.</p>

<p>40:002:001 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem,</p>

<p>40:002:002 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</p>

<p>40:002:003 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all Jerusalem with him.</p>

<p>40:002:004 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be born.</p>

<p>40:002:005 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written by the prophet,</p>

<p>40:002:006 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</p>

<p>40:002:007 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of them diligently what time the star appeared.</p>

<p>40:002:008 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.</p>

<p>40:002:009 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came and stood over where the young child was.</p>

<p>40:002:010 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;joy.</p>

<p>40:002:011 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.</p>

<p>40:002:012 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</p>

<p>40:002:013 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child to destroy him.</p>

<p>40:002:014 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night, and departed into Egypt:</p>

<p>40:002:015 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of Egypt have I called my son.</p>

<p>40:002:016 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two years old and under, according to the time which he had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diligently enquired of the wise men.</p>

<p>40:002:017 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet, saying,</p>

<p>40:002:018 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be comforted, because they are not.</p>

<p>40:002:019 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</p>

<p>40:002:020 Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;young child's life.</p>

<p>40:002:021 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came into the land of Israel.</p>

<p>40:002:022 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aside into the parts of Galilee:</p>

<p>40:002:023 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called a Nazarene.</p>

<p>40:003:001 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wilderness of Judaea,</p>

<p>40:003:002 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>

<p>40:003:003 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>

<p>40:003:004 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wild honey.</p>

<p>40:003:005 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;region round about Jordan,</p>

<p>40:003:006 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>

<p>40:003:007 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</p>

<p>40:003:008 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:</p>

<p>40:003:009 And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to raise up children unto Abraham.</p>

<p>40:003:010 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hewn down, and cast into the fire.</p>

<p>40:003:011 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with fire:</p>

<p>40:003:012 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</p>

<p>40:003:013 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baptized of him.</p>

<p>40:003:014 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, and comest thou to me?</p>

<p>40:003:015 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suffered him.</p>

<p>40:003:016 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon him:</p>

<p>40:003:017 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom I am well pleased.</p>

<p>40:004:001 Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tempted of the devil.</p>

<p>40:004:002 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afterward an hungred.</p>

<p>40:004:003 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God, command that these stones be made bread.</p>

<p>40:004:004 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouth of God.</p>

<p>40:004:005 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him on a pinnacle of the temple,</p>

<p>40:004:006 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</p>

<p>40:004:007 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lord thy God.</p>

<p>40:004:008 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the glory of them;</p>

<p>40:004:009 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wilt fall down and worship me.</p>

<p>40:004:010 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt thou serve.</p>

<p>40:004:011 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ministered unto him.</p>

<p>40:004:012 Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;departed into Galilee;</p>

<p>40:004:013 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</p>

<p>40:004:014 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet, saying,</p>

<p>40:004:015 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;</p>

<p>40:004:016 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up.</p>

<p>40:004:017 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>

<p>40:004:018 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sea: for they were fishers.</p>

<p>40:004:019 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of men.</p>

<p>40:004:020 And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.</p>

<p>40:004:021 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their father, mending their nets; and he called them.</p>

<p>40:004:022 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;followed him.</p>

<p>40:004:023 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people.</p>

<p>40:004:024 And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he healed them.</p>

<p>40:004:025 And there followed him great multitudes of people from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.</p>

<p>40:005:001 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he was set, his disciples came unto him:</p>

<p>40:005:002 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,</p>

<p>40:005:003 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven.</p>

<p>40:005:004 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</p>

<p>40:005:005 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</p>

<p>40:005:006 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteousness: for they shall be filled.</p>

<p>40:005:007 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</p>

<p>40:005:008 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</p>

<p>40:005:009 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of God.</p>

<p>40:005:010 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>40:005:011 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sake.</p>

<p>40:005:012 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you.</p>

<p>40:005:013 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of men.</p>

<p>40:005:014 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot be hid.</p>

<p>40:005:015 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house.</p>

<p>40:005:016 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</p>

<p>40:005:017 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</p>

<p>40:005:018 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fulfilled.</p>

<p>40:005:019 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven.</p>

<p>40:005:020 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>40:005:021 Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judgment:</p>

<p>40:005:022 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in danger of hell fire.</p>

<p>40:005:023 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;</p>

<p>40:005:024 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gift.</p>

<p>40:005:025 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cast into prison.</p>

<p>40:005:026 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.</p>

<p>40:005:027 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not commit adultery:</p>

<p>40:005:028 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after her hath committed adultery with her already in his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart.</p>

<p>40:005:029 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cast into hell.</p>

<p>40:005:030 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cast into hell.</p>

<p>40:005:031 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give her a writing of divorcement:</p>

<p>40:005:032 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;committeth adultery.</p>

<p>40:005:033 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lord thine oaths:</p>

<p>40:005:034 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is God's throne:</p>

<p>40:005:035 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.</p>

<p>40:005:036 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make one hair white or black.</p>

<p>40:005:037 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.</p>

<p>40:005:038 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tooth for a tooth:</p>

<p>40:005:039 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also.</p>

<p>40:005:040 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coat, let him have thy cloak also.</p>

<p>40:005:041 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twain.</p>

<p>40:005:042 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of thee turn not thou away.</p>

<p>40:005:043 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</p>

<p>40:005:044 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despitefully use you, and persecute you;</p>

<p>40:005:045 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</p>

<p>40:005:046 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not even the publicans the same?</p>

<p>40:005:047 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others? do not even the publicans so?</p>

<p>40:005:048 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven is perfect.</p>

<p>40:006:001 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven.</p>

<p>40:006:002 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, They have their reward.</p>

<p>40:006:003 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right hand doeth:</p>

<p>40:006:004 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</p>

<p>40:006:005 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</p>

<p>40:006:006 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;openly.</p>

<p>40:006:007 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they think that they shall be heard for their much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speaking.</p>

<p>40:006:008 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</p>

<p>40:006:009 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</p>

<p>40:006:010 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven.</p>

<p>40:006:011 Give us this day our daily bread.</p>

<p>40:006:012 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</p>

<p>40:006:013 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen.</p>

<p>40:006:014 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will also forgive you:</p>

<p>40:006:015 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father forgive your trespasses.</p>

<p>40:006:016 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their reward.</p>

<p>40:006:017 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;face;</p>

<p>40:006:018 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall reward thee openly.</p>

<p>40:006:019 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</p>

<p>40:006:020 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through nor steal:</p>

<p>40:006:021 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>

<p>40:006:022 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</p>

<p>40:006:023 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how great is that darkness!</p>

<p>40:006:024 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</p>

<p>40:006:025 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;body than raiment?</p>

<p>40:006:026 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them. Are ye not much better than they?</p>

<p>40:006:027 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stature?</p>

<p>40:006:028 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</p>

<p>40:006:029 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not arrayed like one of these.</p>

<p>40:006:030 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</p>

<p>40:006:031 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</p>

<p>40:006:032 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</p>

<p>40:006:033 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all these things shall be added unto you.</p>

<p>40:006:034 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the evil thereof.</p>

<p>40:007:001 Judge not, that ye be not judged.</p>

<p>40:007:002 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</p>

<p>40:007:003 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</p>

<p>40:007:004 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</p>

<p>40:007:005 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy brother's eye.</p>

<p>40:007:006 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feet, and turn again and rend you.</p>

<p>40:007:007 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</p>

<p>40:007:008 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</p>

<p>40:007:009 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he give him a stone?</p>

<p>40:007:010 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</p>

<p>40:007:011 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give good things to them that ask him?</p>

<p>40:007:012 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophets.</p>

<p>40:007:013 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be which go in thereat:</p>

<p>40:007:014 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</p>

<p>40:007:015 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</p>

<p>40:007:016 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thorns, or figs of thistles?</p>

<p>40:007:017 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</p>

<p>40:007:018 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</p>

<p>40:007:019 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cast into the fire.</p>

<p>40:007:020 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</p>

<p>40:007:021 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is in heaven.</p>

<p>40:007:022 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in thy name done many wonderful works?</p>

<p>40:007:023 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from me, ye that work iniquity.</p>

<p>40:007:024 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon a rock:</p>

<p>40:007:025 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;founded upon a rock.</p>

<p>40:007:026 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house upon the sand:</p>

<p>40:007:027 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fall of it.</p>

<p>40:007:028 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people were astonished at his doctrine:</p>

<p>40:007:029 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scribes.</p>

<p>40:008:001 When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;followed him.</p>

<p>40:008:002 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p>

<p>40:008:003 And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</p>

<p>40:008:004 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p>

<p>40:008:005 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a centurion, beseeching him,</p>

<p>40:008:006 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grievously tormented.</p>

<p>40:008:007 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.</p>

<p>40:008:008 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my servant shall be healed.</p>

<p>40:008:009 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</p>

<p>40:008:010 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faith, no, not in Israel.</p>

<p>40:008:011 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>40:008:012 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>40:008:013 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;healed in the selfsame hour.</p>

<p>40:008:014 And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mother laid, and sick of a fever.</p>

<p>40:008:015 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arose, and ministered unto them.</p>

<p>40:008:016 When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;word, and healed all that were sick:</p>

<p>40:008:017 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sicknesses.</p>

<p>40:008:018 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandment to depart unto the other side.</p>

<p>40:008:019 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</p>

<p>40:008:020 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lay his head.</p>

<p>40:008:021 And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first to go and bury my father.</p>

<p>40:008:022 But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their dead.</p>

<p>40:008:023 And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>40:008:024 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.</p>

<p>40:008:025 And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save us: we perish.</p>

<p>40:008:026 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was a great calm.</p>

<p>40:008:027 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that even the winds and the sea obey him!</p>

<p>40:008:028 And when he was come to the other side into the country of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by that way.</p>

<p>40:008:029 And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us before the time?</p>

<p>40:008:030 And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feeding.</p>

<p>40:008:031 So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.</p>

<p>40:008:032 And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perished in the waters.</p>

<p>40:008:033 And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possessed of the devils.</p>

<p>40:008:034 And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their coasts.</p>

<p>40:009:001 And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own city.</p>

<p>40:009:002 And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee.</p>

<p>40:009:003 And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man blasphemeth.</p>

<p>40:009:004 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in your hearts?</p>

<p>40:009:005 For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to say, Arise, and walk?</p>

<p>40:009:006 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.</p>

<p>40:009:007 And he arose, and departed to his house.</p>

<p>40:009:008 But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, which had given such power unto men.</p>

<p>40:009:009 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.</p>

<p>40:009:010 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his disciples.</p>

<p>40:009:011 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?</p>

<p>40:009:012 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.</p>

<p>40:009:013 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sinners to repentance.</p>

<p>40:009:014 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?</p>

<p>40:009:015 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then shall they fast.</p>

<p>40:009:016 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rent is made worse.</p>

<p>40:009:017 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.</p>

<p>40:009:018 While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;live.</p>

<p>40:009:019 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.</p>

<p>40:009:020 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his garment:</p>

<p>40:009:021 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be whole.</p>

<p>40:009:022 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the woman was made whole from that hour.</p>

<p>40:009:023 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minstrels and the people making a noise,</p>

<p>40:009:024 He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.</p>

<p>40:009:025 But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the hand, and the maid arose.</p>

<p>40:009:026 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.</p>

<p>40:009:027 And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.</p>

<p>40:009:028 And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.</p>

<p>40:009:029 Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it unto you.</p>

<p>40:009:030 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, See that no man know it.</p>

<p>40:009:031 But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that country.</p>

<p>40:009:032 As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possessed with a devil.</p>

<p>40:009:033 And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.</p>

<p>40:009:034 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prince of the devils.</p>

<p>40:009:035 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;healing every sickness and every disease among the people.</p>

<p>40:009:036 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheep having no shepherd.</p>

<p>40:009:037 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plenteous, but the labourers are few;</p>

<p>40:009:038 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forth labourers into his harvest.</p>

<p>40:010:001 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.</p>

<p>40:010:002 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son of Zebedee, and John his brother;</p>

<p>40:010:003 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thaddaeus;</p>

<p>40:010:004 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>40:010:005 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samaritans enter ye not:</p>

<p>40:010:006 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</p>

<p>40:010:007 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand.</p>

<p>40:010:008 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devils: freely ye have received, freely give.</p>

<p>40:010:009 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,</p>

<p>40:010:010 Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.</p>

<p>40:010:011 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.</p>

<p>40:010:012 And when ye come into an house, salute it.</p>

<p>40:010:013 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</p>

<p>40:010:014 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your feet.</p>

<p>40:010:015 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city.</p>

<p>40:010:016 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</p>

<p>40:010:017 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;</p>

<p>40:010:018 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.</p>

<p>40:010:019 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye shall speak.</p>

<p>40:010:020 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which speaketh in you.</p>

<p>40:010:021 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father the child: and the children shall rise up against their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parents, and cause them to be put to death.</p>

<p>40:010:022 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that endureth to the end shall be saved.</p>

<p>40:010:023 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.</p>

<p>40:010:024 The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his lord.</p>

<p>40:010:025 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;household?</p>

<p>40:010:026 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.</p>

<p>40:010:027 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.</p>

<p>40:010:028 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both soul and body in hell.</p>

<p>40:010:029 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not fall on the ground without your Father.</p>

<p>40:010:030 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</p>

<p>40:010:031 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sparrows.</p>

<p>40:010:032 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confess also before my Father which is in heaven.</p>

<p>40:010:033 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before my Father which is in heaven.</p>

<p>40:010:034 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send peace, but a sword.</p>

<p>40:010:035 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against her mother in law.</p>

<p>40:010:036 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.</p>

<p>40:010:037 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worthy of me.</p>

<p>40:010:038 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not worthy of me.</p>

<p>40:010:039 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life for my sake shall find it.</p>

<p>40:010:040 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receiveth him that sent me.</p>

<p>40:010:041 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man's reward.</p>

<p>40:010:042 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</p>

<p>40:011:001 And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preach in their cities.</p>

<p>40:011:002 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sent two of his disciples,</p>

<p>40:011:003 And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for another?</p>

<p>40:011:004 Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those things which ye do hear and see:</p>

<p>40:011:005 The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the poor have the gospel preached to them.</p>

<p>40:011:006 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p>

<p>40:011:007 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reed shaken with the wind?</p>

<p>40:011:008 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;houses.</p>

<p>40:011:009 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, and more than a prophet.</p>

<p>40:011:010 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee.</p>

<p>40:011:011 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greater than he.</p>

<p>40:011:012 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</p>

<p>40:011:013 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</p>

<p>40:011:014 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come.</p>

<p>40:011:015 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p>40:011:016 But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fellows,</p>

<p>40:011:017 And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.</p>

<p>40:011:018 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath a devil.</p>

<p>40:011:019 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.</p>

<p>40:011:020 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;works were done, because they repented not:</p>

<p>40:011:021 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ashes.</p>

<p>40:011:022 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.</p>

<p>40:011:023 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until this day.</p>

<p>40:011:024 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.</p>

<p>40:011:025 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.</p>

<p>40:011:026 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.</p>

<p>40:011:027 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>40:011:028 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will give you rest.</p>

<p>40:011:029 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</p>

<p>40:011:030 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</p>

<p>40:012:001 At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of corn and to eat.</p>

<p>40:012:002 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day.</p>

<p>40:012:003 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was an hungred, and they that were with him;</p>

<p>40:012:004 How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them which were with him, but only for the priests?</p>

<p>40:012:005 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blameless?</p>

<p>40:012:006 But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temple.</p>

<p>40:012:007 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.</p>

<p>40:012:008 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.</p>

<p>40:012:009 And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:</p>

<p>40:012:010 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days? that they might accuse him.</p>

<p>40:012:011 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</p>

<p>40:012:012 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lawful to do well on the sabbath days.</p>

<p>40:012:013 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other.</p>

<p>40:012:014 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how they might destroy him.</p>

<p>40:012:015 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;</p>

<p>40:012:016 And charged them that they should not make him known:</p>

<p>40:012:017 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet, saying,</p>

<p>40:012:018 Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.</p>

<p>40:012:019 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voice in the streets.</p>

<p>40:012:020 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.</p>

<p>40:012:021 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.</p>

<p>40:012:022 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both spake and saw.</p>

<p>40:012:023 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of David?</p>

<p>40:012:024 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devils.</p>

<p>40:012:025 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:</p>

<p>40:012:026 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how shall then his kingdom stand?</p>

<p>40:012:027 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.</p>

<p>40:012:028 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom of God is come unto you.</p>

<p>40:012:029 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will spoil his house.</p>

<p>40:012:030 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not with me scattereth abroad.</p>

<p>40:012:031 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.</p>

<p>40:012:032 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither in the world to come.</p>

<p>40:012:033 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by his fruit.</p>

<p>40:012:034 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speaketh.</p>

<p>40:012:035 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bringeth forth evil things.</p>

<p>40:012:036 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</p>

<p>40:012:037 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou shalt be condemned.</p>

<p>40:012:038 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.</p>

<p>40:012:039 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:</p>

<p>40:012:040 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the heart of the earth.</p>

<p>40:012:041 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</p>

<p>40:012:042 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</p>

<p>40:012:043 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.</p>

<p>40:012:044 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;garnished.</p>

<p>40:012:045 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.</p>

<p>40:012:046 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.</p>

<p>40:012:047 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stand without, desiring to speak with thee.</p>

<p>40:012:048 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mother? and who are my brethren?</p>

<p>40:012:049 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</p>

<p>40:012:050 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</p>

<p>40:013:001 The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;side.</p>

<p>40:013:002 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the shore.</p>

<p>40:013:003 And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</p>

<p>40:013:004 And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fowls came and devoured them up:</p>

<p>40:013:005 Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth:</p>

<p>40:013:006 And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had no root, they withered away.</p>

<p>40:013:007 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choked them:</p>

<p>40:013:008 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</p>

<p>40:013:009 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p>40:013:010 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them in parables?</p>

<p>40:013:011 He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not given.</p>

<p>40:013:012 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken away even that he hath.</p>

<p>40:013:013 Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</p>

<p>40:013:014 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye shall see, and shall not perceive:</p>

<p>40:013:015 For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and should understand with their heart, and should be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;converted, and I should heal them.</p>

<p>40:013:016 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they hear.</p>

<p>40:013:017 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have not heard them.</p>

<p>40:013:018 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</p>

<p>40:013:019 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received seed by the way side.</p>

<p>40:013:020 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;</p>

<p>40:013:021 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by and by he is offended.</p>

<p>40:013:022 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</p>

<p>40:013:023 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some thirty.</p>

<p>40:013:024 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;field:</p>

<p>40:013:025 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wheat, and went his way.</p>

<p>40:013:026 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then appeared the tares also.</p>

<p>40:013:027 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then hath it tares?</p>

<p>40:013:028 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?</p>

<p>40:013:029 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up also the wheat with them.</p>

<p>40:013:030 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wheat into my barn.</p>

<p>40:013:031 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sowed in his field:</p>

<p>40:013:032 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</p>

<p>40:013:033 Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</p>

<p>40:013:034 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and without a parable spake he not unto them:</p>

<p>40:013:035 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.</p>

<p>40:013:036 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parable of the tares of the field.</p>

<p>40:013:037 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is the Son of man;</p>

<p>40:013:038 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;</p>

<p>40:013:039 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</p>

<p>40:013:040 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall it be in the end of this world.</p>

<p>40:013:041 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which do iniquity;</p>

<p>40:013:042 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>40:013:043 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p>40:013:044 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;field.</p>

<p>40:013:045 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeking goodly pearls:</p>

<p>40:013:046 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that he had, and bought it.</p>

<p>40:013:047 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the sea, and gathered of every kind:</p>

<p>40:013:048 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.</p>

<p>40:013:049 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,</p>

<p>40:013:050 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>40:013:051 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say unto him, Yea, Lord.</p>

<p>40:013:052 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things new and old.</p>

<p>40:013:053 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parables, he departed thence.</p>

<p>40:013:054 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?</p>

<p>40:013:055 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judas?</p>

<p>40:013:056 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this man all these things?</p>

<p>40:013:057 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his own house.</p>

<p>40:013:058 And he did not many mighty works there because of their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unbelief.</p>

<p>40:014:001 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,</p>

<p>40:014:002 And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves in him.</p>

<p>40:014:003 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.</p>

<p>40:014:004 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.</p>

<p>40:014:005 And when he would have put him to death, he feared the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</p>

<p>40:014:006 But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;danced before them, and pleased Herod.</p>

<p>40:014:007 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would ask.</p>

<p>40:014:008 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here John Baptist's head in a charger.</p>

<p>40:014:009 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her.</p>

<p>40:014:010 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.</p>

<p>40:014:011 And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;damsel: and she brought it to her mother.</p>

<p>40:014:012 And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and went and told Jesus.</p>

<p>40:014:013 When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they followed him on foot out of the cities.</p>

<p>40:014:014 And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.</p>

<p>40:014:015 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves victuals.</p>

<p>40:014:016 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to eat.</p>

<p>40:014:017 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fishes.</p>

<p>40:014:018 He said, Bring them hither to me.</p>

<p>40:014:019 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</p>

<p>40:014:020 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fragments that remained twelve baskets full.</p>

<p>40:014:021 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;women and children.</p>

<p>40:014:022 And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the multitudes away.</p>

<p>40:014:023 And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there alone.</p>

<p>40:014:024 But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waves: for the wind was contrary.</p>

<p>40:014:025 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walking on the sea.</p>

<p>40:014:026 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.</p>

<p>40:014:027 But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cheer; it is I; be not afraid.</p>

<p>40:014:028 And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come unto thee on the water.</p>

<p>40:014:029 And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.</p>

<p>40:014:030 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.</p>

<p>40:014:031 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;didst thou doubt?</p>

<p>40:014:032 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</p>

<p>40:014:033 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.</p>

<p>40:014:034 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gennesaret.</p>

<p>40:014:035 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out into all that country round about, and brought unto him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that were diseased;</p>

<p>40:014:036 And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.</p>

<p>40:015:001 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem, saying,</p>

<p>40:015:002 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</p>

<p>40:015:003 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the commandment of God by your tradition?</p>

<p>40:015:004 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</p>

<p>40:015:005 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</p>

<p>40:015:006 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your tradition.</p>

<p>40:015:007 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</p>

<p>40:015:008 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</p>

<p>40:015:009 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandments of men.</p>

<p>40:015:010 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand:</p>

<p>40:015:011 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</p>

<p>40:015:012 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</p>

<p>40:015:013 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</p>

<p>40:015:014 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</p>

<p>40:015:015 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parable.</p>

<p>40:015:016 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?</p>

<p>40:015:017 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</p>

<p>40:015:018 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the heart; and they defile the man.</p>

<p>40:015:019 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</p>

<p>40:015:020 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unwashen hands defileth not a man.</p>

<p>40:015:021 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Sidon.</p>

<p>40:015:022 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</p>

<p>40:015:023 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</p>

<p>40:015:024 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheep of the house of Israel.</p>

<p>40:015:025 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</p>

<p>40:015:026 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</p>

<p>40:015:027 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which fall from their masters' table.</p>

<p>40:015:028 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made whole from that very hour.</p>

<p>40:015:029 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</p>

<p>40:015:030 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:</p>

<p>40:015:031 Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>

<p>40:015:032 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</p>

<p>40:015:033 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</p>

<p>40:015:034 And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</p>

<p>40:015:035 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</p>

<p>40:015:036 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the multitude.</p>

<p>40:015:037 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broken meat that was left seven baskets full.</p>

<p>40:015:038 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children.</p>

<p>40:015:039 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the coasts of Magdala.</p>

<p>40:016:001 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.</p>

<p>40:016:002 He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be fair weather: for the sky is red.</p>

<p>40:016:003 And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;times?</p>

<p>40:016:004 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.</p>

<p>40:016:005 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forgotten to take bread.</p>

<p>40:016:006 Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</p>

<p>40:016:007 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have taken no bread.</p>

<p>40:016:008 Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no bread?</p>

<p>40:016:009 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?</p>

<p>40:016:010 Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baskets ye took up?</p>

<p>40:016:011 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pharisees and of the Sadducees?</p>

<p>40:016:012 Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Sadducees.</p>

<p>40:016:013 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am?</p>

<p>40:016:014 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.</p>

<p>40:016:015 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?</p>

<p>40:016:016 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son of the living God.</p>

<p>40:016:017 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but my Father which is in heaven.</p>

<p>40:016:018 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prevail against it.</p>

<p>40:016:019 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loosed in heaven.</p>

<p>40:016:020 Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he was Jesus the Christ.</p>

<p>40:016:021 From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be raised again the third day.</p>

<p>40:016:022 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.</p>

<p>40:016:023 But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that be of God, but those that be of men.</p>

<p>40:016:024 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>40:016:025 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will lose his life for my sake shall find it.</p>

<p>40:016:026 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for his soul?</p>

<p>40:016:027 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his works.</p>

<p>40:016:028 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his kingdom.</p>

<p>40:017:001 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,</p>

<p>40:017:002 And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.</p>

<p>40:017:003 And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with him.</p>

<p>40:017:004 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elias.</p>

<p>40:017:005 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.</p>

<p>40:017:006 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were sore afraid.</p>

<p>40:017:007 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afraid.</p>

<p>40:017:008 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus only.</p>

<p>40:017:009 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;risen again from the dead.</p>

<p>40:017:010 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Elias must first come?</p>

<p>40:017:011 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come, and restore all things.</p>

<p>40:017:012 But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.</p>

<p>40:017:013 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Baptist.</p>

<p>40:017:014 And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,</p>

<p>40:017:015 Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water.</p>

<p>40:017:016 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>40:017:017 Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suffer you? bring him hither to me.</p>

<p>40:017:018 And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the child was cured from that very hour.</p>

<p>40:017:019 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not we cast him out?</p>

<p>40:017:020 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</p>

<p>40:017:021 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.</p>

<p>40:017:022 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:</p>

<p>40:017:023 And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again. And they were exceeding sorry.</p>

<p>40:017:024 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pay tribute?</p>

<p>40:017:025 He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children, or of strangers?</p>

<p>40:017:026 Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are the children free.</p>

<p>40:017:027 Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.</p>

<p>40:018:001 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?</p>

<p>40:018:002 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;midst of them,</p>

<p>40:018:003 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of heaven.</p>

<p>40:018:004 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>40:018:005 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receiveth me.</p>

<p>40:018:006 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sea.</p>

<p>40:018:007 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cometh!</p>

<p>40:018:008 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be cast into everlasting fire.</p>

<p>40:018:009 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</p>

<p>40:018:010 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;face of my Father which is in heaven.</p>

<p>40:018:011 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.</p>

<p>40:018:012 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;astray?</p>

<p>40:018:013 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which went not astray.</p>

<p>40:018:014 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that one of these little ones should perish.</p>

<p>40:018:015 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</p>

<p>40:018:016 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be established.</p>

<p>40:018:017 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an heathen man and a publican.</p>

<p>40:018:018 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be loosed in heaven.</p>

<p>40:018:019 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for them of my Father which is in heaven.</p>

<p>40:018:020 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am I in the midst of them.</p>

<p>40:018:021 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?</p>

<p>40:018:022 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but, Until seventy times seven.</p>

<p>40:018:023 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king, which would take account of his servants.</p>

<p>40:018:024 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which owed him ten thousand talents.</p>

<p>40:018:025 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;payment to be made.</p>

<p>40:018:026 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</p>

<p>40:018:027 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loosed him, and forgave him the debt.</p>

<p>40:018:028 But the same servant went out, and found one of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou owest.</p>

<p>40:018:029 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</p>

<p>40:018:030 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should pay the debt.</p>

<p>40:018:031 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.</p>

<p>40:018:032 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou desiredst me:</p>

<p>40:018:033 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?</p>

<p>40:018:034 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;till he should pay all that was due unto him.</p>

<p>40:018:035 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trespasses.</p>

<p>40:019:001 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judaea beyond Jordan;</p>

<p>40:019:002 And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.</p>

<p>40:019:003 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every cause?</p>

<p>40:019:004 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which made them at the beginning made them male and female,</p>

<p>40:019:005 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flesh?</p>

<p>40:019:006 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</p>

<p>40:019:007 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;writing of divorcement, and to put her away?</p>

<p>40:019:008 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beginning it was not so.</p>

<p>40:019:009 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adultery.</p>

<p>40:019:010 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his wife, it is not good to marry.</p>

<p>40:019:011 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save they to whom it is given.</p>

<p>40:019:012 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is able to receive it, let him receive it.</p>

<p>40:019:013 Then were there brought unto him little children, that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rebuked them.</p>

<p>40:019:014 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>40:019:015 And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.</p>

<p>40:019:016 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</p>

<p>40:019:017 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep the commandments.</p>

<p>40:019:018 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt not bear false witness,</p>

<p>40:019:019 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbour as thyself.</p>

<p>40:019:020 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from my youth up: what lack I yet?</p>

<p>40:019:021 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in heaven: and come and follow me.</p>

<p>40:019:022 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</p>

<p>40:019:023 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>40:019:024 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>40:019:025 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Who then can be saved?</p>

<p>40:019:026 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impossible; but with God all things are possible.</p>

<p>40:019:027 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?</p>

<p>40:019:028 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>

<p>40:019:029 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inherit everlasting life.</p>

<p>40:019:030 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first.</p>

<p>40:020:001 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;householder, which went out early in the morning to hire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;labourers into his vineyard.</p>

<p>40:020:002 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he sent them into his vineyard.</p>

<p>40:020:003 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;idle in the marketplace,</p>

<p>40:020:004 And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.</p>

<p>40:020:005 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likewise.</p>

<p>40:020:006 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day idle?</p>

<p>40:020:007 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that shall ye receive.</p>

<p>40:020:008 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beginning from the last unto the first.</p>

<p>40:020:009 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they received every man a penny.</p>

<p>40:020:010 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.</p>

<p>40:020:011 And when they had received it, they murmured against the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goodman of the house,</p>

<p>40:020:012 Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the day.</p>

<p>40:020:013 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?</p>

<p>40:020:014 Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last, even as unto thee.</p>

<p>40:020:015 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thine eye evil, because I am good?</p>

<p>40:020:016 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called, but few chosen.</p>

<p>40:020:017 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apart in the way, and said unto them,</p>

<p>40:020:018 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall condemn him to death,</p>

<p>40:020:019 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.</p>

<p>40:020:020 Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.</p>

<p>40:020:021 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.</p>

<p>40:020:022 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, We are able.</p>

<p>40:020:023 And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father.</p>

<p>40:020:024 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the two brethren.</p>

<p>40:020:025 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that are great exercise authority upon them.</p>

<p>40:020:026 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among you, let him be your minister;</p>

<p>40:020:027 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant:</p>

<p>40:020:028 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</p>

<p>40:020:029 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>40:020:030 And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us, O Lord, thou son of David.</p>

<p>40:020:031 And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, thou son of David.</p>

<p>40:020:032 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I shall do unto you?</p>

<p>40:020:033 They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</p>

<p>40:020:034 So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.</p>

<p>40:021:001 And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples,</p>

<p>40:021:002 Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loose them, and bring them unto me.</p>

<p>40:021:003 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;need of them; and straightway he will send them.</p>

<p>40:021:004 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the prophet, saying,</p>

<p>40:021:005 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ass.</p>

<p>40:021:006 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,</p>

<p>40:021:007 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clothes, and they set him thereon.</p>

<p>40:021:008 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the way.</p>

<p>40:021:009 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p>40:021:010 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Who is this?</p>

<p>40:021:011 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Galilee.</p>

<p>40:021:012 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,</p>

<p>40:021:013 And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.</p>

<p>40:021:014 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;healed them.</p>

<p>40:021:015 And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;displeased,</p>

<p>40:021:016 And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?</p>

<p>40:021:017 And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he lodged there.</p>

<p>40:021:018 Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.</p>

<p>40:021:019 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fig tree withered away.</p>

<p>40:021:020 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soon is the fig tree withered away!</p>

<p>40:021:021 Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be done.</p>

<p>40:021:022 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye shall receive.</p>

<p>40:021:023 And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee this authority?</p>

<p>40:021:024 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what authority I do these things.</p>

<p>40:021:025 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him?</p>

<p>40:021:026 But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John as a prophet.</p>

<p>40:021:027 And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things.</p>

<p>40:021:028 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</p>

<p>40:021:029 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and went.</p>

<p>40:021:030 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and said, I go, sir: and went not.</p>

<p>40:021:031 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God before you.</p>

<p>40:021:032 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye might believe him.</p>

<p>40:021:033 Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;husbandmen, and went into a far country:</p>

<p>40:021:034 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.</p>

<p>40:021:035 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another, and stoned another.</p>

<p>40:021:036 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did unto them likewise.</p>

<p>40:021:037 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reverence my son.</p>

<p>40:021:038 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us seize on his inheritance.</p>

<p>40:021:039 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slew him.</p>

<p>40:021:040 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do unto those husbandmen?</p>

<p>40:021:041 They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</p>

<p>40:021:042 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marvellous in our eyes?</p>

<p>40:021:043 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereof.</p>

<p>40:021:044 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</p>

<p>40:021:045 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parables, they perceived that he spake of them.</p>

<p>40:021:046 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</p>

<p>40:022:001 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said,</p>

<p>40:022:002 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a marriage for his son,</p>

<p>40:022:003 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wedding: and they would not come.</p>

<p>40:022:004 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marriage.</p>

<p>40:022:005 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;farm, another to his merchandise:</p>

<p>40:022:006 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spitefully, and slew them.</p>

<p>40:022:007 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their city.</p>

<p>40:022:008 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which were bidden were not worthy.</p>

<p>40:022:009 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find, bid to the marriage.</p>

<p>40:022:010 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wedding was furnished with guests.</p>

<p>40:022:011 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man which had not on a wedding garment:</p>

<p>40:022:012 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</p>

<p>40:022:013 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>40:022:014 For many are called, but few are chosen.</p>

<p>40:022:015 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entangle him in his talk.</p>

<p>40:022:016 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regardest not the person of men.</p>

<p>40:022:017 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tribute unto Caesar, or not?</p>

<p>40:022:018 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, ye hypocrites?</p>

<p>40:022:019 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.</p>

<p>40:022:020 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;superscription?</p>

<p>40:022:021 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God the things that are God's.</p>

<p>40:022:022 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and went their way.</p>

<p>40:022:023 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is no resurrection, and asked him,</p>

<p>40:022:024 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother.</p>

<p>40:022:025 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wife unto his brother:</p>

<p>40:022:026 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.</p>

<p>40:022:027 And last of all the woman died also.</p>

<p>40:022:028 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven? for they all had her.</p>

<p>40:022:029 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scriptures, nor the power of God.</p>

<p>40:022:030 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</p>

<p>40:022:031 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</p>

<p>40:022:032 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</p>

<p>40:022:033 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doctrine.</p>

<p>40:022:034 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to silence, they were gathered together.</p>

<p>40:022:035 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tempting him, and saying,</p>

<p>40:022:036 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</p>

<p>40:022:037 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</p>

<p>40:022:038 This is the first and great commandment.</p>

<p>40:022:039 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as thyself.</p>

<p>40:022:040 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</p>

<p>40:022:041 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</p>

<p>40:022:042 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, The son of David.</p>

<p>40:022:043 He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, saying,</p>

<p>40:022:044 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make thine enemies thy footstool?</p>

<p>40:022:045 If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</p>

<p>40:022:046 And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man from that day forth ask him any more questions.</p>

<p>40:023:001 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,</p>

<p>40:023:002 Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:</p>

<p>40:023:003 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not.</p>

<p>40:023:004 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them with one of their fingers.</p>

<p>40:023:005 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;garments,</p>

<p>40:023:006 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the synagogues,</p>

<p>40:023:007 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabbi.</p>

<p>40:023:008 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ; and all ye are brethren.</p>

<p>40:023:009 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, which is in heaven.</p>

<p>40:023:010 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ.</p>

<p>40:023:011 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.</p>

<p>40:023:012 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall humble himself shall be exalted.</p>

<p>40:023:013 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in.</p>

<p>40:023:014 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye shall receive the greater damnation.</p>

<p>40:023:015 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yourselves.</p>

<p>40:023:016 Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!</p>

<p>40:023:017 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temple that sanctifieth the gold?</p>

<p>40:023:018 And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.</p>

<p>40:023:019 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;altar that sanctifieth the gift?</p>

<p>40:023:020 Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by all things thereon.</p>

<p>40:023:021 And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him that dwelleth therein.</p>

<p>40:023:022 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, and by him that sitteth thereon.</p>

<p>40:023:023 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;undone.</p>

<p>40:023:024 Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.</p>

<p>40:023:025 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are full of extortion and excess.</p>

<p>40:023:026 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.</p>

<p>40:023:027 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uncleanness.</p>

<p>40:023:028 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.</p>

<p>40:023:029 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the righteous,</p>

<p>40:023:030 And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not have been partakers with them in the blood of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophets.</p>

<p>40:023:031 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of them which killed the prophets.</p>

<p>40:023:032 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.</p>

<p>40:023:033 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;damnation of hell?</p>

<p>40:023:034 Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them from city to city:</p>

<p>40:023:035 That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the altar.</p>

<p>40:023:036 Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generation.</p>

<p>40:023:037 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chickens under her wings, and ye would not!</p>

<p>40:023:038 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.</p>

<p>40:023:039 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</p>

<p>40:024:001 And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temple.</p>

<p>40:024:002 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another, that shall not be thrown down.</p>

<p>40:024:003 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the world?</p>

<p>40:024:004 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deceive you.</p>

<p>40:024:005 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deceive many.</p>

<p>40:024:006 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end is not yet.</p>

<p>40:024:007 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earthquakes, in divers places.</p>

<p>40:024:008 All these are the beginning of sorrows.</p>

<p>40:024:009 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.</p>

<p>40:024:010 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and shall hate one another.</p>

<p>40:024:011 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.</p>

<p>40:024:012 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cold.</p>

<p>40:024:013 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saved.</p>

<p>40:024:014 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come.</p>

<p>40:024:015 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(whoso readeth, let him understand:)</p>

<p>40:024:016 Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:</p>

<p>40:024:017 Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing out of his house:</p>

<p>40:024:018 Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clothes.</p>

<p>40:024:019 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suck in those days!</p>

<p>40:024:020 But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sabbath day:</p>

<p>40:024:021 For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.</p>

<p>40:024:022 And except those days should be shortened, there should no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shortened.</p>

<p>40:024:023 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there; believe it not.</p>

<p>40:024:024 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</p>

<p>40:024:025 Behold, I have told you before.</p>

<p>40:024:026 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe it not.</p>

<p>40:024:027 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</p>

<p>40:024:028 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gathered together.</p>

<p>40:024:029 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be shaken:</p>

<p>40:024:030 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power and great glory.</p>

<p>40:024:031 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from one end of heaven to the other.</p>

<p>40:024:032 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:</p>

<p>40:024:033 So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is near, even at the doors.</p>

<p>40:024:034 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all these things be fulfilled.</p>

<p>40:024:035 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away.</p>

<p>40:024:036 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven, but my Father only.</p>

<p>40:024:037 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son of man be.</p>

<p>40:024:038 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Noe entered into the ark,</p>

<p>40:024:039 And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</p>

<p>40:024:040 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other left.</p>

<p>40:024:041 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken, and the other left.</p>

<p>40:024:042 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come.</p>

<p>40:024:043 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would not have suffered his house to be broken up.</p>

<p>40:024:044 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not the Son of man cometh.</p>

<p>40:024:045 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;season?</p>

<p>40:024:046 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find so doing.</p>

<p>40:024:047 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his goods.</p>

<p>40:024:048 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delayeth his coming;</p>

<p>40:024:049 And shall begin to smite his fellowservants, and to eat and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drink with the drunken;</p>

<p>40:024:050 The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,</p>

<p>40:024:051 And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>40:025:001 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</p>

<p>40:025:002 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</p>

<p>40:025:003 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them:</p>

<p>40:025:004 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</p>

<p>40:025:005 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</p>

<p>40:025:006 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cometh; go ye out to meet him.</p>

<p>40:025:007 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</p>

<p>40:025:008 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our lamps are gone out.</p>

<p>40:025:009 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buy for yourselves.</p>

<p>40:025:010 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shut.</p>

<p>40:025:011 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;open to us.</p>

<p>40:025:012 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not.</p>

<p>40:025:013 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wherein the Son of man cometh.</p>

<p>40:025:014 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his goods.</p>

<p>40:025:015 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another one; to every man according to his several ability;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and straightway took his journey.</p>

<p>40:025:016 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the same, and made them other five talents.</p>

<p>40:025:017 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two.</p>

<p>40:025:018 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hid his lord's money.</p>

<p>40:025:019 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reckoneth with them.</p>

<p>40:025:020 And so he that had received five talents came and brought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more.</p>

<p>40:025:021 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy lord.</p>

<p>40:025:022 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two other talents beside them.</p>

<p>40:025:023 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>

<p>40:025:024 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</p>

<p>40:025:025 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lo, there thou hast that is thine.</p>

<p>40:025:026 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gather where I have not strawed:</p>

<p>40:025:027 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own with usury.</p>

<p>40:025:028 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath ten talents.</p>

<p>40:025:029 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that which he hath.</p>

<p>40:025:030 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>40:025:031 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glory:</p>

<p>40:025:032 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheep from the goats:</p>

<p>40:025:033 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the left.</p>

<p>40:025:034 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the foundation of the world:</p>

<p>40:025:035 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</p>

<p>40:025:036 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in prison, and ye came unto me.</p>

<p>40:025:037 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drink?</p>

<p>40:025:038 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clothed thee?</p>

<p>40:025:039 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</p>

<p>40:025:040 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</p>

<p>40:025:041 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his angels:</p>

<p>40:025:042 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ye gave me no drink:</p>

<p>40:025:043 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</p>

<p>40:025:044 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</p>

<p>40:025:045 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it not to me.</p>

<p>40:025:046 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteous into life eternal.</p>

<p>40:026:001 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sayings, he said unto his disciples,</p>

<p>40:026:002 Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</p>

<p>40:026:003 Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priest, who was called Caiaphas,</p>

<p>40:026:004 And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>40:026:005 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among the people.</p>

<p>40:026:006 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leper,</p>

<p>40:026:007 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meat.</p>

<p>40:026:008 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what purpose is this waste?</p>

<p>40:026:009 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the poor.</p>

<p>40:026:010 When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</p>

<p>40:026:011 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always.</p>

<p>40:026:012 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it for my burial.</p>

<p>40:026:013 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</p>

<p>40:026:014 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chief priests,</p>

<p>40:026:015 And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of silver.</p>

<p>40:026:016 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</p>

<p>40:026:017 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</p>

<p>40:026:018 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at thy house with my disciples.</p>

<p>40:026:019 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made ready the passover.</p>

<p>40:026:020 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</p>

<p>40:026:021 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of you shall betray me.</p>

<p>40:026:022 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</p>

<p>40:026:023 And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dish, the same shall betray me.</p>

<p>40:026:024 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for that man if he had not been born.</p>

<p>40:026:025 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</p>

<p>40:026:026 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is my body.</p>

<p>40:026:027 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Drink ye all of it;</p>

<p>40:026:028 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many for the remission of sins.</p>

<p>40:026:029 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father's kingdom.</p>

<p>40:026:030 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Olives.</p>

<p>40:026:031 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abroad.</p>

<p>40:026:032 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>

<p>40:026:033 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</p>

<p>40:026:034 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>

<p>40:026:035 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</p>

<p>40:026:036 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yonder.</p>

<p>40:026:037 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</p>

<p>40:026:038 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</p>

<p>40:026:039 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</p>

<p>40:026:040 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</p>

<p>40:026:041 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</p>

<p>40:026:042 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it, thy will be done.</p>

<p>40:026:043 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heavy.</p>

<p>40:026:044 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time, saying the same words.</p>

<p>40:026:045 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>

<p>40:026:046 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>40:026:047 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the chief priests and elders of the people.</p>

<p>40:026:048 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</p>

<p>40:026:049 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kissed him.</p>

<p>40:026:050 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.</p>

<p>40:026:051 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priest's, and smote off his ear.</p>

<p>40:026:052 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sword.</p>

<p>40:026:053 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</p>

<p>40:026:054 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must be?</p>

<p>40:026:055 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hold on me.</p>

<p>40:026:056 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fled.</p>

<p>40:026:057 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assembled.</p>

<p>40:026:058 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</p>

<p>40:026:059 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</p>

<p>40:026:060 But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</p>

<p>40:026:061 And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, and to build it in three days.</p>

<p>40:026:062 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</p>

<p>40:026:063 But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</p>

<p>40:026:064 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>

<p>40:026:065 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye have heard his blasphemy.</p>

<p>40:026:066 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</p>

<p>40:026:067 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smote him with the palms of their hands,</p>

<p>40:026:068 Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee?</p>

<p>40:026:069 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</p>

<p>40:026:070 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sayest.</p>

<p>40:026:071 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<p>40:026:072 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</p>

<p>40:026:073 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bewrayeth thee.</p>

<p>40:026:074 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man. And immediately the cock crew.</p>

<p>40:026:075 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out, and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>40:027:001 When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death:</p>

<p>40:027:002 And when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</p>

<p>40:027:003 Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,</p>

<p>40:027:004 Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blood. And they said, What is that to us? see thou to that.</p>

<p>40:027:005 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;departed, and went and hanged himself.</p>

<p>40:027:006 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the price of blood.</p>

<p>40:027:007 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;field, to bury strangers in.</p>

<p>40:027:008 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day.</p>

<p>40:027:009 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel did value;</p>

<p>40:027:010 And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord appointed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>40:027:011 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, Thou sayest.</p>

<p>40:027:012 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered nothing.</p>

<p>40:027:013 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they witness against thee?</p>

<p>40:027:014 And he answered him to never a word; insomuch that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;governor marvelled greatly.</p>

<p>40:027:015 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people a prisoner, whom they would.</p>

<p>40:027:016 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</p>

<p>40:027:017 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is called Christ?</p>

<p>40:027:018 For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</p>

<p>40:027:019 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</p>

<p>40:027:020 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</p>

<p>40:027:021 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</p>

<p>40:027:022 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</p>

<p>40:027:023 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</p>

<p>40:027:024 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;person: see ye to it.</p>

<p>40:027:025 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on our children.</p>

<p>40:027:026 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</p>

<p>40:027:027 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.</p>

<p>40:027:028 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</p>

<p>40:027:029 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jews!</p>

<p>40:027:030 And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the head.</p>

<p>40:027:031 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crucify him.</p>

<p>40:027:032 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name: him they compelled to bear his cross.</p>

<p>40:027:033 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to say, a place of a skull,</p>

<p>40:027:034 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had tasted thereof, he would not drink.</p>

<p>40:027:035 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they cast lots.</p>

<p>40:027:036 And sitting down they watched him there;</p>

<p>40:027:037 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>

<p>40:027:038 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right hand, and another on the left.</p>

<p>40:027:039 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads,</p>

<p>40:027:040 And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in three days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down from the cross.</p>

<p>40:027:041 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and elders, said,</p>

<p>40:027:042 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe him.</p>

<p>40:027:043 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him: for he said, I am the Son of God.</p>

<p>40:027:044 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his teeth.</p>

<p>40:027:045 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the ninth hour.</p>

<p>40:027:046 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>

<p>40:027:047 Some of them that stood there, when they heard that, said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man calleth for Elias.</p>

<p>40:027:048 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</p>

<p>40:027:049 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save him.</p>

<p>40:027:050 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ghost.</p>

<p>40:027:051 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rent;</p>

<p>40:027:052 And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which slept arose,</p>

<p>40:027:053 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</p>

<p>40:027:054 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</p>

<p>40:027:055 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</p>

<p>40:027:056 Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.</p>

<p>40:027:057 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus' disciple:</p>

<p>40:027:058 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commanded the body to be delivered.</p>

<p>40:027:059 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;linen cloth,</p>

<p>40:027:060 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sepulchre, and departed.</p>

<p>40:027:061 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the sepulchre.</p>

<p>40:027:062 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate,</p>

<p>40:027:063 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet alive, After three days I will rise again.</p>

<p>40:027:064 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the last error shall be worse than the first.</p>

<p>40:027:065 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as sure as ye can.</p>

<p>40:027:066 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and setting a watch.</p>

<p>40:028:001 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to see the sepulchre.</p>

<p>40:028:002 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stone from the door, and sat upon it.</p>

<p>40:028:003 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;snow:</p>

<p>40:028:004 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men.</p>

<p>40:028:005 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</p>

<p>40:028:006 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place where the Lord lay.</p>

<p>40:028:007 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</p>

<p>40:028:008 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</p>

<p>40:028:009 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feet, and worshipped him.</p>

<p>40:028:010 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</p>

<p>40:028:011 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that were done.</p>

<p>40:028:012 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers,</p>

<p>40:028:013 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away while we slept.</p>

<p>40:028:014 And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and secure you.</p>

<p>40:028:015 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</p>

<p>40:028:016 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</p>

<p>40:028:017 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</p>

<p>40:028:018 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto me in heaven and in earth.</p>

<p>40:028:019 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</p>

<p>40:028:020 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the world. Amen.</p>
