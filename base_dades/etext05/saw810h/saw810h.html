<p>TUESDAY afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village
of St. Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been
found. Public prayers had been offered up for them, and many and
many a private prayer that had the petitioner's whole heart in
it; but still no good news came from the cave. The majority of
the searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily
avocations, saying that it was plain the children could never be
found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great part of the time
delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her call her
child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time,
then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had
drooped into a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown
almost white. The village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad
and forlorn.</p>

<p>Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the
village bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with
frantic half-clad people, who shouted, "Turn out! turn out!
they're found! they're found!" Tin pans and horns were added to
the din, the population massed itself and moved toward the
river, met the children coming in an open carriage drawn by
shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward
march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah
after huzzah!</p>

<br><br>
<a name="32-248"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="32-248.jpg (95K)" src="32-248.jpg" height="534" width="683">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was
the greatest night the little town had ever seen. During the
first half-hour a procession of villagers filed through Judge
Thatcher's house, seized the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed
Mrs. Thatcher's hand, tried to speak but couldn't&mdash;and
drifted out raining tears all over the place.</p>

<p>Aunt Polly's happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's
nearly so. It would be complete, however, as soon as the
messenger dispatched with the great news to the cave should get
the word to her husband. Tom lay upon a sofa with an eager
auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful
adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it withal;
and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went on an
exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his
kite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest
stretch of the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he
glimpsed a far-off speck that looked like daylight; dropped the
line and groped toward it, pushed his head and shoulders through
a small hole, and saw the broad Mississippi rolling by!

</p>

<br><br>
<a name="32-249"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="32-249.jpg (97K)" src="32-249.jpg" height="520" width="705">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>

And if it
had only happened to be night he would not have seen that speck
of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He
told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she
told him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and
knew she was going to die, and wanted to. He described how he
labored with her and convinced her; and how she almost died for
joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck
of daylight; how he pushed his way out at the hole and then
helped her out; how they sat there and cried for gladness; how
some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them and told them
their situation and their famished condition; how the men didn't
believe the wild tale at first, "because," said they, "you are
five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in"&mdash;
then took them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made
them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought
them home.</p>

<p>Before day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers
with him were tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they
had strung behind them, and informed of the great news.</p>

<p>Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not
to be shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They
were bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow
more and more tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a
little, on Thursday, was downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as
ever Saturday; but Becky did not leave her room until Sunday, and
then she looked as if she had passed through a wasting
illness.</p>

<p>Tom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday,
but could not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on
Saturday or Sunday. He was admitted daily after that, but was
warned to keep still about his adventure and introduce no
exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by to see that he
obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event; also that
the "ragged man's" body had eventually been found in the river
near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to
escape, perhaps.</p>

<p>About a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave, he started
off to visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to
hear exciting talk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he
thought. Judge Thatcher's house was on Tom's way, and he stopped
to see Becky. The Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, and
some one asked him ironically if he wouldn't like to go to the
cave again. Tom said he thought he wouldn't mind it. The Judge
said:</p>

<p>"Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I've not the least
doubt. But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in
that cave any more."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two
weeks ago, and triple-locked&mdash;and I've got the keys."</p>

<p>Tom turned as white as a sheet.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of
water!"</p>

<p>The water was brought and thrown into Tom's face.</p>

<p>"Ah, now you're all right. What was the matter with you,
Tom?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Judge, Injun Joe's in the cave!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
</center>

<br><br>
<a name="33-252"></a>
<br><br>

<p>WITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen
skiff-loads of men were on their way to McDougal's cave, and the
ferryboat, well filled with passengers, soon followed. Tom
Sawyer was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher.</p>

<p>When the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented
itself in the dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched
upon the ground, dead, with his face close to the crack of the
door, as if his longing eyes had been fixed, to the latest
moment, upon the light and the cheer of the free world outside.
Tom was touched, for he knew by his own experience how this
wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but nevertheless he felt
an abounding sense of relief and security, now, which revealed to
him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated before how
vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day he
lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="33-253"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="33-253.jpg (90K)" src="33-253.jpg" height="511" width="671">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>Injun Joe's bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two.
The great foundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked
through, with tedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the
native rock formed a sill outside it, and upon that stubborn
material the knife had wrought no effect; the only damage done
was to the knife itself. But if there had been no stony
obstruction there the labor would have been useless still, for if
the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have
squeezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only
hacked that place in order to be doing something&mdash;in order
to pass the weary time&mdash;in order to employ his tortured
faculties. Ordinarily one could find half a dozen bits of candle
stuck around in the crevices of this vestibule, left there by
tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner had searched them
out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a few bats,
and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The poor
unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a
stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages,
builded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive
had broken off the stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a
stone, wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the
precious drop that fell once in every three minutes with the
dreary regularity of a clock-tick&mdash;a dessertspoonful once in
four and twenty hours. That drop was falling when the Pyramids
were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome were laid
when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the British
empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was
"news."

<p>

It is falling now; it will still be falling when all
these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history, and
the twilight of tradition, and been swallowed up in the thick
night of oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a mission? Did
this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready
for this flitting human insect's need? and has it another
important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No
matter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed
scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this
day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that
slow-dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of
McDougal's cave. Injun Joe's cup stands first in the list of the
cavern's marvels; even "Aladdin's Palace" cannot rival it.</p>

<p>Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people
flocked there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the
farms and hamlets for seven miles around; they brought their
children, and all sorts of provisions, and confessed that they
had had almost as satisfactory a time at the funeral as they
could have had at the hanging.</p>


<br><br>
<a name="33-255"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="33-255.jpg (70K)" src="33-255.jpg" height="321" width="675">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing&mdash;the
petition to the governor for Injun Joe's pardon. The petition had
been largely signed; many tearful and eloquent meetings had been
held, and a committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep
mourning and wail around the governor, and implore him to be a
merciful ass and trample his duty under foot. Injun Joe was
believed to have killed five citizens of the village, but what of
that? If he had been Satan himself there would have been plenty
of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon-petition,
and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky
water-works.</p>

<p>The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place
to have an important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom's
adventure from the Welshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time,
but Tom said he reckoned there was one thing they had not told
him; that thing was what he wanted to talk about now. Huck's face
saddened. He said:</p>

<p>"I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found
anything but whiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just
knowed it must 'a' ben you, soon as I heard 'bout that whiskey
business; and I knowed you hadn't got the money becuz you'd 'a'
got at me some way or other and told me even if you was mum to
everybody else. Tom, something's always told me we'd never get
holt of that swag."</p>

<p>"Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. YOU know his
tavern was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don't you
remember you was to watch there that night?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes! Why, it seems 'bout a year ago. It was that very
night that I follered Injun Joe to the widder's."</p>

<p>"YOU followed him?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe's left friends
behind him, and I don't want 'em souring on me and doing me mean
tricks. If it hadn't ben for me he'd be down in Texas now, all
right."</p>

<p>Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who
had only heard of the Welshman's part of it before.</p>

<p>"Well," said Huck, presently, coming back to the main
question, "whoever nipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money,
too, I reckon&mdash;anyways it's a goner for us, Tom."</p>

<p>"Huck, that money wasn't ever in No. 2!"</p>

<p>"What!" Huck searched his comrade's face keenly. "Tom, have
you got on the track of that money again?"</p>

<p>"Huck, it's in the cave!"</p>

<p>Huck's eyes blazed.</p>

<p>"Say it again, Tom."</p>

<p>"The money's in the cave!"</p>

<p>"Tom&mdash;honest injun, now&mdash;is it fun, or earnest?"</p>

<p>"Earnest, Huck&mdash;just as earnest as ever I was in my life.
Will you go in there with me and help get it out?"</p>

<p>"I bet I will! I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it
and not get lost."</p>

<p>"Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble
in the world."</p>

<p>"Good as wheat! What makes you think the money's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don't find it
I'll agree to give you my drum and every thing I've got in the
world. I will, by jings."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;it's a whiz. When do you say?"</p>

<p>"Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?"</p>

<p>"Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or
four days, now, but I can't walk more'n a mile, Tom&mdash;least I
don't think I could."</p>

<p>"It's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would
go, Huck, but there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody
but me know about. Huck, I'll take you right to it in a skiff.
I'll float the skiff down there, and I'll pull it back again all
by myself. You needn't ever turn your hand over."</p>

<p>"Less start right off, Tom."</p>

<p>"All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a
little bag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of
these new-fangled things they call lucifer matches. I tell you,
many's the time I wished I had some when I was in there
before."</p>

<p>A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a
citizen who was absent, and got under way at once. When they were
several miles below "Cave Hollow," Tom said:</p>

<p>"Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down
from the cave hollow&mdash;no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all
alike. But do you see that white place up yonder where there's
been a landslide? Well, that's one of my marks. We'll get ashore,
now."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="33-257"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="33-257.jpg (95K)" src="33-257.jpg" height="926" width="338">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 


<p>They landed.</p>

<p>"Now, Huck, where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I
got out of with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it."</p>

<p>Huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom
proudly marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:</p>

<p>"Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it's the snuggest hole in
this country. You just keep mum about it. All along I've been
wanting to be a robber, but I knew I'd got to have a thing like
this, and where to run across it was the bother. We've got it
now, and we'll keep it quiet, only we'll let Joe Harper and Ben
Rogers in&mdash;because of course there's got to be a Gang, or
else there wouldn't be any style about it. Tom Sawyer's
Gang&mdash; it sounds splendid, don't it, Huck?"</p>

<p>"Well, it just does, Tom. And who'll we rob?"</p>

<p>"Oh, most anybody. Waylay people&mdash;that's mostly the
way."</p>

<p>"And kill them?"</p>

<p>"No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a
ransom."</p>

<p>"What's a ransom?"</p>

<p>"Money. You make them raise all they can, off'n their friends;
and after you've kept them a year, if it ain't raised then you
kill them. That's the general way. Only you don't kill the women.
You shut up the women, but you don't kill them. They're always
beautiful and rich, and awfully scared. You take their watches
and things, but you always take your hat off and talk polite.
They ain't anybody as polite as robbers&mdash;you'll see that in
any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they've
been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after
that you couldn't get them to leave. If you drove them out they'd
turn right around and come back. It's so in all the books."</p>

<p>"Why, it's real bully, Tom. I believe it's better'n to be a
pirate."</p>

<p>"Yes, it's better in some ways, because it's close to home and
circuses and all that."</p>

<p>By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the
hole, Tom in the lead. They toiled their way to the farther end
of the tunnel, then made their spliced kite-strings fast and
moved on. A few steps brought them to the spring, and Tom felt a
shudder quiver all through him. He showed Huck the fragment of
candle-wick perched on a lump of clay against the wall, and
described how he and Becky had watched the flame struggle and
expire.</p>

<p>The boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the
stillness and gloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They
went on, and presently entered and followed Tom's other corridor
until they reached the "jumping-off place." The candles revealed
the fact that it was not really a precipice, but only a steep
clay hill twenty or thirty feet high. Tom whispered:</p>

<p>"Now I'll show you something, Huck."</p>

<p>He held his candle aloft and said:</p>

<p>"Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that?
There&mdash;on the big rock over yonder&mdash;done with
candle-smoke."</p>

<p>"Tom, it's a CROSS!"</p>

<p>"NOW where's your Number Two? 'UNDER THE CROSS,' hey? Right
yonder's where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!"</p>

<p>Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a
shaky voice:</p>

<p>"Tom, less git out of here!"</p>

<p>"What! and leave the treasure?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;leave it. Injun Joe's ghost is round about there,
certain."</p>

<p>"No it ain't, Huck, no it ain't. It would ha'nt the place
where he died &mdash;away out at the mouth of the cave&mdash;five
mile from here."</p>

<p>"No, Tom, it wouldn't. It would hang round the money. I know
the ways of ghosts, and so do you."</p>

<p>Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Mis-givings gathered in
his mind. But presently an idea occurred to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we're making of ourselves! Injun
Joe's ghost ain't a going to come around where there's a
cross!"</p>

<p>The point was well taken. It had its effect.</p>

<p>"Tom, I didn't think of that. But that's so. It's luck for us,
that cross is. I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt
for that box."</p>

<p>Tom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he
descended. Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small
cavern which the great rock stood in. The boys examined three of
them with no result. They found a small recess in the one nearest
the base of the rock, with a pallet of blankets spread down in
it; also an old suspender, some bacon rind, and the well-gnawed
bones of two or three fowls. But there was no moneybox. The lads
searched and researched this place, but in vain. Tom said:</p>

<p>"He said UNDER the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being
under the cross. It can't be under the rock itself, because that
sets solid on the ground."</p>

<p>They searched everywhere once more, and then sat down
discouraged. Huck could suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:</p>

<p>"Lookyhere, Huck, there's footprints and some candle-grease
on the clay about one side of this rock, but not on the other
sides. Now, what's that for? I bet you the money IS under the
rock. I'm going to dig in the clay."</p>

<p>"That ain't no bad notion, Tom!" said Huck with animation.</p>

<p>Tom's "real Barlow" was out at once, and he had not dug four
inches before he struck wood.</p>

<p>"Hey, Huck!&mdash;you hear that?"</p>

<p>Huck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon
uncovered and removed. They had concealed a natural chasm which
led under the rock. Tom got into this and held his candle as far
under the rock as he could, but said he could not see to the end
of the rift. He proposed to explore. He stooped and passed under;
the narrow way descended gradually. He followed its winding
course, first to the right, then to the left, Huck at his heels.
Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!"</p>

<p>It was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little
cavern, along with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in
leather cases, two or three pairs of old moccasins, a leather
belt, and some other rubbish well soaked with the water-drip.</p>

<p>"Got it at last!" said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished
coins with his hand. "My, but we're rich, Tom!"</p>

<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br> 


<p>"Huck, I always reckoned we'd get it. It's just too good to
believe, but we HAVE got it, sure! Say&mdash;let's not fool
around here. Let's snake it out. Lemme see if I can lift the
box."</p>

<p>It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an
awkward fashion, but could not carry it conveniently.</p>

<p>"I thought so," he said; "THEY carried it like it was heavy,
that day at the ha'nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was
right to think of fetching the little bags along."</p>

<p>The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the
cross rock.</p>

<p>"Now less fetch the guns and things," said Huck.</p>

<p>"No, Huck&mdash;leave them there. They're just the tricks to
have when we go to robbing. We'll keep them there all the time,
and we'll hold our orgies there, too. It's an awful snug place
for orgies."</p>

<p>"What orgies?"</p>

<p>"I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we've
got to have them, too. Come along, Huck, we've been in here a
long time. It's getting late, I reckon. I'm hungry, too. We'll
eat and smoke when we get to the skiff."</p>

<p>They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked
warily out, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and
smoking in the skiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they
pushed out and got under way. Tom skimmed up the shore through
the long twilight, chatting cheerily with Huck, and landed
shortly after dark.</p>

<p>"Now, Huck," said Tom, "we'll hide the money in the loft of
the widow's woodshed, and I'll come up in the morning and we'll
count it and divide, and then we'll hunt up a place out in the
woods for it where it will be safe. Just you lay quiet here and
watch the stuff till I run and hook Benny Taylor's little wagon;
I won't be gone a minute."</p>

<p>He disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the
two small sacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and
started off, dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached
the Welshman's house, they stopped to rest. Just as they were
about to move on, the Welshman stepped out and said:</p>

<p>"Hallo, who's that?"</p>

<p>"Huck and Tom Sawyer."</p>

<p>"Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody
waiting. Here&mdash;hurry up, trot ahead&mdash;I'll haul the
wagon for you. Why, it's not as light as it might be. Got bricks
in it?&mdash;or old metal?"</p>

<p>"Old metal," said Tom.</p>

<p>"I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and
fool away more time hunting up six bits' worth of old iron to
sell to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at
regular work. But that's human nature&mdash;hurry along, hurry
along!"</p>

<p>The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.</p>

<p>"Never mind; you'll see, when we get to the Widow
Douglas'."</p>

<p>Huck said with some apprehension&mdash;for he was long used to
being falsely accused:</p>

<p>"Mr. Jones, we haven't been doing nothing."</p>

<p>The Welshman laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know, Huck, my boy. I don't know about that.
Ain't you and the widow good friends?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, she's ben good friends to me, anyway."</p>

<p>"All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?"</p>

<p>This question was not entirely answered in Huck's slow mind
before he found himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs.
Douglas' drawing-room. Mr. Jones left the wagon near the door and
followed.</p>

<p>The place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any
consequence in the village was there. The Thatchers were there,
the Harpers, the Rogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister,
the editor, and a great many more, and all dressed in their best.
The widow received the boys as heartily as any one could well
receive two such looking beings. They were covered with clay and
candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson with humiliation, and
frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered half as much
as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:</p>

<p>"Tom wasn't at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on
him and Huck right at my door, and so I just brought them along
in a hurry."</p>

<p>"And you did just right," said the widow. "Come with me,
boys."</p>

<p>She took them to a bedchamber and said:</p>

<p>"Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of
clothes&mdash; shirts, socks, everything complete. They're
Huck's&mdash;no, no thanks, Huck&mdash;Mr. Jones bought one and I
the other. But they'll fit both of you. Get into them. We'll
wait&mdash;come down when you are slicked up enough."</p>

<p>Then she left.</p>

<p>HUCK said: "Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The
window ain't high from the ground."</p>

<p>"Shucks! what do you want to slope for?"</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't used to that kind of a crowd. I can't stand it.
I ain't going down there, Tom."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother! It ain't anything. I don't mind it a bit. I'll
take care of you."</p>

<p>Sid appeared.</p>

<p>"Tom," said he, "auntie has been waiting for you all the
afternoon. Mary got your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody's
been fretting about you. Say&mdash;ain't this grease and clay, on
your clothes?"</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist 'tend to your own business. What's
all this blowout about, anyway?"</p>

<p>"It's one of the widow's parties that she's always having.
This time it's for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that
scrape they helped her out of the other night. And say&mdash;I
can tell you something, if you want to know."</p>

<p>"Well, what?"</p>

<p>"Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on
the people here tonight, but I overheard him tell auntie today
about it, as a secret, but I reckon it's not much of a secret
now. Everybody knows&mdash; the widow, too, for all she tries to
let on she don't. Mr. Jones was bound Huck should be
here&mdash;couldn't get along with his grand secret without Huck,
you know!"</p>

<p>"Secret about what, Sid?"</p>

<p>"About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow's. I reckon Mr.
Jones was going to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet
you it will drop pretty flat."</p>

<p>Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.</p>

<p>"Sid, was it you that told?"</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind who it was. SOMEBODY told&mdash;that's
enough."</p>

<p>"Sid, there's only one person in this town mean enough to do
that, and that's you. If you had been in Huck's place you'd 'a'
sneaked down the hill and never told anybody on the robbers. You
can't do any but mean things, and you can't bear to see anybody
praised for doing good ones. There&mdash;no thanks, as the widow
says"&mdash;and Tom cuffed Sid's ears and helped him to the door
with several kicks. "Now go and tell auntie if you dare&mdash;and
tomorrow you'll catch it!"</p>

<p>Some minutes later the widow's guests were at the
supper-table, and a dozen children were propped up at little
side-tables in the same room, after the fashion of that country
and that day. At the proper time Mr. Jones made his little
speech, in which he thanked the widow for the honor she was doing
himself and his sons, but said that there was another person
whose modesty&mdash;</p>

<p>And so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck's
share in the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was
master of, but the surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit
and not as clamorous and effusive as it might have been under
happier circumstances. However, the widow made a pretty fair show
of astonishment, and heaped so many compliments and so much
gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot the nearly intolerable
discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely intolerable
discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody's gaze and
everybody's laudations.</p>

<p>The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof
and have him educated; and that when she could spare the money
she would start him in business in a modest way. Tom's chance was
come. He said:</p>

<p>"Huck don't need it. Huck's rich."</p>

<p>Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the
company kept back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this
pleasant joke. But the silence was a little awkward. Tom broke
it:</p>

<p>"Huck's got money. Maybe you don't believe it, but he's got
lots of it. Oh, you needn't smile&mdash;I reckon I can show you.
You just wait a minute."</p>

<p>Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a
perplexed interest&mdash;and inquiringly at Huck, who was
tongue-tied.</p>

<p>"Sid, what ails Tom?" said Aunt Polly. "He&mdash;well, there
ain't ever any making of that boy out. I never&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt
Polly did not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow
coin upon the table and said:</p>

<p>"There&mdash;what did I tell you? Half of it's Huck's and half
of it's mine!"</p>

<br><br>
<a name="34-266"></a>

</center>
<br><br><br><br> 


<p>The spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody
spoke for a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an
explanation. Tom said he could furnish it, and he did. The tale
was long, but brimful of interest. There was scarcely an
interruption from any one to break the charm of its flow. When he
had finished, Mr. Jones said:</p>

<p>"I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion,
but it don't amount to anything now. This one makes it sing
mighty small, I'm willing to allow."</p>

<p>The money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over
twelve thousand dollars. It was more than any one present had
ever seen at one time before, though several persons were there
who were worth considerably more than that in property.</p>

<br><br><br><br>  

<p>THE reader may rest satisfied that Tom's and Huck's windfall
made a mighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg.
So vast a sum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It
was talked about, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of
many of the citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy
excitement. Every "haunted" house in St. Petersburg and the
neighboring villages was dissected, plank by plank, and its
foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden treasure&mdash;and
not by boys, but men&mdash;pretty grave, unromantic men, too,
some of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted,
admired, stared at. The boys were not able to remember that
their remarks had possessed weight before; but now their sayings
were treasured and repeated; everything they did seemed somehow
to be regarded as remarkable; they had evidently lost the power
of doing and saying commonplace things; moreover, their past
history was raked up and discovered to bear marks of conspicuous
originality. The village paper published biographical sketches of
the boys.</p>

<p>The Widow Douglas put Huck's money out at six per cent., and
Judge Thatcher did the same with Tom's at Aunt Polly's request.
Each lad had an income, now, that was simply prodigious&mdash;a
dollar for every weekday in the year and half of the Sundays.
It was just what the minister got&mdash;no, it was what he was
promised&mdash;he generally couldn't collect it. A dollar and a
quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old
simple days&mdash;and clothe him and wash him, too, for that
matter.</p>

<p>Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said
that no commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of
the cave. When Becky told her father, in strict confidence, how
Tom had taken her whipping at school, the Judge was visibly
moved; and when she pleaded grace for the mighty lie which Tom
had told in order to shift that whipping from her shoulders to
his own, the Judge said with a fine outburst that it was a noble,
a generous, a magnanimous lie&mdash;a lie that was worthy to
hold up its head and march down through history breast to breast
with George Washington's lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky
thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when
he walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went
straight off and told Tom about it.</p>

<p>Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great
soldier some day. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should
be admitted to the National Military Academy and afterward
trained in the best law school in the country, in order that he
might be ready for either career or both.</p>

<p>Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was now under the
Widow Douglas' protection introduced him into society&mdash;no,
dragged him into it, hurled him into it&mdash;and his sufferings
were almost more than he could bear. The widow's servants kept
him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they bedded him
nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot or
stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. He
had to eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and
plate; he had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had
to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth;
whithersoever he turned, the bars and shackles of civilization
shut him in and bound him hand and foot.</p>

<p>He bravely bore his miseries three weeks, and then one day
turned up missing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him
everywhere in great distress. The public were profoundly
concerned; they searched high and low, they dragged the river for
his body. Early the third morning Tom Sawyer wisely went poking
among some old empty hogsheads down behind the abandoned
slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee. Huck
had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds
and ends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his
pipe. He was unkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of
rags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free
and happy. Tom routed him out, told him the trouble he had been
causing, and urged him to go home. Huck's face lost its tranquil
content, and took a melancholy cast. He said:</p>

<p>"Don't talk about it, Tom. I've tried it, and it don't work;
it don't work, Tom. It ain't for me; I ain't used to it. The
widder's good to me, and friendly; but I can't stand them ways.
She makes me get up just at the same time every morning; she
makes me wash, they comb me all to thunder; she won't let me
sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them blamed clothes that
just smothers me, Tom; they don't seem to any air git through
'em, somehow; and they're so rotten nice that I can't set down,
nor lay down, nor roll around anywher's; I hain't slid on a
cellar-door for&mdash;well, it 'pears to be years; I got to go to
church and sweat and sweat&mdash;I hate them ornery sermons! I
can't ketch a fly in there, I can't chaw. I got to wear shoes all
Sunday. The widder eats by a bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she
gits up by a bell&mdash; everything's so awful reg'lar a body
can't stand it."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="35-271"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="35-271.jpg (112K)" src="35-271.jpg" height="562" width="601">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>  

<p>"Well, everybody does that way, Huck."</p>

<p>"Tom, it don't make no difference. I ain't everybody, and I
can't STAND it. It's awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too
easy&mdash;I don't take no interest in vittles, that way. I got
to ask to go a-fishing; I got to ask to go in
a-swimming&mdash;dern'd if I hain't got to ask to do everything.
Well, I'd got to talk so nice it wasn't no comfort&mdash;I'd got
to go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a
taste in my mouth, or I'd a died, Tom. The widder wouldn't let me
smoke; she wouldn't let me yell, she wouldn't let me gape, nor
stretch, nor scratch, before folks&mdash;" [Then with a spasm of
special irritation and injury]&mdash;"And dad fetch it, she
prayed all the time! I never see such a woman! I HAD to shove,
Tom&mdash;I just had to. And besides, that school's going to
open, and I'd a had to go to it&mdash;well, I wouldn't stand
THAT, Tom. Looky-here, Tom, being rich ain't what it's cracked up
to be. It's just worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and
a-wishing you was dead all the time. Now these clothes suits me,
and this bar'l suits me, and I ain't ever going to shake 'em any
more. Tom, I wouldn't ever got into all this trouble if it hadn't
'a' ben for that money; now you just take my sheer of it along
with your'n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes&mdash;not many
times, becuz I don't give a dern for a thing 'thout it's tollable
hard to git&mdash;and you go and beg off for me with the
widder."</p>

<p>"Oh, Huck, you know I can't do that. 'Tain't fair; and besides
if you'll try this thing just a while longer you'll come to like
it."</p>

<p>"Like it! Yes&mdash;the way I'd like a hot stove if I was to
set on it long enough. No, Tom, I won't be rich, and I won't live
in them cussed smothery houses. I like the woods, and the river,
and hogsheads, and I'll stick to 'em, too. Blame it all! just as
we'd got guns, and a cave, and all just fixed to rob, here this
dern foolishness has got to come up and spile it all!"</p>

<p>Tom saw his opportunity&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain't going to keep me back from
turning robber."</p>

<p>"No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest,
Tom?"</p>

<p>"Just as dead earnest as I'm sitting here. But Huck, we can't
let you into the gang if you ain't respectable, you know."</p>

<p>Huck's joy was quenched.</p>

<p>"Can't let me in, Tom? Didn't you let me go for a pirate?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but that's different. A robber is more high-toned than
what a pirate is&mdash;as a general thing. In most countries
they're awful high up in the nobility&mdash;dukes and such."</p>

<br><br><br><br>  

<p>"Now, Tom, hain't you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn't
shet me out, would you, Tom? You wouldn't do that, now, WOULD
you, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Huck, I wouldn't want to, and I DON'T want to&mdash;but what
would people say? Why, they'd say, 'Mph! Tom Sawyer's Gang!
pretty low characters in it!' They'd mean you, Huck. You wouldn't
like that, and I wouldn't."</p>

<p>Huck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle.
Finally he said:</p>

<p>"Well, I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it
and see if I can come to stand it, if you'll let me b'long to the
gang, Tom."</p>

<p>"All right, Huck, it's a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I'll
ask the widow to let up on you a little, Huck."</p>

<p>"Will you, Tom&mdash;now will you? That's good. If she'll let
up on some of the roughest things, I'll smoke private and cuss
private, and crowd through or bust. When you going to start the
gang and turn robbers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, right off. We'll get the boys together and have the
initiation tonight, maybe."</p>

<p>"Have the which?"</p>

<p>"Have the initiation."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"It's to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the
gang's secrets, even if you're chopped all to flinders, and kill
anybody and all his family that hurts one of the gang."</p>

<p>"That's gay&mdash;that's mighty gay, Tom, I tell you."</p>

<p>"Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing's got to be done at
midnight, in the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find&mdash;a
ha'nted house is the best, but they're all ripped up now."</p>

<p>"Well, midnight's good, anyway, Tom."</p>

<p>"Yes, so it is. And you've got to swear on a coffin, and sign
it with blood."</p>

<p>"Now, that's something LIKE! Why, it's a million times bullier
than pirating. I'll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I
git to be a reg'lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking
'bout it, I reckon she'll be proud she snaked me in out of the
wet."</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>SO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a
BOY, it must stop here; the story could not go much further
without becoming the history of a MAN. When one writes a novel
about grown people, he knows exactly where to stop&mdash;that is,
with a marriage; but when he writes of juveniles, he must stop
where he best can.</p>

<p>Most of the characters that perform in this book still live,
and are prosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to
take up the story of the younger ones again and see what sort of
men and women they turned out to be; therefore it will be wisest
not to reveal any of that part of their lives at present.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by

you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
     let us know your plans and to work out the details.
