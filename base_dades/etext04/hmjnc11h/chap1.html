<br>
<p class="first">I left England on the 11th of November, 1847, and
performed the voyage to India under circumstances which have been
detailed in the Introduction. On the 12th of January, 1848, the
&ldquo;Moozuffer&rdquo; was steaming amongst the low swampy islands
of the Sunderbunds. These exhibit no tropical luxuriance, and are,
in this respect, exceedingly disappointing. A low vegetation covers
them, chiefly made up of a dwarf-palm (<i>Ph&oelig;nix
paludosa</i>) and small mangroves, with a few scattered trees on
the higher bank that runs along the water&rsquo;s edge, consisting
of fan-palm, toddy-palm, and <i>Terminalia.</i> Every now and then,
the paddles of the steamer tossed up the large fruits of <i>Nipa
fruticans,</i> a low stemless palm that grows in the tidal waters
of the Indian ocean, and bears a large head of nuts. It is a plant
of no interest to the common observer, but of much to the
geologist, from the nuts of a similar plant abounding in</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 2">[ 2 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the tertiary formations at the mouth of the
Thames, and having floated about there in as great profusion as
here, till buried deep in the silt and mud that now forms the
island of Sheppey.*</p>

<p>Higher up, the river Hoogly is entered, and large trees, with
villages and cultivation, replace the sandy spits and marshy
jungles of the great Gangetic delta. A few miles below Calcutta,
the scenery becomes beautiful, beginning with the Botanic Garden,
once the residence of Roxburgh and Wallich, and now of
Falconer,&mdash;classical ground to the naturalist. Opposite are
the gardens of Sir Lawrence Peel; unrivalled in India for their
beauty and cultivation, and fairly entitled to be called the
Chatsworth of Bengal. A little higher up, Calcutta opened out, with
the batteries of Fort William in the foreground, thundering forth a
salute, and in a few minutes more all other thoughts were absorbed
in watching the splendour of the arrangements made for the
reception of the Governor-General of India.</p>

<p>During my short stay in Calcutta, I was principally occupied in
preparing for an excursion with Mr. Williams of the Geological
Survey, who was about to move his camp from the Damooda valley
coal-fields, near Burdwan, to Beejaghur on the banks of the Soane,
where coal was reported to exist, in the immediate vicinity of
water-carriage, the great desideratum of the Burdwan fields.</p>

<p>My time was spent partly at Government-House, and partly at Sir
Lawrence Peel&rsquo;s residence. The former I was kindly invited to
consider as my Indian home, an honour which I appreciate the more
highly, as the invitation was accompanied with the assurance that I
should</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">have entire freedom to follow my own pursuits; and
the advantages which such a position afforded me, were, I need not
say, of no ordinary kind.</p>

<p>At the Botanic Gardens I received every assistance from Dr.
McLelland,* who was very busy, superintending the publication of
the botanical papers and drawings of his friend, the late Dr.
Griffith, for which native artists were preparing copies on
lithographic paper.</p>

<p>Of the Gardens themselves it is exceedingly difficult to speak;
the changes had been so very great, and from a state with which I
had no acquaintance. There had been a great want of judgment in the
alterations made since Dr. Wallich&rsquo;s time, when they were
celebrated as the most beautiful gardens in the east, and were the
great object of attraction to strangers and townspeople. I found
instead an unsightly wilderness, without shade (the first
requirement of every tropical garden) or other beauties than some
isolated grand trees, which had survived the indiscriminate
destruction of the useful and ornamental which had attended the
well-meant but ill-judged attempt to render a garden a botanical
class-book. It is impossible to praise too highly Dr.
Griffith&rsquo;s abilities and acquirements as a botanist, his
perseverance and success as a traveller, or his matchless industry
in the field and in the closet; and it is not wonderful, that, with
so many and varied talents, he should have wanted the eye of a
landscape-gardener, or the education of a horticulturist. I should,
however, be wanting in my duty to his predecessor, and to his no
less illustrious successor, were these remarks withheld,
proceeding, as they do, from an unbiassed observer, who had the
honour of standing in an equally friendly relation to all parties.
Before leaving India, I saw great improvements,</p>

<p class="fnote">* Dr. Falconer&rsquo;s <i>locum tenens,</i> then
in temporary charge of the establishment.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 4">[ 4 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">but many years must elapse before the gardens can
resume their once proud pre-eminence.</p>

<p>I was surprised to find the Botanical Gardens looked upon by
many of the Indian public, and even by some of the better informed
official men, as rather an extravagant establishment, more
ornamental than useful. These persons seemed astonished to learn
that its name was renowned throughout Europe, and that during the
first twenty years especially of Dr. Wallich&rsquo;s
superintendence, it had contributed more useful and ornamental
tropical plants to the public and private gardens of the world than
any other establishment before or since.* I speak from a personal
knowledge of the contents of our English gardens, and our colonial
ones at the Cape, and in Australia, and from an inspection of the
ponderous volumes of distribution lists, to which Dr. Falconer is
daily adding. The botanical public of Europe and India is no less
indebted than the horticultural to the liberality of the Hon. East
India Company, and to the energy of the several eminent men who
have carried their views into execution.&dagger;</p>

<p class="fnote">* As an illustration of this, I may refer to a
Report presented to the government of Bengal, from which it appears
that between January, 1836, and December, 1840, 189,932 plants were
distributed gratis to nearly 2000 different gardens.<br>
&dagger; I here allude to the great Indian herbarium, chiefly
formed by the staff of the Botanic Gardens under the direction of
Dr. Wallich, and distributed in 1829 to the principal museums of
Europe. This is the most valuable contribution of the kind ever
made to science, and it is a lasting memorial: of the princely
liberality of the enlightened men who ruled the counsels of India
in those days. No botanical work of importance has been published
since 1829, without recording its sense of the obligation, and I
was once commissioned by a foreign government, to purchase for its
national museum, at whatever cost, one set of these collections,
which was brought to the hammer on the death of its possessor. I
have heard it remarked that the expense attending the distribution
was enormous, and I have reason to know that this erroneous
impression has had an unfavourable influence upon the destination
of scarcely less valuable collections, which have for years been
lying untouched in the cellars of the India House. I may add that
officers who have exposed their lives and impaired their health in
forming similar ones at the orders and expense of the Indian
government, are at home, and thrown upon their own resources, or
the assistance of their scientific brethren, for the means of
publishing and distributing the fruits of their labours.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 5">[ 5 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">The Indian government, itself, has already
profited largely by these gardens, directly and indirectly, and
might have done so still more, had its efforts been better seconded
either by the European or native population of the country. Amongst
its greatest triumphs may be considered the introduction of the
tea-plant from China, a fact I allude to, as many of my English
readers may not be aware that the establishment of the tea-trade in
the Himalaya and Assam is almost entirely the work of the
superintendents of the gardens of Calcutta and Seharunpore.</p>

<p>From no one did I receive more kindness than from Sir James
Colvile, President of the Asiatic Society, who not only took care
that I should be provided with every comfort, but presented me with
a completely equipped palkee, which, for strength and excellence of
construction, was everything that a traveller could desire. Often
<i>en route</i> did I mentally thank him when I saw other palkees
breaking down, and travellers bewailing the loss of those forgotten
necessaries, with which his kind attention had furnished me.</p>

<p>I left Calcutta to join Mr. Williams&rsquo; camp on the 28th of
January, driving to Hoogly on the river of that name, and thence
following the grand trunk-road westward towards Burdwan. The
novelty of palkee-travelling at first renders it pleasant; the
neatness with which every thing is packed, the good-humour of the
bearers, their merry pace, and the many more comforts enjoyed than
could be expected in a conveyance <i>horsed by men</i>, the warmth
when the sliding doors are shut, and the breeze when they are open,
are all fully appreciated on first</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 6">[ 6 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">starting, but soon the novelty wears off, and the
discomforts are so numerous, that it is pronounced, at best, a
barbarous conveyance. The greedy cry and gestures of the bearers,
when, on changing, they break a fitful sleep by poking a torch in
your face, and vociferating &ldquo;Bucksheesh, Sahib;&rdquo; their
discontent at the most liberal largesse, and the sluggishness of
the next set who want bribes, put the traveller out of patience
with the natives. The dust when the slides are open, and the
stifling heat when shut during a shower, are conclusive against the
vehicle, and on getting out with aching bones and giddy head at the
journey&rsquo;s end, I shook the dust from my person, and wished
never to see a palkee again.</p>

<p>On the following morning I was passing through the straggling
villages close to Burdwan, consisting of native hovels by the road
side, with mangos and figs planted near them, and palms waving over
their roofs. Crossing the nearly dry bed of the Damooda, I was set
down at Mr. M&lsquo;Intosh&rsquo;s (the magistrate of the
district), and never more thoroughly enjoyed a hearty welcome and a
breakfast.</p>

<p>In the evening we visited the Rajah of Burdwan&rsquo;s palace
and pleasure-grounds, where I had the first glimpse of oriental
gardening: the roads were generally raised, running through rice
fields, now dry and hard, and bordered with trees of Jack, Bamboo,
<i>Melia, Casuarina,</i> etc. Tanks were the prominent features:
chains of them, full of Indian water-lilies, being fringed with
rows of the fan-palm, and occasionally the Indian date. Close to
the house was a rather good menagerie, where I saw, amongst other
animals, a pair of kangaroos in high health and condition, the
female with young in her pouch. Before dark I was again in my
palkee, and hurrying onwards. The night was cool and clear, very
different from the damp</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 7">[ 7 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and foggy atmosphere I had left at Calcutta. On
the following morning I was travelling over a flat and apparently
rising country, along an excellent road, with groves of bamboos and
stunted trees on either hand, few villages or palms, a sterile
soil, with stunted grass and but little cultivation; altogether a
country as unlike what I had expected to find in India as well
might be. All around was a dead flat or table-land, out of which a
few conical hills rose in the west, about 1000 feet high, covered
with a low forest of dusky green or yellow, from the prevalence of
bamboo. The lark was singing merrily at sunrise, and the
accessories of a fresh air and dewy grass more reminded me of some
moorland in the north of England than of the torrid regions of the
east.</p>

<p>At 10 p.m. I arrived at Mr. Williams&rsquo; camp, at Taldangah,
a dawk station near the western limit of the coal basin of the
Damooda valley. His operations being finished, be was prepared to
start, having kindly waited a couple of days for my arrival.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the last day of January, a motley group
of natives were busy striking the tents, and loading the bullocks,
bullock-carts and elephants: these proceeded on the march,
occupying in straggling groups nearly three miles of road, whilst
we remained to breakfast with Mr. F. Watkins, Superintendent of the
East India Coal and Coke Company, who were working the seams.</p>

<p>The coal crops out at the surface; but the shafts worked are
sunk through thick beds of alluvium. The age of these coal-fields
is quite unknown, and I regret to say that my examination of their
fossil plants throws no material light on the subject. Upwards of
thirty species of fossil plants have been procured from them, and
of these the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 8">[ 8 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">majority are referred by Dr. McLelland* to the
inferior oolite epoch of England, from the prevalence of species of
<i>Zamia, Glossopteris,</i> and <i>Taeniopteris.</i> Some of these
genera, together with <i>Vertebraria</i> (a very remarkable Indian
fossil), are also recognised in the coal-fields of Sind and of
Australia. I cannot, however, think that botanical evidence of such
a nature is sufficient to warrant a satisfactory reference of these
Indian coal-fields to the same epoch as those of England or of
Australia; in the first place the outlines of the fronds of ferns
and their nervation are frail characters if employed alone for the
determination of existing genera, and much more so of fossil
fragments: in the second place recent ferns are so widely
distributed, that an inspection of the majority affords little clue
to the region or locality they come from: and in the third place,
considering the wide difference in latitude and longitude of
Yorkshire, India, and Australia, the natural conclusion is that
they could not have supported a similar vegetation at the same
epoch. In fact, finding similar fossil plants at places widely
different in latitude, and hence in climate, is, in the present
state of our knowledge, rather an argument against than for their
having existed cotemporaneously. The <i>Cycade&aelig;,</i>
especially, whose fossil remains afford so much ground for
geological speculations, are far from yielding such precise data as
is supposed. Species of the order are found in Mexico, South
Africa, Australia, and India, some inhabiting the hottest and
dampest, and others the driest climates on the surface of the
globe; and it appears to me rash to argue much from the presence of
the order in the coal of Yorkshire and India, when we reflect that
the geologist of some future epoch may find as good reasons for
referring the present Cape, Australian, or Mexican</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Flora to the same period as that of the Lias and
Oolites, when the <i>Cycade&aelig;</i> now living in the former
countries shall be fossilised.</p>

<p>Specific identity of their contained fossils may be considered
as fair evidence of the cotemporaneous origin of beds, but amongst
the many collections of fossil plants that I have examined, there
is hardly a specimen, belonging to any epoch, sufficiently perfect
to warrant the assumption that the species to which it belonged can
be again recognised. The botanical evidences which geologists too
often accept as proofs of specific identity are such as no botanist
would attach any importance to in the investigation of existing
plants. The faintest traces assumed to be of vegetable origin are
habitually made into genera and species by naturalists ignorant of
the structure, affinities and distribution of living plants, and of
such materials the bulk of so-called systems of fossil plants is
composed.</p>

<p>A number of women were here employed in making gunpowder,
grinding the usual materials on a stone, with the addition of water
from the Hookah; a custom for which they have an obstinate
prejudice. The charcoal here used is made from an <i>Acacia</i>:
the Seiks, I believe, employ <i>Justicia Adhatoda,</i> which is
also in use all over India: at Aden the Arabs prefer the <i>
Calotropis</i>, probably because it is most easily procured. The
grain of all these plants is open, whereas in England,
closer-grained and more woody trees, especially willows, are
preferred.</p>

<p>The jungle I found to consist chiefly of thorny bushes, Jujube
of two species, an <i>Acacia</i> and <i>Butea frondosa,</i> the
twigs of the latter often covered with lurid red tears of Lac,
which is here collected in abundance. As it occurs on the plants
and is collected by the natives it is called Stick-lac, but after
preparation Shell-lac. In Mirzapore, a species of</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 10">[ 10 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first"><i>Celtis</i> yields it, and the Peepul very
commonly in various parts of India. The elaboration of this dye,
whether by the same species of insect, or by many from plants so
widely different in habit and eharacters, is a very curious fact;
since none have red juice, but some have milky and others
limpid.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Mr. Williams and I started on an elephant,
following the camp to Gyra, twelve miles distant. The docility of
these animals is an old story, but it loses so much in the telling,
that their gentleness, obedience, and sagacity seemed as strange to
me as if I had never heard or read of these attributes. The
swinging motion, under a hot sun, is very oppressive, but
compensated for by being so high above the dust. The Mahout, or
driver, guides by poking his great toes under either ear, enforcing
obedience with an iron goad, with which he hammers the
animal&rsquo;s head with quite as much force as would break a
cocoa-nut, or drives it through his thick skin down to the quick. A
most disagreeable sight it is, to see the blood and yellow fat
oozing out in the broiling sun from these great punctures! Our
elephant was an excellent one, when he did not take obstinate fits,
and so docile as to pick up pieces of stone when desired, and with
a jerk of the trunk throw them over his head for the rider to
catch, thus saving the trouble of dismounting to geologise!</p>

<p>Of sights on the road, unfrequented though this noble line is,
there were plenty for a stranger; chiefly pilgrims to Juggernath,
most on foot, and a few in carts or pony gigs of rude construction.
The vehicles from the upper country are distinguished by a far
superior build, their horses are caparisoned with jingling bells,
and the wheels and other parts are bound with brass. The kindness
of the people towards animals, and in some cases towards their
suffering</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 11">[ 11 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">relations, is very remarkable, and may in part
have given origin to the prevalent idea that they are less cruel
and stern than the majority of mankind; but that the
&ldquo;mild&rdquo; Hindoo, however gentle on occasion, is cruel and
vindictive to his brother man and to animals, when his indolent
temper is roused or his avarice stimulated, no one can doubt who
reads the accounts of Thuggee, Dacoitee, and poisoning, and
witnesses the cruelty with which beasts of burthen are treated. A
child carrying a bird, kid, or lamb, is not an uncommon sight, and
a woman with a dog in her arms is still more frequently seen.
Occasionally too, a group will bear an old man to see Juggernath
before he dies, or a poor creature with elephantiasis, who hopes to
be allowed to hurry himself to his paradise, in preference to
lingering in helpless inactivity, and at last crawling up to the
second heaven only. The costumes are as various as the religious
castes, and the many countries to which the travellers belong. Next
in wealth to the merchants, the most thriving-looking wanderer is
the bearer of Ganges&rsquo; holy water, who drives a profitable
trade, his gains increasing as his load lightens, for the further
he wanders from the sacred stream, the more he gets for the
contents of his jar.</p>

<p>Of merchandise we passed very little, the Ganges being still the
high road between north-west India and Bengal. Occasionally a
string of camels was seen, but, owing to the damp climate, these
are rare, and unknown east of the meridian of Calcutta. A little
cotton, clumsily packed in ragged bags, dirty, and deteriorating
every day, even at this dry season, proves in how bad a state it
must arrive at the market during the rains, when the low wagons are
dragged through the streams.</p>

<p>The roads here are all mended with a curious stone,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 12">[ 12 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">called Kunker, which is a nodular concretionary
deposit of limestone, abundantly imbedded in the alluvial soil of a
great part of India.* It resembles a coarse gravel, each pebble
being often as large as a walnut, and tuberculated on the surface:
it binds admirably, and forms excellent roads, but pulverises into
a most disagreeable impalpable dust.</p>

<p>A few miles beyond Taldangah we passed from the sandstone, in
which the coal lies, to a very barren country of gneiss and granite
rocks, upon which the former rests; the country still rising, more
hills appear, and towering far above all is Paras-nath, the
culminant point, and a mountain whose botany I was most anxious to
explore.</p>

<p>The vegetation of this part of the country is very poor, no
good-sized trees are to be seen, all is a low stunted jungle. The
grasses were few, and dried up, except in the beds of the rivulets.
On the low jungly hills the same plants appear, with a few figs,
bamboo in great abundance, several handsome <i>
Acanthace&aelig;</i>; a few <i>Asclepiade&aelig;</i> climbing up
the bushes; and the Cowage plant, now with over-ripe pods, by
shaking which, in passing, there often falls such a shower of its
irritating microscopic hairs, as to make the skin tingle for an
hour.</p>

<p>On the 1st of February, we moved on to Gyra, another
insignificant village. The air was cool, and the atmosphere clear.
The temperature, at three in the morning, was 65&deg;, with no dew,
the grass only 61&deg;. As the sun rose, Parasnath appeared against
the clear grey sky, in the form of a beautiful broad cone, with a
rugged peak, of a deeper grey than the sky. It is a remarkably
handsome mountain, sufficiently lofty to be imposing, rising out of
an elevated country, the slope of which, upward to the base of the
mountain, though imperceptible, is really considerable; and</p>

<p class="fnote">* Often occurring in strata, like flints.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 13">[ 13 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">it is surrounded by lesser hills of just
sufficient elevation to set it off. The atmosphere, too, of these
regions is peculiarly favourable for views: it is very dry at this
season; but still the hills are clearly defined, without the harsh
outlines so characteristic of a moist air. The skies are bright,
the sun powerful; and there is an almost imperceptible haze that
seems to soften the landscape, and keep every object in true
perspective.</p>

<p>Our route led towards the picturesque hills and values in front.
The rocks were all hornblende and micaceous schist, cut through by
trap-dykes, while great crumbling masses (or bosses) of quartz
protruded through the soil. The stratified rocks were often
exposed, pitched up at various inclinations: they were frequently
white with effloresced salts, which entering largely into the
composition tended to hasten their decomposition, and being
obnoxious to vegetation, rendered the sterile soil more hungry
still. There was little cultivation, and that little of the most
wretched kind; even rice-fields were few and scattered; there was
no corn, or gram (<i>Ervum Lens</i>), no Castor-oil, no Poppy,
Cotton, Safflower, or other crops of the richer soils that flank
the Ganges and Hoogly; a very little Sugar-cane, Dhal
(<i>Cajana</i>), Mustard, Linseed, and Rape, the latter three
cultivated for their oil. Hardly a Palm was to be seen; and it was
seldom that the cottages could boast of a Banana, Tamarind, Orange,
Cocoa-nut or Date. The Mahowa (<i>Bassia latifolia</i>) and Mango
were the commonest trees. There being no Kunker in the soil here,
the roads were mended with angular quartz, much to the
elephants&rsquo; annoyance.</p>

<p>We dismounted where some very micaceous stratified rock cropped
out, powdered with a saline efflorescence.*</p>

<p class="fnote">* An impure carbonate of soda. This earth is
thrown into clay vessels with water, which after dissolving the
soda, is allowed to evaporate, when the remainder is collected, and
found to contain so much silica, as to be capable of being fused
into glass. Dr. Boyle mentions this curious fact (Essay on the Arts
and Manufactures of India, read before the Society of Arts,
February 18, 1852), in illustration of the probably early epoch at
which the natives of British India were acquainted with the art of
making glass. More complicated processes are employed, and have
been from a very early period, in other parts of the continent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Jujubes (<i>Zizyphus</i>) prevailed, with the <i>
Carissa carandas</i> (in fruit), a shrub belonging to the usually
poisonous family of Dog-banes (<i>Apocyne&aelig;</i>); its berries
make good tarts, and the plant itself forms tolerable hedges.</p>

<p>The country around Fitcoree is rather pretty, the hills covered
with bamboo and brushwood, and as usual, rising rather suddenly
from the elevated plains. The jungle affords shelter to a few bears
and tigers, jackals in abundance, and occasionally foxes; the birds
seen are chiefly pigeons. Insects are very scarce; those of the
locust tribe being most prevalent, indicative of a dry climate.</p>

<p>The temperature at 3 a.m. was 65&deg;; at 3 p.m. 82&deg; and at
10 p.m., 68&deg;, from which there was no great variation during
the whole time we spent at these elevations. The clouds were rare,
and always light and high, except a little fleecy spot of vapour
condensed close to the summit of Paras-nath. Though the nights were
clear and starlight, no dew was deposited, owing to the great
dryness of the air. On one occasion, this drought was so great
during the passage of a hot wind, that at night I observed the
wet-bulb thermometer to stand 20&middot;5 degrees below the
temperature of the air, which was 66&deg; this indicated a
dew-point of 11&middot;5&deg;, or 54&middot;5&deg; below the air,
and a saturation-point of 0&middot;146; there being only
0&middot;102 grains of vapour per cubic foot of air, which latter
was loaded with dust. The little moisture suspended in the
atmosphere is often seen to be condensed in a thin belt of vapour,
at a considerable distance above the dry surface of the earth, thus
intercepting the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 15">[ 15 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">radiation of heat from the latter to the clear sky
above. Such strata may be observed, crossing the hills in
ribbonlike masses, though not so clearly on this elevated region as
on the plains bounding the lower course of the Soane, where the
vapour is more dense, the hills more scattered, and the whole
atmosphere more humid. During the ten days I spent amongst the
hills I saw but one cloudy sunrise, whereas below, whether at
Calcutta, or on the banks of the Soane, the sun always rose behind
a dense fog-bank.</p>

<p>At 9.30 a.m. the black-bulb thermometer rose in the sun to
130&deg;. The morning observation before 10 or 11 a.m. always gives
a higher result than at noon, though the sun&rsquo;s declination is
so considerably less, and in the hottest part of the day it is
lower still (3.30 p.m. 109&deg;), an effect no doubt due to the
vapours raised by the sun, and which equally interfere with the
photometer observations. The N.W. winds invariably rise at about 9
a.m. and blow with increasing strength till sunset; they are due to
the rarefaction of the air over the heated ground, and being loaded
with dust, the temperature of the atmosphere is hence raised by the
heated particles. The increased temperature of the afternoon is
therefore not so much due to the accumulation of caloric from the
sun&rsquo;s rays, as to the passage of a heated current of air
derived from the much hotter regions to the westward. It would be
interesting to know how far this N.W. diurnal tide extends; also
the rate at which it gathers moisture in its progress over the damp
regions of the Sunderbunds. Its excessive dryness in N.W. India
approaches that of the African and Australian deserts; and I shall
give an abstract of my own observations, both in the vallies of the
Soane and Ganges, and on the elevated plateaus of Behar and of
Mirzapore.*</p>

<p>On the 2nd of February we proceeded to
Tofe-Choney, the hills increasing in height to nearly 1000 feet,
and the country becoming more picturesque. We passed some tanks
covered with <i>Villarsia</i>, and frequented by flocks of white
egrets. The existence of artificial tanks so near a lofty mountain,
from whose sides innumerable water-courses descend, indicates the
great natural dryness of the country during one season of the year.
The hills and vallies were richer than I expected, though far from
luxuriant. A fine <i>Nauclea</i> is a common shady tree, and <i>
Bignonia indica</i>, now leafless, but with immense pods hanging
from the branches. <i>Acanthace&aelig;</i> is the prevalent natural
order, consisting of gay-flowered <i>Eranthemums, Ruellias,
Barlerias,</i> and such hothouse favourites.*</p>

<p>This being the most convenient station whence to ascend
Paras-nath, we started at 6 a.m. for the village of Maddaobund, at
the north base of the mountain, or opposite side from that on which
the grand trunk-road runs. After following the latter for a few
miles to the west, we took a path through beautifully wooded
plains, with scattered trees of the Mahowa (<i>Bassia
latifolia</i>), resembling good oaks: the natives distil a kind of
arrack from its fleshy flowers, which are also eaten raw. The
seeds, too, yield a concrete oil, by expression, which is used for
lamps and occasionally for frying.</p>

<p>Some villages at the west base of the mountain occupy a better
soil, and are surrounded with richer cultivation; palms, mangos,
and the tamarind, the first and last rare</p>

<p class="fnote">* Other plants gathered here, and very typical of
the Flora of this dry region, were <i>Linum trigynum, Feronia
elephantum, &AElig;gle marmelos, Helicteres Asoca, Abrus
precatorius, Flemingia</i>; various <i>Desmodia, Rhynchosi&aelig;,
Glycine,</i> and <i>Grislea tomentosa</i> very abundant, <i>
Conocarpus latifoliusa, Loranthus lonjpglorus,</i> and another
species; <i>Phyllanthus Emblica,</i> various <i>Convolvuli,
Cuscuta,</i> and several herbaceous <i>Composit&aelig;.</i></p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 17">[ 17 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">features in this part of Bengal, appeared to be
common, with fields of rice and broad acres of flax and rape,
through the latter of which the blue <i>Orobanche indica</i>
swarmed. The short route to Maddaobund, through narrow rocky
vallies, was impracticable for the elephants, and we had to make a
very considerable detour, only reaching that village at 2 p.m. All
the hill people we observed were a fine-looking athletic race; they
disclaimed the tiger being a neighbour, which every palkee-bearer
along the road declares to carry off the torch-bearers, torch and
all. Bears they said were scarce, and all other wild animals, but a
natural jealousy of Europeans often leads the natives to deny the
existence of what they know to be an attraction to the proverbially
sporting Englishman.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The site of Maddaobund, elevated 1,230 feet, in a
clearance of the forest, and the appearance of the snow-white domes
and bannerets of its temples through the fine trees by which it is
surrounded, are very beautiful. Though several hundred feet above
any point we had hitherto reached, the situation is so sheltered
that the tamarind, peepul, and banyan trees are superb. A fine
specimen of the latter stands at the entrance to the village, not a
broadheaded tree, as is usual in the prime of its existence, but a
mass of trunks irregularly throwing out immense branches in a most
picturesque manner; the original trunk is apparently gone, and the
principal mass of root stems is fenced in. This, with two
magnificent tamarinds, forms a grand clump. The ascent of the
mountain is immediately from the village up a pathway worn by the
feet of many a pilgrim from the most remote parts of India.</p>

<p>Paras-nath is a mountain of peculiar sanctity, to which
circumstance is to be attributed the flourishing state of
Maddaobund. The name is that of the twenty-third incarnation of
Jinna (Sanscrit &ldquo;Conqueror&rdquo;), who was born at Benares,
lived one hundred years, and was buried on this mountain, which is
the eastern metropolis of Jain worship, as Mount Aboo is the
western (where are their libraries and most splendid temples). The
origin of the Jain sect is obscure, though its rise appears to
correspond with the wreck of Boodhism throughout India in the
eleventh century. The Jains form in some sort a transition-sect
between Boodhists and Hindoos, differing from the former in
acknowledging castes, and from both in their worship of
Paras-nath&rsquo;s foot, instead of that of Munja-gosha of the
Boodhs, or Vishnoo&rsquo;s of the Hindoos. As a sect of Boodhists
their religion is considered pure, and free from the obscenities so
conspicuous in Hindoo worship; whilst, in</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 19">[ 19 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">fact, perhaps the reverse is the case; but the
symbols are fewer, and indeed almost confined to the feet of
Paras-nath, and the priests jealously conceal their esoteric
doctrines.</p>

<p>The temples, though small, are well built, and carefully kept.
No persuasion could induce the Brahmins to allow us to proceed
beyond the vestibule without taking off our shoes, to which we were
not inclined to consent. The bazaar was for so small a village
large, and crowded to excess with natives of all castes, colours,
and provinces of India, very many from the extreme W. and N.W.,
Rajpootana, the Madras Presidency, and Central India. Numbers had
come in good cars, well attended, and appeared men of wealth and
consequence; while the quantities of conveyances of all sorts
standing about, rather reminded me of an election, than of anything
I had seen in India.</p>

<p>The natives of the place were a more Negro-looking race than the
Bengalees to whom I had previously been accustomed; and the
curiosity and astonishment they displayed at seeing (probably many
of them for the first time) a party of Englishmen, were
sufficiently amusing. Our coolies with provisions not having come
up, and it being two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, I having had
no breakfast, and being ignorant of the exclusively Jain population
of the village, sent my servant to the bazaar, for some fowls and
eggs; but he was mobbed for asking for these articles, and parched
rice, beaten flat, with some coarse sugar, was all I could obtain;
together with sweetmeats so odiously flavoured with various herbs,
and sullied with such impurities, that we quickly made them over to
the elephants.</p>

<p>Not being able to ascend the mountain and return in one day, Mr.
Williams and his party went back</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 20">[ 20 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">to the road, leaving Mr. Haddon and myself, who
took up our quarters under a tamarind-tree.</p>

<p>In the evening a very gaudy poojah was performed. The car,
filled with idols, was covered with gilding and silk, and drawn by
noble bulls, festooned and garlanded. A procession was formed in
front; and it opened into an avenue, up and down which gaily
dressed dancing-boys paced or danced, shaking castanets, the
attendant worshippers singing in discordant voices, beating
tom-toms, cymbals, etc. Images (of Boodh apparently) abounded on
the car, in front of which a child was placed. The throng of
natives was very great and perfectly orderly, indeed, sufficiently
apathetic: they were remarkably civil in explaining what they
understood of their own worship. At 2 p.m., the thermometer was
only 65&deg;, though the day was fine, a strong haze obstructing
the sun&rsquo;s rays; at 6 p.m., 58&deg;; at 9 p.m., 56&deg;, and
the grass cooled to 49&deg;. Still there was no dew, though the
night was starlight.</p>

<p>Having provided doolies, or little bamboo chairs slung on four
men&rsquo;s shoulders, in which I put my papers and boxes, we next
morning commenced the ascent; at first through woods of the common
trees, with large clumps of bamboo, over slaty rocks of gneiss,
much inclined and sloping away from the mountain. The view from a
ridge 500 feet high was superb, of the village, and its white domes
half buried in the forest below, the latter of which continued in
sight for many miles to the northward. Descending to a valley some
ferns were met with, and a more luxuriant vegetation, especially of
<i>Urtice&aelig;.</i> Wild bananas formed a beautiful, and to me
novel feature in the woods.</p>

<p>The conical hills of the white ants were very abundant. The
structure appears to me not an independent one, but the debris of
clumps of bamboos, or of the trunks of large</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 21">[ 21 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">trees, which these insects have destroyed. As they
work up a tree from the ground, they coat the bark with particles
of sand glued together, carrying up this artificial sheath or
covered way as they ascend. A clump of bamboos is thus speedily
killed; when the dead stems fall away, leaving the mass of stumps
coated with sand, which the action of the weather soon fashions
into a cone of earthy matter.</p>

<p>Ascending again, the path strikes up the hill, through a thick
forest of Sal (<i>Vateria robusta</i>) and other trees, spanned
with cables of scandent <i>Bauhinia</i> stems. At about 3000 feet
above the sea, the vegetation becomes more luxuriant, and by a
little stream I collected five species of ferns and some
mosses,&mdash;all in a dry state, however. Still higher, <i>
Clematis, Thalictrum,</i> and an increased number of grasses are
seen; with bushes of <i>Verbenace&aelig;</i> and <i>
Composit&aelig;.</i> The white ant apparently does not enter this
cooler region. At 3,500 feet the vegetation again changes, the
trees all become gnarled and scattered; and as the dampness also
increases, more mosses and ferns appear. We emerged from the forest
at the foot of the great ridge of rocky peaks, stretching E. and W.
three or four miles. Abundance of a species of berberry and an <i>
Osbeckia</i> marked the change in the vegetation most decidedly,
and were frequent over the whole summit, with coarse grasses, and
various bushes.</p>

<p>At noon we reached the saddle of the crest (alt. 4,230 feet),
where was a small temple, one of five or six which occupy various
prominences of the ridge. The wind, N.W., was cold, the temp.
56&deg;. The view was beautiful, but the atmosphere too hazy: to
the north were ranges of low wooded hills, and the course of the
Barakah and Adji rivers; to the south lay a flatter country, with
lower ranges, and the Damooda river, its all but waterless bed
snowy-white from the exposed granite blocks with</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 22">[ 22 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">which its course is strewn. East and west the
several sharp ridges of the mountain itself are seen; the western
considerably the highest. Immediately below, the mountain flanks
appear clothed with impenetrable forest, here and there interrupted
by rocky eminences; while to the north the grand trunk road shoots
across the plains, like a white thread, as straight as an arrow,
spanning here and there the beds of the mountain torrents.</p>

<p>On the south side the vegetation was more luxuriant than on the
north, though, from the heat of the sun, the reverse might have
been expected. This is owing partly to the curve taken by the ridge
being open to the south, and partly to the winds from that quarter
being the moist ones. Accordingly, trees which I had left 3000 feet
below in the north ascent, here ascended to near the summit, such
as figs and bananas. A short-stemmed palm (<i>Ph&oelig;nix</i>) was
tolerably abundant, and a small tree (<i>Pterospermum</i>) on which
a species of grass grew epiphytically; forming a curious feature in
the landscape.</p>

<p>The situation of the principal temple is very fine, below the
saddle in a hollow facing the south, surrounded by jungles of
plantain and banyan. It is small, and contains little worthy of
notice but the sculptured feet of Paras-nath, and some marble Boodh
idols; cross-legged figures with crisp hair and the Brahminical
cord. These, a leper covered with ashes in the vestibule, and an
officiating priest, were all we saw. Pilgrims were seen on various
parts of the mountain in very considerable numbers, passing from
one temple to another, and generally leaving a few grains of dry
rice at each; the rich and lame were carried in chairs, the poorer
walked.</p>

<p>The culminant rocks are very dry, but in the rains may possess
many curious plants; a fine <i>Kalanchoe</i> was common,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 23">[ 23 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">with the berberry, a beautiful <i>Indigofera,</i>
and various other shrubs; a <i>Bolbophyllum</i> grew on the rocks,
with a small <i>Begonia,</i> and some ferns. There were no birds,
and very few insects, a beautiful small <i>Pontia</i> being the
only butterfly. The striped squirrel was very busy amongst the
rocks; and I saw a few mice, and the traces of bears.</p>

<p>At 3 p.m., the temperature was 54&deg;, and the air deliciously
cool and pleasant. I tried to reach the western peak (perhaps 300
feet above the saddle), by keeping along the ridge, but was cut off
by precipices, and ere I could retrace my steps it was time to
descend. This I was glad to do in a doolie, and I was carried to
the bottom, with only one short rest, in an hour and three
quarters. The descent was very steep the whole way, partly down
steps of sharp rock, where one of the men cut his foot severely.
The pathway at the bottom was lined for nearly a quarter of a mile
with sick, halt, maimed, lame, and blind beggars, awaiting our
descent. It was truly a fearful sight, especially the lepers, and
numerous unhappy victims to elephantiasis.</p>

<p>Though the botany of Paras-nath proved interesting, its
elevation was not accompanied by such a change from the flora of
its base as I had expected. This is no doubt due to its dry climate
and sterile soil; characters which it shares with the extensive
elevated area of which it forms a part, and upon which I could not
detect above 300 species of plants during my journey. Yet, that the
atmosphere at the summit is more damp as well as cooler than at the
base, is proved as well by the observations as by the vegetation;*
and in some respects, as the increased</p>

<p class="fnote">* Of plants eminently typical of a moister
atmosphere, I may mention the genera <i>Bolbophyllum, Begonia,
&AElig;ginetia, Disporum, Roxburghia, Panax, Eugenia, Myrsine,
Shorea, Millettia,</i> ferns, mosses, and foliaceous lichens; which
appeared in strange association with such dry-climate genera as <i>
Kalanchoe, Pterospermum,</i> and the dwarf-palm, <i>
Ph&oelig;nix.</i> Add to this list the <i>Berberis asiatica,
Clematis nutans, Thalictrum glyphocarpum,</i> 27 grasses, <i>
Cardamine,</i> etc., and the mountain top presents a mixture of the
plants of a damp hot, a dry hot, and of a temperate climate, in
fairly balanced proportions. The prime elements of a tropical flora
were however wholly wanting on Paras-nath, where are neither
Peppers, <i>Pothos, Arum,</i> tall or climbing palms, tree-ferns,
<i>Guttifer&aelig;,</i> vines, or laurels.</p>
