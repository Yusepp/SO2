<br>
<p class="first">We reached the boundary between Sikkim and Tibet
early in the afternoon; it is drawn along Kongra Lama, which is a
low flat spur running east from Kinchinjhow towards Chomiomo, at a
point where these mountains are a few miles apart, thus crossing
the Lachen river:* it is marked by cairns of stone, some rudely
fashioned into chaits, covered with votive rags on wands of bamboo.
I made the altitude by barometer 15,745 feet above the sea, and by
boiling water, 15,694 feet, the water boiling at 184&middot;1&deg;;
the temperature of the air between 2.40 and 4 p.m. varied from
41&middot;3&deg; to 42&middot;5&deg;, the dew-point
39&middot;8&deg;; that of the</p>

<p class="fnote">* The upper valley of the Lachen in Tibet, which I
ascended in the following October, is very open, flat, barren, and
stony; it is bounded on the north by rounded spurs from Chomiomo,
which are continued east to Donkia, forming a watershed to the
Lachen on the south, and to the Arun on the north.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 81">[ 81 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Lachen was 47&deg;, which was remarkably high. We
were bitterly cold; as the previous rain had wetted us through, and
a keen wind was blowing up the valley. The continued mist and fog
intercepted all view, except of the flanks of the great mountains
on either hand, of the rugged snowy ones to the south, and of those
bounding the Lachen to the north. The latter were unsnowed, and
appeared lower than Kongra Lama, the ground apparently sloping away
in that direction; but when I ascended them, three months
afterwards, I found they were 3000 feet higher! a proof how utterly
fallacious are estimates of height, when formed by the eye alone.
My informants called them Peuka-t&rsquo;hlo; &ldquo;peu&rdquo;
signifies north in Tibetan, and &ldquo;t&rsquo;hlo&rdquo; a hill in
Lepcha.</p>

<p>Isolated patches of vegetation appeared on the top of the pass,
where I gathered forty kinds of plants, most of them being of a
tufted habit characteristic of an extreme climate; some (as species
of <i>Caryophylle&aelig;</i>) forming hemi-spherical balls on the
naked soil; others* growing in matted tufts level with the ground.
The greater portion had no woolly covering; nor did I find any of
the cottony species of <i>Saussurea,</i> which are so common on the
wetter mountains to the southward. Some most delicate-flowered
plants even defy the biting winds of these exposed regions; such
are a prickly <i>Meconopsis</i> with slender flower-stalks and four
large blue poppy-like petals, a <i>Cyananthus</i> with a membranous
bell-shaped corolla, and a fritillary. Other curious plants were a
little yellow saxifrage with long runners (very like the arctic <i>
S. flagellaris,</i> of Spitzbergen</p>

<p class="fnote">* The other plants found on the pass were; of
smooth hairless ones, <i>Ranunculus,</i> Fumitory, several species
of <i>Stellaria, Arenaria, Crucifer&aelig;, Parnassia, Morina,</i>
saxifrages, <i>Sedum,</i> primrose, <i>Herminium, Polygonum,
Campanula, Umbellifer&aelig;,</i> grasses and <i>Carices</i>: of
woolly or hairy once, <i>Anemone, Artemisia, Myosotis, Draba,
Potentilla,</i> and several <i>Composit&aelig;,</i> etc.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 82">[ 82 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and Melville Island), and the strong-scented
spikenard (<i>Nardostachys</i>).</p>

<p>The rocks were chiefly of reddish quartz, and so was the base of
Chomiomo. Kinchinjhow on the contrary was of gneiss, with granite
veins: the strike of both was north-west, and the dip north-east
20&deg; to 30&deg;.</p>

<p>We made a fire at the top with sheep&rsquo;s droppings, of which
the Phipun had brought up a bagfull, and with it a pair of
goat-skin bellows, which worked by a slit that was opened by the
hand in the act of raising; when inflated, the hole was closed, and
the skin pressed down, thus forcing the air through the bamboo
nozzle: this is the common form of bellows throughout Tibet and the
Himalaya.</p>

<p>After two hours I was very stiff and cold, and suffering from
headache and giddiness, owing to the elevation; and having walked
about thirteen miles botanizing, I was glad to ride down. We
reached the Phipun&rsquo;s tents about 6 p.m., and had more tea
before proceeding to Tungu. The night was fortunately fine and
calm, with a few stars and a bright young moon, which, with the
glare from the snows, lighted up the valley, and revealed
magnificent glimpses of the majestic mountains. As the moon sank,
and we descended the narrowing valley, darkness came on, and with a
boy to lead my sure-footed pony, I was at liberty uninterruptedly
to reflect on the events of a day, on which I had attained the
object of so many years&rsquo; ambition. Now that all obstacles
were surmounted, and I was returning laden with materials for
extending the knowledge of a science which had formed the pursuit
of my life, will it be wondered at that I felt proud, not less for
my own sake, than for that of the many friends, both in India and
at home, who were interested in my success?</p>

<p>We arrived at Tungu at 9 p.m., my pony not having</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 83">[ 83 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">stumbled once, though the path was rugged, and
crossed by many rapid streams. The Soubah&rsquo;s little shaggy
steed had carried his portly frame (fully fifteen stone weight) the
whole way out and back, and when he dismounted, it shook itself,
snorted, and seemed quite ready for supper.</p>

<p>On the following morning I was occupied in noting and arranging
my collections, which consisted of upwards of 200 plants; all
gathered above 14,000 feet elevation.* Letters arrived from
Dorjiling with unusual speed, having been only seventeen days on
the road: they were full of valuable suggestions and encouragement
from my friends Hodgson, Campbell, and Tchebu Lama.</p>

<p>On the 26th of July the Phipun, who waited on me every morning
with milk and butter, and whose civility and attentions were now
unremitting, proposed that I should accompany him to an encampment
of Tibetans, at the foot of Kinchinjhow. We mounted ponies, and
ascended the Tunguchoo eastwards: it was a rapid river for the
first thousand feet, flowing in a narrow gorge, between sloping,
grassy, and rocky hills, on which large herds of yaks were feeding,
tended by women and children, whose black tents were scattered
about. The yak-calves left their mothers to run beside our ponies,
which became unmanageable, being almost callous to the bit; and the
whole party was sometimes careering over the slopes, chased by the
grunting herds: in other places, the path was narrow and dangerous,
when the sagacious animals proceeded with the utmost gravity and
caution. Rounding one rocky spur, my pony stumbled, and pitched me
forward: fortunately I lighted on the path.</p>

<p class="fnote">* Amongst them the most numerous Natural orders
and genera were, <i>Crucifer&aelig;</i> 10; <i>Composit&aelig;</i>
20; <i>Ranunculace&aelig;</i> 10; <i>Alsine&aelig;</i> 9; <i>
Astragali</i> 10; <i>Potentill&aelig;</i> 8; grasses 12; <i>
Carices</i> 15; <i>Pedicularis</i> 7; <i>Boragine&aelig;</i> 7.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 84">[ 84 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rocks were gneiss, with granite veins (strike north-east,
dip south-east): they were covered with <i>Ephedra,</i>* an <i>
Onosma</i> which yields a purple dye, <i>Orchis,</i> and species of
<i>Androsace</i>; while the slopes were clothed with the spikenard
and purple <i>Pedicularis,</i> and the moist grounds with yellow
cowslip and long grass. A sudden bend in the valley opened a superb
view to the north, of the full front of Kinchinjhow, extending for
four or five miles east and west; its perpendicular sides studded
with the immense icicles, which are said to have obtained for it
the name of &ldquo;jhow,&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;bearded&rdquo;
Kinchin. Eastward a jagged spur stretches south, rising into
another splendid mountain, called Chango-khang (the Eagle&rsquo;s
crag), from whose flanks descend great glaciers, the sources of the
Tunguchoo.</p>

<p>We followed the course of an affluent, called the Chachoo, along
whose bed ancient moraines rose in successive ridges: on these I
found several other species of European genera.&dagger; Over one of
these moraines, 500 feet high, the path ascends to the plains of
Palung, an elevated grassy expanse, two miles long and four broad,
extending southward from the base of Kinchinjhow. Its surface,
though very level for so mountainous a country, is yet varied with
open valleys and sloping hills, 500 to 700 feet high: it is bounded
on the west by low rounded spurs from Kinchinjhow, that form the
flank of the Lachen valley; while on the east it is separated from
Chango-khang by the Chachoo, which cuts a deep east and west trench
along the base of Kinchinjhow, and then turns south to the</p>

<p class="fnote">* A curious genus of small shrubs allied to pines,
that grows in the south of Europe. This species is the European <i>
E. vulgaris</i>; it inhabits the driest parts of north-west India,
and ascends to 17,000 feet in Tibet, but is not found in the moist
intervening countries.<br>
&dagger; <i>Delphinium, Hypecoum, Sagina, Gymnandra, Artemisia,
Caltha, Dracocephalum, Leontopodium.</i></p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 85">[ 85 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Tunguchoo. The course of the Chachoo, where it
turns south, is most curious: it meanders in sickle-shaped curves
along the marshy bottom of an old lake-bed, with steep shelving
sides, 500 to 600 feet deep, and covered with juniper bushes.* It
is fed by the glaciers of Kinchinjhow, and some little lakes to the
east.</p>

<p>The mean height of Palung plains is 16,000 feet: they are
covered with transported blocks, and I have no doubt their surface
has been much modified by glacial action. I was forcibly reminded
of them by the slopes of the Wengern Alp, but those of Palung are
far more level. Kinchinjhow rises before the spectator, just as the
Jungfrau, M&ouml;nch, and Eigher Alps do from that magnificent
point of view.</p>

<p>On ascending a low hill, we came in sight of the Tibet camp at
the distance of a mile, when the great mastiffs that guarded it
immediately bayed; and our ponies starting off at full gallop, we
soon reached an enclosure of stone dykes, within which the black
tents were pitched. The dogs were of immense size, and ragged, like
the yaks, from their winter coat hanging to their flanks in great
masses; each was chained near a large stone, on and off which he
leapt as he gave tongue; they are very savage, but great cowards,
and not remarkable for intelligence.</p>

<p>The people were natives of Gearee and Kambajong, in the adjacent
province of Dingcham, which is the loftiest, coldest, most windy
and arid in Eastern Tibet; and in which are the sources of all the
streams that flow to Nepal; Sikkim, and Bhotan on the one side, and
into the Yaru-tsampu on the other. These families repair yearly to
Palung, with their flocks, herds, and tents, paying tribute to the
Sikkim</p>

<p class="fnote">* These, which grow on an eastern exposure, exist
at a higher elevation than any other bushes I have met with.</p>

<p class="first">Rajah for the privilege: they arrive in June and
leave in September. Both men and women were indescribably filthy;
as they never wash, their faces were perfectly black with smoke and
exposure, and the women&rsquo;s with a pigment of grease as a
protection from the wind. The men were dressed as usual, in the
blanket-cloak, with brass pipes, long knives, flint, steel, and
amulets; the women wore similar, but shorter cloaks, with silver
and copper girdles, trowsers, and flannel boots. Their head-dresses
were very remarkable. A circular band of plaited yak&rsquo;s hair
was attached to the back hair, and encircled the head like a
saint&rsquo;s glory,* at some distance round it. A band crossed the
forehead,</p>

<p class="fnote">* I find in Ermann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Siberia&rdquo;
(i., p. 210), that the married women of Yekaterinberg wear a
head-dress like an ancient glory covered with jewels, whilst the
unmarried ones plait their tresses. The same distinguished
traveller mentions having seen a lad of six years old suckled,
amongst the Tungooze of East Siberia.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 87">[ 87 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">from which coins, corals, and turquoises, hung
down to the eyebrows, while lappets of these ornaments fell over
the ears. Their own hair was plaited in two tails, brought over the
shoulders, and fastened together in front; and a little yellow felt
cap, traversely elongated, so as not to interfere with the shape of
the glory, was perched on the head. Their countenances were
pleasing, and their manners timid.</p>

<p>The children crawled half-naked about the tent, or burrowed like
moles in an immense heap of goats&rsquo; and sheep-droppings, piled
up for fuel, upon which the family lounged. An infant in arms was
playing with a &ldquo;coral,&rdquo; ornamented much like ours, and
was covered with jewels and coins. This custom of decorating
children is very common amongst half-civilised people; and the
coral is, perhaps, one of the last relics of a barbarous age that
is retained amongst ourselves. One mother was nursing her baby, and
churning at the same time, by rolling the goat-skin of yak-milk
about on the ground. Extreme poverty induces the practice of
nursing the children for years; and in one tent I saw a lad upwards
of four years of age unconcernedly taking food from his aunt, and
immediately afterwards chewing hard dry grains of maize.</p>

<p>The tents were pitched in holes about two feet and a half deep;
and within them a wall of similar height was built all round: in
the middle was a long clay arched fire-place, with holes above,
over which the cauldrons were placed, the fire being underneath.
Saddles, horse-cloths, and the usual accoutrements and implements
of a nomad people, all of the rudest description, hung about:
there was no bed or stool, but Chinese rugs for sleeping on. I
boiled water on the fire-place; its temperature (184&middot;5&deg;)
with that of the air (45&middot;5&deg;) gave an elevation of
15,867</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 88">[ 88 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">feet. Barometric observations, taken in October,
at a point considerably lower down the stream, made the elevation
15,620 feet, or a few feet lower than Kongra Lama pass.</p>

<p>A Lama accompanied this colony of Tibetans, a festival in honour
of Kinchinjhow being annually held at a large chait hard by, which
is painted red, ornamented with banners, and surmounted by an
enormous yak&rsquo;s skull, that faces the mountain. The Lama
invited me into his tent, where I found a wife and family. An
extempore altar was at one end, covered with wafers and other
pretty ornaments, made of butter, stamped or moulded with the
fingers.* The tents being insupportably noisome, I preferred
partaking of the buttered brick-tea in the open air; after which, I
went to see the shawl-wool goats sheared in a pen close by. There
are two varieties: one is a large animal, with great horns, called
&ldquo;Rappoo;&rdquo;&dagger; the other smaller, and with slender
horns, is called &ldquo;Tsilloo.&rdquo; The latter yields the
finest wool, but they are mixed for ordinary purposes. I was
assured that the sheep (of which large flocks were grazing near)
afford the finest wool of any. The animals were caught by the tail,
their legs tied, the long winter&rsquo;s hair pulled out, and the
remainder cut away with a broad flat knife, which was sharpened
with a scythe-stone. The operation was clumsily performed, and the
skin much cut.</p>

<p>Turnips are grown at Palung during the short stay of the people,
and this is the most alpine cultivation in Sikkim: the seed is sown
early in July, and the tubers are fit to be eaten in October, if
the season is favourable.</p>

<p class="fnote">* The extensive use of these ornaments throughout
Tibet, on the occasion of religious festivals, is alluded to by MM.
Huc and Gabet.<br>
&dagger; This is the &ldquo;Changra;&rdquo; and the smaller the
&ldquo;Chyapu&rdquo; of Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s catalogue. (See
&ldquo;British Museum Catalogue.&rdquo;)</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 89">[ 89 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">They did not come to maturity this year, as I
found on again visiting this spot in October; but their tops had
afforded the poor Tibetans some good vegetables. The mean
temperature of the three summer months at Palung is probably about
40&deg;, an element of comparatively little importance in
regulating the growth and ripening of vegetables at great
elevations in Tibetan climates; where a warm exposure, the amount
of sunshine, and of radiated heat, have a much greater
influence.</p>

<p>During the winter, when these families repair to Kambajong, in
Tibet, the flocks and herds are all stall-fed, with long grass, cut
on the marshy banks of the Yaru. Snow is said to fall five feet
deep at that place, chiefly after January; and it melts in
April.</p>

<p>After tea, I ascended the hills overhanging the Lachen valley,
which are very bare and stony; large flocks of sheep were feeding
on them, chiefly upon small tufted sedges, allied to the English
<i>Carex pilularis,</i> which here forms the greatest part of the
pasture: the grass grows mixed with it in small tufts, and is the
common Scotch mountain pasture-grass (<i>Festuca ovina</i>).</p>

<p>On the top of these hills, which, for barrenness, reminded me of
the descriptions given of the Siberian steppes, I found, at 17,000
feet elevation, several minute arctic plants, with <i>Rhododendron
nivale,</i> the most alpine of woody plants. On their sterile
slopes grew a curious plant allied to the <i>Cherleria</i> of the
Scotch Alps, forming great hemispherical balls on the ground, eight
to ten inches across, altogether resembling in habit the curious
Balsambog (<i>Bolax glebaria</i>) of the Falkland Islands, which
grows in very similar scenes.*</p>

<p class="fnote">* <i>Arenaria rupifraga,</i> Fenzl. This plant is
mentioned by Dr. Thomson (&ldquo;Travels in Tibet,&rdquo; p. 426)
as common in Tibet, as far north as the Karakoram, at an elevation
between 16,000 and 18,000 feet. In Sikkim it is found at the same
level. Specimens of it are exhibited in the Kew Museum. As one
instance illustrative of the chaotic state of Indian botany, I may
here mention that this little plant, a denizen of such remote and
inaccessible parts of the globe, and which has only been known to
science a dozen years, bears the burthen of no less than six names
in botanical works. This is the <i>Bryomorpha rupifraga</i> of
Karelin and Kireloff (enumeration of Soongarian plants), who first
described it from specimens gathered in 1841, on the Alatau
mountains (east of Lake Aral). In Ledebour&rsquo;s &ldquo;Flora
Rossica&rdquo; (i. p. 780) it appears as <i>Arenaria</i> (sub-genus
<i>Dicranilla</i>) <i>rupifraga,</i> Fenzl, MS. In Decaisne and
Cambessede&rsquo;s Plants of Jacquemont&rsquo;s &ldquo;Voyage aus
Indes Orientales,&rdquo; it is described as <i>Flourensia
c&aelig;spitosa,</i> and in the plates of that work it appears as
<i>Periandra c&aelig;spitosa</i>; and lastly, in Endlicher&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Genera Plantarum,&rdquo; Fenzl proposes the long new generic
name of <i>Thylacospermum</i> for it. I have carefully compared the
Himalayan and Alatau plants, and find no difference between them,
except that the flower of the Himalayan one has 4 petals and
sepals, 8 stamens, and 2 styles, and that of the Alatau 5 petals
and sepals, 10 stamens, and 2-3 styles, characters which are very
variable in allied plants. The flowers appear polygamous, as in the
Scotch alpine <i>Cherleria,</i> which it much resembles in habit,
and to which it is very nearly related in botanical characters.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 90">[ 90 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few days afterwards, I again visited Palung, with the view of
ascertaining the height of perpetual snow on the south face of
Kinchinjhow; unfortunately, bad weather came on before I reached
the Tibetans, from whom I obtained a guide in consequence. From
this place a ride of about four miles brought me to the source of
the Chachoo, in a deep ravine, containing the terminations of
several short, abrupt glaciers,* and into which were precipitated
avalanches of snow and ice. I found it impossible to distinguish
the glacial ice from perpetual snow; the larger beds of snow where
presenting a flat surface, being generally drifts collected in
hollows, or accumulations that have fallen from above: when these
accumulations rest on slopes they become converted into ice, and
obeying the laws of fluidity, flow downwards as glaciers. I boiled
water at the most advantageous position I could select, and
obtained an elevation of 16,522 feet.&dagger; It was snowing
heavily at this time, and we crouched under a gigantic</p>

<p class="fnote">* De Saussure&rsquo;s glaciers of the second
order: see &ldquo;Forbes&rsquo; Travels in the Alps,&rdquo; p.
79.<br>

<p class="first">boulder, benumbed with cold. I had fortunately
brought a small phial of brandy, which, with hot water from the
boiling-apparatus kettle, refreshed us wonderfully.</p>

<p>The spur that divides these plains from the Lachen river, rises
close to Kinchinjhow, as a lofty cliff of quartzy gneiss, dipping
north-east 30&deg;: this I had noticed from the Kongra Lama side.
On this side the dip was also to the northward, and the whole cliff
was crossed by cleavage planes, dipping south, and apparently
cutting those of the foliation at an angle of about 60&deg;: it is
the only decided instance of the kind I met with in Sikkim. I
regretted not being able to examine it carefully, but I was
prevented by the avalanches of stones and snow which were
continually being detached from its surface.*</p>

<p>The plants found close to the snow were minute primroses, <i>
Parnassia, Draba,</i> tufted wormwoods (<i>Artemisia</i>),
saxifrages, gentian, small <i>Composit&aelig;,</i> grasses, and
sedges. Our ponies unconcernedly scraped away the snow with their
hoofs, and nibbled the scanty herbage. When I mounted mine, he took
the bit between his teeth, and</p>

<p class="fnote">* I extremely regret not having been at this time
acquainted with Mr. D. Sharpe&rsquo;s able essays on the foliation,
cleavage, etc., of slaty rocks, gneiss, etc., in the Geological
Society&rsquo;s Journal (ii. p. 74, and v. p. 111), and still more
so with his subsequent papers in the Philosophical Transactions: as
I cannot doubt that many of his observations, and in particular
those which refer to the great arches in which the folia (commonly
called strata) are disposed, would receive ample illustration from
a study of the Himalaya. At vol. i. <a href="chap13.html#page 309">
p. 309,</a> I have distantly alluded to such an arrangement of the
gneiss, etc., into arches, in Sikkim, to which my attention was
naturally drawn by the writings of Professor Sedgwick
(&ldquo;Geolog. Soc. Trans.&rdquo;) and Mr. Darwin
(&ldquo;Geological Observations in South America&rdquo;) on these
obscure subjects. I may add that wherever I met with the gneiss,
mica, schists, and slates, in Sikkim, very near one another, I
invariably found that their cleavage and foliation were
conformable. This, for example, may be seen in the bed of the great
Rungeet, below Dorjiling, where the slates overlie mica schists,
and where the latter contain beds of conglomerate. In these volumes
I have often used the more familiar term of stratification, for
foliation. This arises from my own ideas of the subject not having
been clear when the notes were taken.</p>

no object could be distinguished, he brought me to the tents with

<p>Wild animals are few in kind and rare in individuals, at Tungu
and elsewhere on this frontier; though there is no lack of cover
and herbage. This must be owing to the moist cold atmosphere; and
it reminds me that a similar want of animal life is characteristic
of those climates at the level of the sea, which I have adduced as
bearing a great analogy to the Himalaya, in lacking certain natural
orders of plants. Thus, New Zealand and Fuegia possess, the former
no land animal but a rat, and the latter very few indeed, and none
of any size. Such is also the case in Scotland and Norway. Again,
on the damp west coast of Tasmania, quadrupeds are rare; whilst the
dry eastern half of the island once swarmed with opossums and
kangaroos. A few miles north of Tungu, the sterile and more lofty
provinces of Tibet abound in wild horses, antelopes, hares, foxes,
marmots, and numerous other quadrupeds; although their altitude,
climate, and scanty vegetation are apparently even more unsuited to
support such numbers of animals of so large a size than the karroos
of South Africa, and the steppes of Siberia and Arctic America,
which similarly abound in animal life. The laws which govern the
distribution of large quadrupeds seem to be intimately connected
with those of climate; and we should have regard to these
considerations in our geological speculations, and not draw hasty
conclusions from the absence of the remains of large herbivora in
formations disclosing a redundant vegetation.</p>

Tibetans) sometimes migrates in swarms (like the Lapland
&ldquo;Lemming&rdquo;) from Tibet as far as Tungu. There are few
birds but red-legged crows and common ravens. Most of the insects
belonged to arctic types, and they were numerous in
individuals.&dagger;</p>

<p>The Choongtam Lama was at a small temple near Tungu during the
whole of my stay, but he would not come to visit me, pretending to
be absorbed in his devotions. Passing one day by the temple, I
found him catechising two young aspirants for holy orders. He is
one of the Dukpa sect, wore his mitre, and was seated cross-legged
on the grass with his scriptures on his knees: he put questions to
the boys, when he who answered best took the other some yards</p>

butterflies I saw blues (<i>Polyommatus</i>), marbled whites, <i>

frequent, and I found <i>Scolopendra,</i> ants and earthworms, on
sunny exposures as high as 15,500 feet.</p>

cloth over his back, and mounted; then kicking, spurring, and
cuffing his steed, he was galloped back to the Lama and kicked off;
when the catechising recommenced.</p>

<p>I spent a week at Tungu most pleasantly, ascending the
neighbouring mountains, and mixing with the people, whom I found
uniformly kind, frank, and extremely hospitable; sending their
children after me to invite me to stop at their tents, smoke, and
drink tea; often refusing any remuneration, and giving my
attendants curds and yak-flesh. If on foot, I was entreated to take
a pony; and when tired I never scrupled to catch one, twist a
yak-hair rope over its jaw as a bridle, and throwing a goat-hair
cloth upon its back (if no saddle were at hand), ride away whither
I would. Next morning a boy would be sent for the steed, perhaps
bringing an invitation to come and take it again. So I became fond
of brick-tea boiled with butter, salt, and soda, and expert in the
Tartar saddle; riding about perched on the shoulders of a rough
pony, with my feet nearly on a level with my pockets, and my knees
almost meeting in front.</p>

<p>On the 28th of July much snow fell on the hills around, as low
as 14,000 feet, and half an inch of rain at Tungu;* the former soon
melted, and I made an excursion to Chomiomo on the following day,
hoping to reach the lower line of perpetual snow. Ascending the
valley of the Chomiochoo, I struck north up a steep slope, that
ended in a spur of vast tabular masses of quartz and felspar, piled
like slabs in a stone quarry, dipping south-west 5&deg; to 10&deg;,
and striking north-west. These resulted from the decomposition of
gneiss, from which the layers of mica bad been washed away, when
the rain and frost splitting up the fragments,</p>

<p>Large silky cushions of a forget-me-not grew amongst the rocks,
spangled with beautiful blue flowers, and looking like turquoises
set in silver: the <i>Delphininin glaciale</i>* was also abundant,
exhaling a rank smell of musk. It indicates a very great elevation
in Sikkim, and on my ascent far above it, therefore, I was not
surprised to find water boil at 182&middot;6&deg; (air 43&deg;),
which gives an altitude of 16,754 feet.</p>

<p>A dense fog, with sleet, shut out all view; and I did not know
in what direction to proceed higher, beyond the top of the sharp,
stony ridge I had attained. Here there was no perpetual snow, which
is to be accounted for by the nature of the surface facilitating
its removal, the edges of the rocks which project through the snow,
becoming heated, and draining off the water as it melts.</p>

<p>During my stay at Tungu, from the 23rd to the 30th of July, no
day passed without much deposition of moisture, but generally in so
light a form that throughout the whole time but one inch was
registered in the rain-gauge; during the same time four inches and
a half of rain fell at Dorjiling, and three inches and a half at
Calcutta. The mean temperature was 50&deg; (max. 65&deg;, min.
40&middot;7&deg;); extremes, 65/38&deg;. The mean range
(23&middot;3&deg;) was thus much greater than at Dorjiling, where
it was only 8&middot;9&deg;. A thermometer, sunk three feet, varied
only a few tenths from 57&middot;6&deg;. By twenty-five comparative
observations with Calcutta, 1&deg; Fahr. is the equivalent of every
362 feet of ascent; and twenty comparative observations with
Dorjiling give 1&deg; for every 340 feet. The barometer rose and
fell at the same hours as at lower</p>

<p>I left Tungu on the 30th of July, and spent that night at
Tallum; where a large party of men had just arrived, with loads of
madder, rice, canes, bamboos, planks, etc., to be conveyed to Tibet
on yaks and ponies.* On the following day I descended to Lamteng,
gathering a profusion of fine plants by the way.</p>

<p>The flat on which I had encamped at this place in May and June,
being now a marsh, I took up my abode for two days in one of the
houses, and paid the usual penalty of communication with these
filthy people; for which my only effectual remedy was boiling all
my garments and bedding. Yet the house was high, airy, and light;
the walls composed of bamboo, lath, and plaster.</p>

<p>Tropical Cicadas ascend to the pine-woods above Lamteng in this
month, and chirp shrilly in the heat of the day; and glow-worms fly
about at night. The common Bengal and Java toad, <i>Bufo
scabra,</i> abounded in the marshes, a remarkable instance of wide
geographical distribution, for a Batrachian which is common at the
level of the sea under the tropics.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of August I descended to Choongtam, which I reached
on the 5th. The lakes on the Chateng flat (alt. 8,750 feet) were
very full, and contained many English water-plants;&dagger; the
temperature of the water was 92&deg; near</p>

was swimming about.</p>

<p>Below this I passed an extensive stalactitic deposit of lime,
and a second occurred lower down, on the opposite side of the
valley. The apparently total absence of limestone rocks in any part
of Sikkim (for which I made careful search), renders these
deposits, which are far from unfrequent, very curious. Can the
limestone, which appears in Tibet, underlie the gneiss of Sikkim?
We cannot venture to assume that these lime-charged streams, which
in Sikkim burst from the steep flanks of narrow mountain spurs, at
elevations between 1000 and 7000 feet, have any very remote or deep
origin. If the limestone be not below the gneiss, it must either
occur intercalated with it, or be the remains of a formation now
all but denuded in Sikkim.</p>

<p>Terrific landslips had taken place along the valley, carrying
down acres of rock, soil, and pine-forests, into the stream. I saw
one from Kampo Samdong, on the opposite flank of the valley, which
swept over 100 yards in breadth of forest. I looked in vain for any
signs of scratching or scoring, at all comparable to that produced
by glacial action. The bridge at the Tuktoong, mentioned at <a
href="chap19.html#page 31">p. 31,</a> being carried away, we had to
ascend for 1000 feet (to a place where the river could be crossed)
by a very precipitous path, and descend on the opposite side. In
many places we had great difficulty in proceeding, the track being
obliterated by the rains, torrents, and landslips. Along the flats,
now covered with a dense rank vegetation, we waded ankle, and often
knee, deep in mud, swarming with leeches; and instead of descending
into the valley of the now too swollen Lachen, we made long
detours, rounding spurs by canes and bamboos suspended from
trees.</p>

<p>At Choongtam the rice-fields were flooded: and the whole flat
was a marsh, covered with tropical grasses and weeds, and alive
with insects, while the shrill cries of cicadas, frogs and birds,
filled the air. Sand-flies, mosquitos, cockroaches, and enormous
cockchafers,* <i>Mantis,</i> great locusts, grasshoppers,
flying-bugs, crickets, ants, spiders, caterpillars, and leeches,
were but a few of the pests that swarmed in my tent and made free
with my bed. Great lazy butterflies floated through the air; <i>
Thecla</i> and <i>Hesperides</i> skipped about, and the great <i>
Nymphalid&aelig;</i> darted around like swallows. The venomous
black cobra was common, and we left the path with great caution, as
it is a lazy reptile, and lies basking in the sun; many beautiful
and harmless green snakes, four feet long, glided amongst the
bushes. My dogs caught a &ldquo;Rageu,&rdquo;&dagger; a very
remarkable animal, half goat and half deer; the flesh was good and
tender, dark-coloured, and lean.</p>

Cheirotonus Macleaii,</i> and a smaller species of the same rare
family, <i>Trigonophorus nepalensis</i>; of these the former is
very scarce, the latter extremely abundant, flying about at
evenings; both are flower-feeders, eating honey and pollen. In the
summer of 1848, the months at Dorjiling were well marked by the
swarms of peculiar insects that appeared in inconceivable numbers;
thus, April was marked by a great black <i>Passalus,</i> a beetle
one-and-a-half inch long, that flies in the face and entangles
itself in the hair; May, by stag-beetles and longicorns; June, by
<i>Coccinella</i> (lady-birds), white moths, and flying-bugs; July,

myriads of earwigs, cockroaches, Goliath-beetles, and cicadas;

<p class="first">Lachen valley collections previous to starting for
the Lachoong, whence I hoped to reach Tibet again by a different
route, crossing the Donkia pass, and thence exploring the sources
of the Teesta at the Cholamoo lakes.</p>

<p>Whilst here I ascertained the velocity of the currents of the
Lachen and Lachoong rivers. Both were torrents, than which none
could be more rapid, short of becoming cataracts: the rains were at
their height, and the melting of the snows at its maximum. I first
measured several hundred yards along the banks of each river above
the bridges, repeating this several times, as the rocks and jungle
rendered it very difficult to do it accurately: then, sitting on
the bridge, I timed floating masses of different materials and
sizes that were thrown in at the upper point. I was surprised to
find the velocity of the Lachen only nine miles per hour, for its
waters seemed to shoot past with the speed of an arrow, but the
floats showed the whole stream to be so troubled with local eddies
and backwaters, that it took from forty-three to forty-eight
seconds for each float to pass over 200 yards, as it was
perpetually submerged by under-currents. The breadth of the river
averaged sixty-eight feet, and the discharge was 4,420 cubic feet
of water per second. The temperature was 57&deg;.</p>

<p>At the Lachoong bridge the jungle was still denser, and the
banks quite inaccessible in many places. The mean velocity was
eight miles an hour, the breadth ninety-five feet, the depth about
the same as that of the Lachen, giving a discharge of 5,700 cubic
feet of water per</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 100">[ 100 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">second;* its temperature was also 57&deg;. These
streams retain an extraordinary velocity, for many miles upwards;
the Lachen to its junction with the Zemu at 9000 feet, and the Zemu
itself as far up as the Thlonok, at 10,000 feet, and the Lachoong
to the village of that name, at 8000 feet: their united streams
appear equally rapid till they become the Teesta at
Singtam.&dagger;</p>

<p>On the 15th of August, having received supplies from Dorjiling,
I started up the north bank of the Lachoong, following the Singtam
Soubah, who accompanied me officially, and with a very bad grace;
poor fellow, he expected me to have returned with him to Singtam,
and thence gone back to Dorjiling, and many a sore struggle we had
on this point. At Choongtam he had been laid up with ulcerated legs
from the bites of leeches and sand-flies, which required my
treatment. The path was narrow, and ran through a jungle of mixed
tropical and temperate plants,&Dagger; many of which are not found
at this elevation on the damp outer ranges of Dorjiling. We crossed
to the south bank by a fine cane-bridge forty yards long, the river
being twenty-eight across and here I have to record the loss of my
dog Kinchin; the companion of all my late journeyings, and to whom
I had become really attached. He had a bad habit, of which I</p>

<p class="fnote">* Hence it appears that the Lachoong, being so
much the more copious stream, should in one sense be regarded as
the continuation of the Teesta, rather than the Lachen, which,
however, has by far the most distant source. Their united streams
discharge upwards of 10,000 cubic feet of water per second in the
height of the rains! which is, however, a mere fraction of the
discharge of the Teesta when that river leaves the Himalaya. The
Ganges at Hurdwar discharges 8000 feet per second during the dry
season.<br>
&dagger; The slope of the bed of the Lachen from below the
confluence of the Zemu to the village of Singtam is 174 feet per
mile, or 1 foot in 30; that of the Lachoong from the village of

yards on the round bamboos by which the cane-bridges are crossed,
and on which it was impossible for a dog to retain his footing: in
this situation he used to get thoroughly frightened, and lie down
on the bamboos with his legs hanging over the water, and having no
hold whatever. I had several times rescued him from this perilous
position, which was always rendered more imminent from the shaking
of the bridge as I approached him. On the present occasion, I
stopped at the foot of some rocks below the bridge, botanizing, and
Kinchin having scrambled up the rocks, ran on to the bridge. I
could not see him, and was not thinking about him, when suddenly
his shrill, short barks of terror rang above the roaring torrent. I
hastened to the bridge, but before I could get to it, he had lost
his footing, and had disappeared. Holding on by the cane, I
strained my eyes till the bridge seemed to be swimming up the
valley, and the swift waters to be standing still, but to no
purpose; he had been carried under at once, and swept away miles
below. For many days I missed him by my side on the mountain, and
by my feet in camp. He had become a very handsome dog, with glossy
black hair, pendent triangular ears, short muzzle, high forehead,
jet-black eyes, straight limbs, arched neck, and a most glorious
tail curling over his back.*</p>

<p>A very bad road led to the village of Keadom, situated on a flat
terrace several hundred feet above the river, and 6,609 feet above
the sea, where I spent the night. Here are cultivated plantains and
maize, although the elevation</p>

<p>The river above Keadom is again crossed, by a plank bridge, at a
place where the contracted streams flow between banks forty feet
high, composed of obscurely stratified gravel, sand, and water-worn
boulders. Above this the path ascends lofty flat-topped spurs,
which overhang the river, and command some of the most beautiful
scenery in Sikkim. The south-east slopes are clothed with <i>Abies
Brunoniana</i> at 8000 feet elevation, and cleft by a deep ravine,
from which projects what appears to be an old moraine, fully 1,500
or perhaps 2000 feet high. Extensive landslips on its steep flank
expose (through the telescope) a mass of gravel and angular blocks,
while streams cut deep channels in it.</p>

<p>This valley is far more open and grassy than that of the Lachen,
and the vegetation also differs much.* In the afternoon we reached
Lachoong, which is by far the most picturesque village in the
temperate region of Sikkim. Grassy flats of different levels,
sprinkled with brushwood and scattered clumps of pine and maple,
occupy the valley; whose west flanks rise in steep, rocky, and
scantily wooded grassy slopes. About five miles to the north the
valley forks; two conspicuous domes of snow rising from the
intermediate mountains. The eastern valley leads to lofty snowed
regions, and is said to be impracticable; the Lachoong flows down
the western, which appeared rugged, and covered with pine woods. On

sharp snowed pinnacles, which form the continuation of the Chola
range; over which a pass leads to the Phari district of Tibet,
which intervenes between Sikkim and Bhotan. Southwards the view is
bounded by snowy mountains, and the valley seems blocked up by the
remarkable moraine-like spur which I passed above Keadom.</p>

its east slopes, 1000 feet up.*</p>

<p class="fnote">* I have since been greatly struck with the
similarity between the features of this valley, and those of
Chamouni (though the latter is on a smaller scale) above the
Lavanchi moraine. The spectator standing in the expanded part below
the village of Argentiere, and looking upwards, sees the valley
closed above by the ancient moraine of the Argentiere glacier, and
below by that of Lavanchi; and an all sides the slopes are cut into
terraces, strewed with boulders. I found traces of stratified
pebbles and sand on the north flank of the Lavanchi moraine
however, which I failed to discover in those of Lachoong. The
average slope of these pine-clad Sikkim valleys much approximates
to that of Chamouni, and never approaches the precipitous character
of the Bernese Alps&rsquo; valleys, Kandersteg, Lauterbrunnen, and

<p>The river is fourteen yards broad, and neither deep nor rapid:
the village is on the east bank, and is large for Sikkim; it
contains fully 100 good wooden houses, raised on posts, and
clustered together without order. It was muddy and intolerably
filthy, and intersected by some small streams, whose beds formed
the roads, and, at the same time, the common sewers of the natives.
There is some wretched cultivation in fields,* of wheat, barley,
peas, radishes, and turnips. Rice was once cultivated at this
elevation (8000 feet), but the crop was uncertain; some very
tropical grasses grow wild here, as <i>Eragrostis</i> and <i>
Panicum.</i> In gardens the hollyhock is seen: it is said to be
introduced through Tibet from China; also <i>Pinus excelsa</i> from
