<br>
<p class="first">I returned to the village of Wallanchoon, after
collecting all the plants I could around my camp; amongst them a
common-looking dock abounded in the spots which the yaks had
frequented.</p>

<p>The ground was covered, as with heather, with abundance of
creeping dwarf juniper, <i>Andromeda,</i> and dwarf rhododendron.
On arriving at the village, I refused to receive the Guobah, unless
he opened a bazaar at daylight on the following morning, where my
people might purchase food; and threatened to bring charges against
him before his Rajah. At the same time I arranged for sending the
main body of my party down the Tambur, and so back to Sikkim,
whilst I should, with as few as possible, visit the Kanglachem
(Tibetan) pass in the adjacent valley to the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 228">[ 228 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">eastward, and then, crossing the Nango, Kambachen
and Kanglanamo passes, reach Jongri in Sikkim, on the south flank
of Kinchinjunga.</p>

<p>Strolling out in the afternoon I saw a dance of Lamas; they were
disfigured with black paint* and covered with rags, feathers, and
scarlet cloth, and they carried long poles with bells and banners
attached; thus equipped, they marched through the village, every
now and then halting, when they danced and gesticulated to the rude
music of cymbals and horns, the bystanders applauding with shouts,
crackers, and alms.</p>

<p>I walked up to the convents, which were long ugly buildings,
several stories high, built of wood, and daubed with red and grey
paint. The priests were nowhere to be found, and an old withered
nun, whom I disturbed husking millet in a large wooden mortar, fled
at my approach. The temple stood close by the convent, and had a
broad low architrave: the walls sloped inwards, as did the lintels:
the doors were black, and almost covered with a gigantic and
disproportioned painting of a head, with bloody cheeks and huge
teeth; it was surrounded by myriads of goggle eyes, which seemed to
follow one about everywhere; and though in every respect rude, the
effect was somewhat imposing. The similarly proportioned gloomy
portals of Egyptian fanes naturally invite comparison; but the
Tibetan temples lack the sublimity of these; and the uncomfortable
creeping sensation produced by the many sleepless eyes of
Boodh&rsquo;s numerous incarnations is very different from the awe
with which we contemplate the outspread wings of the Egyptian
symbol, and feel as in the presence of the God who</p>

<p class="fnote">* I shall elsewhere have to refer to the Tibetan
custom of daubing the face with black pigment to protect the skin
from the excessive cold and dryness of these lofty regions; and to
the ludicrous imposition that was passed on the credulity of MM.
Huc and Gabet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">says, &ldquo;I am Osiris the Great: no man hath
dared to lift my veil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had ascended behind the village, but returned down the
&ldquo;via sacra,&rdquo; a steep paved path flanked by mendongs or
low stone dykes, into which were let rows of stone slabs, inscribed
with the sacred &ldquo;Om Mani Padmi om.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hail
to him of the lotus and jewel&rdquo;; an invocation of Sakkya, who
is usually represented holding a lotus flower with a jewel in
it.</p>

<p>On the following morning, a scanty supply of vcry dirty rice was
produced, at a very high price. I had, however, so divided my party
as not to require a great amount of food, intending to send most of
the people back by the Tambur to Dorjiling. I kept nineteen persons
in all, selecting the most willing, as it was evident the journey
at this season would be one of great hardship: we took seven
days&rsquo; food, which was as much as they could carry. At noon, I
left Wallanchoon, and mustered my party at the junction of the
Tambur and Yangma, whence I dismissed the party for Dorjiling, with
my collections of plants, minerals, etc., and proceeded with the
chosen ones to ascend the Yangma river. The scenery was wild and
very grand, our path lying through a narrow gorge, choked with pine
trees, down which the river roared in a furious torrent; while the
mountains on each side were crested with castellated masses of
rock, and sprinkled with snow. The road was very bad, often up
ladders, and along planks lashed to the faces of precipices, and
over-hanging the torrent, which it crossed several times by plank
bridges. By dark we arrived at Yangma Guola, a collection of empty
wood huts buried in the rocky forest-clad valley, and took
possession of a couple. They were well built, raised on posts, with
a stage and ladder</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 230">[ 230 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">at the gable end, and consisted of one good-sized
apartment. Around was abundance of dock, together with three common
English plants.*</p>

<p>The night was calm, misty, and warm (Max. 41&middot;5&deg;, Min.
29&deg;) for the elevation (9,300 feet). During the night, I was
startled out of my sleep by a blaze of light, and jumping up, found
myself in presence of a party of most sinister-looking, black,
ragged Tibetans, armed with huge torches of pine, that filled the
room with flame and pitchy smoke. I remembered their arriving just
before dark, and their weapons dispelled my fears, for they came
armed with bamboo jugs of Murwa beer, and were very drunk and very
amiable: they grinned, nodded, kotowed, lolled out their tongues,
and scratched their ears in the most seductive manner, then held
out their jugs, and besought me by words and gestures to drink and
be happy too. I awoke my servant (always a work of difficulty), and
with some trouble ejected the visitors, happily without setting the
house on fire. I heard them toppling head over heels down the
stair, which I afterwards had drawn up to prevent further
intrusion, and in spite of their drunken orgies, was soon lulled to
sleep again by the music of the roaring river.</p>

<p>On the 29th November, I continued my course north up the Yangma
valley, which after five miles opened considerably, the trees
disappearing, and the river flowing more tranquilly, and through a
broader valley, when above 11,000 feet elevation. The Guobah of
Wallanchoon overtook us on the road; on his way, he said, to
collect the revenues at Yangma village, but in reality to see what
I was about. He owns five considerable villages, and is said to pay
a tax of 6000 rupees (600 pounds) to the Rajah of Nepal: this is no
doubt a great exaggeration, but the</p>

<p class="fnote">* <i>Cardamine hirsuta, Limosella aquatica,</i>
and <i>Juncus bufonius.</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 231">[ 231 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">revenues of such a position, near a pass
frequented almost throughout the year, must be considerable. Every
yak going and coming is said to pay l<i>s</i>., and every horse
4<i>s</i>.; cattle, sheep, ponies, land, and wool are all taxed; he
exports also quantities of timber to Tibet, and various articles
from the plains of India. He joined my party and halted where I
did, had his little Chinese rug spread, and squatted cross-legged
on it, whilst his servant prepared his brick tea with salt, butter,
and soda, of which he partook, snuffed, smoked, rose up, had all
his traps repacked, and was off again.</p>

<p>We encamped at a most remarkable place: the valley was broad,
with little vegetation but stunted tree-junipers: rocky snow-topped
mountains rose on either side, bleak, bare, and rugged; and in
front, close above my tent, was a gigantic wall of rocks,
piled&mdash;as if by the Titans&mdash;completely across the valley,
for about three-quarters of a mile. This striking phenomenon had
excited all my curiosity on first obtaining a view of it. The path,
I found, led over it, close under its west end, and wound amongst
the enormous detached fragments of which it was formed, and which
were often eighty feet square: all were of gneiss and schist, with
abundance of granite in blocks and veins. A superb view opened from
the top, revealing its nature to be a vast moraine, far below the
influence of any existing glaciers, but which at some antecedent
period had been thrown across by a glacier descending to 10,000
feet, from a lateral valley on the east flank. Standing on the top,
and looking south, was the Yangma valley (up which I had come),
gradually contracting to a defile, girdled by snow-tipped
mountains, whose rocky flanks mingled with the black pine forest
below. Eastward the moraine stretched south of the lateral valley,
above which towered the snowy</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 232">[ 232 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">peak of Nango, tinged rosy red, and sparkling in
the rays of the setting sun: blue glaciers peeped from every gulley
on its side, but these were 2000 to 3000 feet above this moraine;
they were small too, and their moraines were mere gravel, compared
with this. Many smaller consecutive moraines, also, were evident
along the bottom of that lateral valley, from this great one up to
the existing glaciers. Looking up the Yangma was a flat grassy
plain, hemmed in by mountains, and covered with other stupendous
moraines, which rose ridge behind ridge, and cut off the view of
all but the mountain tops to the north. The river meandered through
the grassy plain (which appeared a mile and a half broad at the
utmost, and perhaps as long), and cut through the great moraine on
its eastern side, just below the junction of the stream from the
glacial valley, which, at the lower part of its course, flowed over
a broad steep shingle bed.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images/plate4.jpg" width="425" height="307" alt=
"Ancient Moraine thrown across the Yangma Valley, East Nepal">
</center>

<p>I descended to my camp, full of anxious anticipations for the
morrow; while the novelty of the scene, and its striking character,
the complexity of the phenomena, the lake-bed, the stupendous
ice-deposited moraine, and its remoteness from any existing ice,
the broad valley and open character of the country, were all marked
out as so many problems suddenly conjured up for my unaided
solution, and kept me awake for many hours. I had never seen a
glacier or moraine on land before, but being familiar with sea ice
and berg transport, from voyaging in the South Polar regions, I was
strongly inclined to attribute the formation of this moraine to a
period when a glacial ocean stood high on the Himalaya, made fiords
of the valleys, and floated bergs laden with blocks from the
lateral gulleys, which the winds and currents would deposit along
certain lines. On the following morning I carried a barometer to
the top of the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 233">[ 233 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">moraine, which proved to be upwards of 700 feet
above the floor of the valley, and 400 above the dry lake-bed which
it bounded, and to which we descended on our route up the valley.
The latter was grassy and pebbly, perfectly level, and quite
barren, except a very few pines at the bases of the encircling
mountains, and abundance of rhododendrons, <i>Andromeda</i> and
juniper on the moraines. Isolated moraines occurred along both
flanks of the valley, some higher than that I have described, and a
very long one was thrown nearly across from the upper end of
another lateral gulley on the east side, also leading up to the
glaciers of Nango. This second moraine commenced a mile and a half
above the first, and abutting on the east flank of the valley,
stretched nearly across, and then curving round, ran down it,
parallel to and near the west flank, from which it was separated by
the Yangma river: it was abruptly terminated by a conical hill of
boulders, round whose base the river flowed, entering the dry
lake-bed from the west, and crossing it in a south-easterly
direction to the western extremity of the great moraine.</p>

<p>The road, on its ascent to the second moraine, passed over an
immense accumulation of glacial detritus at the mouth of the second
lateral valley, entirely formed of angular fragments of gneiss and
granite, loosely bound together by felspathic sand. The whole was
disposed in concentric ridges radiating from the mouth of the
valley, and descending to the flat; these were moraines <i>in
petto,</i> formed by the action of winter snow and ice upon the
loose d&eacute;bris. A stream flowed over this d&eacute;bris,
dividing into branches before reaching the lake-bed, where its
waters were collected, and whence it meandered southward to fall
into the Yangma.</p>

<p>From the top of the second moraine, a very curious</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 234">[ 234 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><img src="images/fig21.jpg" width="469" height="105" alt=
"Ancient moraines in the Yangma Valley"></center>

<p class="first">scene opened up the valley, of another but more
stony and desolate level lake-bed, through which the Yangma (here
very rapid) rushed, cutting a channel about sixty feet deep; the
flanks of this second lake-bed were cut most distinctly into two
principal terraces, which were again subdivided into others, so
that the general appearance was that of many raised beaches, but
each so broken up, that, with the exception of one on the banks of
the river, none were continuous for any distance. We descended 200
feet, and crossed the valley and river obliquely in a north-west
direction, to a small temple and convent which stood on a broad
flat terrace under the black, precipitous, west flank: this gave me
a good opportunity of examining the structure of this part of the
valley, which was filled with an accumulation, probably 200 feet
thick at the deepest part, of angular gravel and enormous boulders,
both imbedded in the gravel, and strewed on the flat surfaces of
the terraces. The latter were always broadest opposite to the
lateral valleys, perfectly horizontal for the short</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 235">[ 235 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">distance that they were continuous; and very
barren; there were no traces of fossils, nor could I assure myself
of stratification. The accumulation was wholly glacial; and
probably a lake had supervened on the melting of the great glacier
and its recedence, which lake, confined by a frozen moraine, would
periodically lose its waters by sudden accessions of heat melting
the ice of the latter. Stratified silt, no doubt, once covered the
lake bottom, and the terraces have, in succession, been denuded of
it by rain and snow. These causes are now in operation amongst the
stupendous glaciers of north-east Sikkim, where valleys, dammed up
by moraines, exhibit lakes hemmed in between these, the base of the
glacier, and the flanks of the valleys.</p>

<p>Yangma convents stood at the mouth of a gorge which opened upon
the uppermost terrace; and the surface of the latter, here well
covered with grass, was furrowed into concentric radiating ridges,
which were very conspicuous from a distance. The buildings
consisted of a wretched collection of stone huts, painted red,
enclosed by loose stone dykes. Two shockingly dirty Lamas received
me and conducted me to the temple, which had very thick walls, but
was undistinguishable from the other buildings. A small door opened
upon an apartment piled full of old battered gongs, drums, scraps
of silk hangings, red cloth, broken praying-machines&mdash;relics
much resembling those in the lumber-room of a theatre. A ladder led
from this dismal hole to the upper story, which was entered by a
handsomely carved and gilded door: within, all was dark, except
from a little lattice-window covered with oil-paper. On one side
was the library, a carved case, with a hundred gilded pigeon-holes,
each holding a real or sham book, and each closed by a little
square door, on which hung a bag full</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 236">[ 236 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">of amulets. In the centre of the book-case was a
recess, containing a genuine Jos or Fo, graced with his Chinese
attribute of very long pendulous moustaches and beard, and totally
wanting that air of contemplative repose which the Tibetan Lamas
give to their idols. Banners were suspended around, with paintings
of Lhassa, Teshoo Loombo, and various incarnations of Boodh. The
books were of the usual Tibetan form, oblong squares of separate
block-printed leaves of paper, made in Nepal or Bhotan from the
bark of a <i>Daphne,</i> bound together by silk cords, and placed
between ornamented wooden boards. On our way up the valley, we had
passed some mendongs and chaits, the latter very pretty stone
structures, consisting of a cube, pyramid, hemisphere, and cone
placed on the top of one another, forming together the tasteful
combination which appears on the cover of these volumes.</p>

<p>Beyond the convents the valley again contracted, and on crossing
a third, but much lower, moraine, a lake opened to view, surrounded
by flat terraces, and a broad gravelly shore, part of the lake
being dry. To the west, the cliffs were high, black and steep: to
the east a large lateral valley, filled at about 1500 feet up with
blue glaciers, led (as did the other lateral valleys) to the
gleaming snows of Nango; the moraine, too, here abutted on the east
flank of the Yangma valley, below the mouth of the lateral one.
Much snow (from the October fall) lay on the ground, and the cold
was pinching in the shade; still I could not help attempting to
sketch this wonderfully grand scene, especially as lakes in the
Himalaya are extremely rare: the present one was about a mile long,
very shallow, but broad, and as smooth as glass: it reminded me of
the tarn in Glencoe. The reflected lofty peak of Nango appeared as
if frozen</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 237">[ 237 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">deep down in its glassy bed, every snowy crest and
ridge being rendered with perfect precision.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images/fig22.jpg" width="295" height="234" alt=
"Looking across Yangma Valley"></center>

<p>Nango is about 18,000 feet high; it is the next lofty mountain
of the Kinchinjunga group to the west of Junnoo, and I doubt if any
equally high peak occurs again for some distance further west in
Nepal. Facing the Yangma valley, it presents a beautiful range of
precipices of black rock, capped with a thick crust of snow: below
the cliffs the snow again appears continuously and very steep, for
2000 to 3000 feet downwards, where it terminates in glaciers that
descend to 14,000 feet. The steepest snow-beds appear cut into
vertical ridges, whence the whole snowy face is&mdash;as it
were&mdash;crimped in perpendicular, closely-set, zigzag lines,
doubtless caused by the melting process,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 238">[ 238 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">which furrows the surface of the snow into
channels by which the water is carried off: the effect is very
beautiful, but impossible to represent on paper, from the extreme
delicacy of the shadows, and at the same time the perfect
definition and precision of the outlines.</p>

<p>Towards the head of the lake, its bed was quite dry and
gravelly, and the river formed a broad delta over it: the terraces
here were perhaps 100 feet above its level, those at the lower end
not nearly so much. Beyond the lake, the river became again a
violent torrent, rushing in a deep chasm, till we arrived at the
fork of the valley, where we once more met with numerous dry
lake-beds, with terraces high up on the mountain sides.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we reached the village of Yangma, a miserable
collection of 200 to 300 stone huts, nestling under the steep
south-east flank of a lofty, flat-topped terrace, laden with
gigantic glacial boulders, and projecting southward from a snowy
mountain which divides the valley. We encamped on the flat under
the village, amongst some stone dykes, enclosing cultivated fields.
One arm of the valley runs hence N.N.E. amongst snowy mountains,
and appeared quite full of moraines; the other, or continuation of
the Yangma, runs W.N.W., and leads to the Kanglachem pass.</p>

<p>Near our camp (of which the elevation was 13,500 feet),
radishes, barley, wheat, potatos, and turnips, were cultivated as
summer crops, and we even saw some on the top of the terrace, 400
feet above our camp, or nearly 14,000 feet above the sea; these
were grown in small fields cleared of stones, and protected by
dykes.</p>

<p>The scenery, though dismal, (no juniper even attaining this
elevation,) was full of interest and grandeur, from the number and
variety of snowy peaks and glaciers all around the elevated
horizon; the ancient lake-beds, now green or</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 239">[ 239 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">brown with scanty vegetation, the vast moraines,
the ridges of glacial d&eacute;bris, the flat terraces, marking, as
it were with parallel roads, the bluff sides of the mountains, the
enormous boulders perched upon them, and strewed everywhere around,
the little Boodhist monuments of quaint, picturesque shapes,
decorated with poles and banners, the many-coloured dresses of the
people, the brilliant blue of the cloudless heaven by day, the
depth of its blackness by night, heightened by the light of the
stars, that blaze and twinkle with a lustre unknown in less lofty
regions: all these were subjects for contemplation, rendered more
impressive by the stillness of the atmosphere, and the silence that
reigned around. The village seemed buried in repose throughout the
day: the inhabitants had already hybernated, their crops were
stored, the curd made and dried, the passes closed, the soil
frozen, the winter&rsquo;s stock of fuel housed, and the people had
retired into the caverns of their half subterranean houses, to
sleep, spin wool, and think of Boodh, if of anything at all, the
dead, long winter through. The yaks alone can find anything to do:
so long as any vegetation remains they roam and eat it, still
yielding milk, which the women take morning and evening, when their
shrill whistle and cries are heard for a few minutes, as they call
the grunting animals. No other sounds, save the harsh roar and
hollow echo of the falling rock, glacier, or snow-bed, disturbed
the perfect silence of the day or night.*</p>

<p>I had taken three days&rsquo; food to Yangma, and stayed there
as long as it lasted: the rest of my provisions I had left below
the first moraine, where a lateral valley leads east over the Nango
pass to the Kambachen valley, which lay on the route back to
Sikkim.</p>

<p class="fnote">* Snow covers the ground at Yangma from December
till April, and the falls are said to be very heavy, at times
amounting to 12 feet in depth.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 240">[ 240 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was premature in complaining of my Wallanchoon tents, those
provided for me at Yangma being infinitely worse, mere rags, around
which I piled sods as a defence from the insidious piercing
night-wind that descended from the northern glaciers in calm, but
most keen, breezes. There was no food to be procured in the
village, except a little watery milk, and a few small watery
potatos. The latter have only very recently been introduced amongst
the Tibetans, from the English garden at the Nepalese capital, I
believe, and their culture has not spread in these regions further
east than Kinchinjunga, but they will very soon penetrate into
Tibet from Dorjiling, or eastward from Nepal. My private stock of
provisions&mdash;consisting chiefly of preserved meats from my kind
friend Mr. Hodgson&mdash;had fallen very low; and I here found to
my dismay that of four remaining two-pound cases, provided as meat,
three contained prunes, and one <i>&ldquo;dindon aux
truffes!&rdquo;</i> Never did luxuries come more inopportunely;
however the greasy French viand served for many a future meal as
sauce to help me to bolt my rice, and according to the theory of
chemists, to supply animal heat in these frigid regions. As for my
people, they were not accustomed to much animal food; two pounds of
rice, with ghee and chilis, forming their common diet under cold
and fatigue. The poorer Tibetans, especially, who undergo great
privation and toil, live almost wholly on barley-meal, with tea,
and a very little butter and salt: this is not only the case with
those amongst whom I mixed so much, but is also mentioned by MM.
Huc and Gabet, as having been observed by them in other parts of
Tibet.</p>

<p>On the 1st of December I visited the village and terrace, and
proceeded to the head of the Yangma valley,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 241">[ 241 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">in order to ascend the Kanglachem pass as far as
practicable. The houses are low, built of stone, of no particular
shape, and are clustered in groups against the steep face of the
terrace; filthy lanes wind amongst them, so narrow, that if you are
not too tall, you look into the slits of windows on either hand, by
turning your head, and feel the noisome warm air in whiffs against
your face. Glacial boulders lie scattered throughout the village,
around and beneath the clusters of houses, from which it is
sometimes difficult to distinguish the native rock. I entered one
house by a narrow low door through walls four feet thick, and found
myself in an apartment full of wool, juniper-wood, and dried dung
for fuel: no one lived in the lower story, which was quite dark,
and as I stood in it my head was in the upper, to which I ascended
by a notched pole (like that in the picture of a Kamschatk house in
Cook&rsquo;s voyage), and went into a small low room. The inmates
looked half asleep, they were intolerably indolent and filthy, and
were employed in spinning wool and smoking. A hole in the wall of
the upper apartment led me on to the stone roof of the neighbouring
house, from which I passed to the top of a glacial boulder,
descending thence by rude steps to the narrow alley. Wishing to see
as much as I could, I was led on a winding course through, in and
out, and over the tops of the houses of the village, which
alternately reminded me of a stone quarry or gravel pit, and
gipsies living in old lime-kilns; and of all sorts of odd places
that are turned to account as human habitations.</p>

<p>From the village I ascended to the top of the terrace, which is
a perfectly level, sandy, triangular plain, pointing down the
valley at the fork of the latter, and abutting against the flank of
a steep, rocky, snow-topped mountain</p>

<p class="first">to the northward. Its length is probably half a
mile from north to south, but it runs for two miles westward up the
valley, gradually contracting. The surface, though level, is very
uneven, being worn into hollows, and presenting ridges and hillocks
of blown sand and gravel, with small black tufts of rhododendron.
Enormous boulders of gneiss and granite were scattered over the
surface; one of the ordinary size, which I measured, was seventy
feet in girth, and fifteen feet above the ground, into which it had
partly sunk. From the southern pointed end I took sketches of the
opposite flanks of the valleys east and west. The river was about
400 feet below me, and flowed in a little flat lake-bed; other
terraces skirted it,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 243">[ 243 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">cut out, as it were, from the side of that I was
on. On the opposite flank of the valley were several superimposed
terraces, of which the highest appeared to tally with the level I
occupied, and the lowest was raised very little above the river;
none were continuous for any distance, but the upper one in
particular, could be most conspicuously traced up and down the main
valley, whilst, on looking across to the eastern valley, a much
higher, but less distinctly marked one appeared on it. The road to
the pass lay west-north-west up the north bank of the Yangma river,
on the great terrace; for two miles it was nearly level along the
gradually narrowing shelf, at times dipping into the steep gulleys
formed by lateral torrents from the mountains; and as the terrace
disappeared, or melted, as it were, into the rising floor of the
valley, the path descended upon the lower and smaller shelf.</p>

<p>We came suddenly upon a flock of gigantic wild sheep, feeding on
scanty tufts of dried sedge and grass; there were twenty-five of
these enormous animals, of whose dimensions the term sheep gives no
idea: they are very long-legged, stand as high as a calf, and have
immense horns, so large that the fox is said to take up his abode
in their hollows, when detached and bleaching, on the barren
mountains of Tibet. Though very wild, I am sure I could easily have
killed a couple had I had my gun, but I had found it necessary to
reduce my party so uncompromisingly, that I could not afford a man
both for my gun and instruments, and had sent the former back to
Dorjiling, with Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s bird-stuffers, who had broken
one of theirs. Travelling without fire-arms sounds strange in
India, but in these regions animal life is very rare, game is only
procured with much hunting and trouble, and to come within shot of
a flock of wild sheep was a contingency I</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 244">[ 244 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">never contemplated. Considering how very short we
were of any food, and quite out of animal diet, I could not but
bitterly regret the want of a gun, but consoled myself by
reflecting that the instruments were still more urgently required
to enable me to survey this extremely interesting valley. As it
was, the great beasts trotted off, and turned to tantalise me by
grazing within an easy stalking distance. We saw several other
flocks, of thirty to forty, during the day, but never, either on
this or any future occasion, within shot. The <i>Ovis Ammon</i> of
Pallas stands from four to five feet high, and measures seven feet
from nose to tail; it is quite a Tibetan animal, and is seldom seen
below 14,000 feet, except when driven lower by snow; and I have
seen it as high as 18,000 feet. The same animal, I believe, is
found in Siberia, and is allied to the Big-horn of North
America.</p>

<p>Soon after descending to the bed of the valley, which is broad
and open, we came on a second dry lake-bed, a mile long, with
shelving banks all round, heavily snowed on the shaded side; the
river was divided into many arms, and meandered over it, and a fine
glacier-bound valley opened into it from the south. There were no
boulders on its surface, which was pebbly, with tufts of grass and
creeping tamarisk. On the banks I observed much granite, with large
mica crystals, hornstone, tourmaline, and stratified quartz, with
granite veins parallel to the foliation or lamination.</p>

<p>A rather steep ascent of a mile, through a contracted part of
the valley, led to another and smaller lake-bed, a quarter of a
mile long and 100 yards broad, covered with patches of snow, and
having no lateral valley opening into it: it faced the now
stupendous masses of snow and ice which filled the upper part of
the Yangma valley. This lake-bed (elevation,</p>

rude stone hut stood near it, where we halted for a few minutes at
1 p.m., when the temperature was 42&middot;2&deg;, while the
dew-point was only 20&middot;7&deg;.* At the same time, the black
bulb thermometer, fully exposed on the snow, rose 54&deg; above the
air, and the photometer gave 10&middot;572. Though the sun&rsquo;s
power was so great, there was, however, no appearance of the snow
melting, evaporation proceeding with too great rapidity.</p>

<br>

<p>Enormous piles of gravel and sand had descended upon the upper
end of this lake-bed, forming shelves, terraces, and curving
ridges, apparently consolidated by ice, and covered in many places
with snow. Following the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">stream, we soon came to an immense moraine, which
blocked up the valley, formed of angular boulders, some of which
were fifty feet high. Respiration had been difficult for some time,
and the guide we had taken from the village said we were some hours
from the top of the pass, and could get but a little way further;
we however proceeded, plunging through the snow, till on cresting
the moraine a stupendous scene presented itself. A gulf of
moraines, and enormous ridges of d&eacute;bris, lay at our feet,
girdled by an amphitheatre of towering, snow-clad peaks, rising to
17,000 and 18,000 feet all around. Black scarped precipices rose on
every side; deep snow-beds and blue glaciers rolled down every
gulley, converging in the hollow below, and from each transporting
its own materials, there ensued a complication of moraines, that
presented no order to the eye. In spite of their mutual
interference, however, each had raised a ridge of d&eacute;bris or
moraine parallel to itself.</p>

<p>We descended with great difficulty through the soft snow that
covered the moraine, to the bed of this gulf of snow and glaciers;
and halted by an enormous stone, above the bed of a little lake,
which was snowed all over, but surrounded by two superimposed level
terraces, with sharply defined edges. The moraine formed a barrier
to its now frozen waters, and it appeared to receive the drainage
of many glaciers, which filtered through their gravelly ridges and
moraines.</p>

<p>We could make no further progress; the pass lay at the distance
of several hours&rsquo; march, up a valley to the north, down which
the glacier must have rolled that had deposited this great moraine;
the pass had been closed since October, it being very lofty, and
the head of this valley was far more snowy than that at
Wallanchoon. We halted in the snow from 3 to 4 p.m., during which
time I again took angles</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 247">[ 247 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and observations; the height of this spot, called
Pabuk, is 16,038 feet, whence the pass is probably considerably
over 17,000 feet, for there was a steep ascent beyond our position.
The sun sank at 3 p.m., and the thermometer immediately fell from
35&deg; to 30&middot;75&deg;.*</p>

<p>After fixing in my note and sketch books the principal features
of this sublime scene, we returned down the valley: the distance to
our camp being fully eight miles, night overtook us before we got
half-way, but a two days&rsquo; old moon guided us perfectly, a
remarkable instance of the clearness of the atmosphere at these
great elevations. Lassitude, giddiness, and headache came on as our
exertions increased, and took away the pleasure I should otherwise
have felt in contemplating by moonlight the varied phenomena, which
seemed to crowd upon the restless imagination, in the different
forms of mountain, glacier, moraine, lake, boulder and terrace.
Happily I had noted everything on my way up, and left nothing
intentionally to be done on returning. In making such excursions as
this, it is above all things desirable to seize and book every
object worth noticing on the way out: I always carried my note-book
and pencil tied to my jacket pocket, and generally walked with them
in my hand. It is impossible to begin observing too soon, or to
observe too much: if the excursion is long, little is ever done on
the way home; the bodily powers being mechanically exerted, the
mind seeks repose, and being fevered through over-exertion, it can
endure no train of thought, or be brought to bear on a subject.</p>

<p>During my stay at Yangma, the thermometer never rose to 50&deg;,
it fell to 14&middot;75&deg; at night; the ground was frozen for
several inches below the surface, but at two feet depth its</p>

<p class="fnote">* At 4 o&rsquo;clock, to 29&middot;5&deg;, the
average dew-point was 16&middot;3&deg;, and dryness 0&middot;55;

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 248">[ 248 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">temperature was 37&middot;5&deg;. The black bulb
thermometer rose on one occasion 84&deg; above the surrounding air.
Before leaving, I measured by angles and a base-line the elevations
of the great village-terrace above the river, and that of a loftier
one, on the west flank of the main valley; the former was about 400
and the latter 700 feet.</p>

<p>Considering this latter as the upper terrace, and concluding
that it marks a water level, it is not very difficult to account
for its origin. There is every reason to suppose that the flanks of
the valley were once covered to the elevation of the upper terrace,
with an enormous accumulation of d&eacute;bris; though it does not
follow that the whole valley was filled by ice-action to the same
depth; the effect of glaciers being to deposit moraines between
themselves and the sides of the valley they fill; as also to push
forward similar accumulations. Glaciers from each valley, meeting
at the fork, where their depth would be 700 feet of ice, would both
deposit the necessary accumulation along the flanks of the great
valley, and also throw a barrier across it. The melting waters of
such glaciers would accumulate in lakes, confined by the frozen
earth, between the moraines and mountains. Such lakes, though on a
small scale, are found at the terminations and sides of existing
glaciers, and are surrounded by terraces of shingle and
d&eacute;bris; these terraces being laid bare by the sudden
drainage of the lakes during seasons of unusual warmth. To explain
the phenomena of the Yangma valley, it may be necessary to demand
larger lakes and deeper accumulations of d&eacute;bris than are now
familiar to us, but the proofs of glaciers having once descended to
from 8000 to 10,000 feet in every Sikkim and east Nepal valley
communicating with mountains above 16,000 feet elevation, are
overwhelming, and the glaciers must, in some cases, have been</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 249">[ 249 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">fully forty miles long, and 500 feet in depth. The
absence of any remains of a moraine, or of blocks of rock in the
valley below the fork, is I believe, the only apparent objection to
this theory; but, as I shall elsewhere have occasion to observe,
the magnitude of the moraines bears no fixed proportion to that of
the glacier, and at Pabuk, the steep ridges of d&eacute;bris, which
were heaped up 200 feet high, were far more striking than the more
usual form of moraine.</p>

<p>On my way up to Yangma I had rudely plotted the valley, and
selected prominent positions for improving my plan on my return:
these I now made use of, taking bearings with the azimuth compass,
and angles by means of a pocket sextant. The result of my
running-survey of the whole valley, from 10,000 to 16,000 feet, I
have given along with a sketch-map of my routes in India, which
accompanies this volume.</p>
