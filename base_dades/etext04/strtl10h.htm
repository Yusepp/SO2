<h3 align=center>PREFACE</h3>

<p>
Some day we shall have a science of education comparable to the
science
of medicine; but even when that day arrives the <i>art</i> of
education
will still remain the inspiration and the guide of all wise
teachers.
The laws that regulate our physical and mental development will be
reduced to order; but the impulses which lead each new generation to
play its way into possession of all that is best in life will still
have
to be interpreted for us by the artists who, with the wisdom of
years,
have not lost the direct vision of children.

<p>
Some years ago I heard Miss Shedlock tell stories in England.  Her
fine
sense of literary and dramatic values, her power in sympathetic
interpretation, always restrained within the limits of the art she
was
using, and her understanding of educational values, based on a wide
experience of teaching, all marked her as an artist in story-
telling.
She was equally at home in interpreting the subtle blending of wit
and
wisdom in Daudet, the folk lore philosophy of Grimm, or the deeper
world
philosophy and poignant human appeal of Hans Christian Andersen.

<p>
Then she came to America and for two or three years she taught us
the
difference between the nightingale that sings in the tree tops and
the
artificial bird that goes with a spring.  Cities like New York,
Boston,
Pittsburgh and Chicago listened and heard, if sometimes
indistinctly,
the notes of universal appeal, and children saw the Arabian Nights
come
true.

<p>
Yielding to the appeals of her friends in America and England, Miss
Shedlock has put together in this little book such observations and
suggestions on story-telling as can be put in words.  Those who have
the
artist's spirit will find their sense of values quickened by her
words,
and they will be led to escape some of the errors into which even
the
greatest artists fall.  And even those who tell stories with their
minds
will find in these papers wise generalizations and suggestions born
of
wide experience and extended study which well go far towards making
even
an artificial nightingale's song less mechanical.  To those who
know,
the book is a revelation of the intimate relation between a child's
instincts and the finished art of dramatic presentation.  To those
who
do not know it will bring echoes of reality.&mdash;Earl Barnes.</p>

<h3 align=center>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>
Story-telling is almost the oldest art in the world&mdash;the first
conscious form of literary communication.  In the East it still
survives, and it is not an uncommon thing to see a crowd at a street
corner held by the simple narration of a story.  There are signs in
the
West of a growing interest in this ancient art, and we may yet live
to
see the renaissance of the troubadours and the minstrels whose
appeal
will then rival that of the mob orator or itinerant politician.  One
of
the surest signs of a belief in the educational power of the story
is
its introduction into the curriculum of the training-college and the
classes of the elementary and secondary schools.  It is just at the
time
when the imagination is most keen, the mind being unhampered by
accumulation of facts, that stories appeal most vividly and are
retained
for all time.

<p>
It is to be hoped that some day stories will be told to school
groups
only by experts who have devoted special time and preparation to the
art
of telling them.  It is a great fallacy to suppose that the
systematic
study of story-telling destroys the spontaneity of narrative.  After
a
long experience, I find the exact converse to be true, namely, that
it
is only when one has overcome the mechanical difficulties that one
can
"let one's self go" in the dramatic interest of the story.

<p>
By the expert story-teller I do not mean the professional
elocutionist.
The name, wrongly enough, has become associated in the mind of the
public with persons who beat their breast, tear their hair, and
declaim
blood-curdling episodes.  A decade or more ago, the drawing-room
reciter
was of this type, and was rapidly becoming the bugbear of social
gatherings.  The difference between the stilted reciter and the
simple
story-teller is perhaps best illustrated by an episode in Hans
Christian
Andersen's immortal "Story of the Nightingale."  The real
Nightingale
and the artificial Nightingale have been bidden by the Emperor to
unite
their forces and to sing a duet at a Court function. The duet turns
out
most disastrously, and while the artificial Nightingale is singing
his
one solo for the thirty-third time, the real Nightingale flies out
of
the window back to the green wood&mdash;a true artist, instinctively
choosing his right atmosphere.  But the bandmaster&mdash;symbol of
the
pompous pedagogue&mdash;in trying to soothe the outraged feelings of
the
courtiers, says, "Because, you see, Ladies and Gentlemen, and above
all,
Your Imperial Majesty, with the real nightingale you never can tell
what
you will hear, but in the artificial nightingale everything is
decided
beforehand.  So it is, and so it must remain.  It cannot be
otherwise."

<p>
And as in the case of the two nightingales, so it is with the
stilted
reciter and the simple narrator: one is busy displaying the
machinery,
showing "how the tunes go"; the other is anxious to conceal the art.
Simplicity should be the keynote of story-telling, but (and her the
comparison with the nightingale breaks down) it is a simplicity
which
comes after much training in self-control, and much hard work in
overcoming the difficulties which beset the presentation.

<p>
I do not mean that there are not born story-tellers who <i>could</i>
hold an audience without preparation, but they are so rare in number
that we can afford to neglect them in our general consideration, for
this work is dedicated to the average story-tellers anxious to make
the
best use of their dramatic ability, and it is to them that I present
my
plea for special study and preparation before telling a story to a
group
of children&mdash;that is, if they wish for the far-reaching effects
I
shall speak of later on.  Only the preparation must be of a much
less
stereotyped nature than that by which the ordinary reciters are
trained
for their career.

<p>
Some years ago, when I was in America, I was asked to put into the
form
of lectures my views as to the educational value of telling stories.
A
sudden inspiration seized me.  I began to cherish a dream of long
hours
to be spent in the British Museum, the Congressional Library in
Washington and the Public Library in Boston&mdash;and this is the
only
portion of the dream which has been realized.  I planned an
elaborate
scheme of research work which was to result in a magnificent (if
musty)
philological treatise.  I thought of trying to discover by long and
patient researches what species of lullaby were crooned by Egyptian
mothers to their babes, and what were the elementary dramatic poems
in
vogue among Assyrian nursemaids which were the prototypes of "Little
Jack Horner," "Dickory, Dickory Dock" and other nursery classics.  I
intended to follow up the study of these ancient documents by making
an
appendix of modern variants, showing what progress we had made
&mdash;if
any&mdash;among modern nations.

<p>
But there came to me suddenly one day the remembrance of a scene
from
Racine's "Plaideurs," in which the counsel for the defence, eager to
show how fundamental his knowledge, begins his speech: "Before the
Creation of the World"&mdash;And the Judge (with a touch of
weariness
tempered by humor) suggests:

<p>
"Let us pass on to the Deluge."

<p>
And thus I, too, have passed on to the Deluge.  I have abandoned an
account of the origin and past of stories which at best would only
have
displayed a little recently acquired book knowledge.  When I thought
of
the number of scholars who could treat this part of the question
infinitely better than myself, I realized how much wiser it would be
&mdash;though the task is more humdrum&mdash;to deal with the
present
possibilities of story-telling for our generation of parents and
teachers.

<p>
My objects in urging the use of stories in the education of children
are
at least fivefold:

<p>
First, to give them dramatic joy, for which they have a natural
craving;
to develop a sense of humor, which is really a sense of proportion;
to
correct certain tendencies by showing the consequences in the career
of
the hero in the story [Of this motive the children must be quite
unconscious and there should be no didactic emphasis]; to present by
means of example, not precept, such ideals as will sooner or later
be
translated into action; and finally, to develop the imagination,
which
really includes all the other points.

<p>
But the art of story-telling appeals not only to the educational
world
and to parents as parents, but also to a wider public interested in
the
subject from a purely human point of view.

<p>
In contrast to the lofty scheme I had originally proposed to myself,
I
now simply place before all those who are interested in the art of
story-telling in any form the practical experiences I have had in my
travels in America and England.

<p>
I hope that my readers may profit by my errors, improve on my
methods,
and thus help to bring about the revival of an almost lost art.

<p>
In Sir Philip Sydney's "Defence of Poesie: we find these words:

<p>
"Forsooth he cometh to you with a tale, which holdeth children from
play, and old men from the chimney-corner, and pretending no more,
doth
intend the winning of the mind from wickedness to virtue even as the
child is often brought to take most wholesome things by hiding them
in
such other as have a pleasant taste."</p>

<h3 align=center>PART I</h3>
<h4 align=center>THE ART OF THE STORY-TELLER.</h4>
<h4 align=center><a name="chapI">CHAPTER I</a></h4>
<h4 align=center>THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE STORY</h4>

<p>
I propose to deal in this chapter with the difficulties or dangers
which
beset the path of the story-teller, because, until we have overcome
these, we cannot hope to bring out the full value of the story.

<p>
The difficulties are many, and yet they ought not to discourage the
would-be narrators, but only show them how all-important is the
preparation for the story, if it is to have the desired effect.

<p>
I propose to illustrate by concrete examples, thereby serving a
twofold
purpose: one to fix the subject more clearly in the mind of the
student,
the other to use the art of story-telling to explain itself.
<p>
I have chosen one or two instances from my own personal experience.
The
grave mistakes made in my own case may serve as a warning to others
who
will find, however, that experience is the best teacher.  For
positive
work, in the long run, we generally find out our own method.  On the
negative side, however, it is useful to have certain pitfalls
pointed
out to us, in order that we may save time by avoiding them.  It is
for
this reason that I sound a note of warning.

<p>
1.  There is <i>the danger of side issues</i>.  An inexperienced
story-
teller is exposed to the temptation of breaking off from the main
dramatic interest in a short exciting story in order to introduce a
side
issue which is often interesting and helpful but which must be left
for
a longer and less dramatic story.  If the interest turns on some
dramatic moment, the action must be quick and uninterrupted, or it
will
lose half its effect.

<p>
I had been telling a class of young children the story of Polyphemus
and
Ulysses, and just at the most dramatic moment in the story some
impulse
for which I cannot account prompted me to go off on a side issue to
describe the personal appearance of Ulysses.

<p>
The children were visibly bored, but with polite indifference they
listened to my elaborate description of the hero.  If I had given
them
an actual description from Homer, I believe that the strength of the
language would have appealed to their imagination (all the more
strongly
because the might not have understood the individual words) and have
lessened their disappointment at the dramatic issue being postponed;
but
I trusted to my own lame verbal efforts, and signally failed.
Attention
flagged, fidgeting began, the atmosphere was rapidly becoming
spoiled in
spit of the patience and toleration still shown by the children.  At
last, however, one little girl in the front row, as spokeswoman for
the
class, suddenly said: "If you please, before you go on any further,
do
you mind telling us whether, after all, that Poly . . . [slight
pause] .
. . that . . . [final attempt] . . . <i>Polyanthus</i> died?"

<p>
Now, the remembrance of this question has been of extreme use to me
in
my career as a story-teller.  I have realized that in a short
dramatic
story the mind of the listeners must be set at ease with regard to
the
ultimate fate of the special Polyanthus who takes the center of the
stage.

<p>
I remember, too, the despair of a little boy at a dramatic
representation of "Little Red Riding-Hood," when that little person
delayed the thrilling catastrophe with the Wolf, by singing a
pleasant
song on her way through the wood. "Oh, why," said the little boy,
"does
she not get on?"  And I quite shared his impatience.

<p>
This warning is necessary only in connection with the short dramatic
narrative.  There are occasions when we can well afford to offer
short
descriptions for the sake of literary style, and for the purpose of
enlarging the vocabulary of the child.  I have found, however, in
these
cases, it is well to take the children into your confidence, warning
them that they are to expect nothing particularly exciting in the
way of
dramatic event.  They will then settle down with a freer mind
(though
the mood may include a touch of resignation) to the description you
are
about to offer them.

<p>
2.  <i>Altering the story to suit special occasions</i> is done
sometimes from extreme conscientiousness, sometimes from sheer
ignorance
of the ways of children.  It is the desire to protect them from
knowledge which they already possess and with which they, equally
conscientious, are apt to "turn and rend" the narrator.  I remember
once
when I was telling the story of the Siege of Troy to very young
children, I suddenly felt anxious lest there should be anything in
the
story of the rape of Helen not altogether suitable for the average
age
of the class, namely, nine years.  I threw, therefore, a domestic
coloring over the whole subject and presented an imaginary
conversation
between Paris and Helen, in which Paris tried to persuade Helen that
she
was strong-minded woman thrown away on a limited society in Sparta,
and
that she should come away and visit some of the institutions of the
world with him, which would doubtless prove a mutually instructive
journey[1].  I then gave the children the view taken by Herodotus
that
Helen never went to Troy, but was detained in Egypt.  The children
were
much thrilled by the story, and responded most eagerly when, in my
inexperience, I invited them to reproduce in writing for the next
day
the story I had just told them.  A small child presented <i>me</i>,
as
you will see, with the ethical problem from which I had so
laboriously
protected <i>her</i>.  The essay ran:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once upon a time the King of Troy's son was called Paris.  And he
went
over to <i>Greace</i> to see what it was like.  And here he saw the
beautiful Helen<i>er</i>, and likewise her husband Menela<i>yus</i>.
And one day, Menelayus went out hunting, and left Paris and Helener
alone, and Paris said: "Do you not feel <i>dul</i> in this
<i>palis</i>?"[2] And Helener said: "I feel very dull in this <i>
pallice
</i>," and Paris said: "Come away and see the world with me."  So
they
<i>sliped</i> off together, and they came to the King of Egypt, and
<i>
he</i> said: "Who <i>is</i> the young lady"?  So Paris told him.
"But,"
said the King, "it is not <i>propper</i> for you to go off with
other
people's <i>wifes</i>.  So Helener shall stop here."  Paris stamped
his
foot.  When Menelayus got home, <i>he</i> stamped his foot.  And he
called round him all his soldiers, and they stood round Troy for
eleven
years.  At last they thought it was no use <i>standing</i> any
longer,
so they built a wooden horse in memory of Helener and the Trojans
and it
was taken into the town.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Now, the mistake I made in my presentation was to lay any particular
stress on the reason for elopement by my careful readjustment, which
really called more attention to the episode than was necessary for
the
age of my audience; and evidently caused confusion in the minds of
some
of the children who knew the story in its more accurate original
form.

<p>
While traveling in America, I was provided with a delightful
appendix to
this story.  I had been telling Miss Longfellow and her sister the
little girl's version of the Siege of Troy, and Mrs. Thorpe made the
following comment, with the American humor the dryness of which adds
so
much to its value:

<p>
"I never realized before," she said, "how glad the Greeks must have
been
to sit down even inside a horse, when they had been <i>standing</i>
for
eleven years."

<p>
3.  <i>The danger of introducing unfamiliar words</i> is the very
opposite danger of the one to which I have just alluded; it is the
taking for granted that children are acquainted with the meaning of
certain words upon which turns some important point in the story.
We
must not introduce, without at least a passing explanation, words
which,
if not rightly understood, would entirely alter the picture we wish
to
present.

<p>
I had once promised to tell stories to an audience of Irish
peasants,
and I should like to state here that, though my travels have brought
me
in touch with almost every kind of audience, I have never found one
where the atmosphere is so "self-prepared" as in that of a group of
Irish peasants.  To speak to them, especially on the subject of
fairy-
tales, is like playing on a delicate harp: the response is so quick
and
the sympathy so keen.  Of course, the subject of fairy-tales is one
which is completely familiar to them and comes into their everyday
life.
They have a feeling of awe with regard to fairies, which is very
deep in
some parts of Ireland.

<p>
On this particular occasion I had been warned by an artist friend
who
had kindly promised to sing songs between the stories, that my
audience
would be of varying age and almost entirely illiterate.  Many of the
older men and women, who could neither read nor write, had never
been
beyond their native village.  I was warned to be very simple in my
language and to explain any difficult words which might occur in the
particular Indian story I had chosen for that night, namely, "The
Tiger,
the Jackal and the Brahman."[3]&mdash;at a proper distance, however,
lest the audience should class him with the wild animals.  I then
went
on with my story, in the course of which I mentioned a buffalo.  In
spite of the warning I had received, I found it impossible not to
believe that the name of this animal would be familiar to any
audience.
I, therefore, went on with the sentence containing this word, and
ended
it thus: "And then the Brahman went a little further and met an old
buffalo turning a wheel."

<p>
The next day, while walking down the village street, I entered into
conversation with a thirteen-year-old girl who had been in my
audience
the night before and who began at once to repeat in her own words
the
Indian story in questions.  When she came to the particular sentence
I
have just quoted, I was greatly startled to hear <i>her</i> version,
which ran thus: "And the priest went on a little further, and he met
another old gentleman pushing a wheelbarrow."  I stopped her at
once,
and not being able to identify the sentence as part of the story I
had
told, I questioned her a little more closely.  I found that the word
"buffalo," had evidently conveyed to her mind an old "buffer" whose
name
was "Lo," probably taken to be an Indian form of appellation, to be
treated with tolerance though it might not be Irish in sound.  Then,
not
knowing of any wheel more familiarly than that attached to a barrow,
the
young narrator completed the picture in her own mind&mdash;but
which,
one must admit, had lost something of the Indian atmosphere which I
had
intended to gather about.

<p>
4.  <i>The danger of claiming co&ouml;peration of the class by means
of
questions</i> is more serious for the teacher than the child, who
rather
enjoys the process and displays a fatal readiness to give any sort
of
answer if only he can play a part in the conversation.  If we could
in
any way depend on the children giving the kind of answer we expect,
all
might go well and the danger would be lessened; but children have a
perpetual way of frustrating our hopes in this direction, and of
landing
us in unexpected bypaths from which it is not always easy to return
to
the main road without a very violent reaction.  As illustrative of
this,
I quote from the "The Madness of Philip," by Josephine Daskam Bacon,
a
truly delightful essay on child psychology in the guise of the
lightest
of stories.

<p>
The scene takes place in a kindergarten, where a bold and fearless
visitor has undertaken to tell a story on the spur of the moment to
a
group of restless children.

<p>
She opens thus:

<p>
"Yesterday, children, as I came out of my yard, what do you think I
saw?"

<p>
The elaborately concealed surprise in store was so obvious that
Marantha
rose to the occasion and suggested, "An el'phunt."

<p>
"Why, no.  Why should I see an elephant in my yard?  It was not <i>
nearly</i> so big as that&mdash;it was a little thing."

<p>
"A fish," ventured Eddy Brown, whose eye fell upon the aquarium in
the
corner.  The raconteuse smiled patiently.

<p>
"Now, how could a fish, a live fish, get into my front yard?"

<p>
"A dead fish," says Eddy.

<p>
He had never been known to relinquish voluntarily an idea.

<p>
"No; it was a little kitten," said the story-teller decidedly.  "A
little white kitten.  She was standing right near a big puddle of
water.
Now, what else do you think I saw?"

<p>
"Another kitten," suggests Marantha, conservatively.

<p>
"No; it was a big Newfoundland dog.  He saw the little kitten near
the
water.  Now, cats don't like water, do they?  What do they like?"

<p>"Mice," said Joseph Zukoffsky abruptly.

<p>
"Well, yes, they do; but there were no mice in my yard.  I'm sure
you
know what I mean.  If they don't like <i>water</i>, <i>what</i> do
they
like?"

<p>
"Milk," cried Sarah Fuller confidently.

<p>
"They like a dry place," said Mrs. R. B. Smith.  "Now, what do you
suppose the dog did?"

<p>
It may be that successive failures had disheartened the listeners.
It
may be that the very range of choice presented to them and the dog
alike
dazzled their imagination.  At all events, they made no answer.

<p>
"Nobody knows what the dog did?" repeated the story-teller
encouragingly. "What would you do if you saw a little kitten like
that?"

<p>
And Philip remarked gloomily:

<p>
"I'd pull its tail."

<p>
"And what do the rest of you think?  I hope you are not as cruel as
that
little boy."

<p>
A jealous desire to share Philip's success prompted the quick
response:

<p>
"I'd pull it too."

<p>
Now, the reason of the total failure of this story was the inability
to
draw any real response from the children, partly because of the
hopeless
vagueness of the questions, partly because, there being no time for
reflection, children say the first thing that comes into their heads
without any reference to their real thoughts on the subject.

<p>
I cannot imagine anything less like the enlightened methods of the
best
kindergarten teaching.  Had Mrs. R. B. Smith been a real, and not a
fictional, person, it would certainly have been her last appearance
as a
raconteuse in this educational institution.

<p>
5.  <i>The difficulty of gauging the effect of a story upon the
audience
</i> rises from lack of observation and experience; it is the want
of
these qualities which leads to the adoption of such a method as I
have
just presented.  We learn in time that want of expression on the
faces
of the audience and want of any kind of external response do not
always
mean either lack of interest or attention.  There is often real
interest
deep down, but no power, or perhaps no wish, to display that
interest,
which is deliberately concealed at times so as to protect oneself
from
questions which may be put.

<p>
6.  <i>The danger of over illustration</i>.  After long experience,
and
after considering the effect produced on children when pictures are
shown to them during the narration, I have come to the conclusion
that
the appeal to the eye and the ear at the same time is of doubtful
value,
and has, generally speaking, a distracting effect: the concentration
on
one channel of communication attracts and holds the attention more
completely.  I was confirmed in this theory when I addressed an
audience
of blind people[4] for the first time, and noticed how closely they
attended, and how much easier it seemed to them because they were so
completely "undistracted by the sights around them."

<p>
I have often suggested to young teachers two experiments in support
of
this theory.  They are not practical experiments, nor could they be
repeated often with the same audience, but they are intensely
interesting, and they serve to show the <i>actual</i> effect of
appealing to one sense at a time.  The first of these experiments is
to
take a small group of children and suggest that they should close
their
eyes while you tell them a story.  You will then notice how much
more
attention is given to the intonation and inflection of the voice.
The
reason is obvious.  With nothing to distract the attention, it is
concentrated on the only thing offered the listeners, that is,
sound, to
enable them to seize the dramatic interest of the story.

<p>
We find an example of the dramatic power of the voice in its appeal
to
the imagination in one of the tributes brought by an old pupil to
Thomas
Edward Brown, Master at Clifton College:

<p>
"My earliest recollection is that his was the most vivid teaching I
ever
received; great width of view and poetical, almost passionate, power
of
presentment.  We were reading Froude's History, and I shall never
forget
how it was Brown's words, Brown's voice, not the historian's, that
made
me feel the great democratic function which the monasteries
performed in
England; the view became alive in his mouth."  And in another
passage:
"All set forth with such dramatic force and aided by such a splendid
voice, left an indelible impression on my mind."[5]

<p>
A second experiment, and a much more subtle and difficult one, is to
take the same group of children on another occasion, telling them a
story in pantomime form, giving them first the briefest outline of
the
story.  In this case it must be of the simplest construction, until
the
children are able, if you continue the experiment, to look for
something
more subtle.

<p>
I have never forgotten the marvelous performance of a play given in
London many years ago entirely in pantomime form.  The play was
called
"L'Enfant Prodigue," and was presented by a company of French
artists.
It would be almost impossible to exaggerate the strength of that
"silent
appeal" to the public.  One was so unaccustomed to reading meaning
and
development of character into gesture and facial expression that it
was
really a revelation to most of those present&mdash;certainly to all
Anglo-Saxons.

<p>
I cannot touch on this subject without admitting the enormous
dramatic
value connected with the cinematograph.  Though it can never take
the
place of an actual performance, whether in story form or on the
stage,
it has a real educational value in its possibilities of
representation
which it is difficult to overestimate, and I believe that its
introduction into the school curriculum, under the strictest
supervision, will be of extraordinary benefit.  The movement, in its
present chaotic condition, and in the hands of commercial
management, is
more likely to stifle than to awaken or stimulate the imagination,
but
the educational world is fully alive to the danger, and I am
convinced
that in the future of the movement good will predominate.

<p>
The real value of the cinematograph in connection with stories is
that
it provides the background that is wanting to the inner vision of
the
average child, and does not prevent its imagination from filling in
the
details later.  For instance, it would be quite impossible for the
average child to get an idea from mere word-painting of the
atmosphere
of the polar regions as represented lately on the film in connection
with Captain Scott's expedition, but any stories told later on about
these regions would have an infinitely greater interest.

<p>
There is, however, a real danger in using pictures to illustrate the
story, especially if it be one which contains a direct appeal to the
imagination of the child and one quite distinct from the stories
which
deal with facts, namely, that you force the whole audience of
children
to see the same picture, instead of giving each individual child the
chance of making his own mental picture.  That is of far greater
joy,
and of much great educational value, since by this process the child
co&ouml;perates with you instead of having all the work done for
him.

<p>
Queyrat, in his works on "La Logique chez l'Enfant," quotes Madame
Necker de Saussure:[6] "To children and animals actual objects
present
themselves, not the terms of their manifestations.  For them
thinking is
seeing over again, it is going through the sensations that the real
object would have produced.  Everything which goes on within them is
in
the form of pictures, or rather, inanimate scenes in which life is
partially reproduced. . . . Since the child has, as yet, no capacity
for
abstraction, he finds a stimulating power in words and a suggestive
inspiration which holds him enchanted.  They awaken vividly colored
images, pictures far more brilliant than would be called into being
by
the objects themselves."

<p>
Surely, if this be true, we are taking from children that rare power
of mental visualization by offering to their outward vision an <i>
actual
</i> picture.

<p>
I was struck with the following note by a critic of the <i> Outlook
</i>,
referring to a Japanese play but which bears quite directly on the
subject in hand.

<p>
"First, we should be inclined to put insistence upon appeal by <i>
imagination</i>.  Nothing is built up by lath and canvas; everything
has
to be created by the poet's speech."

<p>
He alludes to the decoration of one of the scenes which consists of
three pines, showing what can be conjured up in the mind of the
spectator.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Ah, yes.  Unfolding now before my eyes<br>
The views I know: the Forest, River, Sea<br>
And Mist&mdash;the scenes of Ono now expand.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
I have often heard objections raised to this theory by teachers
dealing
with children whose knowledge of objects outside their own circle is
so
scanty that words we use without a suspicion that they are
unfamiliar
are really foreign expressions to them.  Such words as sea, woods,
fields, mountains, would mean nothing to them, unless some
explanation
were offered.  To these objections I have replied that where we are
dealing with objects that can actually be seen with the bodily eyes,
then it is quite legitimate to show pictures before you begin the
story,
so that the distraction between the actual and mental presentation
may
not cause confusion; but, as the foregoing example shows, we should
endeavor to accustom the children to seeing much more than mere
objects
themselves, and in dealing with abstract qualities we must rely
solely
on the power and choice of words and dramatic qualities of
presentation,
and we need not feel anxious if the response is not immediate, nor
even
if it is not quick and eager.[7]

<p>
7.  <i>The danger of obscuring the point of the story with too many
details</i> is not peculiar to teachers, nor is it shown only in the
narrative form.  I have often heard really brilliant after-dinner
stories marred by this defect.  One remembers the attempt made by
Sancho
Panza to tell a story to Don Quixote.  I have always felt a keen
sympathy with the latter in his impatience over the recital.

<p>
"In a village of Estramadura there was a shepherd&mdash;no, I mean a
goatherd&mdash;which shepherd or goatherd as my story says, was
called
Lope Ruiz&mdash;and this Lope Ruiz was in love with a shepherdess
called
Torralva, who was daughter to a rich herdsman, and this rich
herdsman
&mdash;&mdash;"

<p>
"If this be thy story, Sancho," said Don Quixote, "thou wilt not
have
done these two days.  Tell it concisely, like a man of sense, or
else
say no more."

<p>
"I tell it in the manner they tell all stories in my country,"
answered
Sancho, "and I cannot tell it otherwise, nor ought your Worship to
require me to make new customs."

<p>
"Tell it as thou wilt, then," said Don Quixote, "since it is the
will of
fate that I should here it, go on."

<p>Sancho continued:

<p>
"He looked about him until he espied a fisherman with a boat near
him,
but so small that it could only hold one person and one goat.  The
fisherman got into the boat and carried over on goat; he returned
and
carried another; he came back again and carried another.  Pray, sir,
keep an account of the goats which the fisherman is carrying over,
for
if you lose count of a single one, the story ends, and it will be
impossible to tell a word more. . . . I go on, then. . . . He
returned
for another goat, and another, and another and another&mdash;&mdash;
"

<p>
"<i>Suppose</i> them all carried over," said Don Quixote, "or thou
wilt
not have finished carrying them this twelve months!"

<p>
"Tell me, how many have passed already?" said Sancho.

<p>"How should I know?" answered Don Quixote.

<p>
"See there, now!  Did I not tell thee to keep an exact account?
There
is an end of the story.  I can go no further."

<p>
"How can this be?" said Don Quixote.  "Is it so essential to the
story
to know the exact number of goats that passed over, that if one
error be
made the story can proceed no further?"

<p>"Even so," said Sancho Panza.

<p>
8.  <i>The danger of overexplanation</i> is fatal to the artistic
success of any story, but it is even more serious in connection with
stories told from an educational point of view, because it hampers
the
imagination of the listener, and since the development of that
faculty
is one of our chief aims in telling these stories, we must leave
free
play, we must not test the effect, as I have said before, by the
material method of asking questions.  My own experience is that the
fewer explanations you offer, provided you have been careful with
the
choice of your material and artistic in the presentation, the more
the
child will supplement by his own thinking power what is necessary
for
the understanding of the story.

<p>
Queyrat says: "A child has no need of seizing on the exact meaning
of
words; on the contrary, a certain lack of
precision seems to stimulate his imagination only the more
vigorously,
since it gives him a broader liberty and firmer independence."[8]

<p>
9.  <i>The danger of lowering the standard</i> of the story in order
to
appeal to the undeveloped taste of the child is a special one.  I am
alluding here only to the story which is presented from the
educational
point of view.  There are moments of relaxation in a child's life,
as in
that of an adult, when a lighter taste can be gratified.  I allude
now
to the standard of story for school purposes.

<p>
There is one development of story-telling which seems to have been
very
little considered, either in America or in our own country, namely,
the
telling of stories to <i>old</i> people, and that not only in
institutions or in quiet country villages, but in the heart of the
busy
cities and in the homes of these old people.  How often, when the
young
people are able to enjoy outside amusements, the old people,
necessarily
confined to the chimney-corner and many unable to read much for
themselves, might return to the joy of their childhood by hearing
some
of the old stories told them in dramatic form.  Here is a delightful
occupation for those of the leisured class who have the gift, and a
much
more effective way of reading aloud.

<p>
Lady Gregory, in talking to the workhouse folk in Ireland, was moved
by
the strange contrast between the poverty of the tellers and the
splendors of the tale.  She says:

<p>
"The stories they love are of quite visionary things; of swans that
turn
into kings' daughters, and of castles with crowns over the doors,
and of
lovers' flights on the backs of eagles, and music-loving witches,
and
journeys to the other world, and sleeps that last for seven hundred
years."

<p>
I fear it is only the Celtic imagination that will glory in such
romantic material; but I am sure the men and women of the poorhouse
are
much more interested than we are apt to think in stories outside the
small circle of their lives.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align=center><a name="chapII">CHAPTER II</a></h4>
<h4 align=center>THE ESSENTIALS OF THE STORY</h4>

<p>
It would be a truism to suggest that dramatic instinct and dramatic
power of expression are naturally the first essentials for success
in
the art of story-telling, and that, without these, no story-teller
would
go very far; but I maintain that, even with these gifts, no high
standard of performance will be reached without certain other
qualities,
among the first of which I place <i>apparent</i> simplicity, which
is
really the <i>art</i> of <i>concealing</i> the art.

<p>
I am speaking here of the public story-teller, or of the teacher
with a
group of children, not the spontaneous (and most rare) power of
telling
stories such as B&eacute;ranger gives us in his poem, "Souvenirs du
Peuple":

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Mes enfants, dans ce village,<br>
Suivi de rois, il passa;<br>
Voil&agrave; bien longtemps de cel&agrave;!<br>
Je venais d'entrer en m&eacute;nage,<br>
&Agrave; pied grimpant le coteau,<br>
O&ugrave; pour voir je m'&eacute;tais mise.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Il avait petit chapeau et redingote grise.<br>
Il me dit: Bon jour, ma ch&egrave;re.<br>
Il vous a parl&eacute;, grand m&egrave;re?<br>
Il vous a parl&eacute;?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
I am skeptical enough to think that it is not the spontaneity of the
grandmother but the art of B&eacute;ranger which enhances the effect
of
the story told in the poem.

<p>
This intimate form of narration, which is delightful in its special
surroundings, would fail to <i>reach</i>, much less <i>hold</i>, a
large
audience, not because of its simplicity, but often because of the
want
of skill in arranging material and of the artistic sense of
selection
which brings the interest to a focus and arranges the side lights.
In
short, the simplicity we need for the ordinary purpose is that which
comes from ease and produces a sense of being able to let ourselves
go,
because we have thought out our effects.  It is when we translate
our
instinct into art that the story becomes finished and complete.

<p>
I find it necessary to emphasize this point because people are apt
to
confuse simplicity of delivery with carelessness of utterance, loose
stringing of sentences of which the only connections seem to be the
ever-recurring use of "and" and "so," and "er . . .," this latter
inarticulate sound having done more to ruin a story and distract the
audience than many more glaring errors of dramatic form.

<p>
Real simplicity holds the audience because the lack of apparent
effort
in the artist has the most comforting effect upon the listener.  It
is
like turning from the whirring machinery of process to the finished
article, which bears no traces of the making except the harmony and
beauty of the whole, which make one realize that the individual
parts
have received all proper attention.  What really brings about this
apparent simplicity which insures the success of the story?  It has
been
admirably expressed in a passage from Henry James' lecture on
Balzac:

<p>
"The fault in the artist which amounts most completely to a failure
of
dignity is the absence of <i>saturation with his idea</i>.  When
saturation fails, no other real presence avails, as when, on the
other
hand, it operates, no failure of method fatally interferes."

<p>
I now offer two illustrations of the effect of this saturation, one
to
show that the failure of method does not prevent successful effect,
the
other to show that when it is combined with the necessary secondary
qualities the perfection of the art is reached.

<p>
In illustration of the first point, I recall an experience in the
north
of England when the head mistress of an elementary school asked me
to
hear a young inexperienced girl tell a story to a group of very
small
children.

<p>
When she began, I felt somewhat hopeless, because of the complete
failure of method.  She seemed to have all the faults most damaging
to
the success of a speaker.  Her voice was harsh, her gestures
awkward,
her manner was restless and melodramatic; but, as she went on I soon
began to discount all these faults and, in truth, I soon forgot
about
them, for so absorbed was she in her story, so saturated with her
subject, that she quickly communicated her own interest to her
audience,
and the children were absolutely spellbound.

<p>
The other illustration is connected with a memorable peep behind the
stage, when the late M. Coquelin had invited me to see him in the
greenroom between the first and second acts of "L'abb&eacute;
Constantin," one of the plays given during his last season in
London,
the year before his death.  The last time I had met M. Coquelin was
at a
dinner party, where I had been dazzled by the brilliant conversation
of
this great artist in the r&ocirc;le of a man of the world.  But on
this
occasion I met the simple, kindly priest, so absorbed in his
r&ocirc;le
that he inspired me with the wish to offer a donation for his poor,
and,
on taking leave, to ask for his blessing for myself.  While talking
to
him, I had felt puzzled.  It was only when I had left him that I
realized what had happened, namely, that he was too thoroughly
saturated
with his subject to be able to drop his r&ocirc;le during the
interval,
in order to assume the more ordinary one of host and man of the
world.

<p>
Now, it is this spirit I would wish to inculcate into the would-be
story-tellers.  If they would apply themselves in this manner to
their
work, it would bring about a revolution in the art of presentation,
that
is, in the art of teaching.  The difficulty of the practical
application
of this theory is the constant plea, on the part of teachers, that
there
is not the time to work for such a standard in an art which is so
apparently simple that the work expended on it would never be
appreciated.

<p>
My answer to this objection is that, though the counsel of
perfection
would be to devote a great deal of time to the story, so as to
prepare
the atmosphere quite as much as the mere action of the little drama
(just as photographers use time exposure to obtain sky effects, as
well
as the more definite objects in the picture), yet it is not so much
a
question of time as concentration on the subject, which is one of
the
chief factors in the preparation of the story.

<p>
So many story-tellers are satisfied with cheap results, and most
audiences are not critical enough to encourage a high standard.[9]
The
method of "showing the machinery" has more immediate results, and it
is
easy to become discouraged over the drudgery which is not necessary
to
secure the approbation of the largest number.  But, since I am
dealing
with the essentials of really good story-telling, I may be pardoned
for
suggesting the highest standard and the means for reaching it.

<p>
Therefore, I maintain that capacity for work, and even drudgery, is
among the essentials of story-telling.  Personally, I know of
nothing
more interesting than watching the story grow gradually from mere
outline into a dramatic whole.  It is the same pleasure, I imagine,
which is felt over the gradual development of a beautiful design on
a
loom.  I do not mean machine-made work, which has to be done under
adverse conditions in a certain time and which is similar to
thousands
of other pieces of work; but that work, upon which we can bestow
unlimited time and concentrated thought.

<p>
The special joy in the slowly-prepared story comes in the exciting
moment when the persons, or even the inanimate objects, become alive
and
move as of themselves.  I remember spending two or three
discouraging
weeks with Andersen's story of the "Adventures of a Beetle."  I
passed
through times of great depression, because all the little creatures,
beetles, ear-wigs, frogs, etc., behaved in such a conventional way,
instead of displaying the strong individuality which Andersen had
bestowed upon them that I began to despair of presenting a live
company
at all.

<p>
But one day, the <i>Beetle</i>, so to speak, "took the stage," and
at
once there was life and animation among the minor characters.  Then
the
main work was done, and there remained only the comparatively easy
task
of guiding the movement of the little drama, suggesting side issues
and
polishing the details, always keeping a careful eye on the Beetle,
that
he might "gang his ain gait" and preserve to the full his own
individuality.

<p>
There is a tendency in preparing stories to begin with detail work,
often a gesture or side issue which one has remembered from hearing
a
story told, but if this is done before the contemplative period,
only
scrappy, jerky and ineffective results are obtained, on which one
cannot
count for dramatic effects.  This kind of preparation reminds one of
a
young peasant woman who was taken to see a performance of "Wilhelm
Tell," and when questioned as to the plot could only sum it up
saying,
"I know some fruit was shot at."[10]

<p>
I realize the extreme difficulty teachers have to devote the
necessary
time to perfecting the stories they tell in school, because this is
only
one of the subjects they have to teach in an already over-crowded
curriculum.  To them I would offer this practical advice: Do not be
afraid to repeat your stories.[11]  If you do not undertake more
than
seven stories a year, chosen with infinite care, and if you repeated
these stories six times during the year of forty-two weeks, you
would be
able to do artistic and, therefore, lasting work; you would also be
able
to avoid the direct moral application, for each time a child hears a
story artistically told, a little more of the meaning underlying the
simple story will come to him without any explanation on your part.
The
habit of doing one's best instead of one's second-best means, in the
long run, that one has no interest except in the preparation of the
best, and the stories, few in number, polished and finished in
style,
will have an effect of which one can scarcely overstate the
importance.

<p>
In the story of the "Swineherd," Hans Andersen says:

<p>
"On the grave of the Prince's father there grew a rose-tree.  It
only
bloomed once in five years, and only bore one rose.  But what a
rose!
Its perfume was so exquisite that whoever smelt it forgot at once
all
his cares and sorrows."

<p>
Lafcadio Hearn says:

<p>
"Time weeds out the errors and stupidities of cheap success, and
presents the Truth.  It takes, like the aloe, a long time to flower,
but
the blossom is all the  more precious when it appears."


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align=center><a name="chapIII">CHAPTER III</a></h4>
<h4 align=center>THE ARTIFICES OF STORY-TELLING</h4>

<p>
By this term I do not mean anything against the gospel of simplicity
which I am so constantly preaching, but, for want of a better term,
I
use the word "artifice" to express the mechanical devices by which
we
endeavor to attract and hold the attention of the audience.  The art
of
telling stories is, in truth, much more difficult than acting a part
on
the stage: First, because the narrator is responsible for the whole
drama and the whole atmosphere which surrounds it.  He has to live
the
life of each character and understand the relation which each bears
to
the whole. Secondly, because the stage is a miniature one, gestures
and
movements must all be so adjusted as not to destroy the sense of
proportion.  I have often noticed that actors, accustomed to the
more
roomy public stage, are apt to be too broad in their gestures and
movements when they tell a story.  The special training for the
story-
teller should consist not only in the training of the voice and in
choice of language, but above all in power of delicate suggestion,
which
cannot always be used on the stage because this is hampered by the
presence of <i>actual things</i>.  The story-teller has to present
these
things to the more delicate organism of the "inward eye."

<p>
So deeply convinced am I of the miniature character of the story-
telling art that I believe one never gets a perfectly artistic
presentation of this kind in a very large hall or before a very
large
audience.

<p>
I have made experiments along this line, having twice told a story
to an
audience in America[12] exceeding five thousand, but on both
occasions,
though the dramatic reaction upon oneself from the response of so
large
an audience was both gratifying and stimulating, I was forced to
sacrifice the delicacy of the story and to take from its artistic
value
by the necessity of emphasis, in order to be heard by all present.

<p>
Emphasis is the bane of all story-telling, for it destroys the
delicacy, and the whole performance suggests a struggle in conveying
the
message.  The indecision of the victory leaves the audience restless
and
unsatisfied.

<p>Then, again, as compared with acting on the stage, in telling a
story
one misses the help of effective entrances and exits, the
footlights,
the costume, the facial expression of your fellow-actor which
interprets
so much of what you yourself say without further elaboration on your
part; for, in the story, in case of a dialogue which necessitates
great
subtlety and quickness in facial expression and gesture, one has to
be
both speaker and listener.

<p>
Now, of what artifices can we make use to take the place of all the
extraneous help offered to actors on the stage?  First and foremost,
as
a means of suddenly pulling up the attention of the audience, is the
judicious art of pausing.  For those who have not actually had
experience in the matter, this advice will seem trite and
unnecessary,
but those who have even a little experience will realize with me the
extraordinary efficacy of this very simple means.  It is really what
Coquelin spoke of as a "high light," where the interest is focused,
as
it were, to a point.

<p>
I have tried this simple art of <i>pausing</i> with every kind of
audience, and I have rarely know it to fail.  It is very difficult
to
offer a concrete example of this, unless one is giving a "live"
representation, but I shall make an attempt, and at least I shall
hope
to make myself understood by those who have heard me tell stories.

<p>
In Hans Andersen's "Princess and the Pea," the King goes down to
open
the door himself.  Now, one may make this point in two ways.  One
may
either say: "And then the King went to the door, and at the door
there
stood a real Princess," or, "And then the King went to the door, and
at
the door there stood&mdash;(pause)&mdash;a real Princess."

<p>
It is difficult to exaggerate the difference of effect produced by
so
slight a pause.[13]  With children it means an unconscious curiosity
which expresses itself in a sudden muscular tension.  There is just
time
during that instant's pause to <i>feel</i>, though not to <i>
formulate
</i>, the question: "What is standing at the door?"  By this means,
half
your work of holding the attention is accomplished.  It is not
necessary
for me to enter into the psychological reason of this, but I
strongly
recommend those who are interested in the question to read the
chapter
in Ribot's work on this subject, "Essai sur L'Imagination Cr&eacute;
atrice," as well as Mr. Keatinge's work on "Suggestion."

<p>
I would advise all teachers to revise their stories with a view to
introducing the judicious pause, and to vary its use according to
the
age, the number, and, above all, the mood of the audience.
Experience
alone can insure success in this matter.  It has taken me many years
to
realize the importance of this artifice.

<p>
Among other means for holding the attention of the audience and
helping to bring out the points of the story is the use of gesture.
I
consider, however, that it must be a sparing use, and not of a broad
or
definite character.  We shall never improve on the advice given by
Hamlet to the actors on this subject: "See that ye o'erstep not the
modesty of Nature."

<p>
And yet, perhaps it is not necessary to warn story-tellers against
abuse
of gesture.  It is more helpful to encourage them in the use of it,
especially in Anglo-Saxon countries, where we are fearful of
expressing
ourselves in this way, and when we do the gesture often lacks
subtlety.
The Anglo-Saxon, when he does move at all, moves in solid blocks
&mdash;a
whole arm, a whole leg, the whole body&mdash;but if one watches a
Frenchman or an Italian in conversation, one suddenly realizes how
varied and subtle are the things which can be suggested by the mere
turn
of the wrist or the movement of a finger.  The power of the hand has
been so wonderfully summed up in a passage from Quintillian that I
am
justified in offering it to all those who wish to realize what can
be
done by a gesture:

<p>
"As to the hands, without the aid of which all delivery would be
deficient and weak, it can scarcely be told of what a variety of
motions
they are susceptible, since they almost equal in expression the
power of
language itself.  For other parts of the body assist the speaker,
but
these, I may almost say, speak themselves.  With our hands we ask,
promise, call persons to us and send them away, threaten,
supplicate,
intimate dislike or fear; with out hands we signify joy, grief,
doubt,
acknowledgement, penitence, and indicate measure, quantity, number
and
time.  Have not our hands the power of inciting, of restraining, or
beseeching, of testifying approbation? . . . So that amidst the
great
diversity of tongues pervading all nations and people, the language
of
the hands appears to be a language common to all men."[14]

<p>
One of the most effective of artifices in telling stories to young
children is the use of mimicry&mdash;the imitation of animals'
voices
and sound in general is of never-ending joy to the listeners.
However,
I should wish to introduce a note of grave warning in connection
with
this subject.  This special artifice can only be used by such
narrators
as have special aptitude and gifts in this direction.  There are
many
people with good imaginative power but who are wholly lacking in the
power of mimicry, and their efforts in this direction, however
painstaking, remain grotesque and therefore ineffective.  When
listening
to such performances, of which children are strangely critical, one
is
reminded of the French story in which the amateur animal painter is
showing her picture to an undiscriminating friend:

<p>
"Ah!" says the friend, "this is surely meant for a lion?"

<p>
"No," says the artist (?), with some slight show of temper, "it is
my
little lap-dog."

<p>
Another artifice which is particularly successful with very small
children is to insure their attention by inviting their co&ouml;
peration
before one actually begins the story.  The following has proved
quite
effective as a short introduction to my stories when I was
addressing
large audiences of children:

<p>
"Do you know that last night I had a very strange dream, which I am
going to tell you before I begin the stories?  I dreamed that I was
walking along the streets of &mdash;&mdash; [here would follow the
town
in which I happened to be speaking], with a large bundle on my
shoulders, and this bundle was full of stories which I had been
collecting all over the world in different countries; and I was
shouting
at the top of my voice: 'Stories! Stories! Stories!  Who will listen
to
my stories?'  And the children came flocking round me in my dream,
saying: 'Tell <i>us</i> your stories.  <i>We</i> will listen to your
stories.'  So I pulled out a story from my big bundle and I began in
a
most excited way, "Once upon a time there lived a King and a Queen
who
had no children, and they&mdash;&mdash;' Here a little boy, <i>very
</i>
much like that little boy I see sitting in the front row, stopped
me,
saying: 'Oh, I know <i>that</i> old story: it's Sleeping Beauty.'

<p>
"So I pulled out a second story, and began: 'Once upon a time there
was
a little girl who was sent by her  mother to visit her grandmother
&mdash;&mdash;'  Then a little girl, <i>so</i> much like the one
sitting
at the end of the second row, said: 'Oh! everybody knows that story!
It's&mdash;&mdash;'"

<p>
Here I would like to make a judicious pause, and then the children
in
the audience would shout in chorus, with joyful superiority: "Little
Red
Riding-Hood!" before I had time to explain that the children in my
dream
had done the same.

<p>
This method I repeated two or three times, being careful to choose
very
well-known stories.  By this time the children were all encouraged
and
stimulated.  I usually finished with congratulations on the number
of
stories they knew, expressing a hope that some of those I was going
to
tell that afternoon would be new to them.  I have rarely found this
plan
to fail to establish a friendly relation between oneself and the
juvenile audience.  It is often a matter of great difficulty, not to
<i>
win</i> the attention of an audience but to <i>keep</i> it, and one
of
the most subtle artifices is to let the audience down (without their
perceiving it) after a dramatic situation, so that the reaction may
prepare them for the interest of the next situation.

<p>
An excellent instance of this is to be found in Rudyard Kipling's
story
of "The Cat That Walked . . ." where the repetition of words acts as
a
sort of sedative until one realizes the beginning of a fresh
situation.

<p>
The great point is never to let the audience quite down, that is, in
stories which depend on dramatic situations.  It is just a question
of
shade and color in the language.  If you are telling a story in
sections, and one spread over two or three occasions, you should
always
stop at an exciting moment.  It encourages speculation in the
children's
minds, which increases their interest when the story is taken up
again.

<p>
Another very necessary quality in the mere artifice of story-telling
is
to watch your audience, so as to be able to know whether its mood is
for
action or reaction, and to alter your story accordingly.  The moods
of
reaction are rarer, and you must use them for presenting a different
kind of material.  Here is your opportunity for introducing a piece
of
poetic description, given in beautiful language, to which the
children
cannot listen when they are eager for action and dramatic
excitement.

<p>
Perhaps one of the greatest artifices is to take a quick hold of
your
audience by a striking beginning which will enlist their attention
from
the start.  You can then relax somewhat, but you must be careful
also of
the end because that is what remains most vivid to the children.  If
you
question them as to which story they like best in a program, you
will
constantly find it to be the last one you have told, which has for
the
moment blurred out the others.

<p>
Here are a few specimens of beginnings which seldom fail to arrest
the
attention of the child:

<p>
"There was once a giant ogre, and he lived in a cave by himself."
From
"The Giant and Jack-straws," David Starr Jordan.

<p>
"There were once twenty-five tin soldiers, who were all brothers,
for
they had been made out of the same old tin spoon."  From "The Tin
Soldier," Hans Christian Andersen.

<p>
"There was once an Emperor who had a horse shod with gold."  From
"The
Beetle," Hans Christian Andersen.

<p>
"There was once a merchant who was so rich that he could have paved
the
whole street with gold, and even then he would have had enough for a
small alley."  From the "The Flying Trunk," Hans Christian Andersen.

<p>
"There was once a shilling which came forth from the mint springing
and shouting, 'Hurrah!  Now I am going out into the wide world.'"
From
"The Silver Shilling," Hans Christian Andersen.

<p>
"In the High and Far Off Times the Elephant, O Best Beloved, had no
trunk."  From "The Elephant's Child": "Just So Stories," Rudyard
Kipling.

<p>
"Not always was the Kangaroo as now we behold him, but a Different
Animal with four short legs."   From "Old Man Kangaroo": "Just So
Stories," Rudyard Kipling.

<p>
"Whichever way I turn," said the weather-cock on a high steeple, "no
one
is satisfied."  From "Fire-side Fables," Edwin Barrow.

<p>
"A set of chessmen, left standing on their board, resolved to alter
the
rules of the game."  From the same source.

<p>
"The Pink Parasol had tender whalebone ribs and a slender stick of
cherry-wood."  From "Very Short Stories," Mrs. W. K. Clifford.

<p>
"There was once a poor little Donkey on Wheels: it had never wagged
its
tail, or tossed its head, or said 'Hee-haw,' or tasted a tender
thistle."  From the same source.

<p>
Now, some of these beginnings are, of course, for very young
children,
but they all have the same advantage, that of plunging <i>in medias
res
</i>, and, therefore, arrest attention at once, contrary to the
stories
which open on a leisurely note of description.

<p>
In the same way we must be careful about the endings of stories.
They
must impress themselves either in a very dramatic climax to which
the
whole story has worked up, as in the following:

<p>
"Then he goes out the Wet Wild Woods, or up the Wet Wild Trees, or
on
the Wet Wild Roofs, waving his Wild Tail, and walking by his Wild
Lone."
From "Just So Stories," Rudyard Kipling.

<p>Or by an anti-climax for effect:

<p>
"We have all this straight from the alderman's newspaper, but it is
not
to be depended on."  From "Jack the Dullard," Hans Christian
Andersen.

<p>
Or by evading the point:

<p>
"Whoever does not believe this must buy shares in the Tanner's
yard."
From A Great Grief," Hans Christian Andersen.

<p>
Or by some striking general comment:

<p>"He has never caught up with the three days he missed at the
beginning of the world, and he has never learnt how to behave."
From
"How the Camel got his Hump":  "Just So Stories," Rudyard Kipling.

<p>
I have only suggested in this chapter a few of the artifices which I
have found useful in my own experience, but I am sure that many more
might be added.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align=center><a name="chapIV">CHAPTER IV</a></h4>
<h4 align=center>ELEMENTS TO AVOID IN THE SELECTION OF MATERIAL</h4>

<p>
I am confronted in this portion of my work with a great difficulty,
because I cannot afford to be as catholic as I could wish (this
rejection or selection of material being primarily intended for
those
story-tellers dealing with normal children); but I do wish from the
outset to distinguish between a story told to an individual child in
the
home circle or by a personal friend, and a story told to a group of
children as part of the school curriculum.  And if I seem to
reiterate
this difference, it is because I wish to show very clearly that the
recital of parents and friends may be quite separate in content and
manner from that offered by the teaching world.  In the former case,
almost any subject can be treated, because, knowing the individual
temperament of the child, a wise parent or friend knows also what
can be
presented or not presented to the child; but in dealing with a group
of
normal children in school much has to be eliminated that could be
given
fearlessly to the abnormal child; I mean the child who, by
circumstances
or temperament, is developed beyond his years.

<p>
I shall now mention some of the elements which experience has shown
me
to be unsuitable for class stories.

<p>
I.  <i>Stories dealing with analysis of motive and feeling.</i>
This
warning is specially necessary today, because this is, above all, an
age
of introspection and analysis.  We have only to glance at the
principal
novels and plays during the last quarter of a century, more
especially
during the last ten years, to see how this spirit has crept into our
literature and life.

<p>
Now, this tendency to analyze is obviously more dangerous for
children
than for adults, because, from lack of experience and knowledge of
psychology, the child's analysis is incomplete.  It cannot see all
the
causes of the action, nor can it make that philosophical allowance
for
mood which brings the adult to truer conclusions.

<p>
Therefore, we should discourage the child who shows a tendency to
analyze too closely the motives of its action, and refrain from
presenting to them in our stories any example which might encourage
them
to persist in this course.

<p>
I remember, on one occasion, when I went to say good night to a
little
girl of my acquaintance, I found her sitting up in bed, very wide-
awake.
Her eyes were shining, her cheeks were flushed, and when I asked her
what had excited her so much, she said:

<p>
"I <i>know</i> I have done something wrong today, but I cannot quite
remember what it was."

<p>
I said: "But, Phyllis, if you put your hand, which is really quite
small, in front of your eyes, you could not see the shape of
anything
else, however large it might be.  Now, what you have done today
appears
very large because it is so close, but when it is a little further
off,
you will be able to see better and know more about it.  So let us
wait
till tomorrow morning."

<p>
I am happy to say that she took my advice.  She was soon fast
asleep,
and the next morning she had forgotten the wrong over which she had
been
unhealthily brooding the night before.

<p>
2.  <i>Stories dealing too much with sarcasm and satire</i>.  These
are
weapons which are too sharply polished, and therefore too dangerous,
to
place in the hands of children.  For here again, as in the case of
analysis, they can only have a very incomplete conception of the
case.
They do not know the real cause which produces the apparently
ridiculous
appearance, and it is only the abnormally gifted child or grown-up
person who discovers this by instinct.  It takes a lifetime to
arrive at
the position described in Sterne's words: "I would not have let
fallen
an unseasonable pleasantry in the venerable presence of misery to be
entitled to all the with which Rabelais has ever scattered."

<p>
I will hasten to add that I should not wish children to have their
sympathy too much drawn out, of their emotions kindled too much to
pity,
because this would be neither healthy nor helpful to themselves or
others.  I only want to protect children from the dangerous critical
attitude induced by the use of satire which sacrifices too much of
the
atmosphere of trust and belief in human beings which ought to be an
essential of childlife.  By indulging in satire, the sense of
kindness
in children would become perverted, their sympathy cramped, and they
themselves would be old before their time.  We have an excellent
example
of this in Hans Christian Andersen's "Snow Queen."

<p>
When Kay gets the piece of broken mirror into his eye, he no longer
sees
the world from the normal child's point of view; he can no longer
see
anything but the foibles of those about him, a condition usually
reached
by a course of pessimistic experience.

<p>
Andersen sums up the unnatural point of view in these words: "When
Kay tried to repeat the Lord's Prayer, he could only remember the
multiplication table."  Now, without taking these words in any
literal
sense, we can admit that they represent the development of the head
at
the expense of the heart.

<p>
An example of this kind of story to avoid is Andersen's "Story of
the
Butterfly."  The bitterness of the Anemones, the sentimentality of
the
Violets, the schoolgirlishness of the Snowdrops, the domesticity of
the
Sweetpeas&mdash;all this tickles the palate of the adult, but does
not
belong to the place of the normal child.  Again, I repeat, that the
unusual child may take all this in and even preserve his kindly
attitude
towards the world, but it is dangerous atmosphere for the ordinary
child.

<p>
3.  <i>Stories of a sentimental character.</i>  Strange to say, this
element of sentimentality appeals more to the young teachers than to
the
children themselves.  It is difficult to define the difference
between
real sentiment and sentimentality, but the healthy normal boy or
girl
of, let us say, ten or eleven years old, seems to feel it
unconsciously,
though the distinction is not so clear a few years later.

<p>
Mrs. Elisabeth McCracken contributed an excellent article some years
ago
to the <i>Outlook</i> on the subject of literature for the young, in
which we find a good illustration of this power of discrimination on
the
part of a child.

<p>
A young teacher was telling her pupils the story of the emotional
lady
who, to put her lover to the test, bade him pick up the glove which
she
had thrown down into the arena between the tiger and the lion.  The
lover does her bidding in order to vindicate his character as a
brave
knight.  One boy after hearing the story at once states his contempt
for
the knight's acquiescence, which he declares to be unworthy.

<p>
"But," says the teacher, "you see he really did it to show the lady
how
foolish she was."  The answer of the boy sums up what I have been
trying
to show: "There was no sense in <i>his</i> being sillier than <i>she
</i>
was, to show her <i>she</i> was silly."

<p>
If the boy had stopped there, we might have concluded that he was
lacking in imagination or romance, but his next remark proves what a
balanced and discriminating person he was, for he added: "Now, if <i
>
she</i> had fallen in, and he had leapt after her to rescue her,
that
would have been splendid and of some use."  Given the character of
the
lady, we might, as adults, question the last part of the boy's
statement, but this is pure cynicism and fortunately does not enter
into
the child's calculations.

<p>
In my own personal experience, and I have told this story often in
the
German ballad form to girls of ten and twelve in the high schools in
England, I have never found one girl who sympathized with the lady
or
who failed to appreciate the poetic justice meted out to her in the
end
by the dignified renunciation of the knight.

<p>
Chesterton defines sentimentality as "a tame, cold, or small and
inadequate manner of speaking about certain matters which demand
very
large and beautiful expression."

<p>I would strongly urge upon young teachers to revise, by this
definition, some of the stories they have included in their
repertories,
and see whether they would stand the test or not.

<p>
4.  <i>Stories containing strong sensational episodes.</i>  The
danger
of this kind of story is all the greater because many children
delight
in it and some crave for it in the abstract, but fear it in the
concrete.[15]

<p>
An affectionate aunt, on one occasion, anxious to curry favor with a
four-year-old nephew, was taxing her imagination to find a story
suitable for his tender years.  She was greatly startled when he
suddenly said, in a most imperative tone: "Tell me the story of a
bear
eating a small boy."  This was so remote from her own choice of
subject
that she hesitated at first, but coming to the conclusion that as
the
child had chosen the situation he would feel no terror in the
working up
of its details, she a most thrilling and blood-curdling story,
leading
up to the final catastrophe.  But just as she reached the great
dramatic
moment, the child raised his hands in terror and said: "Oh! Auntie,
don't let the bear <i>really</i> eat the boy!"

<p>
"Don't you know," said an impatient boy who had been listening to a
mild
adventure story considered suitable to his years, "that I don't take
any
interest in the story until the decks are dripping with gore?"  Here
we
have no opportunity of deciding whether or not the actual
description
demanded would be more alarming than the listener had realized.

<p>
Here is a poem of James Stephens, showing a child's taste for
sensational things:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A man was sitting underneath a tree<br>
Outside the village, and he asked me<br>
What name was upon this place, and said he<br>
Was never here before.  He told a<br>
Lot of stories to me too.  His nose was flat.<br>
I asked him how it happened, and he said,<br>
The first mate of the <i>Mary Ann</i> done that<br>
With a marling-spike one day, but he was dead,<br>
And a jolly job too, but he'd have gone a long way to have killed
him.
<br>
A gold ring in one ear, and the other was bit off by a crocodile,
bedad,
<br>
That's what he said: He taught me how to chew.<br>
He was a real nice man.  He liked me too.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The taste that is fed by the sensational contents of the newspapers
and
the dramatic excitement of street life, and some of the lurid
representations of the cinematograph, is so much stimulated that the
interest in normal stories is difficult to rouse.  I will not here
dwell
on the deleterious effects of over-dramatic stimulation, which has
been
known to lead to crime, since I am keener to prevent the telling of
too
many sensational stories than to suggest a cure when the mischief is
done.

<p>
Kate Douglas Wiggin has said:

<p>
"Let us be realistic, by all means, but beware, O story-teller, of
being
too realistic.  Avoid the shuddering tale of 'the wicked boy who
stoned
the birds,' lest some hearer should be inspired to try the dreadful
experiment and see if it really does kill."

<p>
I must emphasize the fact, however, that it is only the excess of
this
dramatic element which I deplore.  A certain amount of excitement is
necessary, but this question belongs to the positive side of the
subject, and I shall deal with it later on.

<p>
5.  <i>Stories presenting matters quite outside the plane of a
child's
interests, unless they are wrapped in mystery</i>.  Experience with
children ought to teach us to avoid stories which contain too much
<i>
allusion</i> to matters of which the hearers are entirely ignorant.
But
judging from the written stories of today, supposed to be for
children,
it is still a matter of difficulty to realize that this form of
allusion
to "foreign" matters, or making a joke, the appreciation of which
depends solely on a special and "inside" knowledge, is always
bewildering and fatal to sustained dramatic interest.

<p>
It is a matter of intense regret that so very few people have
sufficiently clear remembrance of their own childhood to help them
to
understand the taste and point of view of the <i>normal</i> child.
There is a passage in the "Brownies," by Mrs. Ewing, which
illustrates
the confusion created in the child mind by a facetious allusion in a
dramatic moment which needed a more direct treatment.  When the
nursery
toys have all gone astray, one little child exclaims joyfully:

<p>
"Why, the old Rocking-Horse's nose has turned up in the oven!"

<p>
"It couldn't," remarks a tiresome, facetious doctor, far more
anxious to
be funny than to sympathized with the child, "it was the purest
Grecian,
modeled from the Elgin marbles."

<p>
Now, for grownup people this is an excellent joke, but for a child
has
not yet become acquainted with these Grecian masterpieces, the whole
remark is pointless and hampering.[16]

<p>
6.  <i>Stories which appeal to fear or priggishness</i>.  This is a
class of story which scarcely counts today and against which the
teacher
does not need a warning, but I wish to make a passing allusion to
these
stories, partly to round off my subject and partly to show that we
have
made some improvement in choice of subject.

<p>
When I study the evolution of the story from the crude recitals
offered
to our children within the last hundred years, I feel that, though
our
progress may be slow, it is real and sure.  One has only to take
some
examples from the Chaps Books of the beginning of last century to
realize the difference of appeal.  Everything offered then was
either an
appeal to fear or to priggishness, and one wonders how it is that
our
grandparents and their parents every recovered from the effects of
such
stories as were offered to them.  But there is the consoling thought
that no lasting impression was made upon them, such as I believe <i>
may
</i> be possible by the right kind of story.

<p>
I offer a few examples of the old type of story:

<p>
Here is an encouraging address offered to children by a certain Mr.
Janeway about the year 1828:

<p>
"Dare you do anything which your parents forbid you, and neglect to
do
what they command?  Dare you to run up and down on the Lord's Day,
or do
you keep in to read your book, and learn what your good parents
command?"

<p>
Such an address would have almost tempted children to envy the lot
of
orphans, except that the guardians and less close relations might
have
been equally, if not more, severe.

<p>
From "The Curious Girl," published about 1809:

<p>
"Oh! papa, I hope you will have no reason to be dissatisfied with
me,
for I love my studies very much, and I am never so happy at my play
as
when I have been assiduous at my lessons all day."

<p>
"Adolphus: How strange it is, papa, you should believe it possible
for
me to act so like a child, now that I am twelve years old!"

<p>
Here is a specimen taken from a Chap Book about 1835:

<p>
Edward refuses hot bread at breakfast.  His hostess asks whether he
likes it.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>"Yes, I am extremely fond of it."

<p>
"Why did you refuse it?"

<p>
"Because I know that my papa does not approve of my eating it.  Am I
to
disobey a Father and Mother I love so well, and forget my duty,
because
they are a long way off?  I would not touch the cake, were I sure
nobody
would see me.  I myself should know it, and that would be
sufficient.

<p>
"Nobly replied!" exclaimed Mrs. C.  "Act always thus, and you must
be
happy, for although the whole world should refuse the praise that is
due, you must enjoy the approbation of your conscience, which is
beyond
anything else."

Here is a quotation of the same kind from Mrs. Sherwood:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Tender-souled little creatures, desolated by a sense of sin, if they
did
but eat a spoonful of cupboard jam without Mamma's express
permission. .
. . Would a modern Lucy, jealous of her sister Emily's doll, break
out
thus easily into tearful apology for her guilt: 'I know it is wicked
in
me to be sorry that Emily is happy, but I feel that I cannot help
it'?
And would a modern mother retort with heartfelt joy: 'My dear child,
I
am glad you have confessed Now I shall tell you why you feel this
wicked
sorrow'?&mdash;proceeding to an account of the depravity of human
nature
so unredeemed by comfort for a childish mind of common intelligence
that
one can scarcely imagine the interview ending in anything less
tragic
than a fit of juvenile hysteria.

Description of a good boy:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A good boy is dutiful to his Father and Mother, obedient to his
master
and loving to his playfellows.  He is diligent in learning his book
and
takes a pleasure in improving himself in everything that is worthy
of
praise.  He rises early in the morning, makes himself clean and
decent,
and says his prayers.  He loves to hear good advice, is thankful to
those who give it and always follows it.  He never swears[17] or
calls
names or uses ill words to companions.  He is never peevish and
fretful,
always cheerful and good-tempered.

7.  <i>Stories of exaggerated and coarse fun</i>.  In the chapter on
the
positive side of this subject I shall speak more in detail of the
educational value of robust and virile representation of fun and of
sheer nonsense, but as a preparation to these statements, I should
like
to strike a note of warning against the element of exaggerated and
coarse fun being encouraged in our school stories, partly, because
of
the lack of humor in such presentations (a natural product of
stifling
imagination) and partly, because the strain of the abnormal has the
same
effect as the too frequent use of the melodramatic.

<p>
In an article in <i>Macmillans's Magazine</i>, December, 1869, Miss
Yonge writes:

<p>
"A taste for buffoonery is much to be discouraged, an exclusive
taste
for extravagance most unwholesome and even perverting.  It becomes
destructive of reverence and soon degenerates into coarseness.  It
permits nothing poetical or imaginative, nothing sweet or pathetic
to
exist, and there is a certain self-satisfaction and superiority in
making game of what others regard with enthusiasm and sentiment
which
absolutely bars the way against a higher or softer tone."

<p>
Although these words were written nearly half a century ago, they
are
so specially applicable today that they seem quite "up-to-date."
Indeed, I think they will hold equally good fifty years hence.

<p>
In spite of a strong taste on the part of children for what is ugly
and
brutal, I am sure that we ought to eliminate this element as far as
possible from the school stories, especially among poor children.
Not
because I think children should be protected from all knowledge of
evil,
but because so much of this knowledge comes into their life outside
school that we can well afford to ignore it during school hours.  At
the
same time, however, as I shall show by example when I come to the
positive side, it would be well to show children by story
illustration
the difference between brutal ugliness without anything to redeem it
and
surface ugliness, which may be only a veil over the beauty that lies
underneath.  It might be possible, for instance, to show children
the
difference between the real ugliness in the priest's face of the
"Laocoon" group, because of the motive of courage and endurance
behind
the suffering.  Many stories in everyday life could be found to
illustrate this.

<p>
8.  <i>Stories of infant piety and death-bed scenes</i>.  The
stories
for children forty years ago contained much of this element, and the
following examples will illustrate this point:

<p>
Notes from poems written by a child between six and eight years of
age,
by name Philip Freeman, afterwards Archdeacon of Exeter:</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Poor Robin, thou canst fly no more,<br>
Thy joys and sorrows all are o'er.<br>
Through Life's tempestuous storms thou'st trod,<br>
But now art sunk beneath the sod.<br>
Here lost and gone poor Robin lies,<br>
He trembles, lingers, falls and dies.<br>
He's gone, he's gone, forever lost,<br>
No more of him they now can boast.<br>
Poor Robin's dangers all are past,<br>
He struggled to the very last.<br>
Perhaps he spent a happy Life,<br>
Without much struggle and much strife.[18]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The prolonged gloom of the main theme is somewhat lightened by the
speculative optimism of the last verse.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
Life, transient Life, is but a dream,<br>
Like Sleep which short doth lengthened seem<br>
Till dawn of day, when the bird's lay<br>
Doth charm the soul's first peeping gleam.</p>

<p>
Then farewell to the parting year,<br>
Another's come to Nature dear.<br>
In every place, thy brightening face<br>
Does welcome winter's snowy drear.</p>

<p>
Alas! our time is much mis-spent.<br>
Then we must haste and now repent.<br>
We have a book in which to look,<br>
For we on Wisdom should be bent.</p>

<p>
Should God, the Almighty, King of all,<br>
Before His judgment-seat now call<br>
Us to that place of Joy and Grace<br>
Prepared for us since Adam's fall.</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
I think there is no doubt that we have made considerable progress in
this matter.  Not only do we refrain from telling these highly moral
(<I
>sic</i>) stories but we have reached the point of parodying them,
in
sign of ridicule, as, for instance, in such writing as Belloc's
"Cautionary Tales."  These would be a trifle too grim for a timid
child,
but excellent fun for adults.

<p>
It should be our study today to prove to children that the immediate
importance to them is not to think of dying and going to Heaven, but
of
living and&mdash;shall we say?&mdash;of going to college, which is a
far
better preparation for the life to come than the morbid dwelling
upon
the possibility of an early death.

<p>
In an article signed "Muriel Harris," I think, from a copy of the <i
>
Tribune</i>, appeared a delightful article on Sunday books, from
which I
quote the following:

<p>
"All very good little children died young in the storybooks, so that
unusual goodness must have been the source of considerable anxiety
to
affectionate parents.  I came across a little old book the other day
called 'Examples for Youth.'  On the yellow fly-leaf was written, in
childish, carefully-sloping hand: 'Presented to Mary Palmer Junior,
by
her sister, to be read on Sundays,' and was dated 1828.  The
accounts
are taken from a work on "Piety Promoted,' and all of them begin
with
unusual piety in early youth and end with the death-bed of the
little
paragon, and his or her dying words."

<p>
9.  <i>Stories containing a mixture of fairy tale and science</i>.
By
this combination one loses what is essential to each, namely, the
fantastic on the one side, and accuracy on the other.  The true
fairy
tale should be unhampered by any compromise of probability even; the
scientific representation should be sufficiently marvelous along its
own
lines to need no supernatural aid.  Both appeal to the imagination
in
different ways.

<p>
As an exception to this kind of mixture, I should quote "The Honey
Bee,
and Other Stories," translated from the Danish of Evald by C. G.
Moore
Smith.  There is a certain robustness in these stories dealing with
the
inexorable laws of Nature.  Some of them will appear hard to the
child
but they will be of interest to all teachers.

<p>
Perhaps the worst element in the choice of stories is that which
insists
upon the moral detaching itself and explaining the story.  In "Alice
in
Wonderland" the Duchess says, "'And the moral of <i>that</i> is:
Take
care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves.' "How
fond she is of finding morals in things," thought Alice to herself."
(This gives the point of view of the child.)

<p>
The following is a case in point, found in a rare old print in the
British Museum:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Jane S. came home with her clothes soiled and hands badly torn.
"Where have you been?" asked her mother.

<p>
"I fell down the bank near the mill," said Jane, "and I should have
been
drowned, if Mr. M. had not seen me and pulled me out."

<p>
"Why did you go so near the edge of the brink?"

<p>
"There was a pretty flower there that I wanted, and I only meant to
take
one step, but I slipped and fell down.

<p>
<i>Moral:</i> Young people often take but one step in sinful
indulgence
[Poor Jane!], but they fall into soul-destroying sins.  They can do
it
by a single act of sin.  [The heinous act of picking a flower!] They
do
it; but the act leads to another, and they fall into the gulf of
Perdition, unless God interposes.</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Now, quite apart from the folly of this story we must condemn it on
moral grounds.  Could we imagine a lower standard of a Deity than
that
presented here to the child?

<p>
Today the teacher would commend Jane for a laudable interest in
botany,
but might add a word of caution about choosing inclined planes in
the
close neighborhood of a body of running water as a hunting ground
for
specimens and a popular, lucid explanation of the inexorable law of
gravity.

<p>
Here we have an instance of applying a moral when we have finished
our
story, but there are many stories where nothing is left to chance in
this matter and where there is no means for the child to use
ingenuity
or imagination in making out the meaning for himself.

<p>
Henry Morley has condemned the use of this method as applied to
fairy
stories.  He says: "Moralizing in a fairy story is like the snoring
of<I
>Bottom</i> in <i>Titania's</i> lap."

<p>
But I think this applies to all stories, and most especially to
those by
which we do wish to teach something.

<p>
John Burroughs says in his article, "Thou Shalt Not Preach":[19]

<p>
"Didactic fiction can never rank high.  Thou shalt not preach or
teach;
thou shalt portray and create, and have ends as universal as nature.
. .
. What Art demands is that the artist's personal convictions and
notions, his likes and dislikes, do not obtrude themselves at all;
that
good and evil stand judged in his work by the logic of events, as
they
do in nature, and not by any special pleading on his part.  He does
non
hold a brief for either side; he exemplifies the working of the
creative
energy. . . . The great artist works <i>in</i> and <i>through</i>
and <I
>from</i> moral ideas; his works are indirectly a criticism of life.
He
is moral without having a moral.  The moment a moral obtrudes
itself,
that moment he begins to fall from grace as an artist. . . . The
great
distinction of Art is that it aims to see life steadily and to see
it
whole. . . . It affords the one point of view whence the world
appears
harmonious and complete."

<p>
It would seem, then, from this passage, that it is of <i>moral</i>
importance to put things dramatically.</p>

<p>
In Froebel's "Mother Play" he demonstrates the educational value of
stories, emphasizing that their highest use consists in their
ability to
enable the child, through <i>suggestion,</i> to form a pure and
noble
idea of what a man may be or do.  The sensitiveness of a child's
mind is
offended if the moral is forced upon him, but if he absorbs it
unconsciously, he has received its influence for all time.

<p>
To me the idea of pointing out the moral of the story has always
seemed
as futile as tying a flower on a stalk instead of letting the flower
grow out of the stalk, as Nature has intended.  In the first case,
the
flower, showy and bright for the moment, soon fades away.  In the
second
instance, it develops slowly, coming to perfection in fullness of
time
because of the life within.

<p>
Lastly, the element to avoid is that which rouses emotions which
cannot
be translated into action.

<p>
Mr. Earl Barnes, to whom all teachers owe a debt of gratitude for
the
inspiration of his educational views, insists strongly on this
point.
The sole effect of such stories is to produce a form of hysteria,
fortunately short-lived, but a waste of force which might be
directed
into a better channel.[20]  Such stories are so easy to recognize
that
it would be useless to make a formal list, but I make further
allusion
to them, in dealing with stories from the lives of the saints.

<p>
These, then, are the main elements to avoid in the selection of
material
suitable for normal children.  Much might be added in the way of
detail,
and the special tendency of the day may make it necessary to avoid
one
class of story more than another, but this care belongs to another
generation of teachers and parents.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align=center><a name="chapV">CHAPTER V</a></h4>
<h4 align=center>ELEMENTS TO SEEK IN CHOICE OF MATERIAL</h4>

<p>
In his "Choice of Books," Frederic Harrison has said: "The most
useful
help to reading is to know what we shall <i>not</i> read, what we
shall
keep from that small, cleared spot in the overgrown jungle of
information which we can call our ordered patch of fruit-bearing
knowledge."

<p>
Now, the same statement applies to our stories, and, having busied
myself during the last chapter with "clearing my small spot" by
cutting
away a mass of unfruitful growth, I am no going to suggest what
would be
the best kind of seed to sow in the patch which I have "reclaimed
from
the jungle."

<p>
Again, I repeat, I have no wish to be dogmatic and in offering
suggestions as to the stories to be told, I am catering only for a
group
of normal school children.  My list of subjects does not pretend to
cover the whole ground of children's needs, and just as I exclude
the
abnormal or unusual child from the scope of my warning in subjects
to
avoid, so do I also exclude that child from the limitation in choice
of
subjects to be sought, because you can offer almost any subject to
the
unusual child, especially if you stand in close relation to him and
know
his powers of apprehension.  In this matter, age has very little to
say;
it is a question of the stage of development.

<p>
Experience has taught me that for the group of normal children,
irrespective of age, the first kind of story suitable for them will
contain an appeal to conditions to which the child is accustomed.
The
reason for this is obvious: the child, having limited experience,
can
only be reached by this experience, until his imagination is
awakened
and he is enabled to grasp through this faculty what he has not
actually
passed through.  Before this awakening has taken place he enters the
realm of fiction, represented in the story, by comparison with his
personal experience.  Every story and every point in the story mean
more
as that experience widens, and the interest varies, of course, with
temperament, quickness of perception, power of visualizing and of
concentration.

<p>
In "The Marsh King's Daughter," Hans Christian Andersen says:

<p>
"The storks have a great many stories which they tell their little
ones,
all about the bogs and marshes.  They suit them to their age and
capacity.  The young ones are quite satisfied with <i>kribble,
krabble,
</i> or some such nonsense, and find it charming; but the elder ones
want something with more meaning."

<p>
One of the most interesting experiments to be made in connection
with
this subject is to tell the same story at intervals of a year or six
months to an individual child.[21]  The different incidents in the
story
which appeal to him (and one must watch it closely, to be sure the
interest is real and not artificially stimulated by any suggestion
on
one's own part) will mark his mental development and the gradual
awakening of his imagination.  This experiment is a very delicate
one
and will not be infallible, because children are secretive and the
appreciation is often simulated (unconsciously) or concealed through
shyness or want of articulation.  But it is, in spite of this, a
deeply
interesting and helpful experiment.

<p>
To take a concrete example: Let us suppose the story Andersen's "Tin
Soldier" told to a child of five or six years.  At the first
recital,
the point which will interest the child most will be the setting up
of
the tin soldiers on the table, because he can understand this by
means
of his own experience, in his own nursery.  It is an appeal to
conditions to which he is accustomed and for which no exercise of
the
imagination is needed, unless we take the effect of memory to be,
according to Queyrat, retrospective imagination.

<p>
The next incident that appeals is the unfamiliar behavior of the
toys,
but still in familiar surroundings; that is to say, the <i>unusual
</i>
activities are carried on in the safe precincts of the nursery
&mdash;the
<i>usual</i> atmosphere of the child.

<p>
I quote from the text:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Late in the evening the other soldiers were put in their box, and
the
people of the house went to bed.  Now was the time for the toys to
play;
they amused themselves with paying visits, fighting battles and
giving
balls.  The tin soldiers rustled about in their box, for they wanted
to
join the games, but they could not get the lid off.  The nut-
crackers
turned somersaults, and the pencil scribbled nonsense on the slate.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Now, from this point onwards in the story, the events will be quite
outside the personal experience of the child and there will have to
be a
real stretch of imagination to appreciate the thrilling and blood-
curdling adventures of the tin soldier, namely, the terrible sailing
down the gutter under the bridge, the meeting with the fierce rat
who
demands the soldier's passport, the horrible sensation in the fish's
body, etc.  Last of all, perhaps, will come the appreciation of the
best
qualities of the hero: his modesty, his dignity, his reticence, his
courage and his constancy.  He seems to combine all the qualities of
the
best soldier with those of the best civilian, without the more
obvious
qualities which generally attract first.  As for the love story, we
must
<i>expect</i> any child to see its tenderness and beauty, though the
individual child may intuitively appreciate these qualities, but it
is
not what we wish for or work for at this period of child life.

<p>
This method could be applied to various stories.  I have chosen the
"Tin
Soldier" because of its dramatic qualities and because it is marked
off,
probably quite unconsciously on the part of Andersen, into periods
which
correspond to the child's development.

<p>
In Eugene Field's exquisite little poem of "The Dinkey Bird," we
find
the objects familiar to the child in <i>unusual</i> places, so that
some
imagination is needed to realize that "big red sugar-plums are
clinging
to the cliffs beside the sea"; but the introduction of the fantastic
bird and the soothing sound of amfalula tree are new and delightful
sensations, quite out of the child's personal experience.

<p>
Another such instance is to be found in Mrs. W. K. Clifford's story
of
"Master Willie."  The abnormal behavior of familiar objects, such as
a
doll, leads from the ordinary routine to the paths of adventure.
This
story is to be found in a little book called "Very Short Stories," a
most interesting collection for teachers and children.

<p>
We now come to the second element we should seek in material,
namely,
the element of the unusual, which we have already anticipated in the
story of the "Tin Soldier."

<p>
This element is necessary in response to the demand of the child who
expressed the needs of his fellow-playmates when he said: "I want to
go
to the place where the shadows are real."  This is the true
definition
of "faerie" lands and is the first sign of real mental development
in
the child when he is no longer content with the stories of his own
little deeds and experiences, when his ear begins to appreciate
sounds
different from the words in his own everyday language, and when he
begins to separate his own personality from the action of the story.

<p>
George Goschen says:

<p>
"What I want for the young are books and stories which do not simply
deal with our daily life.  I like the fancy even of little children
to
have some larger food than images of their own little lives, and I
confess I am sorry for the children whose imaginations are not
sometimes
stimulated by beautiful fairy tales which carry them to worlds
different
from those in which their future will be passed. . . . I hold that
what
removes them more or less from their daily life is better than what
reminds them of it at every step."[22]

<p>
It is because of the great value of leading children to something
beyond
the limited circle of their own lives that I deplore the twaddling
boarding-school stories written for girls and the artificially
prepared
public school stories for boys.  Why not give them the dramatic
interest
of a larger stage?  No account of a cricket match or a football
triumph
could present a finer appeal to boys and girls than the description
of
the Peacestead in the "Heroes of Asgaard":

<p>
"This was the playground of the &AElig;sir, where they practiced
trials
of skill one with another and held tournaments and sham fights.
These
last were always conducted in the gentlest and most honorable
manner;
for the strongest law of the Peacestead was that no angry blow
should be
struck or spiteful word spoken upon the sacred field."

<p>
For my part, I would unhesitatingly give to boys and girls an
element of
strong romance in the stories which are told them even before they
are
twelve.

<p>
Miss Sewell says:

<p>
"The system that keeps girls in the schoolroom reading simple
stories,
without reading Scott and Shakespeare and Spenser, and then hands
them
over to the unexplored recesses of the Circulating Library, has been
shown to be the most frivolizing that can be devised."  She sets
forth
as the result of her experience that a good novel, especially a
romantic
one, read at twelve or fourteen, is really a beneficial thing.

<p>
At present, so many of the children from the elementary schools get
their first idea of love, if one can give it such a name from vulgar
pictures displayed in the shop windows or jokes on marriage, culled
from
the lowest type of paper, or the proceedings of a divorce court.

<p>
What an antidote to such representation might be found in the
stories of
Hector and Andromache, Siegfried and Br&uuml;nnehilde, Dido and
&AElig;
neas, Orpheus and Eurydice, St. Francis and St. Clare!

<p>
One of the strongest elements we should introduce into our stories
for
children of all ages is that which calls forth love of beauty.  And
the
beauty should stand out, not only in the delineation of noble
qualities
in our heroes and heroines, but in the beauty and strength of
language
and form.

<p>
In this latter respect, the Bible stories are of such inestimable
value;
all the greater because a child is familiar with the subject and the
stories gain fresh significance from the spoken or winged word as
compared with the mere reading.  As to whether we should keep to the
actual text is a matter of individual experience.  Professor R. G.
Moulton, whose interpretations of the Bible stories are so well
known
both in England and America, does not always confine himself to the
actual text, but draws the dramatic elements together, rejecting
what
seems to him to break the narrative, but introducing the actual
language
where it is the most effective.  Those who have heard him will
realize
the success of his method.

<p>
There is one Bible story which can be told with scarcely any
deviation
from the text, if only a few hints are given beforehand, and that is
the
story of Nebuchadnezzar and the Golden Image.  Thus, I think it
wise, if
the children are to succeed in partially visualizing the story, that
they should have some idea of the dimensions of the Golden Image as
it
would stand out in a vast plain.  It might be well to compare those
dimension with some building with which the child is familiar.  In
London, the matter is easy as the height will compare, roughly
speaking,
with Westminster Abbey.  The only change in text I should adopt is
to
avoid the constant enumeration of the list of rulers and the musical
instruments.  In doing this, I am aware that I am sacrificing
something
of beauty in the rhythm, but, on the other hand, for narrative
purpose
the interest is not broken.  The first time the announcement is
made,
that is, by the Herald, it should be in a perfectly loud, clear and
toneless voice, such as you would naturally use when shouting
through a
trumpet to a vast concourse of people scattered over a wide plain,
reserving all the dramatic tone of voice for the passage where
Nebuchadnezzar is making the announcement to the three men by
themselves.  I can remember Professor Moulton saying that all the
dramatic interest of the story is summed up in the words "But if not
. .
."  This suggestion is a very helpful one, for it enables us to work
up
gradually to this point, and then, as it were, <i>unwind,</i> until
we
reach the words of Nebuchadnezzar's dramatic recantation.

<p>
In this connection, it is a good plan occasionally during the story
hour
to introduce really good poetry, which delivered in a dramatic
manner
(far removed, of course, from the melodramatic), might give children
their first love of beautiful form in verse.  And I do not think it
necessary to wait for this.  Even the normal child of seven, though
there is nothing arbitrary in the suggestion of this age, will
appreciate the effect, if only on the ear, of beautiful lines well
spoken.  Mahomet has said, in his teaching advice: "Teach your
children
poetry: it opens the mind, lends grace to wisdom and makes heroic
virtues hereditary."

<p>
To begin with the youngest children of all, here is a poem which
contains a thread of story, just enough to give a human interest:</p
>

<P align=center>MILKING-TIME</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When the cows come home, the milk is coming;<br>
Honey's made when the bees are humming.<br>
Duck, drake on the rushy lake,<br>
And the deer live safe in the breezy brake,<br>
And timid, funny, pert little bunny<br>
Winks his nose, and sits all sunny.&mdash;CHRISTINA ROSSETTI.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Now, in comparing this poem with some of the doggerel verse offered
to
small children, one is struck with the literary superiority in the
choice of words.  Here, in spite of the simplicity of the poem,
there is
not the ordinary limited vocabulary, nor the forced rhyme, nor the
application of a moral, by which the artist falls from grace.

<p>
Again, Eugene Field's "Hushaby Lady," of which the language is most
simple, yet the child is carried away by the beauty of the sound.

<p>
I remember hearing some poetry repeated by the children in one of
the
elementary schools in Sheffield which made me feel that they had
realized romantic possibilities which would prevent their lives from
ever becoming quite prosaic again, and I wish that this practice
were
more usual.  There is little difficulty with the children.  I can
remember, in my own experience as a teacher in London, making the
experiment of reading or repeating passages from Milton and
Shakespeare
to children from nine to eleven years of age, and the enthusiastic
way
they responded by learning those passages by heart.  I have taken
with
several sets of children such passages from Milton as the "Echo
Song,"
"Sabrina," "By the Rushy-fringed Bank," "Back, Shepherds, Back,"
from
"Comus"; "May Morning," "Ode to Shakespeare," "Samson," "On His
Blindness," etc.  I even ventured on several passage from "Paradise
Lost," and found "Now came still evening on" a particular favorite
with
the children.

<p>
It seemed even easier to interest them in Shakespeare, and they
learned
quite readily and easily many passages from "As You Like It," "The
Merchant of Venice," "Julius C&aelig;sar," "Richard II," "Henry IV,"
and
"Henry V."

<p>
The method I should recommend in the introduction of both poets
occasionally into the story-hour would be threefold.  First, to
choose
passages which appeal for beauty of sound or beauty of mental vision
called up by those sounds; such as "Tell me where is Fancy bred,"
"Titania's Lullaby," "How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this
bank."
Secondly, passages for sheer interest of content, such as the Trial
Scene from "The Merchant of Venice," or the Forest Scene in "As You
Like
It."  Thirdly, for dramatic and historical interest, such as, "Men
at
some time are masters of their fates," the whole of Mark Antony's
speech, and the scene with Imogen and her foster brothers in the
Forest.

<p>
It may not be wholly out of place to add here that the children
learned
and repeated these passages themselves, and that I offered them the
same
advice as I do to all story-tellers.  I discussed quite openly with
them
the method I considered best, trying to make them see that
simplicity of
delivery was not only the most beautiful but the most effective
means to
use and, by the end of a few months, when they had been allowed to
experiment and express themselves, they began to see that mere
ranting
was not force and that a sense of reserve power is infinitely more
impressive and inspiring than mere external presentation.

<p>
I encouraged them to criticize each other for the common good, and
sometimes I read a few lines with overemphasis and too much gesture,
which they were at liberty to point out that they might avoid the
same
error.

<p>
Excellent collections of poems for this purpose of narrative are:
Mrs. P. A. Barnett's series of "Song and Story," published by Adam
Black, and "The Posy Ring," chosen and classified by Kate Douglas
Wiggin
and Nora Archibald Smith, published by Doubleday.  For older
children,
"The Call of the Homeland," selected and arranged by Dr. R. P. Scott
and
Katharine T. Wallas, published by Houghton, Mifflin, and "Golden
Numbers," chosen and classified by Kate Douglas Wiggin and Nora
Archibald Smith, published by Doubleday.

<p>
I think it is well to have a goodly number of stories illustrating
the
importance of common-sense and resourcefulness.

<p>
For this reason, I consider the stories treating of the ultimate
success
of the youngest son[23] very admirable for the purpose, because the
youngest child who begins by being considered inferior to the older
ones
triumphs in the end, either from resourcefulness or from common-
sense or
from some higher quality, such as kindness to animals, courage in
overcoming difficulties, etc.[24]

<p>
Thus, we have the story of Cinderella.  The cynic might imagine that
it
was the diminutive size of her foot that insured her success.  The
child
does not realize any advantage in this, but, though the matter need
not
be pressed, the story leaves us with the impression that Cinderella
had
been patient and industrious, and forbearing with her sisters.  We
know
that she was strictly obedient to her godmother, and in order to be
this
she makes her dramatic exit from the ball which is the beginning of
her
triumph.  There are many who might say that these qualities do not
meet
with reward in life and that they end in establishing a habit of
drudgery, but, after all, we must have poetic justice in a fairy
story,
occasionally, at any rate, even if the child is confused by the
apparent
contradiction.

<p>
Such a story is "Jesper and the Hares."  Here, however, it is not at
first resourcefulness that helps the hero, but sheer kindness of
heart,
which prompts him first to help the ants, and then to show civility
to
the old woman, without for a moment expecting any material benefit
from
such actions.  At the end, he does win on his own ingenuity and
resourcefulness, and if we regret that his trickery has such
wonderful
results, we must remember the aim was to win the princess for
herself,
and that there was little choice left him.  I consider that the end
of
this story is one of the most remarkable I have found in my long
years
of browsing among fairy tales.  I should suggest stopping at the
words:
"The Tub is full," as any addition seems to destroy the subtlety of
the
story.[25]

<p>
Another story of this kind, admirable for children from six years
and
upwards, is, "What the Old Man Does is Always Right."  Here,
perhaps,
the entire lack of common-sense on the part of the hero would serve
rather as a warning than a stimulating example, but the conduct of
the
wife in excusing the errors of her foolish husband is a model of
resourcefulness.

<p>
In the story of "Hereafter-this,"[26] we have just the converse: a
perfectly foolish wife shielded by a most patient and forbearing
husband, whose tolerance and common-sense save the situation.

<p>
One of the most important elements to seek in our choice of stories
is
that which tends to develop, eventually, a fine sense of humor in a
child.  I purposely use the word, "eventually," because I realize,
first, that humor has various stages, and that seldom, if ever, can
one
expect an appreciation of fine humor from a normal child, that is,
from
an elemental mind.  It seems as if the rough-and-tumble element were
almost a necessary stage through which children must pass, and which
is
a normal and healthy stage; but up to now we have quite
unnecessarily
extended the period of elephantine fun, and, though we cannot
control
the manner in which children are catered to along this line in their
homes, we can restrict the folly of appealing too strongly or too
long
to this elemental faculty in our schools.  Of course, the temptation
is
strong because the appeal is so easy, but there is a tacit
recognition
that horseplay and practical jokes are no longer considered as an
essential part of a child's education.  We note this in the changed
attitude in the schools, taken by more advanced educators, towards
bullying, fagging, hazing, etc.  As a reaction, then, from more
obvious
fun, there should be a certain number of stories which make appeal
to a
more subtle element, and in the chapter on the questions put to me
by
teachers on various occasions I speak more in detail as to the
educational value of a finer humor in our stories.

<p>
At some period there ought to be presented in our stories the
superstitions connected with the primitive history of the race,
dealing
with the fairy proper, giants, dwarfs, gnomes, nixies, brownies and
other elemental beings.  Andrew Lang says: "Without our savage
ancestors
we should have had no poetry.  Conceive the human race born into the
world in its present advanced condition, weighing, analyzing,
examining
everything.  Such a race would have been destitute of poetry and
flattened by common-sense.  Barbarians did the <i>dreaming</i> of
the
world."

<p>
But it is a question of much debate among educators as to what
should be
the period of the child's life in which these stories are to be
presented.  I, myself, was formerly of the opinion that they
belonged to
the very primitive age of the individual, just as they belong to the
primitive age of the race, but experience in telling stories has
taught
me to compromise.

<p>
Some people maintain that little children, who take things with
brutal
logic, ought not to be allowed the fairy tale in its more limited
form
of the supernatural; whereas, if presented to older children, this
material can be criticized, catalogued and (alas!) rejected as
worthless, or retained with flippant toleration.

<p>
While realizing a certain value in this point of view, I am bound to
admit that if we regulate our stories entirely on this basis, we
lose
the real value of the fairy tale element.  It is the one element
which
causes little children to <i>wonder,</i> simply because no
scientific
analysis of the story can be presented to them.  It is somewhat
heartrending to feel that "Jack and the Bean Stalk" and stories of
that
ilk are to be handed over to the critical youth who will condemn the
quick growth of the tree as being contrary to the order of nature,
and
wonder why <i>Jack</i> was not playing football on the school team
instead of climbing trees in search of imaginary adventures.

<p>
A wonderful plea for the telling of early superstitions to children
is
to be found in an old Indian allegory called, "The Blazing Mansion."

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
An old man owned a large rambling Mansion.  The pillars were rotten,
the
galleries tumbling down, the thatch dry and combustible, and there
was
only one door.  Suddenly, one day, there was a smell of fire: the
old
man rushed out.  To his horror he saw that the thatch was aflame,
the
rotten pillars were catching fire one by one, and the rafters were
burning like tinder.  But, inside, the children went on amusing
themselves quite happily.  The distracted Father said: "I will run
in
and save my children.  I will seize them in my strong arms, I will
bear
them harmless through the falling rafters and the blazing beams."
Then
the sad thought came to him that the children were romping and
ignorant.
"If I say the house is on fire, they will not understand me.  If I
try
to seize them, they will romp about and try to escape.  Alas! not a
moment to be lost!"  Suddenly a bright thought flashed across the
old
man's mind.  "My children are ignorant," he said; "they love toys
and
glittering playthings.  I will promise them playthings of unheard-of
beauty.  Then they will listen."</p>

<p>
So the old man shouted: "Children, come out of the house and see
these
beautiful toys!  Chariots with white oxen, all gold and tinsel.  See
these exquisite little antelopes.  Whoever saw such goats as these?
Children, children come quickly, or they will all be gone!"</p>

<p>
Forth from the blazing ruin the children came in hot haste.  The
word,
"plaything," was almost the only word they could understand.</p>

<p>
Then the Father, rejoiced that his offspring were freed from peril,
procured for them one of the most beautiful chariots ever seen.  The
chariot had a canopy like a pagoda; it had tiny rails and
balustrades
and rows of jingling bells.  Milk-white oxen drew the chariot.  The
children were astonished when they were placed inside.[27]</p>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Perhaps, as a compromise, one might give the gentler superstitions
to
very small children, and leave such a blood-curdling story as
"Bluebeard" to a more robust age.

<p>
There is one modern method which has always seemed to me much to be
condemned, and that is the habit of changing the end of a story, for
fear of alarming the child.  This is quite indefensible.  In doing
this
we are tampering with folklore and confusing stages of development.

<p>
Now, I know that there are individual children that, at a tender
age,
might be alarmed at such a story, for instance, as "Little Red
Riding-
Hood"; in which case, it is better to sacrifice the "wonder stage"
and
present the story later on.

<p>
I live in dread of finding one day a bowdlerized form of
"Bluebeard,"
prepared for a junior standard, in which, to produce a satisfactory
finale, all the wives come to life again, and "live happily ever
after"
with Bluebeard and each other!

<p>
And from this point it seems an easy transition to the subject of
legends of different kinds.  Some of the old country legends in
connection with flowers are very charming for children, and so long
as
we do not tread on the sacred ground of the nature students, we may
indulge in a moderate use of such stories, of which a few will be
found
in the List of Stories, given later.

<p>
With regard to the introduction of legends connected with saints
into
the school curriculum, my chief plea is the element of the unusual
which
they contain and an appeal to a sense of mysticism and wonder which
is a
wise antidote to the prosaic and commercial tendencies of today.
Though
many of the actions of the saints may be the result of a morbid
strain
of self-sacrifice, at least none of them was engaged in the sole
occupation of becoming rich: their ideals were often lofty and
unselfish; their courage high, and their deeds noble.  We must be
careful, in the choice of our legends, to show up the virile
qualities
rather than to dwell on the elements of horror in details of
martyrdom,
or on the too-constantly recurring miracles, lest we should defeat
our
own ends.  For the children might think lightly of the dangers to
which
the saints were exposed if they found them too often preserved at
the
last moment from the punishment they were brave enough to undergo.
For
one or another of these reasons, I should avoid the detailed history
of
St. Juliana, St. Vincent, St. Quintin, St. Eustace, St. Winifred,
St.
Theodore, St. James the More, St. Katharine, St. Cuthbert, St.
Alphage,
St. Peter of Milan, St. Quirine and Juliet, St. Alban and others.

<p>
The danger of telling stories connected with sudden conversions is
that
they are apt to place too much emphasis on the process, rather than
on
the goal to be reached.  We should always insist on the splendid
deeds
performed after a real conversion, not the details of the conversion
itself; as, for instance, the beautiful and poetical work done by
St.
Christopher when he realized what work he could do most effectively.

<p>
On the other hand, there are many stories of the saints dealing with
actions and motives which would appeal to the imagination and are
not
only worthy of imitation, but are not wholly outside the life and
experience even of the child.[28]

<p>
Having protested against the elephantine joke and the too-frequent
use
of exaggerated fun, I now endeavor to restore the balance by
suggesting
the introduction into the school curriculum of a few purely
grotesque
stories which serve as an antidote to sentimentality or
utilitarianism.
But they must be presented as nonsense, so that the children may use
them for what they are intended as&mdash;pure relaxation.  Such a
story
is that of "The Wolf and the Kids," which I present in my own
version at
the end of the book.  I have had serious objections offered to this
story by several educational people, because of the revenge taken by
the
goat on the wolf, but I am inclined to think that if the story is to
be
taken as anything but sheer nonsense, it is surely sentimental to
extend
our sympathy toward a caller who has devoured six of his hostess'
children.  With regard to the wolf being cut open, there is not the
slightest need to accentuate the physical side.  Children accept the
deed as they accept the cutting off of a giant's head, because they
do
not associate it with pain, especially if the deed is presented half
humorously.  The moment in the story where their sympathy is aroused
is
the swallowing of the kids, because the children do realize the
possibility of being disposed of in the mother's absence.  (Needless
to
say, I never point out the moral of the kids' disobedience to the
mother
in opening the door.)  I have always noticed a moment of
breathlessness
even in a grown-up audience when the wolf swallows the kids, and
that
the recovery of them "all safe and sound, all huddled together" is
quite
as much appreciated by the adult audience as by the children, and is
worth the tremor caused by the wolf's summary action.

<p>
I have not always been able to impress upon the teachers the fact
that
this story <i>must</i> be taken lightly.  A very earnest young
student
came to me once after the telling of this story and said in an awe-
struck voice: "Do you cor-relate?"  Having recovered from the effect
of
this word, which she carefully explained, I said that, as a rule, I
preferred to keep the story quite apart from the other lessons, just
an
undivided whole, because it had effects of its own which were best
brought about by not being connected with other lessons.  She
frowned
her disapproval and said: "I am sorry, because I thought I would
take
the Goat for my nature study lesson and then tell your story at the
end."  I thought of the terrible struggle in the child's mind
between
his conscientious wish to be accurate and his dramatic enjoyment of
the
abnormal habits of a goat who went out with scissors, needle and
thread;
but I have been most careful since to repudiate any connection with
nature study in this and a few other stories in my r&eacute;
pertoire.

<p>
One might occasionally introduce one of Edward Lear's "Nonsense
Rhymes."
For instance:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There was an Old Man of Cape Horn<br>
Who wished he had never been born.<br>
So he sat in a chair<br>
Till he died of despair,<br>
That dolorous Old Man of Cape Horn.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Now, except in case of very young children, this could not possibly
be
taken seriously.  The least observant normal boy or girl would
recognize
the hollowness of the pessimism that prevents an old man from at
least
an attempt to rise from his chair.

<p>
The following I have chosen as repeated with intense appreciation
and
much dramatic vigor by a little boy just five years old:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There was an old man who said: "Hush!<br>
I perceive a young bird in that bush."<br>
When they said: "Is it small?"<br>
He replied, "Not at all.<br>
It is four times as large as the bush."[29]
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
One of the most desirable of all elements to introduce into our
stories
is that which encourages kinship with animals.  With very young
children
this is easy, because during those early years when the mind is not
clogged with knowledge, the sympathetic imagination enables them to
enter into the feeling of animals.  Andersen has an illustration of
this point in his "Ice Maiden":

<p>
"Children who cannot talk yet can understand the language of fowls
and
ducks quite well, and cats and dogs speak to them quite as plainly
as
Father and Mother; but that is only when the children are very
small,
and then even Grandpapa's stick will become a perfect horse to them
that
can neigh and, in their eyes, is furnished with legs and a tail.
With
some children this period ends later than with others, and of such
we
are accustomed to say that they are very backward, and that they
have
remained children for a long time.  People are in the habit of
saying
strange things."

<p>
Felix Adler says:

<p>
"Perhaps the chief attraction of fairy tales is due to their
representing the child as living in brotherly friendship with nature
and
all creatures.  Trees, flowers, animals, wild and tame, even the
stars
are represented as comrades of children.  That animals are only
human beings in disguise is an axiom in the fairy tales.  Animals
are
humanized, that is, the kinship between animal and human life is
still
keenly felt, and this reminds us of those early animistic
interpretations of nature which subsequently led to doctrines of
metempsychosis."[30]

<p>
I think that beyond question the finest animal stories are to be
found
in the Indian collections, of which I furnish a list in the last
chapter.

<p>
With regard to the development of the love of Nature through the
telling
of stories, we are confronted with a great difficulty in the
elementary
schools because so many of the children have never been out of the
towns, have never seen a daisy, a blade of grass and scarcely a
tree, so
that in giving, in the form of a story, a beautiful description of
scenery, you can make no appeal to the retrospective imagination,
and
only the rarely gifted child well be able to make pictures while
listening to a style which is beyond his everyday use.
Nevertheless,
once in a while, when the children are in a quiet mood, not eager
for
action but able to give themselves up to the pure joy of sound, then
it
is possible to give them a beautiful piece of writing in praise of
Nature, such as the following, taken from "The Divine Adventure," by
Fiona Macleod:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then he remembered the ancient wisdom of the Gael and came out of
the
Forest Chapel and went into the woods.  He put his lip to the earth,
and
lifted a green leaf to his brow, and held a branch to his ear; and
because he was no longer heavy with the sweet clay of mortality,
though
yet of human clan, he heard that which we do not hear, and saw that
which we do not see, and knew that which we do not know.  All the
green
life was his.  In that new world he saw the lives of trees, now pale
green, now of woodsmoke blue, now of amethyst; the gray lives of
stone;
breaths of the grass and reed, creatures of the air, delicate and
wild
as fawns, or swift and fierce and terrible tigers of that
undiscovered
wilderness, with birds almost invisible but for their luminous
wings,
and opalescent crests.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
The value of this particular passage is the mystery pervading the
whole
picture, which forms so beautiful an antidote to the eternal
explaining
of things.  I think it of the highest importance for the children to
realize that the best and most beautiful things cannot be expressed
in
everyday language and that they must content themselves with a flash
here and there of the beauty which may come later.  One does not
enhance
the beauty of the mountain by pulling to pieces some of the earthy
clogs; one does not increase the impression of a vast ocean by
analyzing
the single drops of water.  But at a reverent distance one gets a
clear
impression of the whole, and can afford to leave the details in the
shadow.

<p>
In presenting such passages (and it must be done very sparingly),
experience has taught me that we should take the children into our
confidence by telling them frankly that nothing exciting is going to
happen, so that they well be free to listen to the mere words.  A
very
interesting experiment might occasionally be made by asking the
children
some weeks afterwards to tell you in their own words what pictures
were
made on their minds.  This is a very different thing from allowing
the
children to reproduce the passage at once, the danger of which
proceeding I speak of later in detail.[31]

<p>
We now come to the question as to what proportion of <i>dramatic
excitement</i> we should present in the stories for a normal group
of
children.  Personally, I should like, while the child is very young,
I
mean in main, not in years, to exclude the element of dramatic
excitement, but though this may be possible for the individual
child, it
is quite Utopian to hope that we can keep the average child free
from
what is in the atmosphere.  Children crave for excitement, and
unless we
give it to them in legitimate form, they will take it in any riotous
form it presents itself, and if from our experience we can control
their
mental digestion by a moderate supply of what they demand, we may
save
them from devouring too eagerly the raw material they can so easily
find
for themselves.

<p>
There is a humorous passage bearing on this question in the story of
the
small Scotch boy, when he asks leave of his parents to present the
pious
little book&mdash;a gift to himself from an aunt to a little sick
friend, hoping probably that the friend's chastened condition will
make
him more lenient towards this mawkish form of literature.  The
parents
expostulate, pointing out to their son how ungrateful he is, and how
ungracious it would be to part with his aunt's gift.  Then the boy
can
contain himself no longer.  He bursts out, unconsciously expressing
the
normal attitude of children at a certain stage of development:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"It's a <i>daft</i> book ony way: there's naebody gets kilt ent.  I
like
stories about folk gettin' their heids cut off, or there's nae wile
beasts.  I I like stories about black men gettin' ate up, an' white
men
killin' lions and tigers an' bears an'&mdash;&mdash;"
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
Then, again, we have the passage from George Eliot's "Mill on the
Floss":

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>
"Oh, dear! I wish they would not fight at your school, Tom.  Didn't
it
hurt you?"

<p>
"Hurt me?  No," said Tom, putting up the hooks again, taking out a
large
pocketknife, and slowly opening the largest blade, which he looked
at
meditatively as he rubbed his finger along it.  Then he added:

<p>
"I gave Spooner a black eye&mdash;that's what he got for wanting to
leather me.  I wasn't going to go halves because anybody leathered
me."

<p>
"Oh! how brave you are, Tom.  I think you are like Samson.  If there
came a lion roaring at men, I think you'd fight him, wouldn't you,
Tom?"

<p>
"How can a lion come roaring at you, you silly thing?  There's no
lions
only in the shows."

<p>
"No, but if we were in the lion countries&mdash;I mean in Africa
where
it's very hot, the lions eat people there.  I can show it you in the
book where I read it."

<p>
"Well, I should get a gun and shoot him."

<p>
"But if you hadn't a gun?&mdash;we might have gone out, you know,
not
thinking, just as we go out fishing, and then a great lion might
come
towards us roaring, and we could not get away from him.  What should
you
do, Tom?"

<p>
Tom paused, and at last turned away contemptuously, saying: "But the
lion <i>isn't</i> coming.  What's the use of talking?"
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
This passage illustrates also the difference between the highly-
developed imagination of the one and the stodgy prosaical
temperament of
the other.  Tom could enter into the elementary question of giving
his
schoolfellow a black eye, but could not possibly enter into the
drama of
the imaginary arrival of a lion.  He was sorely in need of fairy
stories.

<p>
It is to this element we have to cater, and we cannot shirk our
responsibilities.

<p>
William James says:

<p>
"Living things, moving things or things that savor of danger or
blood,
that have a dramatic quality, these are the things natively
interesting
to childhood, to the exclusion of almost everything else, and the
teacher of young children, until more artificial interests have
grown
up, will keep in touch with his pupils by constant appeal to such
matters as these."[32]

<p>
Of course the savor of danger and blood is only <i>one</i> of the
things
to which we should appeal, but I give the whole passage to make the
point clearer.

<p>
This is one of the most difficult parts of our selection, namely,
how to
present enough excitement for the child and yet include enough
constructive element which will satisfy him when the thirst for
"blugginess" is slaked.

<p>
And here I should like to say that, while wishing to encourage in
children great admiration and reverence for the courage and other
fine
qualities which have been displayed in times of war and which have
mitigated its horrors, I think we should show that some of the
finest
moments in these heroes' lives had nothing to do with their
profession
as soldiers.  Thus, we have the well-known story of Sir Philip
Sydney
and the soldier; the wonderful scene where Roland drags the bodies
of
his dead friends to receive the blessing of the Archbishop after the
battle of Roncesvall;[33] and of Napoleon sending the sailor back to
England. There is a moment in the story of Gunnar when he pauses in
the
midst of the slaughter of his enemies, and says, "I wonder if I am
less
base than others, because I kill men less willingly than they."

<p>
And in the "Burning of Njal,"[34] we have the words of the boy,
Thord,
when his grandmother, Bergthora, urges him to go out of the burning
house.

<p>
"'You promised me when I was little, grandmother, that I should
never go
from you till I wished it of myself.  And I would rather die with
you
than live after you.'"

<p>
Here the moral courage is so splendidly shown: none of these heroes
feared to die in battle or in open single fight; but to face death
by
fire for higher considerations is a point of view worth presenting
to
the child.

<p>
In spite of all the dramatic excitement roused by the conduct of our
soldiers and sailors, should we not try to offer also in our stories
the
romance and excitement of saving as well as taking life?

<p>
I would have quite a collection dealing with the thrilling
adventures of
the Lifeboat and the Fire Brigade, of which I shall present examples
in
the final story list.

<p>
Finally, we ought to include a certain number of stories dealing
with
death, especially with children who are of an age to realize that it
must come to all, and that this is not a calamity but a perfectly
natural and simple thing.  At present the child in the street
invariably
connects death with sordid accidents.  I think they should have
stories
of death coming in heroic form, as when a man or woman dies for a
great
cause, in which he has opportunity of admiring courage, devotion and
unselfishness; or of death coming as a result of treachery, such as
we
find in the death of Baldur, the death of Siegfried, and others, so
that
children may learn to abhor such deeds; but also a fair proportion
of
stories dealing with death that comes naturally, when our work is
done,
and our strength gone, which has no more tragedy than the falling of
a
leaf from the tree.  In this way, we can give children the first
idea
that the individual is so much less than the whole.

<p>
Little children often take death very naturally.  A boy of five met
two
of his older companions at the school door.  They said sadly and
solemnly: "We have just seen a dead man!"  "Well," said the little
philosopher, "that's all right.  We've <i>all</i> got to die when
our
work is done."

<p>
In one of the Buddha stories which I reproduce at the end of this
book,
the little Hare (who is, I think, a symbol of nervous individualism)
constantly says: "Suppose the Earth were to fall in, what would
become
of me?"

<p>
As an antidote to the ordinary attitude towards death, I commend an
episode from a German folklore story which is called "Unlucky John,"
and
which is included in the list of stories recommended at the end of
this
book.

<p>
The following sums up in poetic form some of the material necessary
for
the wants of a child.


<P align=center>THE CHILD</p>
<P align=center>1</p>

<P align=center>
The little new soul has come to earth,<br>
He has taken his staff for the pilgrim's way.<br>
His sandals are girt on his tender feet,<br>
And he carries his scrip for what gifts he may.

<P align=center>2</p>
<P align=center>
What will you give to him, Fate Divine?<br>
What for his scrip on the winding road?<br>
A crown for his head, or a laurel wreath?<br>
A sword to wield, or is gold his load?

<P align=center>3</p>
<P align=center>
What will you give him for weal or woe?<br>
What for the journey through day and night?<br>
Give or withhold from him power and fame,<br>
But give to him love of the earth's delight.

<P align=center>4</p>
<P align=center>
Let him be lover of wind and sun<br>
And of falling rain; and the friend of trees;<br>
With a singing heart for the pride of noon,<br>
And a tender heart for what twilight sees.

<P align=center>5</p>
<P align=center>
Let him be lover of you and yours&mdash;<br>
The Child and Mary; but also Pan<br>
And the sylvan gods of the woods and hills,<br>
And the god that is hid in his fellowman.

<P align=center>6</p>
<P align=center>
Love and a song and the joy of the earth,<br>
These be gifts for his scrip to keep<br>
Till, the journey ended, he stands at last<br>
In the gathering dark, at the gate of sleep.</p>
<P align=center><small>ETHEL CLIFFORD</small></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
And so our stories should contain all the essentials for the child's
scrip on the road of life, providing the essentials and holding or
withholding the non-essentials.  But, above all, let us fill the
scrip
with gifts that the child need never reject, even when he passes
through
to "the gate of sleep."</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align=center><a name="chapVI">CHAPTER VI</a></h4>
<h4 align=center>
HOW TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN<br>
THE EFFECT OF THE STORY</h4>

<p>
We are now come to the most important part of the question of story-
telling, to which all the foregoing remarks have been gradually
leading,
and that is the effect of these stories upon the child, quite apart
from
the dramatic joy he experiences in listening to them, which would in
itself be quite enough to justify us in the telling.  But, since I
have
urged the extreme importance of giving so much time to the manner of
telling and of bestowing so much care in the selection of the
material,
it is right that we should expect some permanent results or else
those
who are not satisfied with the mere enjoyment of the children will
seek
other methods of appeal&mdash;and it is to them that I most
specially
dedicate this chapter.

<p>
I think we are of the threshold of the re-discovery of an old truth,
that <i>dramatic presentation</i> is the quickest and the surest
method
of appeal, because it is the only one with which memory plays no
tricks.
If a thing has appeared before us in a vital form nothing can really
destroy it; it is because things are often given in a blurred, faint
light that they gradually fade out of our memory.  A very keen
scientist
was deploring to me, on one occasion, the fact that stories were
told so
much in the schools, to the detriment of science, for which he
claimed
the same indestructible element that I recognize in the best-told
stories.  Being very much interested in her point of view, I asked
her
to tell me, looking back on her school days, what she could remember
as
standing out from other less clear information.  After thinking some
little time over the matter, she said with some embarrassment, but
with
candor that did her much honor:

<p>
"Well, now I come to think of it, it was the story of Cinderella."

<p>
Now, I am not holding any brief for this story in particular.  I
think
the reason it was remembered was because of the dramatic form in
which
it was presented to her, which fired her imagination and kept the
memory
alight.  I quite realize that a scientific fact might also have been
easily remembered if it had been presented in the form of a
successful
chemical experiment; but this also has something of the dramatic
appeal
and will be remembered on that account.

<p>
Sully says: "We cannot understand the fascination of a story for
children save in remembering that for their young minds, quick to
imagine, and unversed in abstract reflection, words are not dead
things
but <i>winged,</i> as the old Greeks called them."[35]

<p>
The <i>Red Queen,</i> in "Alice Through the Looking-Glass," was more
psychological than she was aware of when she made the memorable
statement: "When once you've <i>said</i> a thing, that <i>fixes</i>
it,
and you must take the consequences."

<p>
In Curtin's "Introduction to Myths and Folk Tales of the Russians,
he
says:

<p>
"I remember well the feeling roused in my mind at the mention or
sight
of the name <i>Lucifer</i> during the early years of my life.  It
stood
for me as the name of a being stupendous, dreadful in moral
deformity,
lurid, hideous and mighty.  I remember the surprise with which, when
I
had grown somewhat older and began to study Latin, I came upon the
name
in Virgil where it means <i>light-bringer</i>&mdash;the herald of
the
Sun."

<p>
Plato has said that "the end of education should be the training by
suitable habits of the instincts of virtue in the child."

<p>
About two thousand years later, Sir Philip Sydney, in his "Defence
of
Poesy," says: "The final end of learning is to draw and lead us to
so
high a perfection as our degenerate souls, made worse by their clay
lodgings, can be capable of."

<p>
And yet it is neither the Greek philosopher nor the Elizabethan poet
that makes the everyday application of these principles; but we have
a
hint of this application from the Pueblo tribe of Indians, of whom
Lummis tells us the following:

<p>
"There is no duty to which a Pueblo child is trained in which he has
to
be content with a bare command: do this.  For each, he learns a
fairy-
tale designed to explain how children first came to know that it was
right to 'do this,' and detailing the sad results that befall those
who
did otherwise.  Some tribes have regular story-tellers, men who have
devoted a great deal of time to learning the myths and stories of
their
people and who possess, in addition to good memory, a vivid
imagination.
The mother sends for one of these, and having prepared a feast for
him,
she and her little brood, who are curled up near her, await the
fairy
stories of the dreamer who after his feast and smoke entertains the
company for hours."

<p>
In modern times, the nurse, who is now receiving such complete
training
for her duties with children, should be ready to imitate the
"dreamer"
of the Indian tribe.  I rejoice to find that regular instruction in
story-telling is being given in many of the institutions where the
nurses are trained.

<p>
Some years ago there appeared a book by Dion Calthrop called "King
Peter," which illustrates very fully the effect of story-telling.
It is
the account of the education of a young prince which is carried on
at
first by means of stories, and later he is taken out into the arena
of
life to show what is happening there&mdash;the dramatic appeal being
always the means used to awaken his imagination.  The fact that only
<i>
one</i> story a year is told him prevents our seeing the effect from
day
to day, but the time matters little.  We only need faith to believe
that
the growth, though slow, was sure.

<p>
There is something of the same idea in the "Adventures of
Telemachus,"
written by F&eacute;n&eacute;lon for his royal pupil, the young Duke
of
Burgundy, but whereas Calthrop trusts to the results of indirect
teaching by means of dramatic stories, F&eacute;n&eacute;lon, on the
contrary, makes use of the somewhat heavy, didactic method, so that
one
would think the attention of the young prince must have wandered at
times; and I imagine Telemachus was in the same condition when he
was
addressed at such length by Mentor, who, being Minerva, though in
disguise, should occasionally have displayed that sense of humor
which
must always temper true wisdom.

<p>
Take, for instance the heavy reproof conveyed in the following
passage:

<p>
"Death and shipwreck are less dreadful than the pleasures that
attack
Virtue. . . . Youth is full of presumption and arrogance, though
nothing
in the world is so frail: it fears nothing, and vainly relies utmost
levity and without any precaution."


<p>
And on another occasion, when Calypso hospitably provides clothes
for
the shipwrecked men, and Telemachus is handling a tunic of the
finest
wool and white as snow, with a vest of purple embroidered with gold,
and
displaying much pleasure in the magnificence of the clothes, Mentor
addresses him in a severe voice, saying: "Are these, O Telemachus,
the
thoughts that ought to occupy the heart of the son of Ulysses?  A
young
man who loves to dress vainly, as a woman does, is unworthy of
wisdom or
glory."

<p>
I remember, as a school girl of thirteen, having to commit to memory
several books of these adventures, so as to become familiar with the
style.  Far from being impressed by the wisdom of Mentor, I was
simply
bored, and wondered why Telemachus did not escape from him.  The
only
part in the book that really interested me was Calypso's unrequited
love
for Telemachus, but this was always the point where we ceased to
learn
by heart, which surprised me greatly, for it was here that the real
human interest seemed to begin.

<p>
Of all the effects which I hope for from the telling of stories in
the
schools, I, personally, place first the dramatic joy we bring to the
children and to ourselves.  But there are many who would consider
this
result as fantastic, if not frivolous, and not to be classed among
the
educational values connected with the introduction of stories into
the
school curriculum.  I, therefore, propose to speak of other effects
of
story-telling which may seem of more practical value.

<p>
The first, which is of a purely negative character, is that through
means of a dramatic story we may counteract some of the sights and
sounds of the street which appeal to the melodramatic instinct in
children.  I am sure that all teachers whose work lies in crowded
cities
must have realized the effect produced on children by what they see
and
hear on their way to and from school.  If we merely consider the
bill
boards with their realistic representations, quite apart from the
actual
dramatic happenings in the street, we at once perceive that the
ordinary
school interests pale before such lurid appeals as these.  How can
we
expect the child who has stood openmouthed before a poster
representing
a woman chloroformed by a burglar (while that hero escapes in safety
with jewels) to display any interest in the arid monotony of the
multiplication table?  The illegitimate excitement created by the
sight
of the depraved burglar can only be counteracted by something
equally
exciting along the realistic but legitimate side of appeal; and this
is
where the story of the right kind becomes so valuable, and why the
teacher who is artistic enough to undertake the task can find the
short
path to results which theorists seek for so long in vain.  It is not
even necessary to have an exceedingly exciting story; sometimes one
which will bring about pure reaction may be just as suitable.

<p>
I remember in my personal experience an instance of this kind.  I
had
been reading with some children of about ten years old the story
from
"Cymbeline" of <i>Imogen</i> in the forest scene, when the brothers
strew flowers upon her, and sing the funeral dirge,

<P align=center>Fear no more the heat of the sun.</p>

<p>
Just as we had all taken on this tender, gentle mood, the door
opened
and one of the prefects announced in a loud voice the news of the
relief
of Mafeking.  The children were on their feet at once, cheering
lustily,
and for the moment the joy over the relief of the brave garrison was
the
predominant feeling.  Then, I took advantage of a momentary reaction
and
said: "Now, children, don't you think we can pay England the tribute
of
going back to England's greatest poet?"  In a few minutes we were
back
in the heart of the forest, and I can still hear the delightful
intonation of those subdued voices repeating,

<p align=center>
Golden lads and girls all must<br>
Like chimney-sweepers come to dust.</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note that the same problem that is exercising
us
today was a source of difficulty to people in remote times.  The
following is taken from an old Chinese document, and has particular
interest for us at this time:

<p>
"The philosopher, Mentius (born 371 B. C.), was left fatherless at a
very tender age and brought up by his mother, Changsi.  The care of
this
prudent and attentive mother has been cited as a model for all
virtuous
parents.  The house she occupied was near that of a butcher; she
observed at the first cry of the animals that were being
slaughtered,
the little Mentius ran to be present at the sight, and that, on his
return, he sought to imitate what he had seen.  Fearful lest his
heart
might become hardened, and accustomed to the sights of blood, she
removed to another house which was in the neighborhood of a
cemetery.
The relations of those who were buried there came often to weep upon
their graves, and make their customary libations.  The lad soon took
pleasure in their ceremonies and amused himself by imitating them.
This
was a new subject of uneasiness to his mother: she feared her son
might
come to consider as a jest what is of all things the most serious,
and
that he might acquire a habit of performing with levity, and as a
matter
of routine merely, ceremonies which demand the most exact attention
and
respect.  Again, therefore, she anxiously changed the dwelling, and
went
to live in the city, opposite a school, where her son found examples
the
most worthy of imitation, and began to profit by them.  This
anecdote
has become incorporated by the Chinese into a proverb, which they
constantly quote: The mother of Mentius seeks a neighborhood."

<p>
Another influence we have to counteract is that of newspaper
headings
and placards which catch the eye of children in the streets and
appeal
so powerfully to their imagination.

<p>Shakespeare has said:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Tell me where is Fancy bred,<br>
Or in the heart, or in the head?<br>
How begot, how nourished?<br>
It is engendered in the eyes<br>
With gazing fed,<br>
And Fancy dies in the cradle where it lies.<br>
Let us all ring Fancy's knell.<br>
I'll begin it&mdash;ding, dong, bell.<br>
&mdash;"Merchant of Venice."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
If this be true, it is of importance to decide what our children
shall
look upon as far as we can control the vision, so that we can form
some
idea of the effect upon their imagination.

<p>
Having alluded to the dangerous influence of the street, I should
hasten
to say that this influence is very far from being altogether bad.
There
are possibilities of romance in street life which may have just the
same
kind of effect on children as the telling of exciting stories.  I am
indebted to Mrs. Arnold Glover, Honorary Secretary of the National
Organization of Girls' Clubs,[36] one of the most widely informed
people
on this subject, for the two following experiences gathered from the
streets and which bear indirectly on the subject of story-telling:

<p>
Mrs. Glover was visiting a sick woman in a very poor neighborhood,
and
found, sitting on the door-step of the house, two little children,
holding something tightly grasped in their little hands, and gazing
with
much expectancy towards the top of the street.  She longed to know
what
they were doing, but not being one of those unimaginative and
tactless
folk who rush headlong into the mysteries of children's doings, she
passed them at first in silence.  It was only when she found them
still
in the same silent and expectant posture half an hour later that she
said tentatively: "I wonder whether you would tell me what you are
doing
here?"  After some hesitation, one of them said, in a shy voice:
"We're
waitin' for the  barrer."  It then transpired that, once a week, a
vegetable-and-flower-cart was driven through this particular street,
on
its way to a more prosperous neighborhood, and on a few red-letter
days,
a flower, or a sprig, or even a root sometimes fell out of the back
of
the cart; and these two little children were sitting there in hope,
with
their hands full of soil, ready to plant anything which might by
some
golden chance fall that way, in their secret garden of oyster
shells.

<p>
This seems to me as charming a fairy tale as any that our books can
supply.

<p>
On another occasion, Mrs. Glover was collecting the pennies for the
Holiday Fund Savings Bank from the children who came weekly to her
house.  She noticed on three consecutive Mondays that one little lad
deliberately helped himself to a new envelope from her table.  Not
wishing to frighten or startle him, she allowed this to continue for
some weeks, and then one day, having dismissed the other children,
she
asked him quite quietly why he was taking the envelopes.  At first
he
was very sulky, and said: "I need them more than you do."  She quite
agreed this might be, but reminded him that, after all, they
belonged to
her.  She promised, however, that if he would tell her for what
purpose
he wanted the envelopes, she would endeavor to help him in the
matter.
Then came the astonishing announcement: "I am building a navy."
After a
little more gradual questioning, Mrs. Glover drew from the boy the
information that the Borough water carts passed through the side
street
once a week, flushing the gutter; that then the envelope ships were
made
to sail on the water and pass under the covered ways which formed
bridges for wayfarers and tunnels for the "navy."  Great was the
excitement when the ships passed out of sight and were recognized as
they arrived safely at the other end.  Of course, the expenses in
raw
material were greatly diminished by the illicit acquisition of Mrs.
Glover's property, and in this way she had unconsciously provided
the
neighborhood with a navy and a commander.  Her first instinct, after
becoming acquainted with the whole story, was to present the boy
with a
real boat, but on second thought she collected and gave him a number
of
old envelopes with names and addresses upon them, which added
greatly to
the excitement of the sailing, because they could be more easily
identified as they came out of the other end of the tunnel, and had
their respective reputations as to speed.

<p>
Here is indeed food for romance, and I give both instances to prove
that
the advantages of street life are to be taken into consideration as
well
as the disadvantages, though I think we are bound to admit that the
latter outweigh the former.

<p>
One of the immediate results of dramatic stories is the escape from
the
commonplace, to which I have already alluded in quoting Mr.
Goschen's
words.  The desire for this escape is a healthy one, common to
adults
and children.  When we wish to get away from our own surroundings
and
interests, we do for ourselves what I maintain we ought to do for
children: we step into the land of fiction.  It has always been a
source
of astonishment to me that, in trying to escape from our own
everyday
surroundings, we do not step more boldly into the land of pure
romance,
which would form a real contrast to our everyday life, but, in nine
cases out of ten, the fiction which is sought after deals with the
subjects of our ordinary existence, namely, frenzied finance, sordid
poverty, political corruption, fast society, and religious doubts.

<p>
There is the same danger in the selection of fiction for children:
namely, a tendency to choose very utilitarian stories, both in form
and
substance, so that we do not lift the children out of the
commonplace.
I remember once seeing the titles of two little books, the contents
of
which were being read or told to children; one was called, "Tom the
Bootblack"; the other, "Dan the Newsboy."  My chief objection to
these
stories was the fact that neither of the heroes rejoiced in his work
for
the work's sake.  Had <i>Tom</i> even invented a new kind of
blacking,
or if <i>Dan</i> had started a newspaper, it might have been
encouraging
for those among the listeners who were thinking of engaging in
similar
professions.  It is true, both gentlemen amassed large fortunes, but
surely the school age is not to be limited to such dreams and
aspirations as these!  One wearies of the tales of boys who arrive
in a
town with one cent in their pocket and leave it as millionaires,
with
the added importance of a mayoralty.  It is undoubtedly true that
the
romantic prototype of these worthy youths is <i>Dick Whittingon,</i>
for
whom we unconsciously cherish the affection which we often bestow on
a
far-off personage.  Perhaps&mdash;who can say?&mdash;it is the
picturesque adjunct of the cat, lacking to modern millionaires.

<p>
I do not think it Utopian to present to children a fair share of
stories
which deal with the importance of things "untouched by hand."  They,
too, can learn at an early age that "the things which are seen are
temporal, but the things which are unseen are spiritual."  To those
who
wish to try the effect of such stories on children, I present for
their
encouragement the following lines from James Whitcomb Riley:

<p align=center>
THE TREASURE OF THE WISE MAN[37]</p>
<p align=center>
Oh, the night was dark and the night was late,<br>
When the robbers came to rob him;<br>
And they picked the lock of his palace-gate,<br>
The robbers who came to rob him&mdash;<br>
They picked the lock of the palace-gate,<br>
Seized his jewels and gems of State,<br>
His coffers of gold and his priceless plate,&mdash;<br>
The robbers that came to rob him.</p>

<p align=center>
But loud laughed he in the morning red!&mdash;<br>
For of what had the robbers robbed him?<br>
Ho! hidden safe, as he slept in bed,<br>
When the robbers came to rob him,&mdash;<br>
They robbed him not of a golden shred<br>
Of the childish dreams in his wise old head&mdash;<br>
"And they're welcome to all things else," he said,<br>
When the robbers came to rob him.

<p>
There is a great deal of this romantic spirit, combined with a
delightful sense of irresponsibility, which I claim above all things
for
small children, to be found in our old nursery rhymes.  I quote from
the
following article written by the Rev. R. L. Gales for the <i>
Nation</i>.

<p>
After speaking on the subject of fairy stories being eliminated from
the
school curriculum, the writer adds:

<p>
"This would be lessening the joy of the world and taking from
generations yet unborn the capacity for wonder, the power to take a
large unselfish interest in the spectacle of things, and putting
them
forever at the mercy of small private cares.

<p>
"A nursery rhyme is the most sane, the most unselfish thing in the
world. It calls up some delightful image&mdash;a little nut-tree
with a
silver walnut and a golden pear; some romantic adventure only for
the
child's delight and liberation from the bondage of unseeing
dullness: it
brings before the mind the quintessence of some good thing:

<p>
"'The little dog laughed to see such sport'&mdash;there is the soul
of
good humor, of sanity, of health in the laughter of that innocently
wicked little dog.  It is the laughter of pure frolic without
unkindness.  To have laughed with the little dog as a child is the
best
preservative against mirthless laughter in later years&mdash;the
horse
laughter of brutality, the ugly laughter of spite, the acrid
laughter of
fanaticism.  The world of nursery rhymes, the old world of Mrs.
Slipper-
Slopper, is the world of natural things, of quick, healthy motion,
of
the joy of living.

<p>
"In nursery rhymes the child is entertained with all the pageant of
the
world.  It walks in fairy gardens, and for it the singing birds
pass.
All the King's horses and all the King's men pass before it in their
glorious array.  Craftsmen of all sorts, bakers, confectioners,
silversmiths, blacksmiths are busy for it with all their arts and
mysteries, as at the court of an eastern King."

<p>
In insisting upon the value of this escape from the commonplace, I
cannot prove the importance of it more clearly than by showing what
may
happen to a child who is deprived of his birthright by having none
of
the fairy tale element presented to him.  In "Father and Son," Mr.
Edmund Gosse says:

<p>
"Meanwhile, capable as I was of reading, I found my greatest
pleasure in
the pages of books.  The range of these was limited, for storybooks
of
every description were sternly excluded.  No fiction of any kind,
religious or secular, was admitted into the house.  In this it was
to my
Mother, not to my Father, that the prohibition was due.  She had a
remarkable, I confess, to me somewhat unaccountable impression that
to
'tell a story,' that is, to compose fictitious narrative of any
king,
was a sin. . . . Nor would she read the chivalrous tales in the
verse of
Sir Walter Scott, obstinately alleging that they were not true. She
would nothing but lyrical and subjective poetry.  As a child,
however,
she had possessed a passion for making up stories, and so
considerable a
skill in it, that she was constantly being begged to indulge others
with
its exercise. . . . 'When I was a very little child,' she says, 'I
used
to amuse myself and my brothers with inventing stories such as I had
read.  Having, I suppose, a naturally restless mind and busy
imagination, this soon became the chief pleasure of my life.
Unfortunately, my brothers were always fond of encouraging this
propensity, and I found in Taylor, my maid, a still greater tempter.
I
had not known there was any harm in it, until Miss Shore, a
Calvinistic
governess, finding it out, lectured me severely and told me it was
wicked.  From that time forth, I considered that to invent a story
of
any kind was a sin. . . . But the longing to do so grew with
violence. .
. . The simplicity of Truth was not enough for me.  I must needs
embroider imagination upon it, and the vanity and wickedness which
disgraced my heart are more than I am able to express.'  This [the
author, her son, adds] is surely a very painful instance of the
repression of an instinct."

<p>
In contrast to the stifling of the imagination, it is good to recall
the
story of the great Hermite who, having listened to the discussion of
the
Monday sitting at the Acad&eacute;mie des Sciences (Insitut de
France)
as to the best way to teach the "young idea how to shoot" in the
direction of mathematical genius, said: <i>Cultivez l'imagination,
messieurs.  Tout est L&agrave;.  Si vous voulez des math&eacute;
maticiens, donnez &agrave; vos enfants &agrave; lire&mdash;des
Contes de
F&eacute;es.</i>"

<p>
Another important effect of the story is to develop at an early age
sympathy for children of other countries where conditions are
different
from our own.

<p>
I have so constantly to deal with the question of confusion between
truth and fiction in the minds of children that it might be useful
to
offer here an example of the way they make the distinction for
themselves.

<p>Mrs. Ewing says on this subject:

<p>
"If there are young intellects so imperfect as to be incapable of
distinguishing between fancy and falsehood, it is most desirable to
develop in them the power to do so, but, as a rule, in childhood, we
appreciate the distinction with a vivacity which as elders our care-
clogged memories fail to recall."

<p>
Mr. P. A. Barnett, in his book on the "Common-sense of Education,"
says,
alluding to fairy-tales:

<p>
"Children will <i>act</i> them but not act <i>upon</i> them, and
they
will not accept the incidents as part of their effectual belief.
They
will imagine, to be sure, grotesque worlds, full of admirable and
interesting personages to whom strange things might have happened.
So
much the better: this largeness of imagination is one of the
possessions
that distinguish the better nurtured child from others less
fortunate."

<p>
The following passage from Stevenson's essay on <i>"Child Play"</i>
[38]
will furnish an instance of children's aptitude for creating their
own
dramatic atmosphere:

<p>
"When my cousin and I took our porridge of a morning, we had a
device to
enliven the course of a meal.  He ate his with sugar, and explained
it
to be a country continually buried under snow.  I took mine with
milk,
and explained it to be country suffering gradual inundation.  You
can
imagine us exchanging bulletins; how here was an island still
unsubmerged, here a valley not yet covered with snow; what
inventions
were made; how his population lived in cabins on perches and
traveled on
stilts, and how mine was always in boats; how the interest grew
furious
as the last corner of safe ground was cut off on all sides and grew
smaller every moment; and how, in fine, the food was of altogether
secondary importance, and might even have been nauseous, so long as
we
seasoned it with these dreams.  But perhaps the most exciting
moments I
ever had over a meal were in the case of calf's foot jelly.  It was
hardly possible not to believe&mdash;and you may be quite sure, so
far
from trying, I did all I could to favor the illusion&mdash;that some
part of it was hollow and that sooner or later my spoon would lay
open
the secret tabernacle of the golden rock.  There, might some <i>Red-
Beard</i> await his hour; there might one find the treasures of the
Forty Thieves.  And so I quarried on slowly, with bated breath,
savoring
the interest.  Believe me, I had little palate left for the jelly;
and
though I preferred the taste when I tool cream with it, I used often
to
go without because the cream dimmed the transparent fractures."

<p>
In his work on "Imagination," Ribot says: "The free initiative of
children is always superior to the imitations we pretend to make for
them."

<p>
The passage from Robert Louis Stevenson becomes more clear from a
scientific point of view when taken in connection with one from Karl
Groos' book on the "Psychology of Animal Play":

<p>
"The child is wholly absorbed in his play, and yet under the ebb and
flow of thought and feeling like still water under wind-swept waves,
he
has the knowledge that it is pretense after all.  Behind the sham
'I'
that takes part in the game, stands the unchanged 'I' which regards
the
sham 'I' with quiet superiority."

<p>
Queyrat speaks of play as one of the distinct phases of a child's
imagination; it is "essentially a metamorphosis of reality, a
transformation of places and things."

<p>
Now to return to the point which Mrs. Ewing makes, namely, that we
should develop in normal children the power of distinguishing
between
truth and falsehood.

<p>
I should suggest including two or three stories which would test
that
power in children, and if they fail to realize the difference
between
romancing and telling lies, then it is evident that they need
special
attention and help along this line.  I give the titles of two
stories of
this kind in the collection at the end of the book.[39]

<p>
Thus far we have dealt only with the negative results of stories,
but
there are more important effects, and I am persuaded that if we are
careful in our choice of stories, and artistic in our presentation,
so
that the truth is framed, so to speak, in the memory, we can
unconsciously correct evil tendencies in children which they
recognize
in themselves only when they have already criticized them in the
characters of the story.  I have sometimes been misunderstood on
this
point, and, therefore, I should like to make it quite clear.  I do
<i>
not</i> mean that stories should take the place entirely of moral or
direct teaching, but that on many occasions they could supplement
and
strengthen moral teaching, because the dramatic appeal to the
imagination is quicker than the moral appeal to the conscience.  A
child
will often resist the latter lest it should make him uncomfortable
or
appeal to his personal sense of responsibility: it is often not in
his
power to resist the former, because it has taken possession of him
before he is aware of it.

<p>
As a concrete example, I offer three verses from a poem entitled, "A
Ballad for a Boy," written some twelve years ago by W. Cory, an Eton
master.  The whole poem is to be found in a book of poems known as
"Ionica."[40]

<p>
The poem describes a fight between two ships, the French ship, <i>
T&eacute;m&eacute;raire,</i> and the English ship, <i>Quebec</i>.
The
English ship was destroyed by fire; Farmer, the captain, was killed,
and
the officers take prisoners:

<p>
They dealt with us as brethren, they mourned for Farmer dead,<br>
And as the wounded captives passed each Breton bowed the head.<br>
Then spoke the French lieutenant:<br>
"'Twas the fire that won, not we.<br>
You never struck your flag to <i>us;</i> You'll go to England
free."[41]

<p>
'Twas the sixth day of October, seventeen hundred seventy-nine,<br>
A year when nations ventured against us to combine,<br>
<i>Quebec</i> was burned and Farmer slain, by us remembered not;<br>
But thanks be to the French book wherein they're not forgot.

<p>
And you, if you've got to fight the French, my youngster, bear in
mind
<br>
Those seamen of King Louis so chivalrous and kind;<br>
Think of the Breton gentlemen who took our lads to Brest,<br>
And treat some rescued Breton as a comrade and a guest.

<p>
But in all our stories, in order to produce desired effects we must
refrain from holding, as Burroughs says, "a brief for either side,"
and
we must let the people in the story be judged by their deeds and
leave
the decision of the children free in this matter.[42]

<p>
In a review of Ladd's "Psychology" in the <i>Academy,</i> we find a
passage which refers as much to the story as to the novel:

<p>
"The psychological novelist girds up his loins and sets himself to
write
little essays on each of his characters.  If he have the gift of the
thing he may analyze motives with a subtlety which is more than
their
desert, and exhibit simple folk passing through the most dazzling
rotations.  If he be a novice, he is reduced to mere crude invention
&mdash;the result in both cases is quite beyond the true purpose of
Art.
Art&mdash;when all is said and done&mdash;is a suggestion, and it
refuses to be explained.  Make it obvious, unfold it in detail, and
you
reduce it to a dead letter."

<p>
Again, there is a sentence by Schopenhauer applied to novels which
would
apply equally well to stories:

<p>
"Skill consists in setting the inner life in motion with the
smallest
possible array of circumstances, for it is this inner life that
excites
our interest."

<p>
In order to produce an encouraging and lasting effect by means of
our
stories, we should be careful to introduce a certain number from
fiction
where virtue is rewarded and vice punished, because to appreciate
the
fact that "virtue is its own reward" it takes a developed and
philosophic mind, or a born saint, of whom there will not, I think,
be
many among normal children: a comforting fact, on the whole, as the
normal teacher is apt to confuse them with prigs.

<p>
A grande dame visiting an elementary school listened to the telling
of
an exciting story from fiction, and was impressed by the thrill of
delight which passed through the children.  But when the story was
finished, she said: "But <i>oh!</i> what a pity the story was not
taken
from actual history!"

<p>
Now, not only was this comment quite beside the mark, but the lady
in
question did not realize that pure fiction has one quality which
history
cannot have.  The historian, bound by fact and accuracy, must often
let
his hero come to grief.  The poet (or, in this case we may call him,
in
the Greek sense, the "maker" of stories) strives to show <i>ideal</i
>
justice.

<p>
What encouragement to virtue, except for the abnormal child, can be
offered by the stories of good men coming to grief, such as we find
Miltiades, Phocion, Socrates, Severus, Cicero, Cato and C&aelig;sar?

<p>Sir Philip Sydney says in his "Defence of Poesy":

<p>
"Only the poet declining to be held by the limitations of the
lawyer,
the <i>historian,</i> the grammarian, the rhetorician, the logician,
the
physician, the metaphysician is lifted up with the vigor of his own
imagination; doth grow in effect into another nature in making
things
either better than Nature bringeth forth or quite anew, as the
Heroes,
Demi-gods, Cyclops, Furies and such like so as he goeth hand-in-hand
with Nature, not inclosed in the narrow range of her gifts but
freely
ranging within the Zodiac of his own art&mdash;<i>her</i> world is
brazen; the poet only delivers a golden one."

<p>
The effect of the story need not stop at the negative task of
correcting
evil tendencies.  There is the positive effect of translating the
abstract ideal of the story into concrete action.

<p>
I was told by Lady Henry Somerset that when the first set of
children
came down from London for a fortnight's holiday in the country, she
was
much startled and shocked by the obscenity of the games they played
amongst themselves.  Being a sound psychologist, Lady Henry wisely
refrained from appearing surprised or from attempting any direct
method
of reproof.  "I saw," she said, "that the 'goody' element would have
no
effect, so I changed the whole atmosphere by reading to them or
telling
them the most thrilling medieval tales without any commentary.  By
the
end of the fortnight the activities had all changed.  The boys were
performing astonishing deeds of prowess, and the girls were allowing
themselves to be rescued from burning towers and fetid dungeons."
Now,
if these deeds of chivalry appear somewhat stilted to us, we can at
least realize that, having changed the whole atmosphere of the
filthy
games, it is easier to translate the deeds into something a little
more
in accordance with the spirit of the age, and boys will more readily
wish later on to save their sisters from dangers more sordid and
commonplace than fiery towers and dark dungeons, if they have once
performed the deeds in which they had to court danger and self-
sacrifice
for themselves.

<p>
And now we come to the question as to how these effects are to be
maintained.  In what has already been stated as to the danger of
introducing the dogmatic and direct appeal into the story, it is
evident
that the avoidance of this element is the first means of preserving
the
story in all its artistic force in the memory of the child.  We must
be
careful, as I point out in the chapter on Questions, not to
interfere by
comment or question with the atmosphere we have made round the
story, or
else, in the future, that story will become blurred and overlaid
with
the remembrance, not of the artistic whole, as presented by the
teller
of the story, but by some unimportant small side issue raised by an
irrelevant question or a superfluous comment.

<p>
Many people think that the dramatization of the story by the
children
themselves helps to maintain the effect produced.  Personally, I
fear
there is the same danger as in the immediate reproduction of the
story,
but by some unimportant small side issue raised by an irrelevant
question or a superfluous comment.

<p>
Many people think that the dramatization of the story by the
children
themselves helps to maintain the effect produced.  Personally, I
fear
there is the same danger as in the immediate reproduction of the
story,
namely, that the general dramatic effect may be weakened.

<p>
If, however, there is to be dramatization (and I do not wish to
dogmatize on the subject), I think it should be confined to facts
and
not fancies, and this is why I realize the futility of the
dramatization
of fairy tales.

<p>
Horace E. Scudder says on this subject:

<p>
"Nothing has done more to vulgarize the fairy than its introduction
on
the stage.  The charm of the fairy tale is its divorce from human
experience: the charm of the stage is its realization in miniature
of
human life.  If a frog is heard to speak, if a dog is changed before
our
eyes into a prince by having cold water dashed over it, the charm of
the
fairy tale has fled, and, in its place, we have the perplexing
pleasure
of <i>legerdemain.</i>   Since the real life of a fairy is in the
imagination, a wrong is committed when it is dragged from its
shadowy
hiding-place and made to turn into ashes under the calcium light of
the
understanding."[43]

<p>
I am bound to admit that the teachers have a case when they plead
for
this reproducing of the story, and there are three arguments they
use
the validity of which I admit, but which have nevertheless not
converted
me, because the loss, to my mind, would exceed the gain.

<p>
The first argument they put forward is that the reproduction of the
story enables the child to enlarge and improve his vocabulary.  Now
I
greatly sympathize with this point of view, but, as I regard the
story
hour as a very precious and special one, which I think may have a
lasting effect on the character of a child, I do not think it
important
that, during this hour, a child should be called upon to improve his
vocabulary at the expense of the dramatic whole, and at the expense
of
the literary form in which the story has been presented.  It would
be
like using the Bible for parsing or paraphrase or pronunciation.  So
far, I believe, the line has been drawn here, though there are
blasphemers who have laid impious hands on Milton or Shakespeare for
this purpose.

<p>
There are surely other lessons, as I have already said in dealing
with the reproduction of the story quite apart from the
dramatization,
lessons more utilitarian in character, which can be used for this
purpose: the facts of history (I mean the mere facts as compared
with
the deep truths), and those of geography.  Above all, the grammar
lessons are those in which the vocabulary can be enlarged and
improved.
But I am anxious to keep the story hour apart as dedicated to
something
higher than these excellent but utilitarian considerations.

<p>
The second argument used by the teachers is the joy felt by the
children
in being allowed to dramatize the stories.  This, too, appeals very
strongly to me, but there is a means of satisfying their desire and
yet
protecting the dramatic whole, and that is occasionally to allow
children to act out their own dramatic inventions; this, to my mind,
has
great educational significance: it is original and creative work
and,
apart from the joy of the immediate performance, there is the
interesting process of comparison which can be presented to the
children, showing them the difference between their elementary
attempts
and the finished product of the experienced artist.  This difference
they can be led to recognize by their own powers of observation if
the
teachers are not in too great a hurry to point it out themselves.

<p>
Here is a short original story, quoted by the French psychologist,
Queyrat, in his "Jeux de l'Enfance," written by a child of five:</p>

<p>
"One day I went to sea in a life-boat&mdash;all at once I saw an
enormous whale, and I jumped out of the boat to catch him, but he
was so
big that I climbed on his back and rode astride, and all the little
fishes laughed to see."

<p>
Here is a complete and exciting drama, making a wonderful picture
and
teeming with adventure.  We could scarcely offer anything to so
small a
child for reproduction that would be a greater stimulus to the
imagination.

<p>
Here is another, offered by Loti, but the age of the child is not
given:

<p>
"Once upon a time a little girl out in the Colonies cut open a huge
melon, and out popped a green beast and stung her, and the little
child
died."

<p>
Loti adds:

<p>
"The phrases 'out in the Colonies' and 'a huge melon' were enough to
plunge me suddenly into a dream.  As by an apparition, I beheld
tropical
trees, forests alive with marvelous birds.  Oh! the simple magic of
the
words 'the Colonies'!  In my childhood they stood for a multitude of
distant sun-scorched countries, with their palm-trees, their
enormous
flowers, their black natives, their wild beasts, their endless
possibilities of adventure."

<p>
I quote this in full because it shows so clearly the magic force of
words to evoke pictures, without any material representation.  It is
just the opposite effect of the pictures presented to the bodily eye
without the splendid educational opportunity for the child to form
his
own mental image.

<p>
I am more and more convinced that the rare power of visualization is
accounted for by the lack of mental practice afforded along these
lines.

<p>
The third argument used by teachers in favor of the dramatization of
the
stories is that it is a means of discovering how much the child has
really learned from the story.  Now this argument makes absolutely
no
appeal to me.

<p>
My experience, in the first place, has taught me that a child very
seldom gives out any account of a deep impression made upon him: it
is
too sacred and personal.  But he very soon learns to know what is
expected of him, and he keeps a set of stock sentences which he has
found out are acceptable to the teacher.  How can we possibly gauge
the
deep effects of a story in this way, or how can a child, by acting
out a
story, describe the subtle elements which one has tried to
introduce?
One might as well try to show with a pint measure how the sun and
rain
have affected a plant, instead of rejoicing in the beauty of the
sure,
if slow, growth.

<p>
Then, again, why are we in such a hurry to find out what effects
have
been produced by our stories?  Does it matter whether we know today
or
tomorrow how much a child has understood?  For my part, so sure do I
feel of the effect that I am willing to wait indefinitely.  Only, I
must
make sure that the first presentation is truly dramatic and
artistic.

<p>
The teachers of general subjects have a much easier and more simple
task.  Those who teach science, mathematics, even, to a certain
extent,
history and literature, are able to gauge with a fair amount of
accuracy
by means of examination what their pupils have learned.  The
teaching
carried on by means of stories can never be gauged in the same
manner.

<p>
Carlyle has said:

<p>
"Of this thing be certain: wouldst thou plant for Eternity, then
plant
into the deep infinite faculties of man, his Fantasy and Heart.
Wouldst
thou plant for Year and Day, then plant into his shallow superficial
faculties, his self-love and arithmetical understanding, what will
grow
there."[44]

<p>
If we use this marvelous art of story-telling in the way I have
tried to
show, then the children who have been confided to our care will one
day
be able to bring <i>us</i> the tribute which Bj&ouml;rnson brought
to
Hans Christian Andersen:

<P align=center>
Wings you gave to my Imagination,<br>
Me uplifting to the strange and great;<br>
Gave my heart the poet's revelation,<br>
Glorifying things of low estate.</p>

<P align=center>
When my child-soul hungered all-unknowing,<br>
With great truths its need you satisfied:<br>
Now, a world-worn man, to you is owing<br>
That the child in me has never died.</p>

<h4 align=center><a name="chapVII">CHAPTER VII</a></h4>
<h4 align=center>QUESTIONS ASKED BY TEACHERS</h4>

<p>
The following questions have been put to me so often by teachers, in
my
own country and in America, that I have thought it might be useful
to
give in my book some of the attempts I have made to answer them; and
I
wish to record here an expression of gratitude to the teachers who
have
asked these questions at the close of my lectures.  It has enabled
me to
formulate my views on the subject and to clear up, by means of
research
and thought, the reason for certain things which I had more or less
taken for granted.  It has also constantly modified my own point of
view, and has prevented me from becoming too dogmatic in dealing
with
other people's methods.

<p>
QUESTION I:  <i>Why do I consider it necessary to spend so many
years
on the art of story-telling, which takes in, after all, such a
restricted portion of literature?</i>

<p>
Just in the same way that an actor thinks it worth while to go
through
so many years' training to fit him for the stage, although dramatic
literature is also only one branch of general literature.  The
region of
storyland is the legitimate stage for children.  They crave drama as
we
do, and because there are comparatively few good story-tellers,
children
do not have their dramatic needs satisfied.  What is the result?  We
either take them to dramatic performances for grown-up people, or we
have children's theaters where the pieces, charming as they may be,
are
of necessity deprived of the essential elements which constitute a
drama
&mdash;or they are shriveled up to suit the capacity of the child.
Therefore, it would seem wiser, while the children are quite young,
to
keep them to the simple presentation of stories, because with their
imagination keener at that period, they have the delight of the
inner
vision and they do not need, as we do, the artificial stimulus
provided
by the machinery of the stage.

<p>
QUESTION II:  <i>What is to be done if a child asks you: "Is the
story
true?"</i>

<p>
I hope I shall be considered Utopian in my ideas if a say that it is
quite easy, even with small children, to teach them that the seeing
of
truth is a relative matter which depends on the eyes of the seer.
If we
were not afraid to tell our children that all through life there are
grown-up people who do not see things that others see, their own
difficulties would be helped.

<p>
In his "Imagination Cr&eacute;atrice," Queyrat says:

<p>
"To get down into the recesses of a child's mind, one would have to
become even as he is; we are reduced to interpreting that child in
the
terms of an adult.  The children we observe live and grow in a
civilized
community, and the result of this is that the development of their
imagination is rarely free or complete, for as soon as it rises
beyond
the average level, the rationalistic education of parents and
schoolmasters at once endeavors to curb it.  It is restrained in its
flight by an antagonistic power which treats it as a kind of
incipient
madness."

<p>
It is quite easy to show children that if one keeps things where
they
belong, they are true with regard to each other, but that if one
drags
these things out of the shadowy atmosphere of the "make-believe,"
and
forces them into the land of actual facts, the whole thing is out of
gear.

<p>
To take a concrete example: The arrival of the coach made from a
pumpkin
and driven by mice is entirely in harmony with the <i>Cinderella</i>
surroundings, and I have never heard one child raise any question of
the
difficulty of traveling in such a coach or of the uncertainty of
mice in
drawing it.  But, suggest to the child that this diminutive vehicle
could be driven among the cars of Broadway, or amongst the motor
omnibuses in the Strand, and you would bring confusion at once into
his
mind.

<p>
Having once grasped this, the children will lose the idea that fairy
stories are just for them, and not for their elders, and from this
they
will go on to see that it is the child-like mind of the poet and
seer
that continues to appreciate these things; that it is the dull,
heavy
person whose eyes so soon become dim and unable to see any more the
visions which were once his own.

<p>
In his essay on "Poetry and Life" (Glasgow, 1889), Professor Bradley
says:

<p>
"It is the effect of poetry, not only by expressing emotion but in
other
ways also, to bring life into the dead mass of our experience, and
to
make the world significant."

<p>
This applies to children as well as to adults.  There may come to
the
child in the story hour, by some stirring poem or dramatic
narration, a
sudden flash of the possibilities of life which he had not hitherto
realized in the even course of school experience.

<p>
"Poetry," says Professor Bradley, "is a way of representing truth;
but
there is in it, as its detractors have always insisted, a certain
untruth or illusion.  We need not deny this, so long as we remember
that
the illusion is conscious, that no one wishes to deceive, and that
no
one is deceived.  But it would be better to say that poetry is false
to
literal fact for the sake of obtaining a higher truth.  First, in
order
to represent the connection between a more significant part of
experience and a less significant, poetry, instead of linking them
together by a chain which touches one by one the intermediate
objects
that connect them, leaps from one to the other.  It thus falls at
once
into conflict with common-sense."

<p>
Now, the whole of this passage bears as much on the question of the
truth embodied in a fairy tale as a poem, and it would be
interesting to
take some of these tales and try to discover where they are false to
actual fact for the sake of a higher truth.

<p>
Let us take, for instance, the Story of Cinderella: The coach and
pumpkins to which I have alluded and all the magic part of the
story,
are false to actual facts as we meet them in our every life; but is
it
not a higher truth that <i>Cinderella</i> could escape from her
chimney
corner by thinking of the brightness outside?  In this sense we all
travel in pumpkin coaches.

<p>
Take the Story of Psyche, in any one of the many forms it is
presented
to us in folk-story.  The magic transformation of the lover is false
to
actual fact; but is it not a higher truth that we are often
transformed
by circumstance, and that love and courage can overcome most
difficulties?

<p>
Take the Story of the Three Bears.  It is not in accordance with
established fact that bears should extend hospitality to children
who
invade their territory.  Is it not true in a higher sense that
fearlessness often lessens or averts danger?

<p>
Take the Story of Jack and the Bean Stalk.  The rapid growth of the
bean
stalk and the encounter with the giant are false to literal fact;
but is
it not a higher truth that the spirit of courage and high adventure
leads us straight out of the commonplace and often sordid facts of
life?

<p>
Now, all these considerations are too subtle for the child, and, if
offered in explanation, would destroy the excitement and interest of
the
story; but they are good for those of us who are presenting such
stories: they provide not only an argument against the objection
raised
by unimaginative people as to the futility, if not immorality, of
presenting these primitive tales, but clear up our own doubt and
justify
us in the use of them, if we need such justification.

<p>
For myself, I am perfectly satisfied that, being part of the history
of
primitive people, it would be foolish to ignore them from an
evolutionary point of view, which constitutes their chief
importance;
and it is only from the point of view of expediency that I mention
the
potential truths they contain.

<p>
QUESTION III:  <i>What are you to do if a child says he does not
like
fairy tales?</i>

<p>
This is not an uncommon case.  What we have first to determine,
under
these circumstances, is whether this dislike springs from a stolid,
prosaic nature, whether it springs from a real inability to
visualize
such pictures as the fairy or marvelous element in the story
present, or
whether (and this is often the real reason) it is from a fear of
being
asked to believe what his judgment resents as untrue, or whether he
thinks it is "grown-up" to reject such pleasure as unworthy of his
years.

<p>
In the first case, it is wise to persevere, in hopes of developing
the
dormant imagination.  If the child resents the apparent want of
truth we
can teach him how many-sided truth is, as I suggested in my answer
to
the first question.  In the other cases, we must try to make it
clear
that the delight he may venture to take now will increase, not
decrease,
with years; that the more one brings <i>to</i> a thing, in the way
of
experience and knowledge, the more one will draw <i>out</i> of it.

<p>
Let us take as a concrete example the question of Santa Claus.  This
joy
has almost disappeared, for we have torn away the last shred of
mystery
about the personage by allowing him to be materialized in the
Christmas
shops and bazaars.

<p>
But the original myth need never have disappeared; the link could
easily
have been kept by gradually telling the child that the Santa Claus
they
worshiped as a mysterious and invisible power is nothing but the
spirit
of charity and kindness that makes us remember others, and that this
spirit often takes the form of material gifts.  We can also lead
them a
step higher and show them that this spirit of kindness can do more
than
provide material things; so that the old nursery tale has laid a
beautiful foundation which need never be pulled up: we can build
upon it
and add to it all through our lives.

<p>
Is not <i>one</i> of the reasons that children reject fairy tales
this,
that such very <i>poor</i> material is offered them?  There is a
dreary
flatness about all except the very best which revolts the child of
literary appreciation and would fail to strike a spark in the more
prosaic.

<p>
QUESTION IV:  <i>Do I recommend learning a story by heart, or
telling it
in one's own words?</i>

<p>
This would largely depend on the kind of story.  If the style is
classic
or if the interest of the story is closely connected with the style,
as
in Andersen, Kipling or Stevenson, then it is better to commit it
absolutely to memory.  But if this process should take too long (I
mean
for those who cannot afford the time to specialize), or if it
produces a
stilted effect, then it is wiser to read the story many times over,
let
it soak in, taking notes of certain passages which would add to the
dramatic interest of the story, and not trouble about the word
accuracy
of the whole.

<p>
For instance, for very young children the story of <i>Pandora</i>,
as
told in the "Wonder-Book" could be shortened so as to leave
principally
the dramatic dialogue between the two children, which could be
easily
committed to memory by the narrator and would appeal most directly
to
the children.  Or for older children: in taking a beautiful medieval
story such as "Our Lady's Tumbler," retold by Wickstead, the
original
text could hardly be presented so as to hold an audience; but while
giving up a great deal of the elaborate material, we should try to
present many of the characteristic passages which seem to sum up the
situation.  For instance, before his performance, the <i>Tumbler</i>
cries:  "What am I doing?  For there is none here so caitiff but who
vies with all the rest in serving God after his trade."  And after
his
act of devotion: "Lady, this is a choice performance.  I do it for
no
other but for you; so aid me God, I do not&mdash;for you and for
your
Son.  And this I dare avouch and boast, that for me it is no play-
work.
But I am serving you, and that pays me."

<p>
On the other hand, there are some very gifted narrators who can only
tell the story in their own words.  I consider that both methods are
necessary to the all-round story-teller.

<p>
QUESTION V:  <i>How do I set about preparing a story?</i>

<p>
Here again the preparation depends a great deal on the kind of
story:
whether it has to be committed to memory or rearranged to suit a
certain
age of child, or told entirely in one's own words.  But there is one
kind of preparation which is the same for any story, that is, living
with it for a long time, until one has really obtained the right
atmosphere, especially in the case of inanimate objects.  This is
where
Hans Christian Andersen reigns supreme.  Horace Scudder says of him:
"By
some transmigration, souls have passed into tin soldiers, balls,
tops,
money-pigs, coins, shoes and even such attenuated things as darning-
needles, and when, informing these apparent dead and stupid bodies,
they
begin to make manifestations, it is always in perfect consistency
with
the ordinary conditions of the bodies they occupy, though the
several
objects become, by the endowment of souls, suddenly expanded in
their
capacity."[45]

<p>
Now, my test of being ready with such stories is whether I have
ceased to look upon such objects <i>as</i> inanimate.  Let us take
some
of those quoted from Andersen.  First, the <i>Tin Soldier</i>.  To
me,
since I have lived in the story, he is a real live hero, holding his
own
with some of the bravest fighting heroes in history or fiction.  As
for
his being merely of tin, I entirely forget it, except when I realize
against what odds he fights, or when I stop to admire the wonderful
way
Andersen carries out his simile of the old tin spoon&mdash;the
stiffness
of the musket, and the tears of tin.

<p>
Take the <i>Top</i> and the <i>Ball</i>, and, except for the
delightful
way they discuss the respective merits of cork and mahogany in their
ancestors, you would completely forget that they are not real human
beings with the live passions and frailties common to youth.

<p>
As for the <i>Beetle</i>&mdash;who ever thinks of him as a mere
entomological specimen?  Is he not the symbol of the self-satisfied
traveler who learns nothing en route but the importance of his own
personality?  And the <i>Darning-Needle?</i>  It is impossible to
divorce human interest from the ambition of this little piece of
steel.

<p>
And this same method applied to the preparation of any shows that
one
can sometimes rise from the r&ocirc;le of mere interpreter to that
of
creator&mdash;that is to say, the objects live afresh for you in
response to the appeal you make in recognizing their possibilities
of
vitality.

<p>
As a mere practical suggestion, I would advise that, as soon as one
has
overcome the difficulties of the text (if actually learning by
heart,
there is nothing but the drudgery of constant repetition), and as
one
begins to work the story into true dramatic form, always say the
words
aloud, and many times aloud, before trying them even on one person.
More suggestions come to one in the way of effects from hearing the
sounds of the words, and more complete mental pictures, in this way
than
any other&mdash;it is a sort of testing period, the results of which
may
or may not have to be modified when produced in public.  In case of
committing to memory, I advise word perfection first, not trying
dramatic effects before this is reached; but, on the other hand, if
you
are using your own words, you can think out the effects as you go
along
&mdash;I mean, during the preparation.  Gestures, pauses, facial
expression often help to fix the choice of words one decides to use,
though here again the public performance will often modify the
result.
I strongly advise that all gestures be studied before the glass,
because
this most faithfully recording friend, whose sincerity we dare not
question, will prevent glaring errors, and also help by the
correction
of these to more satisfactory results along positive lines.  If your
gesture does not satisfy you (and practice will make one more and
more
critical), it is generally because you have not made sufficient
allowance for the power of imagination in your audience.  Emphasis
in
gesture is just as inartistic&mdash;and therefore ineffective&mdash;
as
emphasis in tone or language.

<p>
Before deciding, however, either on the facial expression or
gesture, we
must consider the chief characters in the story, and study how we
can
best&mdash;<i>not</i> present them, but allow them to present
themselves, which is a very different thing.  The greatest tribute
which
can be paid to a story-teller, as to an actor, is that his own
personality is temporarily forgotten, because he has so completely
identified himself with his r&ocirc;le.

<p>
When we have decided what the chief characters really mean to do, we
can
let ourselves go in the impersonation.

<p>
I shall now take a story as a concrete example, namely, the Buddhist
legend of the "Lion and the Hare."[46]

<p>
We have here the <i>Lion</i> and the <i>Hare</i> as types&mdash;the
other animals are less individual and therefore display less salient
qualities.  The little hare's chief characteristics are nervousness,
fussiness, and misdirected imagination.  We must bear this all in
mind
when she appears on the stage&mdash;fortunately these
characteristics
lend themselves easily to dramatic representation.  The <i>Lion</i>
is
not only large-hearted but broad-minded.  It is good to have an
opportunity of presenting to the children a lion who has other
qualities
than physical beauty or extraordinary strength (here again there
will
lurk the danger of alarming the nature students).  He is even more
interesting than the magnanimous lion whom we have sometimes been
privileged to meet in fiction.

<p>
Of course we grown-up people know that the <i>Lion</i> is the Buddha
in
disguise.  Children will not be able to realize this, nor is it the
least necessary that they should do so; but they will grasp the idea
that he is a very unusual lion, not to be met with in Paul Du
Chaillu's
adventures, still less in the quasi-domestic atmosphere of the
Zoological Gardens.  If our presentation is life-like and sincere,
we
shall convey all we intend to the child.  This is part of what I
call
the atmosphere of the story, which, as in a photograph, can only be
obtained by long exposure, that is to say, in the case of
preparation we
must bestow much reflection and sympathy.

<p>
Because these two animals are the chief characters, they must be
painted
in fainter colors&mdash;they should be suggested rather than
presented
in detail.  It might be well to give a definite gesture to the <i>
Elephant</i>&mdash;say, a characteristic movement with his trunk
&mdash;a
scowl to the <i>Tiger</i>, a supercilious and enigmatic smile to the
<i>
Camel</i> (suggested by Kipling's wonderful creation).  But if a
gesture
were given to each of the animals, the effect would become
monotonous,
and the minor characters would crowd the foreground of the picture,
impeding the action and leaving little to the imagination of the
audience.  I personally have found it effective to repeat the
gestures
of these animals as they are leaving the stage, but less markedly,
as it
is only a form of reminder.

<p>
Now, what is the impression we wish to leave on the mind of the
child,
apart from the dramatic joy and interest we have endeavored to
provide?
Surely it is that he may realize the danger of a panic.  One method
of
doing this (alas! a favorite one still) is to say at the end of the
story: "Now, children, what do we learn from this?"  Of this method
Lord
Morley has said: "It is a commonplace to the wise, and an
everlasting
puzzle to the foolish, that direct inculcation of morals should
invariably prove so powerless an instrument, so futile a method."

<p>
If this direct method were really effective, we might as well put
the
little drama aside, and say plainly: "It is foolish to be nervous;
it is
dangerous to make loose statements.  Large-minded people understand
things better than those who are narrow-minded."

<p>
All these abstract statements would be as true and as tiresome as
the
multiplication table.  The child might or might not fix them in his
mind, but he would not act upon them.

<p>
But, put all the artistic warmth of which you are capable into the
presentation of the story, and, without one word of comment from
you,
the children will feel the dramatic intensity of that vast concourse
of
animals brought together by the feeble utterance of one
irresponsible
little hare.  Let them feel the dignity and calm of the <i>Lion</i>,
which accounts for his authority; his tender but firm treatment of
the
foolish little <i>Hare;</i> and listen to the glorious finale when
all
the animals retire convinced of their folly; and you will find that
you
have adopted the same method as the <i>Lion</i> (who must have been
an
unconscious follower of Froebel), and that there is nothing to add
to
the picture.

<p>
QUESTION VI:  <i>Is it wise to talk over a story with children and
to
encourage them in the habit of asking questions about it?</i>

<p>At the time, no!  The effect produced is to be by dramatic means,
and
this would be destroyed any attempt at analysis by means of
questions.

<p>
The medium that has been used in the telling of the story is (or
ought
to be) a purely artistic one which will reach the child through the
medium of the emotions: the appeal to the intellect or the reason is
a
different method, which must be used at a different time.  When you
are
enjoying the fragrance of a flower or the beauty of its color, it is
not
the moment to be reminded of its botanical classification, just as
in
the botany lesson it would be somewhat irrelevant to talk of the
part
that flowers play in the happiness of life.

<p>
From a practical point of view, it is not wise to encourage
questions on
the part of the children, because they are apt to disturb the
atmosphere
by bringing in entirely irrelevant matter, so that in looking back
on
the telling of the story, the child often remembers the irrelevant
conversation to the exclusion of the dramatic interest of the story
itself.[47]

<p>
I remember once making what I considered at the time a most
effective
appeal to some children who had been listening to the Story of the
Little Tin Soldier, and, unable to refrain from the cheap method of
questioning, of which I have now recognized the futility, I asked:
"Don't you think it was nice of the little dancer to rush down into
the
fire to join the brave little soldier?"  "Well," said a prosaic
little
lad of six: <i>I</i> thought the draught carried her down."

<p>
QUESTION VII:  <i>Is it wise to call upon children to repeat the
story
as soon as it has been told?</i>

<p>
My answer here is decidedly in the negative.

<p>
While fully appreciating the modern idea of children expressing
themselves, I very much deprecate this so-called self-expression
taking
the form of mere reproduction.  I have dealt with this matter in
detail
in another portion of my book.  This is one of the occasions when
children should be taking in, not giving out (even the most fanatic
of
moderns must agree that there <i>are</i> such moments).

<p>
When, after much careful preparation, an expert has told a story to
the
best of his ability, to encourage the children to reproduce this
story
with their imperfect vocabulary and with no special gift of speech
(I am
always alluding to the normal group of children) is as futile as if,
after the performance of a musical piece by a great artist, some
individual member of the audience were to be called upon to give <i>
his
</i> rendering of the original rendering.  The result would be that
the
musical joy of the audience would be completely destroyed and the
performer himself would share in the loss.[48]</p>

<p>
I have always maintained that five minutes of complete silence after
the
story would do more to fix the impression on the mind of the child
than
any amount of attempt at reproducing it.  The general statement made
in
Dr. Montessor's wonderful chapter on "Silence" would seem to me of
special application to the moments following on the telling of a
story.

<p>
QUESTION VIII:  <i>Should children be encouraged to illustrate the
stories which they have heard?</i>

<p>
As a dramatic interest to the teachers and the children, I think it
is a
very praiseworthy experiment, if used somewhat sparingly.  But I
seriously doubt whether these illustrations in any way indicate the
impression made on the mind of the child.  It is the same question
that
arises when that child is called upon, or expresses a wish, to
reproduce
the story in his own words: the unfamiliar medium in both instances
makes it almost impossible for the child to convey his meaning,
unless
he is an artist in the one case or he has real literary power of
expression in the other.

<p>
My own impression, confirmed by many teachers who have made the
experiment, is that a certain amount of disappointment is mixed up
with
the daring joy in the attempt, simply because the children can get
nowhere near the ideal which has presented itself to the "inner
eye."

<p>
I remember a kindergarten teacher saying that on one occasion, when
she
had told to the class a thrilling story of a knight, one of the
children
immediately asked for permission to draw a picture of him on the
blackboard.  So spontaneous a request could not, of course, be
refused,
and, full of assurance, the would-be artist began to give his
impression
of the knight's appearance.  When the picture was finished, the
child
stood back for a moment to judge for himself of the result.  He put
down
the chalk and said sadly: "And I <i>thought</i> he was so handsome."

<p>
Nevertheless, except for the drawback of the other children seeing a
picture which might be inferior to their own mental vision, I should
quite approve of such experiments, as long as they are not taken as
literal data of what the children have really received.  It would,
however, be better not to have the picture drawn on a blackboard but
at
the child's private desk, to be seen by the teacher and not, unless
the
picture were exceptionally good, to be shown to the other children.

<p>
One of the best effects of such an experiment would be to show a
child
how difficult it is to give the impression one wishes to record, and
which would enable him later on to appreciate the beauty of such
work in
the hands of a finished artist.

<p>
I can anticipate the jeers with which such remarks would be received
by
the Futurist School, but, according to their own theory, I ought to
be
allowed to express the matter <i>as I see it,</i> however faulty the
vision may appear to them.[49]

<p>
QUESTION IX:  <i>In what way can the dramatic method of story-
telling be
used in ordinary class teaching?</i>

<p>
This is too large a question to answer fully in so general a survey
as
this work, but I should like to give one or two examples as to how
the
element of story-telling could be introduced.

<p>
I have always thought that the only way in which we could make
either a
history or literature lesson live, so as to take a real hold on the
mind
of the pupil at any age, would be that, instead of offering lists of
events, crowded into the fictitious area of one reign, one should
take a
single event, say in one lesson out of five, and give it in the most
splendid language and in the most dramatic manner.

<p>
To come to a concrete example: Supposing that one is talking to the
class of Greece, either in connection with its history, its
geography or
its literature, could any mere accumulation of facts give a clearer
idea
of the life of the people than a dramatically told story from Homer,
&AElig;schylus, Sophocles or Euripides?

<p>
What in the history of Iceland could give any more graphic idea of
the
whole character of the life and customs of the inhabitants than one
of
the famous sagas, such as "The Burning of Njal" or "The Death of
Gunnar"?

<p>
In teaching the history of Spain, what could make the pupils
understand
better the spirit of knight-errantry, its faults and its qualities,
than
a recital from "Don Quixote" or from the tale of "The Cid"?

<p>
In a word, the stories must appeal so vividly to the imagination
that
they will light up the whole period of history which we wish them to
illustrate and keep it alive in the memory for all time.

<p>
But quite apart from the dramatic presentation of history, there are
very great possibilities for the short story introduced into the
portrait of some great personage, insignificant in itself, but which
throws a sudden sidelight on his character, showing the mind behind
the
actual deeds; this is what I mean by using the dramatic method.

<p>
To take a concrete example: Suppose, in giving an account of the
life of
Napoleon, after enlarging upon his campaigns, his European policy,
his
indomitable will, one were suddenly to give an idea of his many-
sidedness by relating how he actually found time to compile a
catechism
which was used for some years in the elementary schools of France.
What
sidelights might be thrown in this way on such characters as Nero,
C&aelig;sar, Henry VIII, Luther, Goethe!

<p>
To take one example from these: Instead of making the whole career
of
Henry VIII center round the fact that he was a much-married man,
could
we not present his artistic side and speak of his charming
contributions
to music?

<p>
So much for the history lessons.  But could not the dramatic form
and
interest be introduced into our geography lessons?  Think of the
romance
of the Panama Canal, the position of Constantinople, as affecting
the
history of Europe, the shape of Greece, England as an island, the
position of Thibet [sic], the interior of Africa&mdash;to what
wonderful
story-telling would these themes lend themselves!

<p>
QUESTION X:  <i>Which should predominate in the story&mdash;the
dramatic
or the poetic element?</i>

<p>
This is a much debated point.  From experience I have come to the
conclusion that, though both should be found in the whole range of
stories, the dramatic element should prevail from the very nature of
the
presentation, and also because it reaches the larger number of
children,
at least of normal children.  Almost every child is dramatic, in the
sense that it loves action (not necessarily an action in which it
has to
bear a part).  It is the exceptional child who is reached by the
poetic
side, and just as on the stage the action must be quicker and more
concentrated than in a poem&mdash;than even a dramatic poem&mdash;
the
poetical side, which must be painted in more delicate colors or
presented in less obvious form, often escapes them.  Of course, the
very
reason why we must include the poetical element is that it is an
unexpressed need of most children.  Their need of the dramatic is
more

QUESTION XI:  <i>What is the educational value of humor in the
stories
told to our children?</i>

<p>
My answer to this is that humor means so much more than is usually
understood by this term.  So many people seem to think that to have
a
sense of humor is merely to be tickled by a funny element in a
story.
It surely means something much more subtle than this.  It is
Thackeray
who says: "If humor only meant laughter, but the humorist profess to
awaken and direct your love, your pity, your kindness, your scorn
for
untruth and pretension, your tenderness for the weak, the poor, the
oppressed, the unhappy."  So that, in our stories, the introduction
of
humor should not merely depend on the doubtful amusement that
follows on
a sense of incongruity.  It should inculcate a sense of proportion
brought about by an effort of imagination; it shows a child its real
position in the universe and prevents hasty conclusions.  It
shortens
the period of joy in horse-play and practical jokes.  It brings
about a
clearer perception of all situations, enabling the child to get the
point of view of another person.  It is the first instilling of
philosophy into the mind of a child and prevents much suffering
later on
when the blows of life fall upon him; for a sense of humor teaches
us at
an early age not to expect too much: and this philosophy can be
developed with cynicism or pessimism, without even destroying the <i
>
joie de vivre.</i>

<p>
One cannot, however, sufficiently emphasize the fact that these far-
reaching results can be brought about only by humor quite distinct
from
the broader fun and hilarity which have also their use in an
educational
scheme.

<p>
From my own experience, I have learned that development of humor is
with
most children extremely slow.  It <i>is</i> quite natural and quite
right that at first pure fun, obvious situations and elementary
jokes
should please them, but we can very gradually appeal to something
more
subtle, and if I were asked what story would educate our children
most
thoroughly in appreciation of humor, I should say that "Alice in
Wonderland" was the most effective.

<p>
What better object lesson could be given in humorous form of taking
somebody else's point of view than that given to <i>Alice</i> by the
<i>
Mock Turtle</i> in speaking of the <i>Whiting</i>&mdash;

<p>
"You know what they're like?"

<p>
"I believe so," said Alice.  "They have their tails in their mouths
&mdash;and they're all over crumbs."

<p>
"You're wrong about the crumbs,: said the Mock Turtle.
"Crumbs would all wash off in the sea."</p>

<p>
Or when <i>Alice</i> is speaking to the <i>Mouse</i> of her cat, and
says:

<p>
"She is such a dear quiet thing&mdash;and a capital one for catching
mice&mdash;&mdash;" and then suddenly realizes the point of view of
the
<i>Mouse,</i> who was "trembling down to the end of its tail."

<p>
Then, as an instance of how a lack of humor leads to illogical
conclusions (a condition common to most children), we have the
conversation between <i>Alice</i> and the <i>Pigeon</i>:

<p>
ALICE:  "But little girls eat quite as  much as serpents, you know."

<p>
PIGEON:  "I don't believe it.  But if they do, why then they're a
kind
of serpent, that's all I can say."</p>

<p>
Then, as an instance of how a sense of humor would prevent too much
self- importance:

<p>
"I have a right to think," said Alice sharply.

<p>
"Just about as much right," said the Duchess, "as pigs have to fly."

The following stories do not form a comprehensive selection; this I
have

them in

I regret that I have been unable to furnish many of the stories I

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align=center><a name="sturla">STURLA, THE HISTORIAN[50]</a></h4>

<p>
Then Sturla got ready to sail away with the king, and his name was
put
on the list.  He went on board before many men had come; he had a
sleeping bag and a travelling chest, and took his place on the
foredeck.
A little later the king came on to the quay, and a company of men
with
him.  Sturla rose and bowed, and bade the king "hail," but the king
answered nothing, and went aft along the ship to the quarter-deck.
They
sailed that day to go south along the coast.  But in the evening
when
men unpacked their provisions Sturla sat still, and no one invited
him
to mess.  Then a servant of the king's came and asked Sturla if he
had
any meat and drink.  Sturla said "NO."  Then the king's servant went
to
the king and spoke with him, out of hearing, and then went forward
to
Sturla and said: "You shall go to mess with Thorir Mouth and Erlend
Maw."  They took him into their mess, but rather stiffly.  When men
were
turning in to sleep, a sailor of the king's asked who should tell
them
stories.  There was little answer.  Then said he: "Sturla the
Icelander,
will you tell stories?"  "As you will," said Sturla.  So he told
them
the story of Huld, better and fuller than any one there had ever
heard
it told before.  Then many men pushed forward to the fore-deck,
wanting
to hear as clearly as might be, and there was a great crowd.  The
queen
asked: "What is that crowd on deck there?"  A man answered: "The men
are
listening to the story that the Icelander tells."  "What story is
that?"
said she.  He answers: "It is about a great troll-wife, and it is a
good
story and well told."  The king bade her pay no heed to that, and go
to
sleep.  She says: "I think this Icelander must be a good fellow, and
less to blame than he is reported."  The King was silent.

<p>
So the night passed, and the next morning there was no wind for
them,
and the king's ship lay in the same place.  Later in the day, when
men
sat at their drink, the king sent dishes from his table to Sturla.
Sturla's messmates were pleased with this:  "You bring better luck
than
we thought, if this sort of thing goes on."  After dinner the queen
sent
for Sturla and asked him to come to her and bring the troll-wife
story
along with him.  So Sturla went aft to the quarter-deck, and greeted
the
king and queen.  The king answered little, the queen well and
cheerfully.  She asked him to tell the same story he had told
overnight.
He did so, for a great part of the day.  When he finished, the queen
thanked him, and many others besides, and made him out in their
minds to
be a learned man and sensible.  But the king said nothing; only he
smiled a little.  Sturla thought he saw that the king's whole frame
of
mind was brighter than the day before.  So he said to the king that
he
had made a poem about him, and another about his father: "I would
gladly
get a hearing for them."  The queen said: "Let him recite his poem;
I am
told that he is the best of poets, and his poem will be excellent."
The
king bade him say on, if he would, and repeat the poem he professed
to
have made about him.  Sturla chanted it to the end.  The queen said:
"To
my mind that is a good poem."  The king said to her: "Can you follow
the
poem so clearly?"  "I would be fain to have you think so, Sir," said
the
queen.  The king said: "I have learned that Sturla is good at
verses."
Sturla took his leave of the king and queen and went to his place.
There was no sailing for the king all that day.  In the evening
before
he went to bed he sent for Sturla.  And when he came he greeted the
king
and said: "What will you have me to do, Sir?"  The king called for a
silver goblet full of wine, and drank some and gave it to Sturla and
said: A health to a friend in wine!" (<i>Vin skal til vinar drekka
</i>).
Sturla said: "God be praised for it!"  "Even so, " says the king,
"and
now I wish you to say the poem you have made about my father."
Sturla
repeated it: and when it was finished men praised it much and most
of
all the queen.  The king said: "To my thinking, you are a better
reciter
than the Pope."&mdash;<i>Sturlunga Saga,</i> vol.ii, p.269.</p>

<h4 align=center><a name="saga">A SAGA</a></h4

<p>
In the grey beginnings of the world, or ever the flower of justice
had
rooted in the heart, there lived among the daughters of men two
children, sisters, of one house.

<p>
In childhood did they leap and climb and swim with the men children
of
their race, and were nurtured on the same stories of gods and
heroes.

<p>
In maidenhood they could do all that a maiden might and more&mdash;
delve
could they no less than spin, hunt no less than weave, brew pottage
and
helm ships, wake the harp and tell the stars, face all danger and
laugh
at all pain.

<p>
Joyous in toil-time and rest-time were they as the days and years of
their youth came and went.  Death had spared their house, and
unhappiness knew they  none.  Yet often as at falling day they sat
before sleep round the hearth of red fire, listening with the
household
to the brave songs of gods and heroes, there would surely creep into
their hearts a shadow&mdash;the thought that whatever the years of
their
lives, and whatever the generous deeds, there would for them, as
women,
be no escape at the last from the dire mists of Hela, the fogland
beyond
the grave for all such as die not in battle; no escape for them from
Hela, and no place for ever for them or for their kind among the
glory-
crowned, sword-shriven heroes of echoing Valhalla.

<p>
That shadow had first fallen in their lusty childhood, had slowly
gathered darkness through the overflowing days of maidenhood, and
now,
in the strong tide of full womanhood, often lay upon their future as
the
moon Odin's wrath lies upon the sun.

<p>
But stout were they to face danger and laugh at pain, and for all
the
shadow upon their hope they lived brave and songful days&mdash;the
one a
homekeeper and in her turn a mother of men: the other unhusbanded,
but
gentle to ignorance and sickness and sorrow through the width and
length
of the land.

<p>
And thus, facing life fearlessly and ever with a smile, those two
women
lived even unto extreme old age, unto the one's children's
children's
children, labouring truly unto the end and keeping strong hearts
against
the dread day of Hela, and the fate-locked gates of Valhalla.</p>

<p>
But at the end a wonder.

<p>
As these sisters looked their last upon the sun, the one in the
ancestral homestead under the eyes of love, the other in a distant
land
among strange faces, behold the wind of Thor, and out of the deep of
heaven the white horses of Odin, All-Father, bearing Valkyrie,
shining
messengers of Valhalla.  And those two world-worn women, faithful in
all
their lives, were caught up in death in divine arms and borne far
from
the fogs of Hela to golden thrones among the battle heroes, upon
which
the Nornir, sitting at the loom of life, had from all eternity
graven
their names.

<p>
And from that hour have the gates of Valhalla been thrown wide to
all
faithful endeavour whether of man or woman.</p>

<h4 align=center><a name="legend">THE LEGEND OF ST. CHRISTOPHER</a>
</h4>

<p>
Christopher was of the lineage of the Canaaneans and he was of a
right
great stature, and had a terrible and fearful cheer and countenance.
And he was twelve cubits of length.  And, as it is read in some
histories, when he served and dwelled with the king of Canaaneans,
it
came in his mind that he would seek the greatest prince that was in
the
world and him he would serve and obey.

<p>
And so far he went that he came to a right great king, of whom the
renown generally was that he was the greatest of the world.  And
when
the king saw him received him into his service and made him to dwell
in
his court.

<p>
Upon a time a minstrel sung tofore him a song in which he named oft
the
devil.  And the king which was a Christian man, when he heard him
name
the devil, made anon the sign of the cross in his visage.  And when
Christopher saw that, he had great marvel what sign it was and
wherefore
the king made it.  And he demanded it of him.  And because the king
would not say, he said, "If thou tell me not, I shall no longer
dwell
with thee."  And then the king told to him saying,  "Alway when I
hear
the devil named, I fear that he should have power over me, and I
garnish
me with this sign that he grieve not nor annoy me."  Then
Christopher
said to him, "Thou doubtest the devil that he hurt thee not?  Then
is
the devil more mighty and greater than thou art.  I am then deceived
of
my hope and purpose; for I supposed that I had found the most mighty
and
the most greatest lord of the world.  But I commend thee to God, for
I
will go seek him to be my lord and I his servant."

<p>
And then he departed from this king and hasted him to seek the
devil.
And as he went by a great desert he saw a great company of knights.
Of
which a knight cruel and horrible came to him and demanded whither
he
went.  And Christopher answered to him and said, "I go to seek the
devil
for to be my master."  And he said, "I am he that thou seekest."
And
then Christopher was glad and bound himself to be his servant
perpetual,
and took him for his master and lord.

<p>
And as they went together by a common way, they found there a cross
erect and standing.  And anon as the devil saw the cross, he was
afeard
and fled, and left the right way and brought Christopher about by a
sharp desert, and after, when they were past the cross, he brought
him
to the highway that they had left.  And when Christopher saw that,
he
marvelled and demanded whereof he doubted that he had left high and
fair
way and had gone so far about by so hard desert.  And the devil
would
not tell him in no wise.  Then Christopher said to him, "If thou
wilt
not tell me I shall anon depart from thee and shall serve thee no
more."
Therefore the devil was constrained to tell him, and said "There was
a
man called Christ which was hanged on the cross, and when I see his
sign, I am sore afeard and flee from it wheresomever I find it."  To
whom Christopher said, "Then he is greater and more mightier than
thou,
when thou art afraid of his sign.  And I see well that I have
laboured
in vain since I have not founden the greatest lord of all the earth.
And I will serve thee no longer.  Go thy way then: for I will go
seek
Jesus Christ."

<P>
And when he had long sought and demanded where he should find
Christ,
at last he came into a great desert to an hermit that dwelled there.
And this hermit preached to him of Jesus Christ and informed him in
the
faith diligently.  And he said to him, "This king whom thou desirest
to
serve, requireth this service that thou must oft fast."  And
Christopher
said to him, "Require of me some other thing and I shall do it.  For
that which thou requirest I may not do."  And the hermit said, "Thou
must then wake and make many prayers."  And Christopher said to him,
"I
wot not what it is.  I may do no such thing."  And then the hermit
said
unto him, "Knowest thou such a river in which many be perished and
lost?"  To whom Christopher said, "I know it well."  Then said the
hermit, "Because thou art noble and high of stature and strong in
thy
members, thou shalt be resident by that river and shalt bear over
all
them that shall pass there.  Which shall be a thing right convenable
to
Our Lord Jesus Christ, whom thou desirest to serve, and I hope He
shall
shew Himself to thee."  Then said Christopher, "Certes, this service
may
I well do, and I promise to Him for to do it."

<p>
Then went Christopher to this river, and made there his habitation
for
him.  And he bare a great pole in his hand instead of a staff, by
which
he sustained him in the water; and bare over all manner of people
without ceasing.  And there he abode, thus doing, many days.

<p>
And on a time, as he slept in his lodge, he heard the voice of a
child
which called him and said, "Christopher, come out and bear me over."
Then he awoke and went out; but he found no man.  And when he was
again
in his house, he heard the same voice, and he ran out and found no
body.
The third time he was called, and came thither, and found a child
beside
the rivage of the river: which prayed him goodly to bear him over
the
water.  And then Christopher lift up the child on his shoulders and
took
his staff and entered in to the river for to pass.  And the water of
the
river arose and swelled more and more.  And the child was heavy as
lead.
And always as he went further the water increased and grew more, and
the
child more and more waxed heavy: in so much that Christopher had
great
anguish and feared to be drowned.  And when he was escaped with
great
pain and passed the water, and set the child aground, he said to the
child, "Child, thou hast put me in great peril.  Thou weighest
almost as
I had had all the world upon me.  I might bear no greater burden."
And
the child answered, "Christopher, marvel thou no thing.  For thou
hast
not only borne all the world upon thee; but thou hast borne Him that
created and made the world upon thy shoulders.  I am Jesus Christ,
the
king to whom thou servest in this work.  And that thou mayest know
that
I say to thee truth, set thy staff in the earth by the house, and
thou
shalt see to-morrow that it shall bear flowers and fruit."  And anon
he
vanished from his eyes.

<p>
And then Christopher set his staff in the earth and when he arose on
the
morrow, he found his staff like a palm-tree bearing flowers, leaves
and
dates.

<h4 align=center><a name="arthur">ARTHUR IN THE CAVE</a></h4>

<p>
Once upon a time a Welshman was walking on London Bridge, staring at
the
traffic and wondering why there were so many kites hovering about.
He
had come to London, after many adventures with thieves and
highwaymen,
which need not be related here, in charge of a herd of black Welsh
cattle.  He had sold them with much profit, and with jingling gold
in
his pocket he was going about to see the sights of the city.

<p>
He was carrying a hazel staff in his hand, for you must know that a
good
staff is as necessary to a drover as teeth are to his dogs.  He
stood
still to gaze at some wares in a shop (for at that time London
Bridge
was shops from beginning to end), when he noticed that a man was
looking
at his stick with a long fixed look.  The man after a while came to
him
and asked him where he came from.

<p>
"I come from my own country," said the Welshman, rather surlily, for
he
could not see what business the man had to ask such a question.

<p>
"Do not take it amiss," said the stranger: "if you will only answer
my
questions, and take my advice, it will be of greater benefit to you
than
you imagine.  Do you remember where you cut that stick?"

<p>
The Welshman was still suspicious, and said: "What does it matter
where
I cut it?"

<p>
"It matters," said the questioner, "because there is a treasure
hidden
near the spot where you cut that stick.  If you can remember the
place
and conduct me to it, I will put you in possession of great riches."

<p>
The Welshman now understood he had to deal with a sorcerer, and he
was
greatly perplexed as to what to do.  On the one hand, he was tempted
by
the prospect of wealth; on the other hand, he knew that the sorcerer
must have derived his knowledge from devils, and he feared to have
anything to do with the powers of darkness.  The cunning man strove
hard
to persuade him, and at length made him promise to shew the place
where
he cut his hazel staff.

<p>
The Welshman and the magician journeyed together to Wales.  They
went to
Craig y Dinas, the Rock of the Fortress, at the head of the Neath
valley, near Pont Nedd Fechan, and the Welshman, pointing to the
stock
or root of an old hazel, said: "This is where I cut my stick."

<p>
"Let us dig," said the sorcerer.  They digged until they came to a
broad, flat stone.  Prying this up, they found some steps leading
downwards.  They went down the steps and along a narrow passage
until
they came to a door.  "Are you brave?" asked the sorcerer; "will you
come in with me?"

<p>
"I will," said the Welshman, his curiosity getting the better of his
fear.

<p>
They opened the door, and a great cave opened out before them.
There
was a faint red light in the cave, and they could see everything.
The
first thing they came to was a bell.

<p>
"Do not touch that bell," said the sorcerer, "or it will be all over
with us both."

<p>
As they went further in, the Welshman saw that the place was not
empty.
There were soldiers lying down asleep, thousands of them, as far as
ever
the eye could see.  Each one was clad in bright armour, the steel
helmet
of each was on his head, the shining shield of each was on his arm,
the
sword of each was near his hand, each had his spear stuck in the
ground
near him, and each and all were asleep.

<p>
In the midst of the cave was a great round table at which sat
warriors
whose noble features and richly-dight armour proclaimed that they
were
not as the roll of common men.

<p>
Each of these, too, had his head bent down in sleep.  On a golden
throne
on the further side of the round table was a king of gigantic
stature
and august presence.  In his hand, held below the hilt, was a mighty
sword with scabbard and haft of gold studded with gleaming gems; on
his
head was a crown set with precious stones which flashed and glinted
like
so many points of fire.  Sleep had set its seal on his eyelids also.

<p>
"Are they asleep?" asked the Welshman, hardly believing his own
eyes.

<p>
"Yes, each and all of them," answered the sorcerer.  "But, if you
touch
yonder bell, they will all awake."

<p>
"How long have they been asleep?"

<p>
"For over a thousand years."

<p>
"Who are they?"

<p>
"Arthur's warriors, waiting for the time to come when they shall
destroy
all the enemy of the Cymry and re-possess the strand of Britain,
establishing their own king once more at Caer Lleon."

<p>
"Who are these sitting at the round table?"

<p>
"These are Arthur's knights&mdash;Owain, the son of Urien; Cai, the
son
of Cynyr; Gnalchmai, the son of Gwyar; Peredir, the son of Efrawe;
Geraint, the son of Erbin; Ciernay, the son of Celhddon; Edeyrn, the
son
of Nudd; Cymri, the son of Clydno."

<p>
"And on the golden throne?" broke in the Welshman.

<p>
"Is Arthur himself, with his sword Excalibur in his hand," replied
the
sorcerer.

<p>
Impatient by this time at the Welshman's questions, the sorcerer
hastened to a great heap of yellow gold on the floor of the cave.
He
took up as much as he could carry, and bade his companion do the
same.
"It is time for us to go," he then said, and he led the way towards
the
door by which they had entered.

<p>
But the Welshman was fascinated by the sight of the countless
soldiers
in their glittering arms&mdash;all asleep.

<p>
"How I should like to see them all awaking!" he said to himself.  "I
will touch the bell&mdash;I <i>must</i> see them all arising from
their
sleep."

<p>
When they came to the bell, he struck it until it rang through the
whole
place.  As soon as it rang, lo! the thousands of warriors leapt to
their
feet and the ground beneath them shook with the sound of the steel
arms.
And a great voice came from their midst: "Who rang the bell?  Has
the
day come?"

<p>
The sorcerer was so much frightened that he shook like an aspen
leaf.
He shouted in answer: "No, the day has not come.  Sleep on."

<p>
The mighty host was all in motion, and the Welshman's eyes were
dazzled
as he looked at the bright steel arms which illumined the cave as
with
the light of myriad flames of fire.

<p>
"Arthur," said the voice again, "awake; the bell has rung, the day
is
breaking.  Awake, Arthur the Great."

<p>
"No," shouted the sorcerer, "it is still night.  Sleep on, Arthur
the
Great."

<p>
A sound came from the throne.  Arthur was standing, and the jewels in
his
crown shone like bright stars above the countless throng.  His voice
was
strong and sweet like the sound of many waters, and he said:

<p>
"My warriors, the day has not come when the Black Eagle and the
Golden
Eagle shall go to war.  It is only a seeker after gold who has rung
the
bell.  Sleep on, my warriors; the morn of Wales has not yet dawned."

<p>
A peaceful sound like the distant sigh of the sea came over the
cave,
and in a trice the soldiers were all asleep again.  The sorcerer
hurried
the Welshman out of the cave, moved the stone back to its place and
vanished.

<p>
Many a time did the Welshman try to find his way into the cave
again,
but though he dug over every inch of the hill, he has never again
found
the entrance to Arthur's Cave.</p>

<h4 ALIGN=CENTER><a name="hafiz">HAFIZ, THE STONE-CUTTER</a></h4>

<p>
There was once a stone-cutter whose name was Hafiz, and all day long
he
chipped, chipped, chipped at his block.  And often he grew very
weary of
his task and he would say to himself impatiently, "Why should I not
have
pleasure and amusement as other folk have?"

<p>
One day, when the sun was very hot and when he felt specially weary,
he
suddenly heard the sound of many feet, and, looking up from his
work, he
saw a great procession coming his way.  It was the King, mounted on
a
splendid charger, all his soldiers to the right, in their shining
armour, and the servants to the left, dressed in gorgeous clothing,
ready to do his behests.

<p>
And Hafiz said: "How splendid to be a King!  If only I could be a
King,
if only for ten minutes, so that I might know what it feels like!"
And
then, even as he spoke, he seemed to be dreaming, and in his dream
he
sang this little song:

<p>
"Ah me!  Ah me!<br>
If Hafiz only the King could be!"[51]

<p>
And then a voice from the air around seemed to answer him and to
say:

<p>
"Be thou the King."

<p>
And Hafiz became the King, and he it was that sat on the splendid
charger, and they were his soldiers to the right and his servants to
the
left.  And Hafiz said: "I am King, and there is no one stronger in
the
whole world than I."

<p>
But soon, in spite of the golden canopy over his head, Hafiz began
to
feel the terrible heat of the rays of the sun, and soon he noticed
that
the soldiers and servants were weary, that his horse drooped, and
that
he, Hafiz, was overcome, and he said angrily: "What!  Is there
something
stronger in the world than a King?"  And, almost without knowing it,
he
again sang his song&mdash;more boldly than the first time:

<p>
"Ah me!  Ah me!<br>
If Hafiz only the Sun could be!"

<p>
And the Voice answered:

<p>"Be thou the Sun."

<p>
And Hafiz became the Sun, and shone down upon the Earth, but,
because he
did not know how to shine very wisely, he shone very fiercely, so
that
the crops dried up, and folk grew sick and died.  And then there
arose
from the East a little cloud which slipped between Hafiz and the
Earth,
so that he could no longer shine down upon it, and he said:  "Is
there
something stronger in the world than the Sun?"

<p>
"Ah me!  Ah me!<br>
If Hafiz only the Cloud could be!"

<p>
"Be thou the Cloud.

<p>
And Hafiz became the Cloud, and rained down water upon the Earth,
but,
because he did not know how to do so wisely, there fell so much rain
that all the little rivulets became great rivers, and all the great
rivers overflowed their banks, and carried everything before them in
swift torrent&mdash;all except one great rock which stood unmoved.
And
Hafiz said: "Is there something stronger than the Cloud?"

<p>
"Ah me!  Ah me!<br>
If Hafiz only the Rock could be!"

<p>
And the Voice said:

<p>
"Be thou the Rock."

<p>
And Hafiz became the Rock, and the Cloud disappeared and the waters
went
down.

<p>
And Hafiz the Rock, saw coming towards him a man&mdash;but he could
not
see the face.  As the man approached he suddenly raised a hammer and
struck Hafiz, so that he felt it through all his stony body.  And
Hafiz
said: "Is there something stronger in the world than the Rock?

<p>
"Ah me!  Ah me!<br>
If Hafiz only that Man might be!"

<p>
And the Voice said:

<p>
"Be thou&mdash;Thyself."

<p>
And Hafiz seized the hammer and said:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The Sun was stronger than the King, the Cloud was stronger than the
sun, the Rock was stronger then the Cloud, but I, Hafiz, was
stronger
than all."

<h4 align=center><a name="health">TO YOUR GOOD HEALTH</a></h4>
<P align=center>(<i>From the Russian</i>)</p>

<p>
Long long ago there lived a King who was such a mighty monarch that
whenever he sneezed everyone in the whole country had to say, "To
your
good health!"  Everyone said it except the Shepherd with the bright
blue
eyes, and he would not say it.

<p>
The King heard of this and was very angry, and sent for the Shepherd
to
appear before him.

<p>
The Shepherd came and stood before the throne, where the King sat
looking very grand and powerful.  But however grand or powerful he
might
be, the Shepherd did not feel a bit afraid of him.

<p>
"Say at once 'To my good health'!" cried the King.

<p>
"To my good health," replied the Shepherd.

<p>
"To mine&mdash;to <i>mine,</i> you rascal, you vagabond!" stormed
the
King.

<p>
"To mine, to mine, Your Majesty," was the answer.

<p>
"But to <i>mine</i>&mdash;to my own!" roared the King, and beat on
his
breast in a rage.

<p>
"Well, yes; to mine, of course, to my own," cried the Shepherd, and
gently tapped his breast.

<p>
The King was beside himself with fury and did not know what to do,
when
the Lord chamberlain interfered:

<p>
"Say at once&mdash;say this very moment, 'To your health, Your
Majesty,'
for if you don't say it you will lose your life," he whispered.

<p>
"No, I won't say it tell I get the Princess for my wife," was the
Shepherd's answer.

<p>
Now the Princess was sitting on a little throne beside the King, her
father, and she look as sweet and lovely as a little golden dove.
When
she heard what the Shepherd said, she could not help laughing, for
there
is no denying the fact that this young shepherd with the blue eyes
pleased her very much; indeed, he pleased her better than any king's
son
she had yet seen.

<p>
But the King was not as pleasant as his daughter, and gave orders to
throw the Shepherd into the white bear's pit.

<p>
The guards led him away and thrust him into the pit with the white
bear,
who had had nothing to eat for two days and was very hungry.  The
door
of the pit was hardly closed when the bear rushed at the shepherd;
but
when it saw his eyes it was so frightened that it was ready to eat
itself.  It shrank away into a corner and gazed at him from there,
and
in spite of being so famished, did not dare to touch him, but sucked
its
own paws from sheer hunger.  The Shepherd felt that if he once
removed
his eyes off the beast he was a dead man, and in order to keep
himself
awake he made songs and sang them, and so the night went by.

<p>
Next morning the Lord Chamberlain came to see the Shepherd's bones,
and
was amazed to find him alive and well.  He led him to the King, who
fell
into a furious passion, and said:

<p>
"Well, you have learned what it is to be very near death, and now
will
you say, 'To my very good health'?"

<p>
But the Shepherd answered:

<p>
"I am not afraid of ten deaths!  I will only say it if I may have
the
Princess for my wife."

<p>
"Then go to your death," cried the King, and ordered him to be
thrown
into the den with the wild boars.

<p>
The wild boars had not been fed for a week, and when the Shepherd
was
thrust into their den they rushed at him to tear him to pieces.  But
the
Shepherd took a little flute out of the sleeve of his jacket, and
began
to play a merry tune, on which the wild boars first of all shrank
shyly
away, and then got up on their hind legs and danced gaily.  The
Shepherd
would have given anything to be able to laugh, they looked so funny;
but
he dared not stop playing, for he knew well enough that the moment
he
stopped they would fall upon him and tear him to pieces.  His eyes
were
of no use to him here, for he could not have stared ten wild boars
in
the face at once; so he kept playing, and the wild boars danced very
slowly, as if in a minuet; then by degrees he played faster and
faster,
till they could hardly twist and turn quickly enough, and ended by
all
falling over each other in a heap, quite exhausted and out of
breath.

<p>
Then the Shepherd ventured to laugh at last; and he laughed so long
and
so loud that when the Lord Chamberlain came early in the morning,
expecting to find only his bones, the tears were still running down
his
cheeks from laughter.

<p>
As soon as the King was dressed the Shepherd was again brought
before
him; but he was more angry than ever to think the wild boars had not
torn the man to bits, and he said:

<p>
"Well, you have learned what it feels to be near ten deaths, <i>now
</i>
say 'To my good health'!"

<p>
But the shepherd broke in with:

<p>
"I do not fear a hundred deaths; and I will only say it if I may
have
the Princess for my wife."

<p>
"Then go to a hundred deaths!" roared the King, and ordered the
Shepherd
to be thrown down the deep vault of scythes.

<p>
The guards dragged him away to a dark dungeon, in the middle of
which
was a deep well with sharp scythes all round it.  At the bottom of
the
well was a little light by which one could see, if anyone was thrown
in,
whether he had fallen to the bottom.

<p>
When the Shepherd was dragged to the dungeon he begged the guards to
leave him alone a little while that he might look down into the pit
of
scythes; perhaps he might after all make up his mind to say, "To
your
good health" to the King.

<p>
So the guards left him alone, and he stuck up his long stick near
the
wall, hung his cloak round the stick and put his hat on the top.  He
also hung his knapsack up beside the cloak, so that it might seem to
have some body within it.  When this was done, he called out to the
guards and said that he had considered the matter, but after all he
could not make up his mind to say what the King wished.

<p>
The guards came in, threw the hat and cloak, knapsack and stick all
down
in the well together, watched to see how they put out the light at
the
bottom, and came away, thinking that now there was really an end to
the
Shepherd.  But he had hidden in a dark corner, and was now laughing
to
himself all the time.

<p>
Quite early next morning came the Lord Chamberlain with a lamp, and
he
nearly fell backwards with surprise when he saw the Shepherd alive
and
well.  He brought him to the King, whose fury was greater than ever,
but
who cried:

<p>
"Well, now you have been near a hundred deaths; will you say, 'To
your
good health'?"

<p>
But the Shepherd only gave the answer:

<p>
"I won't say it till the Princess is my wife."

<p>
"Perhaps, after all, you may do it for less," said the King, who saw
that there was no chance of making away with the shepherd; and he
ordered the state coach to be got ready; then he made the Shepherd
get
in with him and sit beside him, and ordered the coachman to drive to
the
silver wood.

<p>
When they reached it, he said:

<p>
"Do you see this silver wood?  Well, if you will say 'To your good
health,' I will give it to you."

<p>
The shepherd turned hot and cold by turns, but he still persisted:

<p>
"I will not say it till the Princess is my wife."

<p>
The King was much vexed; he drove further on till they came to a
splendid castle, all of gold, and then he said:

<p>
"Do you see this golden castle?  Well, I will give you that too, the
silver wood and the gold castle, if only you will say one thing to
me:
'To your good health.'"

<p>
The Shepherd gaped and wondered, and was quite dazzled but he still
said:

<p>
"No, I will not say it till I have the Princess for my wife."

<p>
This time the King was overwhelmed with grief, and gave orders to
drive
on to the diamond pond and there he tried once more:

<p>
"You shall have the all&mdash;all, if you will but say 'To your good
health.'"

<p>
The Shepherd had to shut his staring eyes tight not to be dazzled
with
the brilliant pond, but still he said:

<p>
"No, no; I will not say it till I have the Princess for my wife."

<p>
Then the King saw that all his efforts were useless, and that he
might
as well give in; so he said:

<p>
"Well, well, it is all the same to me&mdash;I will give you my
daughter
to wife; but then you really must say to me, 'To your good health.'"

<p>
"Of course I'll say it; why should I not say it?  It stands to
reason
that I shall say it then."

<p>
At this the King was more delighted than anyone could have believed.
He made it known all through the country that there were going to be
great rejoicings, as the Princess was going to be married.  And
everyone
rejoiced to think that the Princess who had refused so many royal
suitors, should have ended by falling in love with the staring-eyed
Shepherd.

<p>
There was such a wedding as had never been seen.  Everyone ate and
drank
and danced.  Even the sick were feasted, and quite tiny new-born
children had presents given them.  But the greatest merrymaking was
in
the King's palace; there the best bands played and the best food was
cooked.  A crowd of people sat down to table, and all was fun and
merrymaking.

<p>
And when the groomsman, according to custom, brought in the great
boar's
head on a big dish and placed it before the King, so that he might
carve
it and give everyone a share, the savoury smell was so strong that
the
King began to sneeze with all his might.

<p>
"To your very good health!" cried the Shepherd before anyone else,
and
the King was so delighted that he did not regret having given him
his
daughter.

<p>
In time, when the old King died, the Shepherd succeeded him.  He
made a
very good king, and never expected his people to wish him well
against
their wills: but, all the same, everyone did wish him well, because
they
loved him.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align=center><a name="cock">THE PROUD COCK</a></h4>

<p>
There was once a cock who grew so dreadfully proud that he would
have
nothing to say to anybody.  He left his house, it being far beneath
his
dignity to have any trammel of that sort in his life, and as for his
former acquaintance, he cut them all.

<p>
One day, whilst walking about, he came to a few little sparks of
fire
which were nearly dead.

<p>
They cried out to him: "Please fan us with your wings, and we shall
come
to the full vigour of life again."

<p>
But he did not deign to answer, and as he was going away one of the
sparks said; "Ah well! we shall die, but our big brother, the Fire
will
pay you out for this one day."

<p>
On another day he was airing himself in a meadow, showing himself
off in
a very superb set of clothes.  A voice calling from somewhere said:
"Please be so good as to drop us into the water again."

<p>
He looked about and saw a few drops of water: they had got separated
from their friends in the river, and were pining away with grief.
"Oh!
please be so good as to drop us into the water again," they said;
but,
without any answer, he drank up the drops.  He was too proud and a
great
deal too big to talk to a poor little puddle of water; but the drops
said: "Our big brother, the Water, will one day take you in hand,
you
proud and senseless creature."

<p>
Some days afterwards, during a great storm of rain, thunder and
lightning, the cock took shelter in a little empty cottage, and shut
to
the door; and he thought: "I am clever; I am in comfort.  What fools
people are to top out in a storm like this!  What's that?" thought
he.
"I never heard a sound like that before."

<p>
In a little while it grew much louder, and when a few minutes had
passed, it was a perfect howl.  "Oh!" thought he, "this will never
do.
I must stop it somehow.  But what is it I have to stop?"

<p>
He soon found it was the wind, shouting through the keyhole, so he
plugged up the keyhole with a bit of clay, and then the wind was
able to
rest.  He was very tired with whistling so long through the keyhole,
and
he said: "Now, if ever I have at any time a chance of doing a good
turn
to that princely domestic fowl, I well do it."

<p>
Weeks afterwards, the cock looked in at a house door: he seldom went
there, because the miser to whom the house belonged almost starved
himself, and so, of course, there was nothing over for anybody else.

<p>
To his amazement the cock saw the miser bending over a pot on the
fire.
At last the old fellow turned round to get a spoon with which to
stir
his pot, and then the cock, waking up, looked in and saw that the
miser
was making oyster-soup, for he had found some oyster-shells in an
ash-
pit, and to give the mixture a colour he had put in a few halfpence
in
the pot.

<p>
The miser chanced to turn quickly round, while the cock was peering
into
the saucepan, and, chuckling to himself, he said: "I shall have
chicken
broth after all."

<p>
He tripped up the cock into the pot and shut the lid on.  The bird,
feeling warm, said: "Water, water, don't boil!"  But the water only
said: "You drank up my young brothers once: don't ask a favour of <i
>
me."</i>

<p>
Then he called out to the Fire: "Oh! kind Fire, don't boil the
water."
But the fire replied: "You once let my young sisters die: you cannot
expect any mercy from me."  So he flared up and boiled the water all
the
faster.

<p>
At last, when the cock got unpleasantly warm, he thought of the
wind,
and called out: "Oh, Wind, come to my help!" and the Wind said:
"Why,
there is that noble domestic bird in trouble.  I will help him."  So
he
came down the chimney, blew out the fire, blew the lid off the pot,
and
blew the cock far away into the air, and at last settled him on a
steeple, where the cock remained ever since.  And people say that
the
halfpence which were in the pot when it was boiling have given him
the
queer brown colour he still wears.

<p>&mdash;<i>From the Spanish</i>.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 ALIGN=CENTER><a name="sneg">SNEGOURKA</a></h4>

<p>
There lived once, in Russia, a peasant and his wife who would have
been
as happy as the day is long, if only God had given them a little
child.

<p>
One day, as they were watching the children playing in the snow, the
man
said to the woman:

<P
>"Wife, shall we go out and help the children make a snowball?"

<p>
But the wife answered, smiling:

<p>
"Nay, husband, but since God has given us no little child, let us go
and
fashion one from the snow."

<p>
And she put on her long blue cloak, and he put on his long brown
coat,
and they went out onto the crisp snow, and began to fashion the
little
child.

<p>
First, they made the feet and the legs and the little body, and then
they took a ball of snow for the head.  And at that moment a
stranger in
a long cloak, with his hat well drawn over his face, passed that
way,
and said: "Heaven help your undertaking!"

<p>
And the peasants crossed themselves and said:

<p>
"It is well to ask help from Heaven in all we do."

<p>
Then they went on fashioning the little child.  And they made two
holes
for the eyes and formed the nose and the mouth.  And then&mdash;
wonder
of wonders&mdash;the little child came alive, and breath came from
its
nostrils and parted lips.

<p>
And the man was feared, and said to his wife: "What have we done?"

<p>
And the wife said: "This is the little girl child God has sent us."
And
she gathered it into her arms, and the loose snow fell away from the
little creature.  Her hair became golden and her eyes were as blue
as
forget-me-nots&mdash;but there was no colour in her cheeks, because
there was no blood in her veins.

<p>
In a few days she was like a child of three or four, and in a few
weeks
she seemed to be the age of nine or ten, and ran about gaily and
prattled with the other children, who loved her so dearly, though
she
was so different from them.

<p>
Only, happy as she was, and dearly as her parents loved her, there
was
one terror in her life, and that was the sun.  And during the day
she
would run and hide herself in cool, damp places away from the
sunshine,
and this the other children could not understand.

<p>
As the Spring advanced and the days grew longer and warmed, little
Snegourka (for this was the name by which she was known) grew paler
and
thinner, and her mother would often ask her: "What ails you, my
darling?" and Snegourka would say: "Nothing, Mother but I wish the
sun
were not so bright."

<p>
One day, on St. John's Day, the children of the village came to
fetch
her for a day in the woods, and they gathered flowers for her and
did
all they to make her happy, but it was only when the great red sun
went
down that Snegourka drew a deep breath of relief and spread her
little
hands out to the cool evening air.  And the boys, glad at her
gladness,
said: "Let us do something for Snegourka.  Let us light a bonfire."
And Snegourka not knowing what a bonfire was, she clapped her hands
and
was as merry and eager as they.  And she helped them gather the
sticks,
and then they all stood round the pile and the boys set fire to the
wood.

<p>
Snegourka stood watching the flames and listening to the crackle of
the
wood: and then suddenly they heard a tiny sound&mdash;and looking at
the
place where Snegourka had been standing, they saw nothing but a
little
snow-drift fast melting.  And they called and called, "Snegourka!
Snegourka!" thinking she had run into the forest.  But there was no
answer.  Snegourka had disappeared from this life as mysteriously as
she
had come into it.

<h4 align=center><a name="nixie">THE WATER NIXIE</a></h4>

<p>
The river was so clear because it was the home of a very beautiful
Water
Nixie who lived in it, and who sometimes could emerge from her home
and
sit in woman's form upon the bank.  She had a dark green smock upon
her,
the colour of the water-weed that waves as the water wills it, deep,
deep down.  And in her long wet hair were the white flowers of the
water-violet, and she held a reed mace in her hand.  Her face was
very
sad because she had lived a long life, and known so many adventures,
ever since she was a baby, which was nearly a hundred years ago.
For
creatures of the streams and trees live a long, long time, and when
they
die they lose themselves in Nature.  That means that they are
forever
clouds, or trees, or rivers, and never have the form of men and
women
again.

<p>
All water creatures would live, if they might choose it, in the sea,
where they are born.  It is in the sea they float hand-in-hand upon
the
crested billows, and sink deep in the great troughs of the strong
waves,
that are green as jade.  They follow the foam and lose themselves in
the
wide ocean&mdash;</p>

<p align=center>
"Where great whales come sailing by,<br>
Sail and sail with unshut eye;"</p>

<p>
and they store in the Sea King's palace the golden phosphor of the
sea.
But this Water Nixie had lost her happiness through not being good.
She
had forgotten many things that had been told her, and she had done
many
things that grieved others.  She had stolen somebody else's property
&mdash;quite a large bundle of happiness&mdash;which belonged
elsewhere
and not to her.  Happiness is generally made to fit the person who
owns
it, just as do your shoes, or clothes; so that when you take someone
else's it's very little good to you, for it fits badly, and you can
never forget it isn't yours.

<p>
So what with one thing and another, this Water Nixie had to be
punished,
and the Queen of the Sea had banished her from the waves.[52]

<p>
"You shall live for a long time in little places where you will
weary of
yourself.  You will learn to know yourself so well that everything
you
want will seem too good for you, and you will cease to claim it.
And
so, in time, you shall get free."

<p>
Then the Nixie had to rise up and go away, and be shut into the
fastness
of a very small space, according to the words of the Queen.  And
this
small space was&mdash;a tear.

<p>
At first she could hardly express her misery, and by thinking so
continuously of the wideness and savour of the sea, she brought a
dash
of the brine with her, that makes the saltness of our tears.  She
became
many times smaller than her own stature; even then, by standing
upright
and spreading wide her arms, she touched with her finger-tips the
walls
of her tiny crystal home.  How she longed that this tear might be
wept,
and the walls of her prison shattered!  But the owner of this tear
was
of a very proud nature, and she was so sad that tears seemed to her
in
no wise to express her grief.

<p>
She was a Princess who lived in a country that was not her home.
What
were tears to her?  If she could have stood on the top of the very
highest hill and with both hands caught the great winds of heaven,
strong as they, and striven with them, perhaps she might have felt
as if
she expressed all she knew.  Or, if she could have torn down the
stars
from the heavens, or cast her mantle over the sun.  But tears!
Would
they have helped to tell her sorrow?  You cry if you soil your
copybook,
don't you? or pinch your hand?  So you may imagine the Nixie's home
was
a safe one, and she turned round and round in the captivity of that
tear.

<p>
For twenty years she dwelt in that strong heart, till she grew to be
accustomed to her cell.  At last, in this wise came her release.

<p>
An old gipsy came one morning to the Castle and begged to see the
Princess.  She must see her, she cried.  And the Princess came down
the
steps to meet her, and the gipsy gave her a small roll of paper, but
in
the midst of the page was a picture, small as the picture reflected
in
the iris of an eye.  The picture shewed a hill, with one tree on the
sky-line, and a long road wound round the hill.

<p>
And suddenly in the Princess' memory a voice spoke to her.  Many
sounds
she heard, gathered up into one great silence, like the quiet there
is
in forest spaces, when it is Summer and the green is deep:&mdash;</p
>

<P align=center>
"Blessed are they that have the home longing,<br>
For they shall go home."</p>


<p>
Then the Princess gave the gipsy two golden pieces, and went up to
her
chamber, and long that night she sat, looking out upon the sky.

<p>
She had no need to look upon the honeyed scroll, though she held it
closely.  Clearly before her did she see that small picture: the
hill,
and the tree, and the winding road, imaged as if mirrored in the
iris of
an eye.  And in her memory she was upon that road, and the hill rose
beside her, and the little tree was outlined, every twig of it,
against
the sky.

<p>
And as she saw all this, an overwhelming love of the place arose in
her,
a love of that certain bit of country that was so sharp and strong,
that
it stung and swayed her, as she leaned on the window-sill.

<p>
And because the love of a country is one of the deepest loves you
may
feel, the band of her control was loosened, and the tears came
welling
to her eyes.  Up they brimmed and over in salty rush and follow,
dimming
her eyes, magnifying everything, speared for a moment on her
eyelashes,
then shimmering to their fall.  And at last came the tear that held
the
disobedient Nixie.

<p>
Splish! it fell.  And she was free.

<p>
If you could have seen how pretty she looked standing there, about
the height of a grass-blade, wringing out her long wet hair.  Every
bit
of moisture she wrung out of it, she was so glad to be quit of that
tear.  Then she raised her two arms above her in one delicious
stretch,
and if you had been the size of a mustard-seed perhaps you might
have
heard her laughing.  Then she grew a little, and grew and grew, till
she
was about the height of a bluebell, and as slender to see.

<p>
She stood looking at the splash on the window-sill that had been her
prison so long, and then with three steps of her bare feet, she
reached
the jessamine that was growing by the window, and by this she swung
herself to the ground.

<p>
Away she sped over the dew-drenched meadows till she came to the
running
brook, and with all her longing in her outstretched hands, she
kneeled
down by the crooked willows among all the comfry and the
loosestrife,
and the yellow irises and the reeds.

<p>
Then she slid into the wide, cool stream.</p>

PAMELA TENNANT (LADY GLENCONNER).</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align=center><a name="rose">THE BLUE ROSE</a></h4>

<p>
There lived once upon a time in China a wise Emperor who had one
daughter.  His daughter was remarkable for her perfect beauty.  Her
feet
were the smallest in the world; her eyes were long and slanting and
bright as brown onyxes, and when you heard her laugh it was like the
listening to a tinkling stream or to the chimes of a silver bell.
Moreover, the Emperor's daughter was as wise as she was beautiful,
and
she chanted the verse of the great poets better than anyone in the
land.
The Emperor was old in years; his son was married and had begotten a
son; he was, therefore, quite happy with regard to the succession to
the
throne, but he wished before he died to see his daughter wedded to
someone who should be worthy of her.

<p>
Many suitors presented themselves to the palace as soon as it became
know that the Emperor desired a son-in-law, but when they reached
the
palace they were met by the Lord Chamberlain, who told them that the
Emperor had decided that only the man who found and brought back the
blue rose should marry his daughter.  The suitors were much puzzled
by
this order.  What was the blue rose and where was it to be found?
In
all, a hundred and fifty at once put away from them all thought of
winning the hand of the Emperor's daughter, since they considered
the
condition imposed to be absurd.

<p>
The other hundred set about trying to find the blue rose.  One of
them
&mdash;his name was Ti-Fun-Ti&mdash;he was a merchant and was
immensely
rich, at once went to the largest shop in the town and said to the
shopkeeper, "I want a blue rose, the best you have."

<p>
The shopkeeper, with many apologies, explained that he did not stock
blue roses.  He had red roses in profusion, white, pink and yellow
roses, but no blue roses.  There had hitherto been no demand for the
article.

<p>
"Well," said Ti-Fun-Ti, "you must get one for me.  I do not mind how
much money it costs, but I must have a blue rose."

<p>
The shopkeeper said he would do his best, but he feared it would be
an
expensive article and difficult to procure.  Another of the suitors,
whose name I have forgotten, was a warrior, and extremely brave; he
mounted his horse, and taking with him a hundred archers and a
thousand
horsemen, he marched into the territory of the King of the Five
Rivers,
whom he knew to be the richest king in the world and the possessor
of
the rarest treasures, and demanded of him the blue rose, threatening
him
with a terrible doom should he be reluctant to give it up.

<p>
The King of the Five Rivers, who disliked soldiers, and had a horror
of
noise, physical violence, and every kind of fuss (his bodyguard was
armed solely with fans and sunshades), rose from the cushions on
which
he was lying when the demand was made, and, tinkling a small bell,
said
to the servant who straightway appeared, "Fetch me the blue rose."

<p>
The servant retired and returned presently bearing on a silken
cushion a
large sapphire which was carved so as to imitate a full-blown rose
with
all its petals.

<p>
"This," said the king of the Five Rivers, "is the blue rose.  You
are
welcome to it."

<p>
The warrior took it, and after making brief, soldier-like thanks, he
went straight back to the Emperor's palace, saying that he had lost
no
time in finding the blue rose.  He was ushered into the presence of
the
Emperor, who as soon as he heard the warrior's story and saw the
blue
rose which had been brought sent for his daughter and said to her:
"This
intrepid warrior has brought you what he claims to be the blue rose.
Has he accomplished the quest?"

<p>
The Princess took the precious object in her hands, and after
examining
it for a moment, said: "This is not a rose at all.  It is a
sapphire; I
have no need of precious stones."  And the warrior went away in
discomfiture.

<p>
The merchant, hearing of the warrior's failure, was all the more
anxious
to win the prize.  He sought the shopkeeper and said to him: "Have
you
got me the blue rose?"  I trust you have; because, if not, I shall
most
assuredly be the means of your death.  My brother-in-law is chief
magistrate, and I am allied by marriage to all the chief officials
in
the kingdom."

<p>
The shopkeeper turned pale and said: "Sir, give me three days and I
will
procure you the rose without fail."  The merchant granted him the
three
days and went away.  Now the shopkeeper was at his wit's end as to
what
to do, for he knew well there was no such thing as a blue rose.  For
two
days he did nothing but moan and wring his hands, and on the third
day
he went to his wife and said, "Wife, we are ruined."

<p>
But his wife, who was a sensible woman, said: "Nonsense.  If there
is
no such thing as a blue rose we must make one.  Go to the chemist
and
ask him for a strong dye which well change a white rose into a blue
one."

<p>
So the shopkeeper went to the chemist and asked him for a dye, and
the
chemist gave him a bottle of red liquid, telling him to pick a white
rose and to dip its stalk into the liquid and the rose would turn
blue.
The shopkeeper did as he was told; the rose turned into a beautiful
blue
and the shopkeeper took it to the merchant, who at once went with it
to
the palace saying that he had found the blue rose.

<p>
He was ushered into the presence of the Emperor, who as soon as he
saw
the blue rose sent for his daughter and said to her: "This wealthy
merchant has brought you what he claims to be the blue rose.  Has he
accomplished the quest?"

<p>
The Princess took the flower in her hands and after examining it for
a
moment said: "This is a white rose, its stalk has been dipped in a
poisonous dye and it has turned blue.  Were a butterfly to settle
upon
it it would die of the potent fume.  Take it back.  I have no need
of a
dyed rose." And she returned it to the merchant with many elegantly
expressed thanks.

<p>
The other ninety-eight suitors all sought in various ways for the
blue
rose.  Some of them traveled all over the world seeking it; some of
them
sought the aid of wizards and astrologers, and one did not hesitate
to
invoke the help of the dwarfs that live underground; but all of
them,
whether they traveled in far countries or took counsel with wizards
and
demons or sat pondering in lonely places, failed to find the blue
rose.

<p>
At last they all abandoned the quest except the Lord Chief Justice,
who
was the most skillful lawyer and statesman in the country.  After
thinking over the matter for several months he sent for the most
famous
artist in the country and said to him: "Make me a china cup.  Let it
be
milk-white in colour and perfect in shape, and paint on it a rose, a
blue rose."

<p>
The artist made obeisance and withdrew, and worked for two months at
the Lord Chief Justice's cup.  In two months' time it was finished,
and
the world has never seen such a beautiful cup, so perfect in
symmetry,
so delicate in texture, and the rose on it, the blue rose, was a
living
flower, picked in fairyland and floating on the rare milky surface
of
the porcelain.  When the Lord Chief Justice saw it he gasped with
surprise and pleasure, for he was a great lover of porcelain, and
never
in his life had he seen such a piece.  He said to himself, "Without
doubt the blue rose is here on this cup and nowhere else."

<p>
So, after handsomely rewarding the artist, he went to the Emperor's
palace and said that he had brought the blue rose.  He was ushered
into
the Emperor's presence, who as he saw the cup sent for his daughter
and
said to her: "This eminent lawyer has brought you what he claims to
be
the blue rose.  Has he accomplished the quest?"

<p>
The Princess took the bowl in her hands, and after examining it for
a
moment said: "This bowl is the most beautiful piece of china I have
ever
seen.  If you are kind enough to let me keep it I will put it aside
until I receive the blue rose.  For so beautiful is it that no other
flower is worthy to be put in it except the blue rose."

<p>
The Lord Chief Justice thanked the Princess for accepting the bowl
with
many elegantly turned phrases, and he went away in discomfiture.

<p>
After this there was no one in the whole country who ventured on the
quest of the blue rose.  It happened that not long after the Lord
Chief
Justice's attempt a strolling minstrel visited the kingdom of the
Emperor.  One evening he was playing his one-stringed instrument
outside
a dark wall.  It was a summer's evening, and the sun had sunk in a
glory
of dusty gold, and in the violet twilight one or two stars were
twinkling like spearheads.  There was an incessant noise made by the
croaking of frogs and the chatter of grasshoppers.  The minstrel was
singing a short song over and over again to a monotonous tune.  The
sense of it was something like this:</p>

<P align=center>
I watched beside the willow trees<br>
The river, as the evening fell,<br>
The twilight came and brought no breeze,<br>
Nor dew, nor water for the well.</p>

<P align=center>
When from the tangled banks of grass<br>
A bird across the water flew,<br>
And in the river's hard grey glass<br>
I saw a flash of azure blue.</p>

<p>
As he sang he heard a rustle on the wall, and looking up he saw a
slight
figure white against the twilight, beckoning him.  He walked along
under
the wall until he came to a gate, and there someone was waiting for
him,
and he was gently led into the shadow of a dark cedar tree.  In the
dim
twilight he saw two bright eyes looking at him, and he understood
their
message.  In the twilight a thousand meaningless nothings were
whispered
in the light of the stars, and the hours fled swiftly.  When the
East
began to grow light, the Princess (for it was she) said it was time
to
go.

<p>
"But," said the minstrel, "to-morrow I shall come to the palace and
ask
for your hand."

<p>
"Alas!" said the Princess, "I would that were possible, but my
father
has made a foolish condition that only he may wed me who finds the
blue
rose."

<p>
"That is simple," said the minstrel.  "I will find it."  And they
said
good night to each other.

<p>
The next morning the minstrel went to the palace, and on his way he
picked a common white rose from a wayside garden.  He was ushered
into
the Emperor's presence, who sent for his daughter and said to her:
"This
penniless minstrel has brought you what he claims to be the blue
rose.
Has he accomplished the quest?"

<p>
The Princess took the rose in her hands and said: "Yes, this is
without
doubt the blue rose."

<p>
But the Lord Chief Justice and all who were present respectfully
pointed
out that the rose was a common white rose and not a blue one, and
the
objection was with many forms and phrases conveyed to the Princess.

<p>
"I think the rose is blue," said the Princess.  "Perhaps you are all
colour blind."

<p>
The Emperor, with whom the decision rested, decided that if the
Princess
thought the rose was blue it was blue, for it was well known that
her
perception was more acute than that of any one else in the kingdom.<

<p>
So the minstrel married the Princess, and they settled on the sea
coast
in a little seen house with a garden full of white roses, and they
lived
happily ever afterwards.  And the Emperor, knowing that his daughter
had
made a good match, died in peace.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align=center><a name="frogs">THE TWO FROGS</a></h4>

<p>
Once upon a time in the country of Japan there lived two frogs, one
of
whom made his home in a ditch near the town of Osaka, on the sea
coast,
while the other dwelt in a clear little stream which ran through the
city of Kioto.  At such a great distance apart, they had never even
heard of each other; but, funnily enough, the idea came into both
their
heads at once that they should like to see a little of the world,
and
the frog who lived at Kioto wanted to visit Osaka, and the frog who
lived at Osaka wished to go to Kioto, where the great Mikado had his
palace.

<p>
So one fine morning in the spring, they both set out along the road
that
led from Kioto to Osaka, one from one end and the other from the
other.

<p>
The journey was more tiring than they expected, for they did not
know
much about travelling, and half-way between the two towns there rose
a
mountain which had to be climbed.  It took them a long time and a
great
many hops to reach the top, but there they were at last, and what
was
the surprise of each to see another frog before him!  They looked at
each other for a moment without speaking, and then fell into
conversation, and explained the cause of their meeting so far from
their
homes.  It was delightful to find that they both felt the same wish
&mdash;to learn a little more of their native country&mdash;and as
there
was no sort of hurry they stretched themselves out in a cool, damp
place, and agreed that they would have a good rest before they
parted to
go their ways.

<p>
"What a pity we are not bigger," said the Osaka frog, "and then we
could
see both towns from here and tell if it worth our while going on."

<p>
"Oh, that is easily manage," returned the Kioto frog.  "We have only
got
to stand up on our hind legs, and hold on to each other, and then we
can
each look at the town he is travelling to."

<p>
This idea pleased the Osaka frog so much that he at once jumped up
and
put his front paws on the shoulder of his friend, who had risen
also.
There they both stood, stretching themselves as high as they could,
and
holding each other tightly, so that they might not fall down.  The
Kioto
frog turned his nose towards Osaka, and the Osaka frog turned his
nose
toward Kioto; but the foolish thing forgot that when the stood up
their
great eyes lay in the backs of their heads, and that though their
noses
might point to the places to which they wanted to go, their eyes
beheld
the places from which they had come.

<p>
"Dear me!" cried the Osaka frog; "Kioto is exactly like Osaka.  It
is
certainly not worth such a long journey.  I shall go home."

<p>
"If I had had any idea that Osaka was only a copy of Kioto I should
never have travelled all this way," exclaimed the frog from Kioto,
and
as he spoke, he took his hands from his friend's shoulders and they
both
fell down to the grass.

<p>
Then they took a polite farewell of each other, and set off for
home,
again, and to the end of their lives they believed that Osaka and
Kioto,
which are as different to look at as two towns can be, were as like
as
two peas.

<p>&mdash;THE VIOLET LOVING BOOK.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align=center><a name="shepherd">THE WISE OLD SHEPHERD</a></h4>

<p>
Once upon a time a Snake went out of his hole to take an airing.  He
crawled about, greatly enjoying the scenery and the fresh whiff of
the
breeze, until, seeing an open door, he went in.  Now this door was
the
door of the palace of the King, and inside was the King himself,
with
all his courtiers.

<p>Imagine their horror at seeing a huge Snake crawling in at the
door.
They all ran away except the king, who felt that his rank forbade
him to
be a coward, and the King's son.  The King called out for somebody
to
come and kill the Snake; but this horrified them still more, because
in
that country the people believed it to be wicked to kill any living
thing, even snakes and scorpion and wasps.  So the courtiers did
nothing, but the young Prince obeyed his father, and killed the
Snake
with his stick.

<p>
After a while the Snake's wife became anxious and set out in search
of
her husband.  She too saw the open door of the palace, and in she
went.
O horror! there on the floor lay the body of her husband all covered
with blood and quite dead.  No one saw the Snake's wife crawl in;
she
inquired of a white ant what had happened, and when she found that
the
young prince had killed her husband, she made a vow that, as he had
made
her a widow, so she would make his wife a widow.

<p>
That night, when all the world was asleep, the Snake crept into the
Prince's bedroom, and coiled round his neck.  The Prince slept on,
and
when he awoke in the morning, he was surprised to find his neck
encircled with the coils of a snake.  He was afraid to stir, so
there he
remained, until the Prince's mother became anxious and went to see
what
was the matter.  When she entered his room, and saw him in this
plight,
she gave a loud shriek, and ran off to tell the king.

<p>
"Call the archers," said the King.

<p>
The archers came in a row, fitted the arrows to the bows, the bows
were
raised and ready to shoot, when, on a sudden, from the Snake there
issued a voice which spoke as follows:

<p>
"O archers, wait, wait and hear me before you shoot.  It is not fair
to
carry out the sentence before you have heard the case.  Is not this
a
good law: an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth?  Is it not so,
O
King?"

<p>
"Yes," replied the King, "that is our law."

<p>
"Then," said the snake, "I plead the law.  Your son has made me a
widow,
so it is fair and right that I should make his wife a widow."

<p>
"That sounds right enough," said the King, "but right and law are
not
always the same thing.  We had better ask somebody who knows."

<p>
They asked all the judges, but none of them could tell the law of
the
matter.  They shook their heads, and said they would look up all
their
law-books, and see whether anything of the sort had ever happened
before, and if so, how it had been decided.  That is the way judges
used
to decide cases in that country, though I dare say it sounds to you
a
very funny way.  It looked as if they had not much sense in their
own
heads, and perhaps that was true.  The upshot of it all was that not
a
judge would give an opinion; so the King sent messengers all over
the
countryside, to see if they could find somebody somewhere who knew
something.

<p>
One of these messengers found a party of five shepherds, who were
sitting upon a hill and trying to decide a quarrel of their own.
They
gave their opinions so freely, and in language so very strong, that
the
King's messenger said to himself, "Here are the men for us.  Here
are
five men, each with an opinion of his own, and all different."
Posthaste he scurried back to the King, and told him that he had
found
at last some one ready to judge the knotty point.

<p>
So the King and the Queen, and the Prince and Princess, and all the
courtiers, got on horseback, and away they galloped to the hill
whereupon the five shepherds were sitting, and the Snake too went
with
them, coiled around the neck of the Prince.

<p>
When they got to the shepherds' hill, the shepherds were dreadfully
frightened.  At first they thought the strangers were a gang of
robbers,
and when they saw it was the King their next thought was that one of
their misdeeds had been found out; and each of them began thinking
what
was the last thing he had done, and wondering, was it that?

<p>
But the King and the courtiers got off their horses, and said good
day,
in the most civil way.  So the shepherds felt their minds set at
ease
again.  Then the King said:

<p>
"Worthy shepherds, we have a question to put to you, which not all
the
judges in all the courts of my city have been able to solve.  Here
is my
son, and here, as you see, is a snake coiled round his neck.  Now,
the
husband of this Snake came creeping into my palace hall, and my son
the
Prince killed him; so this Snake, who is the wife of the other, says
that, as my son has made her a widow, so she has a right to widow my
son's wife.  What do you think about it?"

<p>
The first shepherd said: "I think she is quite right, my Lord the
King.
If anyone made my wife a widow, I would pretty soon do the same to
him."

<p>
This was brave language, and the other shepherds shook their heads
and
looked fierce.  But the King was puzzled, and could not quite
understand
it.  You see, in the first place, if the man's wife were a widow,
the
man would be dead; and then it is hard to see that he could do
anything.
So to make sure, the King asked the second shepherd whether that was
his
opinion too.

<p>
"Yes," said the second shepherd; "now the Prince has killed the
Snake,
the Snake has a right to kill the Prince if he can."  But that was
not
of much use either, as the Snake was as dead as a doornail.  So the
King
passed on to the third.

<p>
"I agree with my mates," said the third shepherd.  "Because, you
see, a
Prince is a Prince, but then a Snake is a Snake."  That was quite
true,
they all admitted, but it did not seem to help the matter much.
Then
the King asked the fourth shepherd to say what he thought.

<p>
The fourth shepherd said: "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a
tooth;
so I think a widow should be a widow, if so be she don't marry
again."

<p>
By this time the poor King was so puzzled that he hardly knew
whether he
stood on his head or his heels.  But there was still the fifth
shepherd
left; the oldest and wisest of them all; and the fifth shepherd
said:

<p>"King, I should like to ask two questions."

<p>
"Ask twenty, if you like," said the King.  He did not promise to
answer
them, so he could afford to be generous.

<p>
"First.  I ask the Princess how many sons she has."

<p>
"Four," said the Princess.

<p>
"And how many sons has Mistress Snake here?"

<p>
Seven," said the Snake.

<p>
"Then," said the old shepherd, "it will be quite fair for Mistress
Snake
to kill his Highness the Prince when her Highness the Princess has
had
three sons more."

<p>
"I never thought of that," said the Snake.  "Good-bye, King, and all
you
good people.  Send a message when the Princess has had three more
sons,
and you may count upon me&mdash;I will not fail you."

<p>
So saying, she uncoiled from the Prince's neck and slid away among
the
grass.

<p>
The King and the Prince and everybody shook hands with the wise old
shepherd, and went home again.  And the Princess never had any more
sons
at all.  She and the Prince lived happily for many years; and if
they
are not dead they are living still.

And it came to pass that the Buddha (to be) was born again as a
Lion.
Just as he had helped his fellow-men, he now began to help his
fellow-
animals, and there was a great deal to be done.  For instance, there
was
a little nervous Hare who was always afraid that something dreadful
was
going to happen to her.  She was always saying: "Suppose the Earth
were
to fall in, what would happen to me?"  And she said this so often
that
at last she thought it really was about to happen.  One day, when
she
had been saying over and over again, "Suppose the Earth were to fall
in,
what would happen to me?" she heard a slight noise: it really was
only a
heavy fruit which had fallen upon a rustling leaf, but the little
Hare
was so nervous she was ready to believe anything, and she said in a
frightened tone: "The Earth <i>is</i> falling in."  She ran away as
fast
as she could go, and presently she met an old brother Hare, who
said:
"Where are you running to Mistress Hare?"

<p>
And the little Hare said: "I have no time to stop and tell you
anything.
The Earth is falling in, and I am running away."

<p>
"The Earth is falling in, is it?" said the old brother Hare, in a
tone
of much astonishment; and he repeated this to <i>his</i> brother
hare,
and <i>he</i> to <i>his</i> brother hare, and he to <i>his</i>
brother
hare, until at last there were a hundred thousand brother hares, all
shouting: "The Earth is falling in."  Now presently the bigger
animals
began to take the cry up.  First the deer, and then the sheep, and
then
the wild boar, and then the buffalo, and then the camel, and then
the
tiger, and then the elephant.

<p>
Now the wise Lion heard all this noise and wondered at it.  "There
are
no signs," he said, "of the Earth falling in.  They must have heard
something."  And then he stopped them all short and said: "What is
this
you are saying?"

<p>
And the Elephant said: "I remarked that the Earth was falling in."

<p>
"How do you know this?" asked the Lion.

<p>
"Why, now I come to think of it, it was the Tiger that remarked it
to
me."

<p>
And the Tiger said: "I had it from the Camel," and the Camel said:
"I
had it from the Buffalo."  And the buffalo from the wild boar, and
the
wild boar from the sheep, and the sheep from the deer, and the deer
from
the hares, and the Hares said: "Oh! <i>we</i> heard it from <i>that
</i>
little Hare."

<p>
And the Lion said: "Little Hare, <i>what</i> made you say that the
Earth
was falling in?"

<p>
And the little Hare said: "I <i>saw</i> it."

<p>
"You saw it?" said the Lion.  "Where?"

<p>
"Yonder, by that tree."

<p>
"Well," said the Lion, "come with me and I will show you how&mdash;
&mdash;"

<p>
"No, no," said the Hare, "I would not go near that tree for
anything,
I'm <i>so</i> nervous."

<p>
"But," said the Lion, "I am going to take you on my back."  And he
took
her on his back, and begged the animals to stay where they were
until
they returned.  Then he showed the little Hare how the fruit had
fallen
upon the leaf, making the noise that had frightened her, and she
said:
"Yes, I see&mdash;the Earth is <i>not</i> falling in." and the Lion
said: "Shall we go back and tell the other animals?"  And they went
back.  The little Hare stood before the animals and said: "The Earth
is
<i>not</i> falling in."  And all the animals began to repeat this to
one
another, and they dispersed gradually, and you heard the words more
and
more softly:

<p>
"The Earth is <i>not</i> falling in," etc., etc., etc., until the
sound
died away altogether.</p>

<h4 align=center><a name="festival">THE TRUE SPIRIT OF A FESTIVAL
DAY</a
></h4>

<p>
And it came to pass that the Buddha was born a Hare and lived in a
wood;
on one side was the foot of a mountain, on another a river, on the
third
side a border village.

<p>
And with him lived three friends: a Monkey, a Jackal and an Otter;
each
of these creatures got food on his own hunting ground.  In the
evening
they met together, and the Hare taught his companions many wise
things:
that the moral law should be observed, that alms should be given to
the
poor, and that holy days should be kept.

<p>
One day the Buddha said: "To-morrow is a fast day.  Feed any beggars
that come to you by giving food from your own table."  They all
consented.

<p>
The next day the Otter went down to the bank of the Ganges to seek
his
prey.  Now a fisherman had landed seven red fish and had buried them
in
the sand on the river's bank while he went down the stream catching
more
fish.  The Otter scented the buried fish, dug up the sand till he
came
upon them, and he called aloud: "Does any one own these fish?"  And,
not
seeing the owner, he laid the fish in the jungle where he dwelt,
intending to eat them at a fitting time.  Then he lay down, thinking
how
virtuous he was.

<p>
The Jackal also went off in search of food, and found in the hut of
a
field watcher a lizard, two spits, and a pot of milk-curd.

<p>
And, after thrice crying aloud, "To whom do these belong?" and not
finding an owner, he put on his neck the rope for lifting the pot,
and
grasping the spits and lizard with his teeth, he laid them in his
own
lair, thinking, "In due season I will devour them," and then he lay
down, thinking how virtuous he had been.

<p>
But the Hare (who was the Buddha-to-be) in due time came out,
thinking
to lie (in contemplation) on the Kuca grass.  "It is impossible for
me
to offer <i>grass</i> to any beggars who may chance to come by, and
I
have no oil or rice or fish.  If any beggar comes to me, I will give
him
(of) my own flesh to eat."

<p>
Now when Sakka, the King of the Gods, heard this thing, he
determined to
put the Royal Hare to the test.  So he came in disguise of a Brahmin
to
the Otter and said: "Wise Sir, if I could get something to eat, I
would
perform <i>all</i> my priestly duties."

<p>
The Otter said: "I will give you food.  Seven red fish have I safely
brought to land from the sacred river of the Ganges.  Eat thy fill,
O
Brahmin, and stay in this wood."

<p>
And the Brahmin said: "Let it be until to-morrow, and I will see to
it
then."

<p>
Then he went to the Jackal, who confessed that he had stolen the
food,
but he begged the Brahmin to accept it and remain in the wood: but
the
Brahmin said: "Let it be until the morrow, and then I well see to
it."

<p>
Then the Brahmin went to the wise Hare, and the Hare said: "Behold,
I
will give you of my flesh to eat.  But you must not take life on
this
holy day.  When you have piled up the logs I will sacrifice myself
by
falling into the midst of the flames, and when my body is roasted
you
shall eat my flesh and perform all your priestly duties."

<p>
Now when Sakka heard these words he caused a heap of burning coals
to
appear, and the Wisdom Being, rising from the grass, came to the
place,
but before casting himself into the flames he shook himself, lest
perchance there should be any insects in his coat who might suffer
death.  Then, offering his body as a free gift, he sprang up, and
like a
royal swan, lighting on a bed of lotus in an ecstasy of joy, he fell
on
the heap of live coals.  But the flame failed even to heat the pores
or
the hair on the body of the Wisdom Being, and it was as if he had
entered a region of frost.  Then he addressed the Brahmin in these
words: "Brahmin, the fire that you have kindled is icy cold; it
fails to
heat the pores of the hair on my body.  What is the meaning of
this?"

<p>
"O most wise Hare!  I am Sakka, and have come to put your virtue to
the
test."

<p>
And the Buddha in a sweet voice said: "No god or man could find in
me an
unwillingness to die."

<p>
Then Sakka said: "O wise Hare, be thy virtue know to all the ages to
come."

<p>
And seizing the mountain he squeezed out the juice and daubed on the
moon the signs of the young hare.

<p>
Then he placed him back on the grass that he might continue his
Sabbath
meditation, and returned to Heaven.

<p>
And the four creatures lived together and kept the moral law.</p>
<p>&mdash;<i>From</i> "EASTERN STORIES AND LEGENDS."</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align=center><a name="filial">FILIAL PIETY</a></h4>

<p>
Now it came to pass that the Buddha was reborn in the shape of a
parrot,
and he greatly excelled all other parrots in his strength and
beauty.
And when he was full grown his father, who had long been the leader
of
the flock in their flights to other climes, said to him: "My son,
behold, thou shalt rest.  I will lead the birds."  And the parrots
rejoiced in the strength of their new leader, and willingly did they
follow him.  Now from that day on, the Buddha undertook to feed his
parents, and would not consent that they should do any more work.
Each
day he led his flock to the Himalaya Hills, and when he had eaten
his
fill of the clumps of rice that grew there, he filled his beak with
food
for the dear parents who were waiting his return.

<p>Now there was a man appointed to watch the rice-fields, and he
did
his best to drive the parrots away, but there seemed to be some
secret
power in the leader of this flock which the keeper could not
overcome.

<p>
He noticed that the parrots ate their fill and then flew away, but
that the Parrot-King not only satisfied his hunger, but carried away
rice in his beak.

<p>
Now he feared there would be no rice left, and he went to his
master,
the Brahmin, to tell him what had happened; and even as the master
listened there came to him the thought that the Parrot-King was
something higher than he seemed, and he loved him even before he saw
him.  But he said nothing of this, and only warned the Keeper that
he
should set a snare and catch the dangerous bird.  So the man did as
he
was bidden: he made a small cage and set the snare, and sat down in
his
hut waiting for the birds to come.  And soon he saw the Parrot-King
amidst his flock, who, because he had no greed, sought no richer
spot,
but flew down to the same place in which he had fed the day before.

<p>
Now, no sooner had he touched the ground than he felt his feet
caught in
the noose.  Then fear crept into his bird heart, but a stronger
feeling
was there to crush it down, for he thought: "If I cry out the Cry of
the
Captured, my Kinsfolk will be terrified, and they will fly away
foodless.  But if I lie still, then their hunger will be satisfied,
and
may they safely come to my aid."  Thus, was the parrot both brave
and
prudent.

<p>
But alas! he did not know that his Kinsfolk had nought of his brave
spirit.  When <i>they</i> had eaten their fill, though they heard
the
thrice-uttered cry of the captured, they flew away, nor heed the sad
plight of their leader.

<p>
Then was the heart of the Parrot-King sore within him, and he said:
"All
these my kith and kin, and not one to look back on me.  Alas! what
sin
have I done?"

<p>
The watchman now heard the cry if the Parrot-King, and the sound of
the
other parrots flying through the air.  "What is that?" he cried, and
leaving his hut he came to the place where he had laid the snare.
There
he found the captive parrot; he tied his feet together and brought
him
to the Brahmin, his master.  Now, when the Brahmin saw the Parrot-
King,
he felt his strong power, and his heart was full of love to him, but
he
hid his feelings, and said in a voice of anger: "Is thy greed
greater
than that of all other birds?  They eat their fill, but thou canst
takest away each day more food than thou canst eat.  Doest thou this
out
of hatred for me, or dost thou store up the food in same granary for
selfish greed?"

<p>
And the Great Being made answer in a sweet human voice: "I hate thee
not, O Brahmin.  Nor do I store the rice in a granary for selfish
greed.
But this thing I do.  Each day I pay a debt which is due&mdash;each
day
I grant a loan, and each day I store up a treasure."

<p>
Now the Brahmin could not understand the words of the Buddha
(because
true wisdom had not entered his heart) and he said: "I pray thee, O
Wondrous Bird, to make these words clear unto me."

<p>
And then the Parrot-King made answer: "I carry food to my ancient
parents who can no longer seek that food for themselves: thus I pay
my
daily debt.  I carry food to my callow chicks whose wings are yet
ungrown.  When I am old they will care for me&mdash;this my loan to
them.  And for other birds, weak and helpless of wing, who need the
aid
of the strong, for them I lay up a store; to these I give in
charity."

<p>
Then was the Brahmin much moved and showed the love that was in his
heart.  "Eat thy fill, O Righteous Bird, and let thy Kinsfolk eat,
too,
for thy sake."  And he wished to bestow a thousand acres of land
upon
him, but the Great Being would only take a tiny portion round which
were
set boundary stores.

<p>
And the parrot returned with a head of rice, and said: "Arise, dear
parents, that I may take you to a place of plenty."  And he told
them
the story of his deliverance.</p>

<h3 align=center>THREE STORIES FROM HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN[53]</h3>
<h4 align=center><a name="swineherd">THE SWINEHERD</a></h4>

<p>
There was once a poor Prince.  He owned a Kingdom&mdash;a very small
one, but it was big enough to allow him to marry, and he was
determined
to marry.  Now, it was really very bold on his part to say to a
King's
daughter: "Will you marry me?"  But he dared to do so, for his name
was
known far and wide, and there were hundreds of princesses who would
willingly have said: "Yes, thank you."  But, would <i>she?</i>  We
shall
hear what happened.

<p>
On the grave of the Prince's father, there grew a rose-tree&mdash;
such a
wonderful rose-tree!  It bloomed only once in five years, and then
it
bore only one rose&mdash;but what a rose!  Its perfume was so sweet
that
whoever smelt it forgot all his cares and sorrows.  The Prince had
also
a nightingale which could sing as if all the delicious melodies in
the
world were contained in its little throat.  The rose and the
nightingale
were both to be given to the Princess, and were therefore placed in
two
great silver caskets and sent to her.  The Emperor had them carried
before him into the great hall where the Princess was playing at
"visiting" with her ladies-in-waiting&mdash;they had nothing else to
do.
When she saw the caskets with the presents in them, she clapped her
hands with joy.

<p>
"If it were only a little pussy-cat," she cried.  But out came a
beautiful rose.

<p>
"How elegantly it is made," said all the ladies of the court.

<p>
"It is more than elegant," said the Emperor, "It is <i>neat.</i>

<p>
"Fie, papa," she said, "it is not made at all; it is a <i>natural</i
>
rose."

<p>
"Let us see what the other casket contains before we lose our
temper,"
said the Emperor, and then out came the little nightingale and sang
so
sweetly that at first nobody could think of anything to say against
it."

<p>
"<i>Superbe, superbe,"</i> cried the ladies of the court, for they
all
chattered French, one worse than the other.

<p>
"How the bird reminds me of the late Empress' musical-box!" said an
old
Lord-in-Waiting.  "Ah, me! the same tone, the same execution."

<p>
"The very same," said the Emperor, and he cried like a little child.

<p>
"I hope it is not a real bird," said the Princess.

<p>
Oh, yes! it is a real bird," said those who had brought it.

<p>
"Then let the bird fly away," she said, and she would on no account
allow the Prince to come in.

<p>
But he was not to be disheartened; he smeared his face with black
and
brown, drew his cap over his forehead, and knocked at the Palace
door.
The Emperor opened it.

<p>
"Good day, Emperor," he said.  "Could I get work at the Palace?"

<p>
"Well, there are so many wanting places," said the Emperor; "but let
me
see!&mdash;I need a Swineherd.  I have a good many pigs to keep."

<p>
So the Prince was made Imperial Swineherd.  He had a wretched little
room near the pig-sty and here he was obliged to stay.  But the
whole
day he sat and worked, and by the evening he had made a neat little
pipkin, and round it was a set of bells, and as soon as the pot
began to
boil, the bells fell to jingling most sweetly and played the old
melody:

<P align=center>
"Ach du lieber Augustin,<br>
Alles is weg, weg, weg!"[54]</p>

<p>
But the most wonderful thing was that when you held your finger in
the
steam of the pipkin, you could immediately smell what dinner was
cooking
on every hearth in the town.  That was something very different from
a
rose.

<p>
The Princess was walking out with her ladies-in-waiting, and when
she
heard the melody, she stopped short, and looked pleased, for she
could
play "Ach du lieber Augustin" herself; it was the only tune she
knew,
and that she played with one finger.  "Why, that is the tune I
play,"
she said.  "What a cultivated Swineherd he must be.  Go down and ask
him
how much his instrument costs."

<p>
So one of the ladies-in-waiting was obliged to go down, but she put
on
pattens first.

<p>
"How much do you want for your pipkin?" asked the Lady-in-waiting.

<p>
"I will have ten kisses from the Princess," said the Swineherd.

<p>
"Good gracious!" said the Lady-in-waiting.

<p>
"I will not take less," said the Swineherd.

<p>
"Well, what did he say?" asked the Princess.

<p>
"I really cannot tell you," said the Lady-in-waiting.  "It is too
dreadful."

<p>
"Then you must whisper it,"" said the Princess.

<p>
So she whispered it.

<p>
"He is very rude," said the Princess, and she walked away.  But she
had
gone only a few steps when the bells sounded so sweetly:

<P align=center>
"Ach du lieber Augustin<br>
Alles ist weg, weg, weg!"</p>

<p>
"Listen," said the Princess, "ask him whether he will have his
kisses
from my Ladies-in-waiting."

<p>
"No, thank you," said the Swineherd.  "I will have ten kisses from
the
Princess, or, I will keep my pipkin."

<p>
"How tiresome!" said the Princess; "but you must stand round me, so
that
nobody shall see."

<p>
So the ladies-in-waiting stood round her and they spread out their
skirts.  The Swineherd got the kisses, and she got the pipkin.

<p>
How delighted she was.  All the evening and the whole of the next
day,
that pot was made to boil.  And you might have known what everybody
was
cooking on every hearth in town, from the Chamberlain's to the
shoemaker's.  The court ladies danced and clapped their hands.

<p>
"We know who is to have fruit-soup and pancakes, and we know who is
going to have porridge, and cutlets.  How very interesting it is!"

<p>
"Most interesting, indeed," said the first Lady-of-Honor.

<p>
"Yes, but hold your tongues, for I am the Emperor's daughter."

<p>
"Of course we will," they cried in one breath.

<p>
The Swineherd, or the Prince, nobody knew that he was not a real
Swineherd, did not let the day pass without doing something, and he
made
a rattle which could play all the waltzes, and the polkas and the
hop-
dances which had been know since the creation of the world.

<p>
"But this is <i>superbe!"</i> said the Princess, who was just
passing:
"I have never heard  more beautiful composition.  Go and as him what
the
instrument costs.  But I will give no more kisses."

<p>
"He insists on a hundred kisses from the Princess," said the ladies-
in-waiting who had been down to ask.

<p>
"I think he must be quite mad," said the Princess, and she walked
away.
But when she had taken a few steps, she stopped short, and said:
"One
must encourage the fine arts, and I am the emperor's daughter.  Tell
him
he may have ten kisses, as before, and the rest he can take from my
ladies-in-waiting."

<p>
"Yes, but we object to that,: said the ladies-in-waiting.

<p>
"That is nonsense," said the Princess.  "If I can kiss him, surely
you
can do the same.  Go down at once.  Don't I give you board and
wages?"

<p>
So the ladies-in-waiting were obliged to go down to the Swineherd
again.

<p>
"A hundred kisses from the Princess, or each keeps his own."

<p>
"Stand round me," she said.  And all the ladies-in-waiting stood
round
her, and the Swineherd began to kiss her.

<p>
"What can all the crowd be down by the pig-sty?" said the Emperor,
stepping out onto the balcony.  He rubbed his eyes and put on his
spectacles.  "It is the court ladies up to some of their tricks.  I
must
go down and look after them."  He pulled up his slippers, for they
were
shoes which he had trodden down at heel.

<p>
Gracious goodness, how he hurried!  As soon as he came into the
garden,
he walked very softly, and the ladies-in-waiting had so much to do
counting the kisses, so that everything could be done fairly, and
that
the Swineherd should get neither too many nor too few, that they
never
noticed the Emperor at all.  He stood on tip-toe.

<p>
"What is this all about?" he said, when he saw the kissing that was
going on, and he hit them on the head with his slipper, just as the
Swineherd was getting the eighty-sixth kiss.  "Heraus!" said the
Emperor, for he was angry, and both the Princess and the Swineherd
were
turned out of his Kingdom.

<p>
The Princess wept, the Swineherd scolded, and the rain streamed
down.

<p>
"Oh! wretched creature that I am," said the Princess.  "If I had
only
taken the handsome Prince!  Oh, how unhappy I am!"

<p>
Then the Swineherd went behind a tree, washed the black and brown
off
his face, threw of his ragged clothes, and stood forth in his royal
apparel, looking so handsome that she was obliged to curtsey.

<p>
"I have learned to despise you," he said.  "You would not have an
honorable Prince.  You could not appreciate a rose or a nightingale,
but
for a musical toy, you kissed the Swineherd.  Now you have your
reward."

<p>
So he went into his Kingdom, shut the door and bolted it, and she
had to
stand outside singing:

<P align=center>
"Ach, du lieber Augustin,<br>
Alles is weg, weg, weg!"</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align=center><a name="nightengale">THE NIGHTINGALE</a></h4>

<p>
In China, you must know, the Emperor is a Chinaman, and all those
around
him are Chinamen, too.  It is many years since all this happened,
and
for that very reason it is worth hearing, before it is forgotten.

<p>
The Emperor's palace was the most beautiful in the world; built all
of
fine porcelain and very costly, but so fragile that it was very
difficult to touch, and you had to be very careful in doing so.  The
most wonderful flowers were to be seen in the garden, and to the
most
beautiful silver bells, tinkling bells were tied, for fear people
should
pass by without noticing them.  How well everything had been thought
out
in the Emperor's garden!  This was so big, that the gardener himself
did
not know where it ended.  If you walked on and on you came to the
most
beautiful forest, with tall trees and big lakes.  The wood stretched
right down to the sea which was blue and deep; great ships could
pass
underneath the branches, and here a nightingale had made its home,
and
its singing was so entrancing that the poor fisherman, though he had
so
many other things to do, would lie still and listen when he was out
at
night drawing in his nets.

<p>
"How beautiful it is!" he said; but then he was forced to think
about
his own affairs, and the Nightingale was forgotten.  The next day,
when
it sang again, the fisherman said the same thing: "How beautiful it
is!"

<p>
Travellers from all the countries of the world came to the emperor's
town, and expressed their admiration of the palace and the garden,
but
when they heard the Nightingale, they all said: "This is the best of
all!"

<p>
Now, when these travellers came home, they told of what they had
seen.
And scholars wrote many books about the town, the palace and the
garden,
but nobody left out the Nightingale; it was always spoken of as the
most
wonderful of all they had seen.  And those who had the gift of the
Poet,
wrote the most delightful poems all about the Nightingale in the
wood
near the deep lake.

<p>
The books went round the world, and in the course of time some of
them
reached the Emperor.  He sat in his golden chair, and read and read,
nodding his head every minute; for it pleased him to read the
beautiful
descriptions of the town, the palace and the garden.

<p>
"But the Nightingale is the best of all," he read.

<p>
"What is this?" said the Emperor.  "The Nightingale!  I now nothing
whatever about it.  To think of there being such a bird in my
Kingdom
&mdash;nay in my very garden&mdash;and I have never heard it.  And
to
think one should learn such a thing for the first time from a book!"

<p>
Then he summoned his Lord-in-Waiting, who was such a grand personage
that if anyone inferior in rank ventured to speak to him, or ask him
about anything, he merely answered "P," which meant nothing
whatever.

<p>
"There is said to be a most wonderful bird, called the Nightingale,"
said the Emperor; "they say it is the best thing in my great
Kingdom.
Why have I  been told nothing about it?"

<p>
"I have never heard it mentioned before," said the Lord-in-Waiting.
"It
has certainly never been presented at court."

<p>
"It is my good pleasure that it shall appear to-night and sing
before
me!" said the Emperor.  "The whole world knows what is mine, and I
myself do not know it."

<p>
"I have never heard it mentioned before," said the Lord-in-Waiting.
"I
will seek it, and I shall find it."

<p>
But where was it to be found?  The Lord-in-Waiting ran up and down
all
the stairs, through halls and passages, but not one of all those
whom he
met had ever heard a word about the Nightingale; so the Lord-in-
Waiting
ran back to the Emperor and told him that it must certainly be a
fable
invented by writers of books.

<p>
"Your Majesty must not believe all that is written in books.  It is
pure
invention, something which is called the Black Art."

<p>
"But," said the Emperor, "the book in which I have read this was
sent to
me by His Majesty, the Emperor of Japan, and therefore this cannot
be a
falsehood.  I <i>will</i> hear the Nightingale.  It must appear this
evening!  It has my Imperial favor, and if it fails to appear the
Court
shall be trampled upon after the Court has supped."

<p>
"Tsing-pe!" said the Lord-in-Waiting, and again he ran up and down
all
the stairs, through all the passages, and half the Court ran with
him,
for they had no wish to be trampled upon.  And many questions were
asked
about the wonderful Nightingale, of whom all had heard except those
who
lived at Court.

<p>
At last, they met a poor little girl in the kitchen.  She said: "Oh,
yes! The Nightingale!  I know it well.  How it can sing!  Every
evening
I have permission to take the broken pieces from the table to my
poor
sick mother who lives near the sea-shore, and on my way back, when I
feel tired, and rest a while in the wood, then I hear the
Nightingale
sing, and my eyes are filled with tears; it is as if my mother
kissed
me."

<p>
"Little kitchen-maid," said the Lord-in-Waiting, "I will get a
permanent
place for you in the Court Kitchen and permission to see the Emperor
dine, if you can lead us to the Nightingale; for it has been
commanded
to appear at Court to-night."

<p>
So they started off all together where the bird used to sing; half
the
Court went, too.  They were going along at a good pace, when
suddenly
they heard a cow lowing.

<p>
"Oh," said a Court-Page.  "There it is!  What a wonderful power for
so
small a creature!  I have certainly heard it before."

<p>
"No, those are the cows lowing," said the little kitchen-maid.  "We
are
a long way from the place yet."

<p>
Then the frogs began to croak in the marsh.  "Glorious," said the
Court-Preacher.  "Now, I hear it&mdash;it is just like little
church-
bells."

<p>
"No, those are the frogs," said the little kitchen-maid.  "But now I
think we shall soon hear it."

<p>
And then the Nightingale began to sing.

<p>
"There it is," said the little girl.  "Listen, listen&mdash;there it
sits!"  And she pointed to a little gray bird in the branches.

<p>
"Is it possible!" said the Lord-in-Waiting.  "I had never supposed
it
would look like that.  How very plain it looks!  It has certainly
lost
its color from seeing so many grand folk here."

<p>
"Little Nightingale," called out the little kitchen-maid, "our
gracious
Emperor wishes you to sing for him."

<p>
"With the greatest pleasure," said the Nightingale, and it sang, and
it
was a joy to hear it.

<p>
"It sounds like little glass bells," said the Lord-in-Waiting; "and
just
look at its little throat, how it moves!  It is astonishing to think
we
have never heard it before!  It will have a real <i>success</i> at
Court."

<p>
"Shall I sing for the Emperor again?" asked the Nightingale, who
thought
that the Emperor  was there in person.

<p>
"Mine excellent little Nightingale," said the Lord-in-Waiting, "I
have
the great pleasure of bidding you to a Court-Festival this night,
when
you will enchant His Imperial Majesty with your delightful
warbling."

<p>
"My voice sounds better among the green trees," said the
Nightingale.
But it came willingly when it knew the Emperor wished it.

<p>
There was a great deal of furbishing up at the palace.  The walls
and
ceiling which were of porcelain, shone with the light of a thousand
golden lamps.  The most beautiful flowers of the tinkling kind were
placed in the passages.  There was a running to and fro and a great
draught, but that is just what made the bells ring, and one could
not
hear oneself speak.  In the middle of the great hall where the
Emperor
sat, a golden rod had been set up on which the Nightingale was to
perch.
The whole Court was present, and the little kitchen-maid was allowed
to
stand behind the door, for she had now the actual title of Court
Kitchen-Maid.  All were there in their smartest clothes, and they
all
looked toward the little gray bird to which the Emperor nodded.

<p>
And then the Nightingale sang, so gloriously that tears sprang into
the
Emperor's eyes and rolled down his cheeks, and the Nightingale sang
even
more sweetly.  The song went straight to the heart, and the Emperor
was
so delighted that he declared that the Nightingale should have his
golden slipper to hang round its neck.  But the Nightingale
declined.
It had already had its reward.

<p>
"I have seen tears in the Emperor's eyes.  That is my greatest
reward.
An Emperor's tears have a wonderful power.  God knows I am
sufficiently
rewarded," and again its sweet, glorious voice was heard.

<p>
"That is the most delightful coquetting I have ever known," said the
ladies sitting round, and they took water into their mouths, in
order to
gurgle when anyone spoke to them, and they really thought they were
like
the Nightingale.  Even the footmen and the chambermaids sent word
that
they were satisfied, and that means a great deal, for they are
always
the most difficult people to please.  Yes, indeed, there was no
doubt as
to the Nightingale's success.  It was to stay at Court, and have its
own
cage, with liberty to go out twice in the daytime, and once at
night.
Twelve footmen went out with it, and each held a silk ribbon which
was
tied to the bird's leg, and which they held very tightly.  There was
not
much pleasure in an outing of that sort.  The whole town was talking
about the wonderful bird, and when two people met, one said:
"Nightin
&mdash;&mdash; and the other said "gale," and they sighed and
understood
one another.  Eleven cheese-mongers' children were called after the
bird, though none of them could sing a note.

<p>
One day a large parcel came for the Emperor.  Outside was written
the
word: "Nightingale."

<p>
"Here we have a new book about our wonderful bird," said the
Emperor.
But it was not a book; it was a little work of art which lay in a
box
&mdash;an artificial Nightingale, which looked exactly like the real
one, but it was studded all over with diamonds, rubies and
sapphires.
As soon as you wound it up, it could sing one of the songs which the
real bird sang, and its tail moved up and down and glittered with
silver
and gold.  Round its neck was a ribbon on which was written: "The
Emperor of Japan's Nightingale is poor indeed, compared with the
Emperor
of China's."

<p>
"That is delightful," they all said, and on the messenger who had
brought the artificial bird, they bestowed the title of "Imperial
Nightingale-Bringer-in-Chief."

<p>
"Let them sing together, and <i>what</i> a duet that will be!"

<p>
And so they had to sing, but the thing would not work, because the
real
Nightingale could only sing in its own way, and the artificial
Nightingale went by clockwork.

<p>
"That is not its fault," said the band-master.  "Time is its strong
point and it has quite my method."

<p>
Then the artificial Nightingale had to sing alone.  It had just as
much
success as the real bird, and it was so much handsomer to look at;
it
glittered like bracelets and breast-pins.  It sang the same tune
three
and thirty times, and still it was not tired; the people would
willingly
listen to the whole performance over again from the start, but the
Emperor suggested that the real Nightingale should sing for a while
&mdash;where was it?  Nobody had noticed it had flown out of the
open
window back to its green woods.

<p>
"But what is the meaning of all this?" said the Emperor.  All the
courtiers railed at the Nightingale and said it was a most
ungrateful
creature.

<p>
"We have the better of the two," they said, and the artificial
Nightingale had to sing again, and this was the thirty-fourth time
they
had heard the same tune.  But they did not know it properly event
then
because it was so difficult, and the band-master praised the
wonderful
bird in the highest terms and even asserted that it was superior to
the
real bird, not only as regarded the outside, with the many lovely
diamonds, but the inside as well.

<p>
"You see, ladies and gentlemen, and above all your Imperial Majesty,
that with the real Nightingale, you can never predict what may
happen,
but with the artificial bird, everything is settled beforehand; so
it
remains and it cannot be changed.  One can account for it.  One can
rip
it open, and show the human ingenuity, explaining how the cylinders
lie,
how they work, and how one thing is the result of another."

<p>
"That is just what we think," they all exclaimed, and the bandmaster
received permission to exhibit the bird to the people on the
following
Sunday.  The Emperor said they would hear it sing.  They listened
and
were as much delighted as if they had been drunk with tea, which is
Chinese, you know, and they all said: "Oh!" and stuck their
forefingers
in the air, and nodded their heads.  But the poor fisherman who had
heard the real Nightingale, said: "It sounds quite well, and a
little
like it, but there is something wanting, I do not know what."

<p>
The real Nightingale was banished from the Kingdom.

<p>
The artificial bird had its place on a silken cushion close to the
Emperor's bed.  All the presents it had received, the gold and
precious
stones, lay all round it, and it had been honored with the title of
High-Imperial-Bed-Room-Singer&mdash;in the first rank, on the left
side,
for even the Emperor considered that side the grander on which the
heart
is placed, and even an Emperor has his heart on the left side.

<p>
The band-master wrote twenty-five volumes about the wonderful
artificial
bird.  The book was very learned and very long, filled with the most
difficult words in the Chinese language, and everybody said they had
read and understood it, for otherwise they would have been
considered
stupid, and would have been trampled upon.

<p>
And thus a whole year passed away.  The Emperor, the Court, and all
the
Chinamen knew every little gurgle in the artificial bird's song, and
just for this reason, they were all the better pleased with it.
They
could sing it themselves&mdash;which they did.

<p>
The boys in the street sang "Zi-zi-zi," and, "cluck, cluck," and
even
the Emperor sang it.  Yes, it was certainly beautiful!

<p>
But one evening, while the bird was singing, and the Emperor lay in
bed
listening to it, there was a whirring sound inside the bird, and
something whizzed; all the wheels ran round, and the music stopped.

<p>
The Emperor sprang out of bed and sent for the Court Physician, but
what
could he do?  Then they sent for the watch-maker, and after much
talk
and examination, he patched the bird up, but he said it must be
spared
as much as possible, because the hammers were so worn out&mdash;and
he
could not put new ones in so that the music could be counted on.
This
was a great grief.  The bird could only be allowed to sing once a
year,
and even that was risky, but on these occasions, the band-master
would
make a little speech, full of difficult words, saying the bird was
just
as good as ever&mdash;and that was true.

<p>
Five years passed away, and a great sorrow had come to the country.
The
people all really cared for their Emperor, and now he was ill and it
was
said he could not live.  A new Emperor had been chosen, and the
people
stood about the streets, and questioned the Lord-in-Waiting about
their
Emperor's condition.

<p>
"P!" he said, and shook his head.

<p>
The Emperor lay pale and cold on his great, gorgeous bed; the whole
Court believed that he was dead, and they all hastened to pay homage
to
the new Emperor.  The footmen hurried off to discuss matters, and
the
chambermaids gave a great coffee-party.  Cloth had been laid down in
all
the rooms and passages, so that not even a footstep should be heard
and
it was all so very quiet.  But the Emperor was not yet dead.  He lay
stiff and pale in the sumptuous bed, with its long velvet curtains
and
heavy gold tassels; high above was an open window, and the moon
shone in
upon the Emperor and the artificial bird.  The poor Emperor could
hardly
breathe; he felt as if someone were sitting on his chest; he opened
his
eyes and saw that it was Death sitting on his chest, wearing his
golden
crown, holding in one hand his golden sword, and in the other his
splendid banner.  And from the folds of the velvet curtains strange
faces peered forth; some terrible to look on, others mild and
friendly
&mdash;these were the Emperor's good and bad deeds, which gazed upon
him
now that Death sat upon his heart.

<p>
"Do you remember this?" whispered one after the other.  "Do you
remember
that?"  They told him so much that the sweat poured down his face.

<p>
"I never knew that," said the Emperor.  "Music! music!  Beat the
great
Chinese drum!" he called out, "so that I may not hear what they are
saying!"

<p>
But they kept on, and Death nodded his head, like a Chinaman, at
everything they said.

<p>
"Music, music," cried the Emperor.  "You precious little golden
bird!
Sing to me, ah! sing to me!  I have given you gold and costly
treasure.
I have hung my golden slipper about your neck.  Sing to me.  Sing to
me!"

<p>
But the bird was silent; there was no one to wind him up, and
therefore
he could not sing.  Death went on, staring at the Emperor with his
great
hollow eyes, and it was terribly still.

<p>
Then suddenly, close to the window, came the sound of a lovely song.
It
was the little live Nightingale perched on a branch outside.  It had
heard of its Emperor's need, and had therefore flown hither to bring
him
comfort and hope, and as he sang, the faces became paler and the
blood
coursed more freely through the Emperor's veins.  Even Death himself
listened and said: "Go on, little Nightingale.  Go on."

<p>
"Yes, if you will give me the splendid sword.  Yes, if you will give
me
the Imperial banner!  Yes, if you will give me the Emperor's crown!"

<p>
And Death gave back all these treasures for a song.  And still the
Nightingale sang on.  He sang of the quiet churchyard, where the
white
roses grow, where the elder flowers bloom, and where the grass is
kept
moist by the tears of those left behind, and there came to Death
such a
longing to see his garden, that he floated out of the window, like a
could white mist.

<p>
"Thank you, thank you," said the Emperor.  "You heavenly little
bird, I
know you well!  I banished you from the land, and you have charmed
away
the evil spirits from my bed and you have driven Death from my
heart.
How shall I reward you?"

<p>
"You have rewarded me," said the Nightingale.  "I brought tears to
your
eyes the first time I sang, and I shall never forget that.  Those
are
the jewels which touched the heart of the singer; but sleep now,
that
you may wake fresh and strong.  I will sing to you."  Then it sang
again, and the Emperor fell into a sweet sleep.

<p>
The sun shone in upon him through the window, when he woke the next
morning feeling strong and well.  None of his servants had come
back,
because they thought he was dead, but the Nightingale was still
singing.

<p>
You will always stay with me," said the Emperor.  "You shall only
sing
when it pleases you, and I will break the artificial Nightingale
into a
thousand pieces."

<p>
"Do not do that," said the Nightingale.  "It has done the best it
could.
Keep it with you.  I cannot build my nest in a palace, but let me
come
just as I please.  I well sit on the branch near the window, and
sing to
you that you may both joyful and thoughtful.  I will sing to you of
the
happy folk, and of those that suffer; I will sing of the evil and of
the
good, which is being hidden from you.  The little singing bird flies
hither and thither, to the poor fisherman, to the peasant's hut, to
many
who live far from your Court.  Your heart is dearer to me than your
crown, and yet the crown has a breath of sanctity, too.  I will
come, I
will sing to you!  But one thing you must promise me!"

<p>
"All that you ask," said the Emperor, and stood there in his
imperial
robes which he had put on himself, and held the heavy golden sword
on
his heart.

<p>
"I beg you, let no one know that you have a little bird who tells
you
everything.  It will be far better so!"

<p>
Then the Nightingale flew away.

<p>
The servants came to look upon their dead Emperor.  Yes, there they
stood; and the Emperor said: "Good morning!"</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align=center><a name="pea">THE PRINCESS AND THE PEA</a></h4>

<p>
There was once a Prince who wished to marry a Princess, but she must
be
a <i>real</i> Princess.  He travelled all over the world to find
one,
but there was always something wrong.  There were plenty of
Princesses,
but whether they were <i>real</i> or not he could not be sure.
There
was always something that was not quite right.  So he came home
again,
feeling very sad, for he was so anxious to have a real Princess.

<p>
One evening there was a terrible storm; it lightened and thundered,
and
the rain came down in torrents; it was a fearful night.  In the
midst of
the storm there came a knocking at the town-gate, and the old King
himself went down to open it.  There, outside stood a princess.  But
what a state she was in from the rain and the storm!  The water was
running out of her hair on to her clothes, into he shoes and out at
the
heels; and yet she said she was a <i>real</i> Princess.

<p>
"We shall soon find out about that," thought the old Queen.  But she
said never a word.  She went into the bedroom, took off all the
bedclothes and put a pea on the bedstead.  Then she took twenty
mattresses and laid them on the pea and twenty eider-down quilts on
the
mattresses.  And the Princess was to sleep on the top of all.

<p>
In the morning they came to her and asked her how she had slept.

<p>
"Oh! wretchedly," said the Princess.  "I scarcely closed my eyes the
whole night long.  Heaven knows what could have been in the bed!  I
have
lain upon something hard, so that my whole body is black and blue.
It
is quite dreadful."

<p>
They could see now that she was a <i>real</i> Princess, because she
had
felt the pea through twenty mattresses and twenty eider-down quilts.
Nobody but a real Princess could be so sensitive.

<p>
So the Prince married her, for now he knew that he had found a <i>
real
</i> Princess, and the pea was sent to an Art Museum, where it can
still
be seen, if nobody has taken it away.

<p>
Now, mark you: This is a true story.</p>

<p align=center>AUTHOR'S NOTE</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I had intended, in this section, to offer an appendix of titles of
stories and books which should cover all the ground of possible
narrative in schools; but I have found so many lists containing
standard
books and stories, that I have decided that this original plan would
be
a work of supererogation.  What is really needed is a supplementary
list
to those already published&mdash;a specialized list which is the
result
of private research and personal experience.  I have for many years
spent considerable time in the British Museum and some of the
principal
libraries in America.  I now offer the fruit of my labor.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I trust that the grouping of my stories in this section may not be
misleading. Under "Myths, Legends and Fairy Tales" I have included
many
stories which contain valuable ethical teaching, deep philosophy and
stimulating examples for conduct in life.  I regret that I have been
unable to find a good collection of stories from history for
narrative
purposes.  I have made a careful and lengthy search, but the stories
are
all written from the <i>reading</i> point of view rather than the <i
>
telling.</i>

<p>1. I venture to hope (at this long distance of years) that my<br>
language in telling the story was more simple than appears from this
<br>
account.

<p>2. This difference of spelling in the same essay will be much<br>
appreciated by those who know how gladly children offer an
orthographical<br> alternative, in hopes that one if not the other
may
satisfy the exigency<br> of the situation.</p>

<p>9. A noted Greek gymnast struck his pupil, though he was
applauded by

artistic."

intense enjoyment bound up with the process of imaginative
realization.

<p>13. There must be no more emphasis in the second manner than<br>
the first.

<p>14. From "Education of an Orator," Book II, Chapter 3.

<p>15. One child's favorite book bore the exciting title of "Birth,
<br>
Life and Death of Crazy Jane."

<p>16. This does not imply that the child would not appreciate in
the
right<br> context the thrilling and romantic story in connection
with<br
> the finding of the Elgin marbles.</p>

<p>17. One is almost inclined to prefer Marjorie Fleming's little<br

innocent oaths.

<p>19. From "Literary Values."

<p>20. A story is told of Confucius, who, having attended a funeral,
<br>
presented his horse to the chief mourner.  When asked why he
bestowed<br

given
<br>in the "Agamemnon" (speaking of the victor's attitude after the
taking<br>of Troy):

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Yea, let no craving for forbidden gain<br>
Bid conquerors yield before the darts of greed."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>42. It is curious to find that the story of Puss-in-Boots in its
variants<br> is sometimes presented with a moral, sometimes without.
In
the Valley<br> of the Ganges it has <i>none.</i>  In Cashmere it has
<br>
one moral, in Zanzibar another.

<p>48. In this matter I have, in England, the support of Dr.
Kimmins,<br
>Chief Inspector of Education in the London County Council, who is
<br>
strongly opposed to the immediate reproduction of stories.

<p>49. These remarks refer only to the illustrations of stories
told.<br
> Whether children should be encouraged to self-expression in
drawing<br
>(quite apart form reproducing in one medium what has been conveyed
to
<br> them in another), is too large a question to deal with in this
special<br> work on story-telling.

<p>50. I give the following story, quoted by Professor Ker in his
Romanes<br> lecture, 1906, as an encouragement to those who develop
the
art of<br>story-telling.

<p>51. The melody to be crooned at first and to grow louder at <br>
each
incident.

<p>52. "The punishment that can most affect Merfolk is to restrict
their
<br>freedom.  And this is how the Queen of the Sea punished the
Nixie of
<br>our tale."

<p>53. The three stories from Hans Christian Andersen have for so
long
<br> formed part of my r&eacute;pertoire that I have been requested
to
<br>include them.  I am offering a free translation of my own from
the
<br>Danish version.

<p>54. Alas! dear Augustin, All is lost, lost!</p>

End of Project Gutenberg's The Art of the Story-Teller, by Marie L. Shedlock

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ART OF THE STORY-TELLER ***

This file should be named strtl10.txt or strtl10.zip
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks get a new NUMBER, strtl11.txt
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, strtl10a.txt

This etext was created by Doug Levy, _literra scripta manet_.

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
texts harmless, from all liability, cost and expense, including
legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the
following that you do or cause:  [1] distribution of this eBook,
[2] alteration, modification, or addition to the eBook,
or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"

          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The eBook may be readily converted by the reader at
