*****This file should be named 2musk10.txt or 2musk10.zip******

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, 2musk11.txt

Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we do NOT keep these books
in compliance with any particular paper edition, usually otherwise.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month, or 384 more Etexts in 1998 for a total of 1500+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 150 billion Etexts given away.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

Ten Years Later
by Alexandre Dumas




The Vicomte de Bragelonne.

Volume I.




CHAPTER 1

The Letter.



Towards the middle of the month of May, in the year 1660, at
nine o'clock in the morning, when the sun, already high in
the heavens, was fast absorbing the dew from the ramparts of
the castle of Blois a little cavalcade, composed of three
men and two pages, re-entered the city by the bridge,
without producing any other effect upon the passengers of
the quay beyond a first movement of the hand to the head, as
a salute, and a second movement of the tongue to express, in
the purest French then spoken in France: "There is Monsieur
returning from hunting." And that was all.

Whilst, however, the horses were climbing the steep
acclivity which leads from the river to the castle, several
shop-boys approached the last horse, from whose saddle-bow a
number of birds were suspended by the beak.

On seeing this, the inquisitive youths manifested with
rustic freedom their contempt for such paltry sport, and,
after a dissertation among themselves upon the disadvantages
of hawking, they returned to their occupations; one only of
the curious party, a stout, stubby, cheerful lad, having
demanded how it was that Monsieur, who, from his great
revenues, had it in his power to amuse himself so much
better, could be satisfied with such mean diversions.

"Do you not know," one of the standers-by replied, "that
Monsieur's principal amusement is to weary himself?"

The light-hearted boy shrugged his shoulders with a gesture
which said as clear as day: "In that case I would rather be
plain Jack than a prince." And all resumed their labors.

In the meanwhile, Monsieur continued his route with an air
at once so melancholy and so majestic, that he certainly
would have attracted the attention of spectators, if
spectators there had been; but the good citizens of Blois
could not pardon Monsieur for having chosen their gay city
for an abode in which to indulge melancholy at his ease, and
as often as they caught a glimpse of the illustrious ennuye,
they stole away gaping, or drew back their heads into the
interior of their dwellings, to escape the soporific
influence of that long pale face, of those watery eyes, and
that languid address; so that the worthy prince was almost
certain to find the streets deserted whenever he chanced to
pass through them.

Now, on the part of the citizens of Blois this was a
culpable piece of disrespect, for Monsieur was, after the
king -- nay, even, perhaps before the king -- the greatest
noble of the kingdom. In fact, God, who had granted to Louis
XIV., then reigning, the honor of being son of Louis XIII.,
had granted to Monsieur the honor of being son of Henry IV.
It was not then, or, at least it ought not to have been, a
trifling source of pride for the city of Blois, that Gaston
of Orleans had chosen it as his residence, and he his court
in the ancient castle of its states.

But it was the destiny of this great prince to excite the
attention and admiration of the public in a very modified
degree wherever he might be. Monsieur had fallen into this
situation by habit.

It was not, perhaps, this which gave him that air of
listlessness. Monsieur had been tolerably busy in the course
of his life. A man cannot allow the heads of a dozen of his
best friends to be cut off without feeling a little
excitement, and as, since the accession of Mazarin to power,
no heads had been cut off, Monsieur's occupation was gone,
and his morale suffered from it.

The life of the poor prince was, then, very dull. After his
little morning hawking-party on the banks of the Beuvion, or
in the woods of Chiverny, Monsieur crossed the Loire, went
to breakfast at Chambord, with or without an appetite and
the city of Blois heard no more of its sovereign lord and
master till the next hawking-day.

So much for the ennui extra muros; of the ennui of the
interior we will give the reader an idea if he will with us
follow the cavalcade to the majestic porch of the castle of
the states.

Monsieur rode a little steady-paced horse, equipped with a
large saddle of red Flemish velvet, with stirrups in the
shape of buskins; the horse was of a bay color; Monsieur's
pourpoint of crimson velvet corresponded with the cloak of
the same shade and the horse's equipment, and it was only by
this red appearance of the whole that the prince could be
known from his two companions, the one dressed in violet,
the other in green. He on the left, in violet, was his
equerry; he on the right, in green, was the grand veneur.

One of the pages carried two gerfalcons upon a perch, the
other a hunting-horn, which he blew with a careless note at
twenty paces from the castle. Every one about this listless
prince did what he had to do listlessly.

At this signal, eight guards, who were lounging in the sun
in the square court, ran to their halberts, and Monsieur
made his solemn entry into the castle.

When he had disappeared under the shades of the porch, three
or four idlers, who had followed the cavalcade to the
castle, after pointing out the suspended birds to each
other, dispersed with comments upon what they saw: and, when
they were gone, the street, the place, and the court all
remained deserted alike.

Monsieur dismounted without speaking a word, went straight
to his apartments, where his valet changed his dress, and as
Madame had not yet sent orders respecting breakfast,
Monsieur stretched himself upon a chaise longue, and was
soon as fast asleep as if it had been eleven o'clock at
night.

The eight guards, who concluded their service for the day
was over, laid themselves down very comfortably in the sun
upon some stone benches; the grooms disappeared with their
horses into the stables, and, with the exception of a few
joyous birds, startling each other with their sharp chirping
in the tufted shrubberies, it might have been thought that
the whole castle was as soundly asleep as Monsieur was.

All at once, in the midst of this delicious silence, there
resounded a clear ringing laugh, which caused several of the
halberdiers in the enjoyment of their siesta to open at
least one eye.

This burst of laughter proceeded from a window of the
castle, visited at this moment by the sun, that embraced it
in one of those large angles which the profiles of the
chimneys mark out upon the walls before mid-day.

The little balcony of wrought iron which advanced in front
of this window was furnished with a pot of red gilliflowers,
another pot of primroses, and an early rose-tree, the
foliage of which, beautifully green, was variegated with
numerous red specks announcing future roses.

In the chamber lighted by this window was a square table,
covered with an old large-flowered Haarlem tapestry; in the
center of this table was a long-necked stone bottle, in
which were irises and lilies of the valley; at each end of
this table was a young girl.

The position of these two young people was singular; they
might have been taken for two boarders escaped from a
convent. One of them, with both elbows on the table, and a
pen in her hand, was tracing characters upon a sheet of fine
Dutch paper; the other, kneeling upon a chair, which allowed
her to advance her head and bust over the back of it to the
middle of the table, was watching her companion as she
wrote, or rather hesitated to write.

Thence the thousand cries, the thousand railleries, the
thousand laughs, one of which, more brilliant than the rest,
had startled the birds in the gardens, and disturbed the
slumbers of Monsieur's guards.

We are taking portraits now; we shall be allowed, therefore,
we hope, to sketch the two last of this chapter.

The one who was leaning in the chair -- that is to say, the
joyous, the laughing one -- was a beautiful girl of from
eighteen to twenty, with brown complexion and brown hair,
splendid, from eyes which sparkled beneath strongly-marked
brows, and particularly from her teeth, which seemed to
shine like pearls between her red coral lips. Her every
movement seemed the accent of a sunny nature, she did not
walk -- she bounded.

The other, she who was writing, looked at her turbulent
companion with an eye as limpid, as pure, and as blue as the
azure of the day. Her hair, of a shaded fairness, arranged
with exquisite taste, fell in silky curls over her lovely
mantling cheeks; she passed across the paper a delicate
hand, whose thinness announced her extreme youth. At each
burst of laughter that proceeded from her friend, she
raised, as if annoyed, her white shoulders in a poetical and
mild manner, but they were wanting in that richfulness of
mold which was likewise to be wished in her arms and hands.

"Montalais! Montalais!" said she at length, in a voice soft
and caressing as a melody, "you laugh too loud -- you laugh
like a man! You will not only draw the attention of
messieurs the guards, but you will not hear Madame's bell
when Madame rings."

This admonition neither made the young girl called Montalais
cease to laugh and gesticulate. She only replied: "Louise,
you do not speak as you think, my dear; you know that
messieurs the guards, as you call them, have only just
commenced their sleep, and that a cannon would not waken
them; you know that Madame's bell can be heard at the bridge
of Blois, and that consequently I shall hear it when my
services are required by Madame. What annoys you, my child,
is that I laugh while you are writing; and what you are
afraid of is that Madame de Saint-Remy, your mother, should
come up here, as she does sometimes when we laugh too loud,
that she should surprise us, and that she should see that
enormous sheet of paper upon which, in a quarter of an hour,
you have only traced the words Monsieur Raoul. Now, you are
right, my dear Louise, because after these words, `Monsieur
Raoul,' others may be put so significant and so incendiary
as to cause Madame de Saint-Remy to burst out into fire and
flames! Hein! is not that true now? -- say."

And Montalais redoubled her laughter and noisy provocations.

The fair girl at length became quite angry; she tore the
sheet of paper on which, in fact, the words "Monsieur Raoul"
were written in good characters, and crushing the paper in
her trembling hands, she threw it out of the window.

"There! there!" said Mademoiselle de Montalais; "there is
our little lamb, our gentle dove, angry! Don't be afraid,
Louise -- Madame de Saint-Remy will not come; and if she
should, you know I have a quick ear. Besides, what can be
more permissible than to write to an old friend of twelve
years' standing, particularly when the letter begins with
the words `Monsieur Raoul'?"

"It is all very well -- I will not write to him at all,"
said the young girl.

"Ah, ah! in good sooth, Montalais is properly punished,"
cried the jeering brunette, still laughing. "Come, come! let
us try another sheet of paper, and finish our dispatch
off-hand. Good! there is the bell ringing now. By my faith,
so much the worse! Madame must wait, or else do without her
first maid of honor this morning."

A bell, in fact, did ring; it announced that Madame had
finished her toilette, and waited for Monsieur to give her
his hand, and conduct her from the salon to the refectory.

This formality being accomplished with great ceremony, the
husband and wife breakfasted, and then separated till the
hour of dinner, invariably fixed at two o'clock.

The sound of this bell caused a door to be opened in the
offices on the left hand of the court, from which filed two
maitres d'hotel followed by eight scullions bearing a kind
of hand-barrow loaded with dishes under silver covers.

One of the maitres d'hotel, the first in rank, touched one
of the guards, who was snoring on his bench, slightly with
his wand; he even carried his kindness so far as to place
the halbert which stood against the wall in the hands of the
man stupid with sleep, after which the soldier, without
explanation, escorted the viande of Monsieur to the
refectory, preceded by a page and the two maitres d'hotel.

Wherever the viande passed, the soldiers ported arms.

Mademoiselle de Montalais and her companion had watched from
their window the details of this ceremony, to which, by the
bye, they must have been pretty well accustomed. But they
did not look so much from curiosity as to be assured they
should not be disturbed. So guards, scullions, maitres
d'hotel, and pages having passed, they resumed their places
at the table; and the sun, which, through the window-frame,
had for an instant fallen upon those two charming
countenances, now only shed its light upon the gilliflowers,
primroses, and rosetree.

"Bah!" said Mademoiselle de Montalais, taking her place
again; "Madame will breakfast very well without me!"

"Oh! Montalais, you will be punished!" replied the other
girl, sitting down quietly in hers.

"Punished, indeed! -- that is to say, deprived of a ride!
That is just the way in which I wish to be punished. To go
out in the grand coach, perched upon a doorstep; to turn to
the left, twist round to the right, over roads full of ruts,
where we cannot exceed a league in two hours; and then to
come back straight towards the wing of the castle in which
is the window of Mary de Medici, so that Madame never fails
to say: `Could one believe it possible that Mary de Medici
should have escaped from that window -- forty-seven feet
high? The mother of two princes and three princesses!' If
you call that relaxation, Louise, all I ask is to be
punished every day; particularly when my punishment is to
remain with you and write such interesting letters as we
write!"

"Montalais! Montalais! there are duties to be performed."

"You talk of them very much at your ease, dear child! --
you, who are left quite free amidst this tedious court. You
are the only person that reaps the advantages of them
without incurring the trouble, -- you, who are really more
one of Madame's maids of honor than I am, because Madame
makes her affection for your father-in-law glance off upon
you; so that you enter this dull house as the birds fly into
yonder court, inhaling the air, pecking the flowers, picking
up the grain, without having the least service to perform,
or the least annoyance to undergo. And you talk to me of
duties to be performed! In sooth, my pretty idler, what are
your own proper duties, unless to write to the handsome
Raoul? And even that you don't do; so that it looks to me as
if you likewise were rather negligent of your duties!"

Louise assumed a serious air, leant her chin upon her hand,
and, in a tone full of candid remonstrance, "And do you
reproach me with my good fortune?" said she. "Can you have
the heart to do it? You have a future; you belong to the
court; the king, if he should marry, will require Monsieur
to be near his person; you will see splendid fetes; you will
see the king, who they say is so handsome, so agreeable!"

"Ay, and still more, I shall see Raoul, who attends upon M.
le Prince," added Montalais, maliciously.

"Poor Raoul!" sighed Louise.

"Now is the time to write to him, my pretty dear! Come,
begin again, with that famous `Monsieur Raoul' which figures
at the top of the poor torn sheet."

She then held the pen toward her, and with a charming smile
encouraged her hand, which quickly traced the words she
named.

"What next?" asked the younger of the two girls.

"Why, now write what you think, Louise," replied Montalais.

"Are you quite sure I think of anything?"

"You think of somebody, and that amounts to the same thing,
or rather even more."

"Do you think so, Montalais?"

"Louise, Louise, your blue eyes are as deep as the sea I saw
at Boulogne last year! No, no, I mistake -- the sea is
perfidious: your eyes are as deep as the azure yonder --
look! -- over our heads!"

"Well, since you can read so well in my eyes, tell me what I
am thinking about, Montalais."

"In the first place, you don't think Monsieur Raoul; you
think My dear Raoul."

"Oh! ---- "

"Never blush for such a trifle as that! `My dear Raoul,' we
will say -- `You implore me to write to you at Paris, where
you are detained by your attendance on M. le Prince. As you
must be very dull there, to seek for amusement in the
remembrance of a provinciale ---- '"

Louise rose up suddenly. "No, Montalais," said she, with a
smile; "I don't think a word of that. Look, this is what I
think;" and she seized the pen boldly and traced, with a
firm hand, the following words: --

"I should have been very unhappy if your entreaties to
obtain a remembrance of me had been less warm. Everything
here reminds me of our early days, which so quickly passed
away, which so delightfully flew by, that no others will
ever replace the charm of them in my heart."

Montalais, who watched the flying pen, and read, the wrong
way upwards, as fast as her friend wrote, here interrupted
by clapping her hands. "Capital!" cried she; "there is
frankness -- there is heart -- there is style! Show these
Parisians, my dear, that Blois is the city for fine
language!"

"He knows very well that Blois was a Paradise to me,"
replied the girl.

"That is exactly what you mean to say; and you speak like an
angel."

"I will finish, Montalais," and she continued as follows:
"You often think of me, you say, Monsieur Raoul: I thank
you; but that does not surprise me, when I recollect how
often our hearts have beaten close to each other."

"Oh! oh!" said Montalais. "Beware; my lamb! You are
scattering your wool, and there are wolves about."

Louise was about to reply, when the gallop of a horse
resounded under the porch of the castle.

"What is that?" said Montalais, approaching the window. "A
handsome cavalier, by my faith!"

"Oh! -- Raoul!" exclaimed Louise, who had made the same
movement as her friend, and, becoming pale as death, sunk
back beside her unfinished letter.

"Now, he is a clever lover, upon my word!" cried Montalais;
"he arrives just at the proper moment."

"Come in, come in, I implore you!" murmured Louise.

"Bah! he does not know me. Let me see what he has come here
for."




CHAPTER 2

The Messenger.



Mademoiselle de Montalais was right; the young cavalier was
goodly to look upon.

He was a young man of from twenty-four to twenty-five years
of age, tall and slender, wearing gracefully the picturesque
military costume of the period. His large boots contained a
foot which Mademoiselle de Montalais might not have disowned
if she had been transformed into a man. With one of his
delicate but nervous hands he checked his horse in the
middle of the court, and with the other raised his hat,
whose long plumes shaded his at once serious and ingenuous
countenance.

The guards, roused by the steps of the horse, awoke and were
on foot in a minute. The young man waited till one of them
was close to his saddle-bow: then stooping towards him, in a
clear, distinct voice, which was perfectly audible at the
window where the two girls were concealed, "A message for
his royal highness," he said.

"Ah, ah!" cried the soldier. "Officer, a messenger!"

But this brave guard knew very well that no officer would
appear, seeing that the only one who could have appeared
dwelt at the other side of the castle, in an apartment
looking into the gardens. So he hastened to add: "The
officer, monsieur, is on his rounds, but in his absence, M.
de Saint-Remy, the maitre d'hotel shall be informed."

"M. de Saint-Remy?" repeated the cavalier, slightly
blushing.

"Do you know him?"

"Why, yes; but request him, if you please, that my visit be
announced to his royal highness as soon as possible."

"It appears to be pressing," said the guard, as if speaking
to himself, but really in the hope of obtaining an answer.

The messenger made an affirmative sign with his head.

"In that case," said the guard, "I will go and seek the
maitre d'hotel myself."

The young man, in the meantime, dismounted; and whilst the
others were making their remarks upon the fine horse the
cavalier rode, the soldier returned.

"Your pardon, young gentleman; but your name, if you
please?"

"The Vicomte de Bragelonne, on the part of his highness M.
le Prince de Conde."

The soldier made a profound bow, and, as if the name of the
conqueror of Rocroy and Sens had given him wings, he stepped
lightly up the steps leading to the ante-chamber.

M. de Bragelonne had not had time to fasten his horse to the
iron bars of the perron, when M. de Saint-Remy came running,
out of breath, supporting his capacious body with one hand,
whilst with the other he cut the air as a fisherman cleaves
the waves with his oar.

"Ah, Monsieur le Vicomte! You at Blois!" cried he. "Well,
that is a wonder. Good-day to you -- good-day, Monsieur
Raoul."

"I offer you a thousand respects, M. de Saint-Remy."

"How Madame de la Vall -- I mean, how delighted Madame de
Saint-Remy will be to see you! But come in. His royal
highness is at breakfast -- must he be interrupted? Is the
matter serious?"

"Yes, and no, Monsieur de Saint-Remy. A moment's delay,
however, would be disagreeable to his royal highness."

"If that is the case, we will force the consigne, Monsieur
le Vicomte. Come in. Besides, Monsieur is in an excellent
humor to-day. And then you bring news, do you not?"

"Great news, Monsieur de Saint-Remy."

"And good, I presume?"

"Excellent."

"Come quickly, come quickly then!" cried the worthy man,
putting his dress to rights as he went along.

Raoul followed him, hat in hand, and a little disconcerted
at the noise made by his spurs in these immense salons.

As soon as he had disappeared in the interior of the palace,
the window of the court was repeopled, and an animated
whispering betrayed the emotion of the two girls. They soon
appeared to have formed a resolution, for one of the two
faces disappeared from the window. This was the brunette;
the other remained behind the balcony, concealed by the
flowers, watching attentively through the branches the
perron by which M. de Bragelonne had entered the castle.

In the meantime the object of so much laudable curiosity
continued his route, following the steps of the maitre
d'hotel. The noise of quick steps, an odor of wine and
viands, a clinking of crystal and plates, warned them that
they were coming to the end of their course.

The pages, valets and officers, assembled in the office
which led up to the refectory, welcomed the newcomer with
the proverbial politeness of the country; some of them were
acquainted with Raoul, and all knew that he came from Paris.
It might be said that his arrival for a moment suspended the
service. In fact, a page, who was pouring out wine for his
royal highness, on hearing the jingling of spurs in the next
chamber, turned round like a child, without perceiving that
he was continuing to pour out, not into the glass, but upon
the tablecloth.

Madame, who was not so preoccupied as her glorious spouse
was, remarked this distraction of the page.

"Well?" exclaimed she.

"Well!" repeated Monsieur; "what is going on then?"

M. de Saint-Remy, who had just introduced his head through
the doorway, took advantage of the moment.

"Why am I to be disturbed?" said Gaston, helping himself to
a thick slice of one of the largest salmon that had ever
ascended the Loire to be captured between Painboeuf and
Saint-Nazaire.

"There is a messenger from Paris. Oh! but after monseigneur
has breakfasted will do; there is plenty of time."

"From Paris!" cried the prince, letting his fork fall. "A
messenger from Paris, do you say? And on whose part does
this messenger come?"

"On the part of M. le Prince," said the maitre d'hotel
promptly.

Every one knows that the Prince de Conde was so called.

"A messenger from M. le Prince!" said Gaston, with an
inquietude that escaped none of the assistants, and
consequently redoubled the general curiosity.

Monsieur, perhaps, fancied himself brought back again to the
happy times when the opening of a door gave him an emotion,
in which every letter might contain a state secret, -- in
which every message was connected with a dark and
complicated intrigue. Perhaps, likewise, that great name of
M. le Prince expanded itself, beneath the roofs of Blois, to
the proportions of a phantom.

Monsieur pushed away his plate.

"Shall I tell the envoy to wait?" asked M. de Saint-Remy.

A glance from Madame emboldened Gaston, who replied: "No,
no! let him come in at once, on the contrary. A propos, who
is he?"

"A gentleman of this country, M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne."

"Ah, very well! Introduce him, Saint-Remy -- introduce him."

And when he had let fall these words, with his accustomed
gravity, Monsieur turned his eyes, in a certain manner, upon
the people of his suite, so that all, pages, officers, and
equerries, quitted the service, knives and goblets, and made
towards the second chamber a retreat as rapid as it was
disorderly.

This little army had dispersed in two files when Raoul de
Bragelonne, preceded by M. de Saint-Remy, entered the
refectory.

The short interval of solitude which this retreat had left
him, permitted Monsieur the time to assume a diplomatic
countenance. He did not turn round, but waited till the
maitre d'hotel should bring the messenger face to face with
him.

Raoul stopped even with the lower end of the table, so as to
be exactly between Monsieur and Madame. From this place he
made a profound bow to Monsieur and a very humble one to
Madame; then, drawing himself up into military pose, he
waited for Monsieur to address him.

On his part the Prince waited till the doors were
hermetically closed; he would not turn round to ascertain
the fact, as that would have been derogatory to his dignity,
but he listened with all his ears for the noise of the lock,
which would promise him at least an appearance of secrecy.

The doors being closed, Monsieur raised his eyes towards the
vicomte, and said, "It appears that you come from Paris,
monsieur?"

"This minute, monseigneur."

"How is the king?"

"His majesty is in perfect health, monseigneur."

"And my sister-in-law?"

"Her majesty the queen-mother still suffers from the
complaint in her chest, but for the last month she has been
rather better."

"Somebody told me you came on the part of M. le Prince. They
must have been mistaken, surely?"

"No, monseigneur; M. le Prince has charged me to convey this
letter to your royal highness, and I am to wait for an
answer to it."

Raoul had been a little annoyed by this cold and cautious
reception, and his voice insensibly sank to a low key.

The prince forgot that he was the cause of this apparent
mystery, and his fears returned.

He received the letter from the Prince de Conde with a
haggard look, unsealed it as he would have unsealed a
suspicious packet, and in order to read it so that no one
should remark the effects of it upon his countenance, he
turned round.

Madame followed, with an anxiety almost equal to that of the
prince, every maneuver of her august husband.

Raoul, impassible, and a little disengaged by the attention
of his hosts, looked from his place through the open window
at the gardens and the statues which peopled them.

"Well!" cried Monsieur, all at once, with a cheerful smile;
"here is an agreeable surprise, and a charming letter from
M. le Prince. Look, Madame!"

The table was too large to allow the arm of the prince to
reach the hand of Madame; Raoul sprang forward to be their
intermediary, and did it with so good a grace as to procure
a flattering acknowledgment from the princess.

"You know the contents of this letter, no doubt?" said
Gaston to Raoul.

"Yes, monseigneur; M. le Prince at first gave me the message
verbally, but upon reflection his highness took up his pen."

"It is beautiful writing," said Madame, "but I cannot read
it."

"Will you read it to Madame, M. de Bragelonne?" said the
duke.

"Yes, read it, if you please, monsieur."

Raoul began to read, Monsieur giving again all his
attention. The letter was conceived in these terms:



Monseigneur -- The king is about to set out for the
frontiers. You are aware that the marriage of his majesty is
concluded upon. The king has done me the honor to appoint me
his marechal-des-logis for this journey, and as I knew with
what joy his majesty would pass a day at Blois, I venture to
ask your royal highness's permission to mark the house you
inhabit as our quarters. If, however, the suddenness of this
request should create to your royal highness any
embarrassment, I entreat you to say so by the messenger I
send, a gentleman of my suite, M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne.
My itinerary will depend upon your royal highness's
determination, and instead of passing through Blois, we
shall come through Vendome and Romorantin. I venture to hope
that your royal highness will be pleased with my
arrangement, it being the expression of my boundless desire
to make myself agreeable to you."



"Nothing can be more gracious toward us," said Madame, who
had more than once consulted the looks of her husband during
the reading of the letter. "The king here!" exclaimed she,
in a rather louder tone than would have been necessary to
preserve secrecy.

"Monsieur," said his royal highness in his turn, "you will
offer my thanks to M. de Conde, and express to him my
gratitude for the honor he has done me."

Raoul bowed.

"On what day will his majesty arrive?" continued the prince.

"The king, monseigneur, will in all probability arrive this
evening."

"But how, then, could he have known my reply if it had been
in the negative?"

"I was desired, monseigneur, to return in all haste to
Beaugency, to give counter-orders to the courier, who was
himself to go back immediately with counter-orders to M. le
Prince."

"His majesty is at Orleans, then?"

"Much nearer, monseigneur; his majesty must by this time
have arrived at Meung."

"Does the court accompany him?"

"Yes, monseigneur."

"A propos, I forgot to ask you after M. le Cardinal."

"His eminence appears to enjoy good health, monseigneur."

"His nieces accompany him, no doubt?"

"No, monseigneur, his eminence has ordered the
Mesdemoiselles de Mancini to set out for Brouage. They will
follow the left bank of the Loire, while the court will come
by the right."

"What! Mademoiselle Mary de Mancini quit the court in that
manner?" asked Monsieur, his reserve beginning to diminish.

"Mademoiselle Mary de Mancini in particular," replied Raoul
discreetly.

A fugitive smile, an imperceptible vestige of his ancient
spirit of intrigue, shot across the pale face of the prince.

"Thanks, M. de Bragelonne," then said Monsieur. "You would,
perhaps, not be willing to carry M. le Prince the commission
with which I would charge you, and that is, that his
messenger has been very agreeable to me; but I will tell him
so myself."

Raoul bowed his thanks to Monsieur for the honor he had done
him.

Monsieur made a sign to Madame, who struck a bell which was
placed at her right hand; M. de Saint-Remy entered, and the
room was soon filled with people.

"Messieurs," said the prince, "his majesty is about to pay
me the honor of passing a day at Blois; I depend upon the
king, my nephew, not having to repent of the favor he does
my house."

"Vive le Roi!" cried all the officers of the household with
frantic enthusiasm, and M. de Saint-Remy louder than the
rest.

Gaston hung down his head with evident chagrin. He had all
his life been obliged to hear, or rather to undergo this cry
of "Vive le Roi!" which passed over him. For a long time,
being unaccustomed to hear it, his ear had had rest, and now
a younger, more vivacious, and more brilliant royalty rose
up before him, like a new and more painful provocation.

Madame perfectly understood the sufferings of that timid,
gloomy heart; she rose from the table, Monsieur imitated her
mechanically, and all the domestics, with a buzzing like
that of several bee-hives, surrounded Raoul for the purpose
of questioning him.

Madame saw this movement, and called M. de Saint Remy. "This
is not the time for gossiping, but working," said she, with
the tone of an angry housekeeper.

M. de Saint-Remy hastened to break the circle formed by the
officers round Raoul, so that the latter was able to gain
the ante-chamber.

"Care will be taken of that gentleman, I hope," added
Madame, addressing M. de Saint-Remy.

The worthy man immediately hastened after Raoul. "Madame
desires refreshments to be offered to you," said he; "and
there is, besides, a lodging for you in the castle."

"Thanks, M. de Saint-Remy," replied Raoul; "but you know how
anxious I must be to pay my duty to M. le Comte, my father."

"That is true, that is true, Monsieur Raoul; present him, at
the same time, my humble respects, if you please."

Raoul thus once more got rid of the old gentleman, and
pursued his way. As he was passing under the porch, leading
his horse by the bridle, a soft voice called him from the
depths of an obscure path.

"Monsieur Raoul!" said the voice.

The young man turned round, surprised, and saw a dark
complexioned girl, who, with a finger on her lip, held out
her other hand to him. This young lady was an utter
stranger.




CHAPTER 3

The Interview.



Raoul made one step towards the girl who thus called him.

"But my horse, madame?" said he.

"Oh! you are terribly embarrassed! Go yonder way -- there is
a shed in the outer court: fasten your horse, and return
quickly!"

"I obey, madame."

Raoul was not four minutes in performing what he had been
directed to do; he returned to the little door, where, in
the gloom, he found his mysterious conductress waiting for
him, on the first steps of a winding staircase.

"Are you brave enough to follow me, monsieur knight errant?"
asked the girl, laughing at the momentary hesitation Raoul
had manifested.

The latter replied by springing up the dark staircase after
her. They thus climbed up three stories, he behind her,
touching with his hands, when he felt for the banister, a
silk dress which rubbed against each side of the staircase.
At every false step made by Raoul, his conductress cried,
"Hush!" and held out to him a soft and perfumed hand.

"One would mount thus to the belfry of the castle without
being conscious of fatigue," said Raoul.

"All of which means, monsieur, that you are very much
perplexed, very tired, and very uneasy. But be of good
cheer, monsieur; here we are, at our destination."

The girl threw open a door, which immediately, without any
transition, filled with a flood of light the landing of the
staircase, at the top of which Raoul appeared, holding fast
by the balustrade.

The girl continued to walk on -- he followed her; she
entered a chamber -- he did the same.

As soon as he was fairly in the net he heard a loud cry,
and, turning round, saw at two paces from him, with her
hands clasped and her eyes closed, that beautiful fair girl
with blue eyes and white shoulders, who, recognizing him,
called him Raoul.

He saw her, and divined at once so much love and so much joy
in the expression of her countenance, that he sank on his
knees in the middle of the chamber, murmuring, on his part,
the name of Louise.

"Ah! Montalais -- Montalais!" she sighed, "it is very wicked
to deceive me so."

"Who, I? I have deceived you?"

"Yes; you told me you would go down to inquire the news, and
you have brought up monsieur!"

"Well, I was obliged to do so -- how else could he have
received the letter you wrote him?" And she pointed with her
finger to the letter which was still upon the table.

Raoul made a step to take it; Louise, more rapid, although
she had sprung forward with a sufficiently remarkable
physical hesitation, reached out her hand to stop him. Raoul
came in contact with that trembling hand, took it within his
own, and carried it so respectfully to his lips, that he
might be said to have deposited a sigh upon it rather than a
kiss.

In the meantime Mademoiselle de Montalais had taken the
letter, folded it carefully, as women do, in three folds,
and slipped it into her bosom.

"Don't be afraid, Louise," said she; "monsieur will no more
venture to take it hence than the defunct king Louis XIII.
ventured to take billets from the corsage of Mademoiselle de
Hautefort."

Raoul blushed at seeing the smile of the two girls; and he
did not remark that the hand of Louise remained in his.

"There " said Montalais, "you have pardoned me, Louise, for
having brought monsieur to you; and you, monsieur, bear me
no malice for having followed me to see mademoiselle. Now,
then, peace being made, let us chat like old friends.
Present me, Louise, to M. de Bragelonne."

"Monsieur le Vicomte," said Louise, with her quiet grace and
ingenuous smile, "I have the honour to present to you
Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais, maid of honor to her royal
highness Madame, and moreover my friend -- my excellent
friend."

Raoul bowed ceremoniously.

"And me, Louise," said he -- "will you not present me also
to mademoiselle?"

"Oh, she knows you -- she knows all!"

This unguarded expression made Montalais laugh and Raoul
sigh with happiness, for he interpreted it thus: "She knows
all our love."

"The ceremonies being over, Monsieur le Vicomte," said
Montalais, "take a chair, and tell us quickly the news you
bring flying thus."

"Mademoiselle, it is no longer a secret; the king, on his
way to Poitiers, will stop at Blois, to visit his royal
highness."

"The king here!" exclaimed Montalais, clapping her hands.
"What! are we going to see the court? Only think, Louise --
the real court from Paris! Oh, good heavens! But when will
this happen, monsieur?"

"Perhaps this evening, mademoiselle; at latest, tomorrow."

Montalais lifted her shoulders in sign of vexation.

"No time to get ready! No time to prepare a single dress! We
are as far behind the fashions as the Poles. We shall look
like portraits of the time of Henry IV. Ah, monsieur! this
is sad news you bring us!"

"But, mesdemoiselles, you will be still beautiful!"

"That's no news! Yes, we shall be always beautiful because
nature has made us passable; but we shall be ridiculous,
because the fashion will have forgotten us. Alas!
ridiculous! I shall be thought ridiculous -- I!

"And by whom?" said Louise, innocently.

"By whom? You are a strange girl, my dear. Is that a
question to put to me? I mean everybody; I mean the
courtiers, the nobles; I mean the king."

"Pardon me, my good friend, but as here every one is
accustomed to see us as we are ---- "

"Granted; but that is about to change, and we shall be
ridiculous, even for Blois; for close to us will be seen the
fashions from Paris, and they will perceive that we are in
the fashion of Blois! It is enough to make one despair!"

"Console yourself, mademoiselle."

"Well, so let it be! After all, so much the worse for those
who do not find me to their taste!" said Montalais
philosophically.

"They would be very difficult to please," replied Raoul,
faithful to his regular system of gallantry.

"Thank you, Monsieur le Vicomte. We were saying, then, that
the king is coming to Blois?"

"With all the court."

"Mesdemoiselles de Mancini, will they be with them?"

"No, certainly not."

"But as the king, it is said, cannot do without Mademoiselle
Mary?"

"Mademoiselle, the king must do without her. M. le Cardinal
will have it so. He has exiled his nieces to Brouage."

"He! -- the hypocrite!"

"Hush!" said Louise, pressing a finger on her friend's rosy
lips.

"Bah! nobody can hear me. I say that old Mazarino Mazarini
is a hypocrite, who burns impatiently to make his niece
Queen of France."

"That cannot be, mademoiselle, since M. le Cardinal, on the
contrary, has brought about the marriage of his majesty with
the Infanta Maria Theresa."

Montalais looked Raoul full in the face, and said, "And do
you Parisians believe in these tales? Well! we are a little
more knowing than you, at Blois."

"Mademoiselle, if the king goes beyond Poitiers and sets out
for Spain, if the articles of the marriage contract are
agreed upon by Don Luis de Haro and his eminence, you must
plainly perceive that it is not child's play."

"All very fine! but the king is king, I suppose?"

"No doubt, mademoiselle; but the cardinal is the cardinal."

"The king is not a man, then! And he does not love Mary
Mancini?"

"He adores her."

"Well, he will marry her then. We shall have war with Spain.
M. Mazarin will spend a few of the millions he has put away;
our gentlemen will perform prodigies of valor in their
encounters with the proud Castilians, and many of them will
return crowned with laurels, to be recrowned by us with
myrtles. Now, that is my view of politics."

"Montalais, you are wild!" said Louise, "and every
exaggeration attracts you as light does a moth."

"Louise, you are so extremely reasonable, that you will
never know how to love."

"Oh!" said Louise, in a tone of tender reproach, "don't you
see, Montalais? The queen-mother desires to marry her son to
the Infanta; would you wish him to disobey his mother? Is it
for a royal heart like his to set such a bad example? When
parents forbid love, love must be banished."

And Louise sighed: Raoul cast down his eyes, with an
expression of constraint. Montalais, on her part, laughed
aloud.

"Well, I have no parents!" said she.

"You are acquainted, without doubt, with the state of health
of M. le Comte de la Fere?" said Louise, after breathing
that sigh which had revealed so many griefs in its eloquent
utterance.

"No, mademoiselle," replied Raoul, "I have not yet paid my
respects to my father; I was going to his house when
Mademoiselle de Montalais so kindly stopped me. I hope the
comte is well. You have heard nothing to the contrary, have
you?"

"No, M. Raoul -- nothing, thank God!"

Here, for several instants, ensued a silence, during which
two spirits, which followed the same idea, communicated
perfectly, without even the assistance of a single glance.

"Oh, heavens!" exclaimed Montalais in a fright; "there is
somebody coming up."

"Who can it be?" said Louise, rising in great agitation.

"Mesdemoiselles, I inconvenience you very much. I have,
without doubt, been very indiscreet," stammered Raoul, very
ill at ease.

"It is a heavy step," said Louise.

"Ah! if it is only M. Malicorne," added Montalais, "do not
disturb yourselves."

Louise and Raoul looked at each other to inquire who M.
Malicorne could be.

"There is no occasion to mind him," continued Montalais; "he
is not jealous."

"But, mademoiselle ---" said Raoul.

"Yes, I understand. Well, he is as discreet as I am."

"Good heavens!" cried Louise, who had applied her ear to the
door, which had been left ajar, "it is my mother's step!"

"Madame de Saint-Remy! Where shall I hide myself?" exclaimed
Raoul, catching at the dress of Montalais, who looked quite
bewildered.

"Yes," said she; "yes, I know the clicking of those pattens!
It is our excellent mother. M. le Vicomte, what a pity it is
the window looks upon a stone pavement, and that fifty paces
below it."

Raoul glanced at the balcony in despair. Louise seized his
arm and held it tight.

"Oh, how silly I am!" said Montalais, "have I not the
robe-of-ceremony closet? It looks as if it were made on
purpose."

It was quite time to act; Madame de Saint-Remy was coming up
at a quicker pace than usual. She gained the landing at the
moment when Montalais, as in all scenes of surprises, shut
the closet by leaning with her back against the door.

"Ah!" cried Madame de Saint-Remy, "you are here, are you,
Louise?"

"Yes, madame," replied she, more pale than if she had
committed a great crime.

"Well, well!"

"Pray be seated, madame," said Montalais, offering her a
chair, which she placed so that the back was towards the
closet.

"Thank you, Mademoiselle Aure -- thank you. Come my child,
be quick."

"Where do you wish me to go, madame?"

"Why, home, to be sure; have you not to prepare your
toilette?"

"What did you say?" cried Montalais, hastening to affect
surprise, so fearful was she that Louise would in some way
commit herself.

"You don't know the news, then?" said Madame de Saint-Remy.

"What news, madame, is it possible for two girls to learn up
in this dove-cote?"

"What! have you seen nobody?"

"Madame, you talk in enigmas, and you torment us at a slow
fire!" cried Montalais, who, terrified at seeing Louise
become paler and paler, did not know to what saint to put up
her vows.

At length she caught an eloquent look of her companion's,
one of those looks which would convey intelligence to a
brick wall. Louise directed her attention to a hat --
Raoul's unlucky hat, which was set out in all its feathery
splendor upon the table.

Montalais sprang towards it, and, seizing it with her left
hand, passed it behind her into the right, concealing it as
she was speaking.

"Well," said Madame de Saint-Remy, "a courier has arrived,
announcing the approach of the king. There, mesdemoiselles;
there is something to make you put on your best looks."

"Quick, quick!" cried Montalais. "Follow Madame your mother,
Louise; and leave me to get ready my dress of ceremony."

Louise arose; her mother took her by the hand, and led her
out on to the landing.

"Come along," said she; then adding in a low voice, "When I
forbid you to come to the apartment of Montalais, why do you
do so?"

"Madame, she is my friend. Besides, I had but just come."

"Did you see nobody concealed while you were there?"

"Madame!"

"I saw a man's hat, I tell you -- the hat of that fellow,
that good-for-nothing!"

"Madame!" repeated Louise.

"Of that do-nothing De Malicorne! A maid of honor to have
such company -- fie! fie!" and their voices were lost in the
depths of the narrow staircase.

Montalais had not missed a word of this conversation, which
echo conveyed to her as if through a tunnel. She shrugged
her shoulders on seeing Raoul, who had listened likewise,
issue from the closet.

"Poor Montalais!" said she, "the victim of friendship! Poor
Malicorne, the victim of love!"

She stopped on viewing the tragic-comic face of Raoul, who
was vexed at having, in one day, surprised so many secrets.

"Oh, mademoiselle!" said he; "how can we repay your
kindness?"

"Oh, we will balance accounts some day," said she. "For the
present, begone, M. de Bragelonne, for Madame de Saint-Remy
is not over indulgent; and any indiscretion on her part
might bring hither a domiciliary visit, which would be
disagreeable to all parties."

"But Louise -- how shall I know ---- "

"Begone! begone! King Louis XI. knew very well what he was
about when he invented the post."

"Alas!" sighed Raoul.

"And am I not here -- I, who am worth all the posts in the
kingdom? Quick, I say, to horse! so that if Madame de
Saint-Remy should return for the purpose of preaching me a
lesson on morality, she may not find you here."

"She would tell my father, would she not?" murmured Raoul.

"And you would be scolded. Ah, vicomte, it is very plain you
come from court; you are as timid as the king. Peste! at
Blois we contrive better than that to do without papa's
consent. Ask Malicorne else!"

And at these words the girl pushed Raoul out of the room by
the shoulders. He glided swiftly down to the porch, regained
his horse, mounted, and set off as if he had had Monsieur's
guards at his heels.




CHAPTER 4

Father and Son.



Raoul followed the well-known road, so dear to his memory,
which led from Blois to the residence of the Comte de la
Fere.

The reader will dispense with a second description of that
habitation: he, perhaps, has been with us there before, and
knows it. Only, since our last journey thither, the walls
had taken a grayer tint, and the brickwork assumed a more
harmonious copper tone; the trees had grown, and many that
then only stretched their slender branches along the tops of
the hedges, now bushy, strong, and luxuriant, cast around,
beneath boughs swollen with sap, great shadows of blossoms
of fruit for the benefit of the traveler.

Raoul perceived, from a distance, the two little turrets,
the dove-cote in the elms, and the flights of pigeons, which
wheeled incessantly around that brick cone, seemingly
without power to quit it, like the sweet memories which
hover round a spirit at peace.

As he approached, he heard the noise of the pulleys which
grated under the weight of the massy pails; he also fancied
he heard the melancholy moaning of the water which falls
back again into the wells -- a sad, funereal, solemn sound,
which strikes the ear of the child and the poet -- both
dreamers -- which the English call splash; Arabian poets,
gasgachau; and which we Frenchmen, who would be poets, can
only translate by a paraphrase -- the noise of water falling
into water.

It was more than a year since Raoul had been to visit his
father. He had passed the whole time in the household of M.
le Prince. In fact, after all the commotions of the Fronde,
of the early period of which we formerly attempted to give a
sketch, Louis de Conde had made a public, solemn, and frank
reconciliation with the court. During all the time that the
rupture between the king and the prince had lasted, the
prince, who had long entertained a great regard for
Bragelonne, had in vain offered him advantages of the most
dazzling kind for a young man. The Comte de la Fere, still
faithful to his principles of loyalty and royalty, one day
developed before his son in the vaults of Saint Denis, --
the Comte de la Fere, in the name of his son, had always
declined them. Moreover, instead of following M. de Conde in
his rebellion, the vicomte had followed M. de Turenne,
fighting for the king. Then when M. de Turenne, in his turn,
had appeared to abandon the royal cause, he had quitted M.
de Turenne, as he had quitted M. de Conde. It resulted from
this invariable line of conduct that, as Conde and Turenne
had never been conquerors of each other but under the
standard of the king, Raoul, however young, had ten
victories inscribed on his list of services, and not one
defeat from which his bravery or conscience had to suffer.

Raoul, therefore, had, in compliance with the wish of his
father, served obstinately and passively the fortunes of
Louis XIV., in spite of the tergiversations which were
endemic, and, it might be said, inevitable, at that period.

M. de Conde, on being restored to favor, had at once availed
himself of all the privileges of the amnesty to ask for many
things back again which had been granted him before, and
among others, Raoul. M. de la Fere, with his invariable good
sense, had immediately sent him again to the prince.

A year, then, had passed away since the separation of the
father and son; a few letters had softened, but not removed,
the pains of absence. We have seen that Raoul had left at
Blois another love in addition to filial love. But let us do
him this justice -- if it had not been for chance and
Mademoiselle de Montalais, two great temptations, Raoul,
after delivering his message, would have galloped off
towards his father's house, turning his head round, perhaps,
but without stopping for a single instant, even if Louise
had held out her arms to him.

So the first part of the journey was given by Raoul to
regretting the past which he had been forced to quit so
quickly, that is to say, his lady-love; and the other part
to the friend he was about to join, so much too slowly for
his wishes.

Raoul found the garden-gate open, and rode straight in,
without regarding the long arms, raised in anger, of an old
man dressed in a jacket of violet-colored wool, and a large
cap of faded velvet.

The old man, who was weeding with his hands a bed of dwarf
roses and marguerites, was indignant at seeing a horse thus
traversing his sanded and nicely-raked walks. He even
ventured a vigorous "Humph!" which made the cavalier turn
round. Then there was a change of scene; for no sooner had
he caught sight of Raoul's face, than the old man sprang up
and set off in the direction of the house, amidst
interrupted growlings, which appeared to be paroxysms of
wild delight.

When arrived at the stables, Raoul gave his horse to a
little lackey, and sprang up the perron with an ardor that
would have delighted the heart of his father.

He crossed the ante-chamber, the dining-room, and the salon,
without meeting with any one; at length, on reaching the
door of M. de la Fere's apartment, he rapped impatiently,
and entered almost without waiting for the word "Enter!"
which was vouchsafed him by a voice at once sweet and
serious. The comte was seated at a table covered with papers
and books; he was still the noble, handsome gentleman of
former days, but time had given to this nobleness and beauty
a more solemn and distinct character. A brow white and void
of wrinkles, beneath his long hair, now more white than
black; an eye piercing and mild, under the lids of a young
man; his mustache, fine but slightly grizzled, waved over
lips of a pure and delicate model, as if they had never been
curled by mortal passions; a form straight and supple; an
irreproachable but thin hand -- this was what remained of
the illustrious gentleman whom so many illustrious mouths
had praised under the name of Athos. He was engaged in
correcting the pages of a manuscript book, entirely filled
by his own hand.

Raoul seized his father by the shoulders, by the neck, as he
could, and embraced him so tenderly and so rapidly, that the
comte had neither strength nor time to disengage himself, or
to overcome his paternal emotions.

"What! you here, Raoul, -- you! Is it possible?" said he.

"Oh, monsieur, monsieur, what joy to see you once again!"

"But you don't answer me, vicomte. Have you leave of
absence, or has some misfortune happened at Paris?"

"Thank God, monsieur," replied Raoul, calming himself by
degrees, "nothing has happened but what is fortunate. The
king is going to be married, as I had the honor of informing
you in my last letter, and, on his way to Spain, he will
pass through Blois."

"To pay a visit to Monsieur?"

"Yes, monsieur le comte. So, fearing to find him unprepared,
or wishing to be particularly polite to him, monsieur le
prince sent me forward to have the lodgings ready."

"You have seen Monsieur?" asked the vicomte, eagerly.

"I have had that honor."

"At the castle?"

"Yes, monsieur," replied Raoul, casting down his eyes,
because, no doubt, he had felt there was something more than
curiosity in the comte's inquiries.

"Ah, indeed, vicomte? Accept my compliments thereupon."

Raoul bowed.

"But you have seen some one else at Blois?"

"Monsieur, I saw her royal highness, Madame."

"That's very well: but it is not Madame that I mean.'

Raoul colored deeply, but made no reply.

"You do not appear to understand me, monsieur le vicomte,"
persisted M. de la Fere, without accenting his words more
strongly, but with a rather severer look.

"I understand you quite plainly, monsieur," replied Raoul,
"and if I hesitate a little in my reply, you are well
assured I am not seeking for a falsehood."

"No, you cannot tell a lie, and that makes me so astonished
you should be so long in saying yes or no."

"I cannot answer you without understanding you very well,
and if I have understood you, you will take my first words
in ill part. You will be displeased, no doubt, monsieur le
comte, because I have seen ---- "

"Mademoiselle de la Valliere -- have you not?"

"It was of her you meant to speak, I know very well,
monsieur," said Raoul, with inexpressible sweetness.

"And I asked you if you have seen her."

"Monsieur, I was ignorant, when I entered the castle, that
Mademoiselle de la Valliere was there; it was only on my
return, after I had performed my mission, that chance
brought us together. I have had the honor of paying my
respects to her."

"But what do you call the chance that led you into the
presence of Mademoiselle de la Valliere?"

"Mademoiselle de Montalais, monsieur."

"And who is Mademoiselle de Montalais?"

"A young lady I did not know before, whom I had never seen.
She is maid of honor to Madame."

"Monsieur le vicomte, I will push my interrogatory no
further, and reproach myself with having carried it so far.
I had desired you to avoid Mademoiselle de la Valliere, and
not to see her without my permission. Oh, I am quite sure
you have told me the truth, and that you took no measures to
approach her. Chance has done me this injury; I do not
accuse you of it. I will be content then, with what I
formerly said to you concerning this young lady. I do not
reproach her with anything -- God is my witness! only it is
not my intention or wish that you should frequent her place
of residence. I beg you once more, my dear Raoul, to
understand that."

It was plain the limpid eyes of Raoul were troubled at this
speech.

"Now, my friend," said the comte, with his soft smile, and
in his customary tone, "let us talk of other matters. You
are returning, perhaps, to your duty?"

"No, monsieur, I have no duty for to-day, except the
pleasure of remaining with you. The prince kindly appointed
me no other: which was so much in accord with my wish."

"Is the king well?"

"Perfectly."

"And monsieur le prince also?"

"As usual, monsieur."

The comte forgot to inquire after Mazarin; that was an old
habit.

"Well, Raoul, since you are entirely mine, I will give up my
whole day to you. Embrace me -- again, again! You are at
home, vicomte! Ah, there is our old Grimaud! Come in,
Grimaud: monsieur le vicomte is desirous of embracing you
likewise."

The good old man did not require to be twice told; he rushed
in with open arms, Raoul meeting him halfway.

"Now, if you please, we will go into the garden, Raoul. I
will show you the new lodging I have had prepared for you
during your leave of absence, and whilst examining the last
winter's plantations and two saddle-horses I have just
acquired, you will give me all the news of our friends in
Paris."

The comte closed his manuscript, took the young man's arm,
and went out into the garden with him.

Grimaud looked at Raoul with a melancholy air as the young
man passed out; observing that his head nearly touched the
traverse of the doorway, stroking his white royale, he
slowly murmured:

"How he has grown!"




CHAPTER 5

In which Something will be said of Cropoli
--of Cropoli and of a Great Unknown Painter.



Whilst the Comte de la Fere with Raoul visits the new
buildings he has had erected, and the new horses he has
bought, with the reader's permission we will lead him back
to the city of Blois, and make him a witness of the
unaccustomed activity which pervades that city.

It was in the hotels that the surprise of the news brought
by Raoul was most sensibly felt.

In fact, the king and the court at Blois, that is to say, a
hundred horsemen, ten carriages, two hundred horses, as many
lackeys as masters -- where was this crowd to be housed?
Where were to be lodged all the gentry of the neighborhood,
who would gather in two or three hours after the news had
enlarged the circle of its report, like the increasing
circumference produced by a stone thrown into a placid lake?

Blois, as peaceful in the morning, as we have seen, as the
calmest lake in the world, at the announcement of the royal
arrival, was suddenly filled with the tumult and buzzing of
a swarm of bees.

All the servants of the castle, under the inspection of the
officers, were sent into the city in quest of provisions,
and ten horsemen were dispatched to the preserves of
Chambord to seek for game, to the fisheries of Beuvion for
fish, and to the gardens of Chaverny for fruits and flowers.

Precious tapestries, and lusters with great gilt chains,
were drawn from the cupboards; an army of the poor were
engaged in sweeping the courts and washing the stone fronts,
whilst their wives went in droves to the meadows beyond the
Loire, to gather green boughs and field-flowers. The whole
city, not to be behind in this luxury of cleanliness,
assumed its best toilette with the help of brushes, brooms,
and water.

The kennels of the upper town, swollen by these continued
lotions, became rivers at the bottom of the city, and the
pavement, generally very muddy, it must be allowed, took a
clean face, and absolutely shone in the friendly rays of the
sun.

Next the music was to be provided; drawers were emptied; the
shop-keepers did a glorious trade in wax, ribbons, and
sword-knots; housekeepers laid in stores of bread, meat, and
spices. Already numbers of the citizens whose houses were
furnished as if for a siege, having nothing more to do,
donned their festive clothes and directed their course
towards the city gate, in order to be the first to signal or
see the cortege. They knew very well that the king would not
arrive before night, perhaps not before the next morning.
Yet what is expectation but a kind of folly, and what is
that folly but an excess of hope?

In the lower city, at scarcely a hundred paces from the
Castle of the States, between the mall and the castle, in a
sufficiently handsome street, then called Rue Vieille, and
which must, in fact, have been very old, stood a venerable
edifice, with pointed gables, of squat but large dimensions,
ornamented with three windows looking into the street on the
first floor, with two in the second and with a little oeil
de boeuf in the third.

On the sides of this triangle had recently been constructed
a parallelogram of considerable size, which encroached upon
the street remorselessly, according to the familiar uses of
the building of that period. The street was narrowed by a
quarter by it, but then the house was enlarged by a half;
and was not that a sufficient compensation?

Tradition said that this house with the pointed gables was
inhabited, in the time of Henry III., by a councilor of
state whom Queen Catherine came, some say to visit, and
others to strangle. However that may be, the good lady must
have stepped with a circumspect foot over the threshold of
this building.

After the councilor had died -- whether by strangulation or
naturally is of no consequence -- the house had been sold,
then abandoned, and lastly isolated from the other houses of
the street. Towards the middle of the reign of Louis XIII.
only, an Italian, named Cropoli, escaped from the kitchens
of the Marquis d'Ancre, came and took possession of this
house. There he established a little hostelry, in which was
fabricated a macaroni so delicious that people came from
miles round to fetch it or eat it.

So famous had the house become for it, that when Mary de
Medici was a prisoner, as we know, in the castle of Blois,
she once sent for some.

It was precisely on the day she had escaped by the famous
window. The dish of macaroni was left upon the table, only
just tasted by the royal mouth.

This double favor, of a strangulation and a macaroni,
conferred upon the triangular house, gave poor Cropoli a
fancy to grace his hostelry with a pompous title. But his
quality of an Italian was no recommendation in these times,
and his small, well-concealed fortune forbade attracting too
much attention.

When he found himself about to die, which happened in 1643,
just after the death of Louis XIII., he called to him his
son, a young cook of great promise, and with tears in his
eyes, he recommended him to preserve carefully the secret of
the macaroni, to Frenchify his name, and at length, when the
political horizon should be cleared from the clouds which
obscured it -- this was practiced then as in our day, to
order of the nearest smith a handsome sign, upon which a
famous painter, whom he named, should design two queens'
portraits, with these words as a legend: "To The Medici."

The worthy Cropoli, after these recommendations, had only
sufficient time to point out to his young successor a
chimney, under the slab of which he had hidden a thousand
ten-franc pieces, and then expired.

Cropoli the younger, like a man of good heart, supported the
loss with resignation, and the gain without insolence. He
began by accustoming the public to sound the final i of his
name so little, that by the aid of general complaisance, he
was soon called nothing but M. Cropole, which is quite a
French name. He then married, having had in his eye a little
French girl, from whose parents he extorted a reasonable
dowry by showing them what there was beneath the slab of the
chimney.

These two points accomplished, he went in search of the
painter who was to paint the sign; and he was soon found. He
was an old Italian, a rival of the Raphaels and the Caracci,
but an unfortunate rival. He said he was of the Venetian
school, doubtless from his fondness for color. His works, of
which he had never sold one, attracted the eye at a distance
of a hundred paces; but they so formidably displeased the
citizens, that he had finished by painting no more.

He boasted of having painted a bath-room for Madame la
Marechale d'Ancre, and mourned over this chamber having been
burnt at the time of the marechal's disaster.

Cropoli, in his character of a compatriot, was indulgent
towards Pittrino, which was the name of the artist. Perhaps
he had seen the famous pictures of the bath-room. Be this as
it may, he held in such esteem, we may say in such
friendship, the famous Pittrino, that he took him in his own
house.

Pittrino, grateful, and fed with macaroni, set about
propagating the reputation of this national dish, and from
the time of its founder, he had rendered, with his
indefatigable tongue, signal services to the house of
Cropoli.

As he grew old he attached himself to the son as he had done
to the father, and by degrees became a kind of overlooker of
a house in which his remarkable integrity, his acknowledged
sobriety, and a thousand other virtues useless to enumerate,
gave him an eternal place by the fireside, with a right of
inspection over the domestics. Besides this, it was he who
tasted the macaroni, to maintain the pure flavor of the
ancient tradition; and it must be allowed that he never
permitted a grain of pepper too much, or an atom of parmesan
too little. His joy was at its height on that day when
called upon to share the secret of Cropoli the younger, and
to paint the famous sign.

He was seen at once rummaging with ardor in an old box, in
which he found some brushes, a little gnawed by the rats,
but still passable; some colors in bladders almost dried up;
some linseed-oil in a bottle, and a palette which had
formerly belonged to Bronzino, that dieu de la pittoure, as
the ultramontane artist, in his ever young enthusiasm,
always called him.

Pittrino was puffed up with all the joy of a rehabilitation.

He did as Raphael had done -- he changed his style, and
painted, in the fashion of the Albanian, two goddesses
rather than two queens. These illustrious ladies appeared so
lovely on the sign, -- they presented to the astonished eyes
such an assemblage of lilies and roses, the enchanting
result of the change of style in Pittrino -- they assumed
the poses of sirens so Anacreontically -- that the principal
echevin, when admitted to view this capital piece in the
salle of Cropole, at once declared that these ladies were
too handsome, of too animated a beauty, to figure as a sign
in the eyes of passers-by.

To Pittrino he added, "His royal highness, Monsieur, who
often comes into our city, will not be much pleased to see
his illustrious mother so slightly clothed, and he will send
you to the oubliettes of the state; for, remember, the heart
of that glorious prince is not always tender. You must
efface either the two sirens or the legend, without which I
forbid the exhibition of the sign. I say this for your sake,
Master Cropole, as well as for yours, Signor Pittrino."

What answer could be made to this? It was necessary to thank
the echevin for his kindness, which Cropole did. But
Pittrino remained downcast and said he felt assured of what
was about to happen.

The visitor was scarcely gone when Cropole, crossing his
arms, said: "Well, master, what is to be done?"

"We must efface the legend," said Pittrino, in a melancholy
tone. "I have some excellent ivory-black; it will be done in
a moment, and we will replace the Medici by the nymphs or
the sirens, whichever you prefer."

"No," said Cropole, "the will of my father must be carried
out. My father considered ---- "

"He considered the figures of the most importance," said
Pittrino.

"He thought most of the legend," said Cropole.

"The proof of the importance in which he held the figures,"
said Pittrino, "is that he desired they should be
likenesses, and they are so."

"Yes; but if they had not been so, who would have recognized
them without the legend? At the present day even, when the
memory of the Blaisois begins to be faint with regard to
these two celebrated persons, who would recognize Catherine
and Mary without the words `To the Medici'?"

"But the figures?" said Pittrino, in despair; for he felt
that young Cropole was right. "I should not like to lose the
fruit of my labor."

"And I should not wish you to be thrown into prison and
myself into the oubliettes."

"Let us efface `Medici,' " said Pittrino, supplicatingly.

"No," replied Cropole, firmly. "I have got an idea, a
sublime idea -- your picture shall appear, and my legend
likewise. Does not `Medici' mean doctor, or physician, in
Italian?"

"Yes, in the plural."

"Well, then, you shall order another sign-frame of the
smith; you shall paint six physicians, and write underneath
`Aux Medici' which makes a very pretty play upon words."

"Six physicians! impossible! And the composition?" cried
Pittrino.

"That is your business -- but so it shall be -- I insist
upon it -- it must be so -- my macaroni is burning."

This reasoning was peremptory -- Pittrino obeyed. He
composed the sign of six physicians, with the legend; the
echevin applauded and authorized it.

The sign produced an extravagant success in the city, which
proves that poetry has always been in the wrong, before
citizens, as Pittrino said.

Cropole, to make amends to his painter-in-ordinary, hung up
the nymphs of the preceding sign in his bedroom, which made
Madame Cropole blush every time she looked at it, when she
was undressing at night.

This is the way in which the pointed-gable house got a sign;
and this is how the hostelry of the Medici, making a
fortune, was found to be enlarged by a quarter, as we have
described. And this is how there was at Blois a hostelry of
that name, and had for painter-in-ordinary Master Pittrino.




CHAPTER 6

The Unknown.



Thus founded and recommended by its sign, the hostelry of
Master Cropole held its way steadily on towards a solid
prosperity.

It was not an immense fortune that Cropole had in
perspective; but he might hope to double the thousand louis
d'or left by his father, to make another thousand louis by
the sale of his house and stock, and at length to live
happily like a retired citizen.

Cropole was anxious for gain, and was half-crazy with joy at
the news of the arrival of Louis XIV.

Himself, his wife, Pittrino, and two cooks, immediately laid
hands upon all the inhabitants of the dove-cote, the
poultry-yard, and the rabbit-hutches; so that as many
lamentations and cries resounded in the yards of the
hostelry of the Medici as were formerly heard in Rama.

Cropole had, at the time, but one single traveler in his
house.

This was a man of scarcely thirty years of age, handsome,
tall, austere, or rather melancholy, in all his gestures and
looks.

He was dressed in black velvet with jet trimmings; a white
collar, as plain as that of the severest Puritan, set off
the whiteness of his youthful neck; a small dark-colored
mustache scarcely covered his curled, disdainful lip.

He spoke to people looking them full in the face without
affectation, it is true, but without scruple; so that the
brilliancy of his black eyes became so insupportable, that
more than one look had sunk beneath his like the weaker
sword in a single combat.

At this time, in which men, all created equal by God, were
divided, thanks to prejudices, into two distinct castes, the
gentleman and the commoner, as they are really divided into
two races, the black and the white, -- at this time, we say,
he whose portrait we have just sketched could not fail of
being taken for a gentleman, and of the best class. To
ascertain this, there was no necessity to consult anything
but his hands, long, slender, and white, of which every
muscle, every vein, became apparent through the skin at the
least movement, and eloquently spoke of good descent.

This gentleman, then, had arrived alone at Cropole's house.
He had taken, without hesitation, without reflection even,
the principal apartment which the hotelier had pointed out
to him with a rapacious aim, very praiseworthy, some will
say, very reprehensible will say others, if they admit that
Cropole was a physiognomist and judged people at first
sight.

This apartment was that which composed the whole front of
the ancient triangular house, a large salon, lighted by two
windows on the first stage, a small chamber by the side of
it, and another above it.

Now, from the time he had arrived, this gentleman had
scarcely touched any repast that had been served up to him
in his chamber. He had spoken but two words to the host, to
warn him that a traveler of the name of Parry would arrive,
and to desire that, when he did, he should be shown up to
him immediately.

He afterwards preserved so profound a silence, that Cropole
was almost offended, so much did he prefer people who were
good company.

This gentleman had risen early the morning of the day on
which this history begins, and had placed himself at the
window of his salon, seated upon the ledge, and leaning upon
the rail of the balcony, gazing sadly but persistently on
both sides of the street, watching, no doubt, for the
arrival of the traveler he had mentioned to the host.

In this way he had seen the little cortege of Monsieur
return from hunting, then had again partaken of the profound
tranquillity of the street, absorbed in his own
expectations.

All at once the movement of the crowd going to the meadows,
couriers setting out, washers of pavement, purveyors of the
royal household, gabbling, scampering shopboys, chariots in
motion, hair-dressers on the run, and pages toiling along,
this tumult and bustle had surprised him, but without losing
any of that impassible and supreme majesty which gives to
the eagle and the lion that serene and contemptuous glance
amidst the hurrahs and shouts of hunters or the curious.

Soon the cries of the victims slaughtered in the
poultry-yard, the hasty steps of Madame Cropole up that
little wooden staircase, so narrow and so echoing, the
bounding pace of Pittrino, who only that morning was smoking
at the door with all the phlegm of a Dutchman; all this
communicated something like surprise and agitation to the
traveler.

As he was rising to make inquiries, the door of his chamber
opened. The unknown concluded they were about to introduce
the impatiently expected traveler, and made three
precipitate steps to meet him.

But, instead of the person he expected, it was Master
Cropole who appeared, and behind him, in the half-dark
staircase, the pleasant face of Madame Cropole, rendered
trivial by curiosity. She only gave one furtive glance at
the handsome gentleman, and disappeared.

Cropole advanced, cap in hand, rather bent than bowing,

A gesture of the unknown interrogated him, without a word
being pronounced.

"Monsieur," said Cropole, "I come to ask how -- what ought I
to say: your lordship, monsieur le comte, or monsieur le
marquis?"

"Say monsieur, and speak quickly," replied the unknown, with
that haughty accent which admits of neither discussion nor
reply.

"I came, then, to inquire how monsieur had passed the night,
and if monsieur intended to keep this apartment?"

"Yes."

"Monsieur, something has happened upon which we could not
reckon."

"What?"

"His majesty Louis XIV. will enter our city to-day and will
remain here one day, perhaps two."

Great astonishment was painted on the countenance of the
unknown.

"The King of France coming to Blois?"

"He is on the road, monsieur."

"Then there is the stronger reason for my remaining," said
the unknown.

"Very well; but will monsieur keep all the apartments?"

"I do not understand you. Why should I require less to-day
than yesterday?"

"Because, monsieur, your lordship will permit me to say,
yesterday I did not think proper, when you chose your
lodging, to fix any price that might have made your lordship
believe that I prejudged your resources; whilst to-day ----
"

The unknown colored; the idea at once struck him that he was
supposed to be poor, and was being insulted.

"Whilst to-day," replied he, coldly, "you do prejudge."

"Monsieur, I am a well-meaning man, thank God! and simple
hotelier as I am, there is in me the blood of a gentleman.
My father was a servant and officer of the late Marechal
d'Ancre. God rest his soul!"

"I do not contest that point with you; I only wish to know,
and that quickly, to what your questions tend?"

"You are too reasonable, monsieur, not to comprehend that
our city is small, that the court is about to invade it,
that the houses will be overflowing with inhabitants, and
that lodgings will consequently obtain considerable prices."

Again the unknown colored. "Name your terms," said he.

"I name them with scruple, monsieur, because I seek an
honest gain, and that I wish to carry on my business without
being uncivil or extravagant in my demands. Now the room you
occupy is considerable, and you are alone."

"That is my business."

"Oh! certainly. I do not mean to turn monsieur out."

The blood rushed to the temples of the unknown; he darted at
poor Cropole, the descendant of one of the officers of the
Marechal d'Ancre, a glance that would have crushed him down
to beneath that famous chimney-slab, if Cropole had not been
nailed to the spot by the question of his own proper
interests.

"Do you desire me to go?" said he. "Explain yourself -- but
quickly."

"Monsieur, monsieur, you do not understand me. It is very
critical -- I know -- that which I am doing. I express
myself badly, or perhaps, as monsieur is a foreigner, which
I perceive by his accent ---- "

In fact, the unknown spoke with that impetuosity which is
the principal character of English accentuation, even among
men who speak the French language with the neatest purity.

"As monsieur is a foreigner, I say, it is perhaps he who
does not catch my exact meaning. I wish for monsieur to give
up one or two of the apartments he occupies, which would
diminish his expenses and ease my conscience. Indeed, it is
hard to increase unreasonably the price of the chambers,
when one has had the honor to let them at a reasonable
price."

"How much does the hire amount to since yesterday?"

"Monsieur, to one louis, with refreshments and the charge
for the horse."

"Very well, and that of to-day?"

"Ah! there is the difficulty. This is the day of the king's
arrival; if the court comes to sleep here, the charge of the
day is reckoned. From that it results that three chambers,
at two louis each, makes six louis. Two louis, monsieur, are
not much; but six louis make a great deal."

The unknown, from red, as we have seen him, became very
pale.

He drew from his pocket, with heroic bravery, a purse
embroidered with a coat-of-arms, which he carefully
concealed in the hollow of his hand. This purse was of a
thinness, a flabbiness, a hollowness, which did not escape
the eye of Cropole.

The unknown emptied the purse into his hand. It contained
three double louis, which amounted to the six louis demanded
by the host.

But it was seven that Cropole had required.

He looked, therefore, at the unknown, as much as to say,
"And then?"

"There remains one louis, does there not, master hotelier?"

"Yes, monsieur, but ---- "

The unknown plunged his hand into the pocket of his
haut-de-chausses, and emptied it. It contained a small
pocket-book, a gold key, and some silver. With this change
he made up a louis.

"Thank you, monsieur," said Cropole. "It now only remains
for me to ask whether monsieur intends to occupy his
apartments to-morrow, in which case I will reserve them for
him; whereas, if monsieur does not mean to do so, I will
promise them to some of the king's people who are coming."

"That is but right," said the unknown, after a long silence,
"but as I have no more money, as you have seen, and as I yet
must retain the apartments, you must either sell this
diamond in the city, or hold it in pledge."

Cropole looked at the diamond so long, that the unknown
said, hastily:

"I prefer your selling it, monsieur; for it is worth three
hundred pistoles. A Jew -- are there any Jews in Blois? --
would give you two hundred or a hundred and fifty for it --
take whatever may be offered for it, if it be no more than
the price of your lodging. Begone!"

"Oh! monsieur," replied Cropole, ashamed of the sudden
inferiority which the unknown reflected upon him by this
noble and disinterested confidence, as well as by the
unalterable patience opposed to so many suspicions and
evasions. "Oh, monsieur, I hope people are not so dishonest
at Blois as you seem to think, and that the diamond, being
worth what you say ---- "

The unknown here again darted at Cropole one of his
withering glances.

"I really do not understand diamonds, monsieur, I assure
you," cried he.

"But the jewelers do: ask them," said the unknown. "Now I
believe our accounts are settled, are they not, monsieur
l'hote?"

"Yes, monsieur, and to my profound regret; for I fear I have
offended monsieur."

"Not at all!" replied the unknown, with ineffable majesty.

"Or have appeared to be extortionate with a noble traveler.
Consider, monsieur, the peculiarity of the case."

"Say no more about it, I desire; and leave me to myself."

Cropole bowed profoundly, and left the room with a stupefied
air, which announced that he had a good heart, and felt
genuine remorse.

The unknown himself shut the door after him, and when left
alone, looked mournfully at the bottom of the purse, from
which he had taken a small silken bag containing the
diamond, his last resource.

He dwelt likewise upon the emptiness of his pockets, turned
over the papers in his pocket-book, and convinced himself of
the state of absolute destitution in which he was about to
be plunged.

He raised his eyes towards heaven, with a sublime emotion of
despairing calmness, brushed off with his hand some drops of
sweat which trickled over his noble brow, and then cast down
upon the earth a look which just before had been impressed
with almost divine majesty.

That the storm had passed far from him, perhaps he had
prayed in the bottom of his soul.

He drew near to the window, resumed his place in the
balcony, and remained there, motionless, annihilated, dead,
till the moment when, the heavens beginning to darken, the
first flambeaux traversed the enlivened street, and gave the
signal for illumination to all the windows of the city.




CHAPTER 7

Parry.



Whilst the unknown was viewing these lights with interest,
and lending an ear to the various noises, Master Cropole
entered his apartment, followed by two attendants, who laid
the cloth for his meal.

The stranger did not pay them the least attention; but
Cropole approaching him respectfully, whispered " Monsieur,
the diamond has been valued."

"Ah!" said the traveler. "Well?"

"Well, monsieur, the jeweler of S. A. R. gives two hundred
and eighty pistoles for it."

"Have you them?"

"I thought it best to take them, monsieur; nevertheless, I
made it a condition of the bargain, that if monsieur wished
to keep his diamond, it should be held till monsieur was
again in funds."

"Oh, no, not at all; I told you to sell it."

"Then I have obeyed, or nearly so, since, without having
definitely sold it, I have touched the money."

"Pay yourself," added the unknown.

"I will do so, monsieur, since you so positively require
it."

A sad smile passed over the lips of the gentleman.

"Place the money on that trunk," said he, turning round and
pointing to the piece of furniture.

Cropole deposited a tolerably large bag as directed, after
having taken from it the amount of his reckoning.

"Now," said he, "I hope monsieur will not give me the pain
of not taking any supper. Dinner has already been refused;
this is affronting to the house of les Medici. Look,
monsieur, the supper is on the table, and I venture to say
that it is not a bad one."

The unknown asked for a glass of wine, broke off a morsel of
bread, and did not stir from the window whilst he ate and
drank.

Shortly after was heard a loud flourish of trumpets; cries
arose in the distance, a confused buzzing filled the lower
part of the city, and the first distinct sound that struck
the ears of the stranger was the tramp of advancing horses.

"The king! the king!" repeated a noisy and eager crowd.

"The king!" cried Cropole, abandoning his guest and his
ideas of delicacy, to satisfy his curiosity.

With Cropole were mingled, and jostled, on the staircase,
Madame Cropole, Pittrino, and the waiters and scullions.

The cortege advanced slowly, lighted by a thousand
flambeaux, in the streets and from the windows.

After a company of musketeers, a closely ranked troop of
gentlemen, came the litter of monsieur le cardinal, drawn
like a carriage by four black horses. The pages and people
of the cardinal marched behind.

Next came the carriage of the queen-mother, with her maids
of honor at the doors, her gentlemen on horseback at both
sides.

The king then appeared, mounted upon a splendid horse of
Saxon breed, with a flowing mane. The young prince
exhibited, when bowing to some windows from which issued the
most animated acclamations, a noble and handsome
countenance, illumined by the flambeaux of his pages.

By the side of the king, though a little in the rear, the
Prince de Conde, M. Dangeau, and twenty other courtiers,
followed by their people and their baggage, closed this
veritably triumphant march. The pomp was of a military
character.

Some of the courtiers -- the elder ones, for instance --
wore traveling dresses; but all the rest were clothed in
warlike panoply. Many wore the gorges and buff coat of the
times of Henry IV. and Louis XIII.

When the king passed before him, the unknown, who had leant
forward over the balcony to obtain a better view, and who
had concealed his face by leaning on his arm, felt his heart
swell and overflow with a bitter jealousy.

The noise of the trumpets excited him -- the popular
acclamations deafened him: for a moment he allowed his
reason to be absorbed in this flood of lights, tumult and
brilliant images.

"He is a king!" murmured he, in an accent of despair.

Then, before he had recovered from his sombre reverie all
the noise, all the splendor, had passed away. At the angle
of the street there remained nothing beneath the stranger
but a few hoarse, discordant voices, shouting at intervals,
"Vive le Roi!"

There remained likewise the six candles held by the
inhabitants of the hostelry des Medici; that is to say, two
for Cropole, two for Pittrino, and one for each scullion.
Cropole never ceased repeating, "How good-looking the king
is! How strongly he resembles his illustrious father!"

"A handsome likeness!" said Pittrino.

"And what a lofty carriage he has!" added Madame Cropole,
already in promiscuous commentary with her neighbors of both
sexes.

Cropole was feeding their gossip with his own personal
remarks, without observing that an old man on foot, but
leading a small Irish horse by the bridle, was endeavoring
to penetrate the crowd of men and women which blocked up the
entrance to the Medici. But at that moment the voice of the
stranger was heard from the window.

"Make way, monsieur l'hotelier, to the entrance of your
house!"

Cropole turned around, and, on seeing the old man, cleared a
passage for him.

The window was instantly closed.

Pittrino pointed out the way to the newly-arrived guest, who
entered without uttering a word.

The stranger waited for him on the landing; he opened his
arms to the old man and led him to a seat.

"Oh, no, no, my lord!" said he. "Sit down in your presence?
-- never!"

"Parry," cried the gentleman, "I beg you will; you come from
England -- you come so far. Ah! it is not for your age to
undergo the fatigues my service requires. Rest yourself."

"I have my reply to give your lordship, in the first place."

"Parry, I conjure you to tell me nothing; for if your news
had been good, you would not have begun in such a manner;
you go about, which proves that the news is bad."

"My lord," said the old man, "do not hasten to alarm
yourself, all is not lost, I hope. You must employ energy,
but more particularly resignation."

"Parry," said the young man, "I have reached this place
through a thousand snares and after a thousand difficulties;
can you doubt my energy? I have meditated this journey ten
years, in spite of all counsels and all obstacles -- have
you faith in my perseverance? I have this evening sold the
last of my father's diamonds; for I had nothing wherewith to
pay for my lodging and my host was about to turn me out."

Parry made a gesture of indignation, to which the young man
replied by a pressure of the hand and a smile.

"I have still two hundred and seventy-four pistoles left,
and I feel myself rich. I do not despair, Parry; have you
faith in my resignation?"

The old man raised his trembling hands towards heaven.

"Let me know," said the stranger, -- "disguise nothing from
me -- what has happened?"

"My recital will be short, my lord, but in the name of
Heaven do not tremble so."

"It is impatience, Parry. Come, what did the general say to
you?"

"At first the general would not receive me."

"He took you for a spy?"

"Yes, my lord, but I wrote him a letter."

"Well?"

"He read it, and received me, my lord."

"Did that letter thoroughly explain my position and my
views?"

"Oh, yes!" said Parry, with a sad smile; "it painted your
very thoughts faithfully."

"Well -- then, Parry?"

"Then the general sent me back the letter by an
aide-de-camp, informing me that if I were found the next day
within the circumscription of his command, he would have me
arrested."

"Arrested!" murmured the young man. "What! arrest you, my
most faithful servant?"

"Yes, my lord."

"And notwithstanding you had signed the name Parry?"

"To all my letters, my lord; and the aide-de-camp had known
me at St. James's and at Whitehall, too," added the old man
with a sigh.

The young man leaned forward, thoughtful and sad.

"Ay, that's what he did before his people," said he,
endeavoring to cheat himself with hopes. "But, privately --
between you and him -- what did he do? Answer!"

"Alas! my lord, he sent to me four cavaliers, who gave me
the horse with which you just now saw me come back. These
cavaliers conducted me, in great haste, to the little port
of Tenby, threw me, rather than embarked me, into a
fishing-boat, about to sail for Brittany, and here I am."

"Oh!" sighed the young man, clasping his neck convulsively
with his hand, and with a sob. "Parry, is that all? -- is
that all?"

"Yes, my lord; that is all."

After this brief reply ensued a long interval of silence,
broken only by the convulsive beating of the heel of the
young man on the floor.

The old man endeavored to change the conversation; it was
leading to thoughts much too sinister.

"My lord," said he, "what is the meaning of all the noise
which preceded me? What are these people crying `Vive le
Roi!' for? What king do they mean? and what are all these
lights for?"

"Ah! Parry," replied the young man ironically, "don't you
know that this is the King of France visiting his good city
of Blois? All those trumpets are his, all those gilded
housings are his, all those gentlemen wear swords that are
his. His mother precedes him in a carriage magnificently
encrusted with silver and gold. Happy mother! His minister
heaps up millions, and conducts him to a rich bride. Then
all these people rejoice, they love their king, they hail
him with their acclamations, and they cry, `Vive le Roi!
Vive le Roi!'"

"Well, well, my lord," said Parry, more uneasy at the turn
the conversation had taken than at the other.

"You know," resumed the unknown, "that my mother and my
sister, whilst all this is going on in honor of the King of
France, have neither money nor bread; you know that I myself
shall be poor and degraded within a fortnight, when all
Europe will become acquainted with what you have told me.
Parry, are there not examples in which a man of my condition
should himself ---- "

"My lord, in the name of Heaven ---- "

"You are right, Parry, I am a coward, and if I do nothing
for myself, what will God do? No, no, I have two arms,
Parry, and I have a sword." And he struck his arm violently
with his hand and took down his sword, which hung against
the wall.

"What are you going to do, my lord?"

"What am I going to do, Parry? What every one in my family
does. My mother lives on public charity, my sister begs for
my mother; I have, somewhere or other, brothers who equally
beg for themselves; and I, the eldest, will go and do as all
the rest do -- I will go and ask charity!"

And at these words, which he finished sharply with a nervous
and terrible laugh, the young man girded on his sword, took
his hat from the trunk, fastened to his shoulder a black
cloak, which he had worn during all his journey, and
pressing the two hands of the old man, who watched his
proceedings with a look of anxiety, --

"My good Parry," said he, "order a fire, drink, eat, sleep,
and be happy; let us both be happy, my faithful friend, my
only friend. We are rich, as rich as kings!"

He struck the bag of pistoles with his clenched hand as he
spoke, and it fell heavily to the ground. He resumed that
dismal laugh that had so alarmed Parry; and whilst the whole
household was screaming, singing, and preparing to install
the travelers who had been preceded by their lackeys, he
glided out by the principal entrance into the street, where
the old man, who had gone to the window, lost sight of him
in a moment.




CHAPTER 8

What his Majesty King Louis XIV. was at the Age of Twenty-Two



It has been seen, by the account we have endeavored to give
of it, that the entree of King Louis XIV. into the city of
Blois had been noisy and brilliant his young majesty had
therefore appeared perfectly satisfied with it.

On arriving beneath the porch of the Castle of the States,
the king met, surrounded by his guards and gentlemen, with
S. A. R. the duke, Gaston of Orleans, whose physiognomy,
naturally rather majestic, had borrowed on this solemn
occasion a fresh luster and a fresh dignity. On her part,
Madame, dressed in her robes of ceremony, awaited, in the
interior balcony, the entrance of her nephew. All the
windows of the old castle, so deserted and dismal on
ordinary days, were resplendent with ladies and lights.

It was then to the sound of drums, trumpets, and vivats,
that the young king crossed the threshold of that castle in
which, seventy-two years before, Henry III. had called in
the aid of assassination and treachery to keep upon his head
and in his house a crown which was already slipping from his
brow, to fall into another family.

All eyes, after having admired the young king, so handsome
and so agreeable, sought for that other king of France, much
otherwise king than the former, and so old, so pale, so
bent, that people called him the Cardinal Mazarin.

Louis was at this time endowed with all the natural gifts
which make the perfect gentleman; his eye was brilliant,
mild, and of a clear azure blue. But the most skillful
physiognomists, those divers into the soul, on fixing their
looks upon it, if it had been possible for a subject to
sustain the glance of the king, -- the most skillful
physiognomists, we say, would never have been able to fathom
the depths of that abyss of mildness. It was with the eyes
of the king as with the immense depths of the azure heavens,
or with those more terrific, and almost as sublime, which
the Mediterranean reveals under the keels of its ships in a
clear summer day, a gigantic mirror in which heaven delights
to reflect sometimes its stars, sometimes its storms.

The king was short of stature -- he was scarcely five feet
two inches: but his youth made up for this defect, set off
likewise by great nobleness in all his movements, and by
considerable address in all bodily exercises.

Certes, he was already quite a king, and it was a great
thing to be a king in that period of traditional devotedness
and respect; but as, up to that time, he had been but seldom
and always poorly shown to the people, as they to whom he
was shown saw him by the side of his mother, a tall woman,
and monsieur le cardinal, a man of commanding presence, many
found him so little of a king as to say, --

"Why, the king is not so tall as monsieur le cardinal!"

Whatever may be thought of these physical observations,
which were principally made in the capital, the young king
was welcomed as a god by the inhabitants of Blois, and
almost like a king by his uncle and aunt, Monsieur and
Madame, the inhabitants of the castle.

It must, however, be allowed, that when he saw, in the hall
of reception, chairs of equal height placed for himself, his
mother, the cardinal, and his uncle and aunt, a disposition
artfully concealed by the semicircular form of the assembly,
Louis XIV. became red with anger, and looked around him to
ascertain by the countenances of those that were present, if
this humiliation had been prepared for him. But as he saw
nothing upon the impassible visage of the cardinal, nothing
on that of his mother, nothing on those of the assembly, he
resigned himself, and sat down, taking care to be seated
before anybody else.

The gentlemen and ladies were presented to their majesties
and monsieur le cardinal.

The king remarked that his mother and he scarcely knew the
names of any of the persons who were presented to them;
whilst the cardinal, on the contrary never failed, with an
admirable memory and presence of mind, to talk to every one
about his estates, his ancestors, or his children, some of
whom he named, which enchanted those worthy country
gentlemen, and confirmed them in the idea that he alone is
truly king who knows his subjects, from the same reason that
the sun has no rival, because the sun alone warms and
lightens.

The study of the young king, which had begun a long time
before, without anybody suspecting it, was continued then,
and he looked around him attentively to endeavor to make out
something in the physiognomies which had at first appeared
the most insignificant and trivial.

A collation was served. The king, without daring to call
upon the hospitality of his uncle, had waited for it
impatiently. This time, therefore, he had all the honors
due, if not to his rank, at least to his appetite

As to the cardinal, he contented himself with touching with
his withered lips a bouillon, served in a gold cup. The
all-powerful minister, who had taken her regency from the
queen, and his royalty from the king, had not been able to
take a good stomach from nature.

Anne of Austria, already suffering from the cancer which six
or eight years after caused her death, ate very little more
than the cardinal.

For Monsieur, already puffed up with the great event which
had taken place in his provincial life, he ate nothing
whatever.

Madame alone, like a true Lorrainer, kept pace with his
majesty; so that Louis XIV., who, without this partner,
might have eaten nearly alone, was at first much pleased
with his aunt, and afterwards with M. de Saint-Remy, her
maitre d'hotel, who had really distinguished himself.

The collation over, at a sign of approbation from M. de
Mazarin, the king arose, and, at the invitation of his aunt,
walked about among the ranks of the assembly.

The ladies then observed -- there are certain things for
which women are as good observers at Blois as at Paris --
the ladies then observed that Louis XIV. had a prompt and
bold look, which premised a distinguished appreciator of
beauty. The men, on their part, observed that the prince was
proud and haughty, that he loved to look down those who
fixed their eyes upon him too long or too earnestly, which
gave presage of a master.

Louis XIV. had accomplished about a third of his review when
his ears were struck with a word which his eminence
pronounced whilst conversing with Monsieur.

This word was the name of a woman.

Scarcely had Louis XIV. heard this word than he heard, or
rather listened to nothing else; and neglecting the arc of
the circle which awaited his visit, his object seemed to be
to come as quickly as possible to the extremity of the
curve.

Monsieur, like a good courtier, was inquiring of monsieur le
cardinal after the health of his nieces; he regretted, he
said, not having the pleasure of receiving them at the same
time with their uncle; they must certainly have grown in
stature, beauty and grace, as they had promised to do the
last time Monsieur had seen them.

What had first struck the king was a certain contrast in the
voices of the two interlocutors. The voice of Monsieur was
calm and natural while he spoke thus; while that of M. de
Mazarin jumped by a note and a half to reply above the
diapason of his usual voice. It might have been said that he
wished that voice to strike, at the end of the salon, any
ear that was too distant.

"Monseigneur," replied he, "Mesdemoiselles de Mazarin have
still to finish their education: they have duties to
fulfill, and a position to make. An abode in a young and
brilliant court would dissipate them a little."

Louis, at this last sentence, smiled sadly. The court was
young, it was true, but the avarice of the cardinal had
taken good care that it should not be brilliant.

"You have nevertheless no intention," replied Monsieur, "to
cloister them or make them bourgeoises?"

"Not at all," replied the cardinal, forcing his Italian
pronunciation in such a manner that, from soft and velvety
as it was, it became sharp and vibrating, "not at all: I
have a full and fixed intention to marry them, and that as
well as I shall be able."

"Parties will not be wanting, monsieur le cardinal," replied
Monsieur, with a bonhomie worthy of one tradesman
congratulating another.

"I hope not, monseigneur, and with reason, as God has been
pleased to give them grace, intelligence, and beauty."

During this conversation, Louis XIV., conducted by Madame,
accomplished, as we have described, the circle of
presentations.

"Mademoiselle Auricule," said the princess, presenting to
his majesty a fat, fair girl of two-and-twenty, who at a
village fete might have been taken for a peasant in Sunday
finery, -- "the daughter of my music-mistress."

The king smiled. Madame had never been able to extract four
correct notes from either viol or harpsichord.

"Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais," continued Madame, "a young
lady of rank, and my good attendant."

This time it was not the king that smiled; it was the young
lady presented, because, for the first time in her life, she
heard, given to her by Madame, who generally showed no
tendency to spoil her, such an honorable qualification.

Our old acquaintance Montalais, therefore, made his majesty
a profound courtesy, the more respectful from the necessity
she was under of concealing certain contractions of her
laughing lips, which the king might not have attributed to
their real cause.

It was just at this moment that the king caught the word
which startled him.

"And the name of the third?" asked Monsieur.

"Mary, monseigneur," replied the cardinal.

There was doubtless some magical influence in that word,
for, as we have said, the king started at hearing it, and
drew Madame towards the middle of the circle, as if he
wished to put some confidential question to her, but, in
reality, for the sake of getting nearer to the cardinal.

"Madame my aunt," said he, laughing, and in a suppressed
voice, "my geography-master did not teach me that Blois was
at such an immense distance from Paris."

"What do you mean, nephew?" asked Madame.

"Why, because it would appear that it requires several
years, as regards fashion, to travel the distance! -- Look
at those young ladies!"

"Well; I know them all."

"Some of them are pretty."

"Don't say that too loud, monsieur my nephew; you will drive
them wild."

"Stop a bit, stop a bit, dear aunt!" said the king, smiling;
"for the second part of my sentence will serve as a
corrective to the first. Well, my dear aunt, some of them
appear old and others ugly, thanks to their ten-year-old
fashions."

"But, sire, Blois is only five days, journey from Paris."

"Yes, that is it," said the king: "two years behind for each
day."

"Indeed! do you really think so? Well, that is strange! It
never struck me."

"Now, look, aunt," said Louis XIV., drawing still nearer to
Mazarin, under the pretext of gaining a better point of
view, "look at that simple white dress by the side of those
antiquated specimens of finery, and those pretentious
coiffures. She is probably one of my mother's maids of
honor, though I don't know her."

"Ah! ah! my dear nephew!" replied Madame, laughing, "permit
me to tell you that your divinatory science is at fault for
once. The young lady you honor with your praise is not a
Parisian, but a Blaisoise."

"Oh, aunt!" replied the king with a look of doubt.

"Come here, Louise," said Madame.

And the fair girl, already known to you under that name,
approached them, timid, blushing, and almost bent beneath
the royal glance.

"Mademoiselle Louise Francoise de la Baume le Blanc, the
daughter of the Marquise de la Valliere," said Madame,
ceremoniously.

The young girl bowed with so much grace, mingled with the
profound timidity inspired by the presence of the king, that
the latter lost, while looking at her, a few words of the
conversation of Monsieur and the cardinal.

"Daughter-in-law," continued Madame, "of M. de Saint-Remy,
my maitre d'hotel, who presided over the confection of that
excellent daube truffee which your majesty seemed so much to
appreciate."

No grace, no youth, no beauty, could stand out against such
a presentation. The king smiled. Whether the words of Madame
were a pleasantry, or uttered in all innocency, they proved
the pitiless immolation of everything that Louis had found
charming or poetic in the young girl. Mademoiselle de la
Valliere, for Madame and, by rebound, for the king, was, for
a moment, no more than the daughter of a man of a superior
talent over dindes truffees.

But princes are thus constituted. The gods, too, were just
like this in Olympus. Diana and Venus, no doubt, abused the
beautiful Alcmena and poor Io, when they condescended, for
distraction's sake, to speak, amidst nectar and ambrosia, of
mortal beauties, at the table of Jupiter.

Fortunately, Louise was so bent in her reverential salute,
that she did not catch either Madame's words or the king's
smile. In fact, if the poor child, who had so much good
taste as alone to have chosen to dress herself in white
amidst all her companions -- if that dove's heart, so easily
accessible to painful emotions, had been touched by the
cruel words of Madame, or the egotistical cold smile of the
king, it would have annihilated her.

And Montalais herself, the girl of ingenious ideas, would
not have attempted to recall her to life; for ridicule kills
beauty even.

But fortunately, as we have said, Louise, whose ears were
buzzing, and her eyes veiled by timidity, -- Louise saw
nothing and heard nothing; and the king, who had still his
attention directed to the conversation of the cardinal and
his uncle, hastened to return to them.

He came up just at the moment Mazarin terminated by saying:
"Mary, as well as her sisters, has just set off for Brouage.
I make them follow the opposite bank of the Loire to that
along which we have traveled; and if I calculate their
progress correctly, according to the orders I have given,
they will to-morrow be opposite Blois."

These words were pronounced with that tact -- that measure,
that distinctness of tone, of intention, and reach -- which
made del Signor Giulio Mazarini the first comedian in the
world.

It resulted that they went straight to the heart of Louis
XIV., and the cardinal, on turning round at the simple noise
of the approaching footsteps of his majesty, saw the
immediate effect of them upon the countenance of his pupil,
an effect betrayed to the keen eyes of his eminence by a
slight increase of color. But what was the ventilation of
such a secret to him whose craft had for twenty years
deceived all the diplomatists of Europe?

From the moment the young king heard these last words, he
appeared as if he had received a poisoned arrow in his
heart. He could not remain quiet in a place, but cast around
an uncertain, dead, and aimless look over the assembly. He
with his eyes interrogated his mother more than twenty
times: but she, given up to the pleasure of conversing with
her sister-in-law, and likewise constrained by the glance of
Mazarin, did not appear to comprehend any of the
supplications conveyed by the looks of her son.

From this moment, music, lights, flowers, beauties, all
became odious and insipid to Louis XIV. After he had a
hundred times bitten his lips, stretched his legs and his
arms like a well-brought-up child who, without daring to
gape, exhausts all the modes of evincing his weariness --
after having uselessly again implored his mother and the
minister, he turned a despairing look towards the door, that
is to say, towards liberty.

At this door, in the embrasure of which he was leaning, he
saw, standing out strongly, a figure with a brown and lofty
countenance, an aquiline nose, a stern but brilliant eye,
gray and long hair, a black mustache, the true type of
military beauty, whose gorget, more sparkling than a mirror,
broke all the reflected lights which concentrated upon it,
and sent them back as lightning. This officer wore his gray
hat with its long red plumes upon his head, a proof that he
was called there by his duty, and not by his pleasure. If he
had been brought thither by his pleasure -- if he had been a
courtier instead of a soldier, as pleasure must always be
paid for at the same price -- he would have held his hat in
his hand.

That which proved still better that this officer was upon
duty, and was accomplishing a task to which he was
accustomed, was, that he watched, with folded arms,
remarkable indifference, and supreme apathy, the joys and
ennuis of this fete. Above all, he appeared, like a
philosopher, and all old soldiers are philosophers, -- he
appeared above all to comprehend the ennuis infinitely
better than the joys; but in the one he took his part,
knowing very well how to do without the other.

Now, he was leaning, as we have said, against the carved
door-frame when the melancholy, weary eyes of the king, by
chance, met his.

It was not the first time, as it appeared, that the eyes of
the officer had met those eyes, and he was perfectly
acquainted with the expression of them; for, as soon as he
had cast his own look upon the countenance of Louis XIV.,
and had read by it what was passing in his heart -- that is
to say, all the ennui that oppressed him -- all the timid
desire to go out which agitated him, -- he perceived he must
render the king a service without his commanding it, --
almost in spite of himself. Boldly, therefore, as if he had
given the word of command to cavalry in battle, "On the
king's service!" cried he, in a clear, sonorous voice.

At these words, which produced the effect of a peal of
thunder, prevailing over the orchestra, the singing and the
buzz of the promenaders, the cardinal and the queen-mother
looked at each other with surprise.

Louis XIV., pale, but resolved, supported as he was by that
intuition of his own thought which he had found in the mind
of the officer of musketeers, and which he had just
manifested by the order given, arose from his chair, and
took a step towards the door.

"Are you going, my son?" said the queen, whilst Mazarin
satisfied himself with interrogating by a look which might
have appeared mild if it had not been so piercing.

"Yes, madame," replied the king; "I am fatigued, and,
besides, wish to write this evening."

A smile stole over the lips of the minister, who appeared,
by a bend of the head, to give the king permission.

Monsieur and Madame hastened to give orders to the officers
who presented themselves.

The king bowed, crossed the hall, and gained the door, where
a hedge of twenty musketeers awaited him. At the extremity
of this hedge stood the officer, impassible, with his drawn
sword in his hand. The king passed, and all the crowd stood
on tip-toe, to have one more look at him.

Ten musketeers, opening the crowd of the ante-chambers and
the steps, made way for his majesty. The other ten
surrounded the king and Monsieur, who had insisted upon
accompanying his majesty. The domestics walked behind. This
little cortege escorted the king to the chamber destined for
him. The apartment was the same that had been occupied by
Henry III. during his sojourn in the States.

Monsieur had given his orders. The musketeers, led by their
officer, took possession of the little passage by which one
wing of the castle communicates with the other. This passage
was commenced by a small square ante-chamber, dark even in
the finest days. Monsieur stopped Louis XIV.

"You are passing now, sire," said he, "the very spot where
the Duc de Guise received the first stab of the poniard."

The king was ignorant of all historical matters; he had
heard of the fact, but he knew nothing of the localities or
the details.

"Ah!" said he with a shudder.

And he stopped. The rest, both behind and before him,
stopped likewise.

"The duc, sire," continued Gaston, "was nearly where I
stand: he was walking in the same direction as your majesty;
M. de Lorgnes was exactly where your lieutenant of
musketeers is; M. de Saint-Maline and his majesty's
ordinaries were behind him and around him. It was here that
he was struck."

The king turned towards his officer, and saw something like
a cloud pass over his martial and daring countenance.

"Yes, from behind!" murmured the lieutenant, with a gesture
of supreme disdain. And he endeavored to resume the march,
as if ill at ease at being between walls formerly defiled by
treachery.

But the king, who appeared to wish to be informed, was
disposed to give another look at this dismal spot.

Gaston perceived his nephew's desire.

"Look, sire," said he, taking a flambeau from the hands of
M. de Saint-Remy, "this is where he fell. There was a bed
there, the curtains of which he tore with catching at them."

"Why does the floor seem hollowed out at this spot?" asked
Louis.

"Because it was here the blood flowed," replied Gaston; "the
blood penetrated deeply into the oak, and it was only by
cutting it out that they succeeded in making it disappear.
And even then," added Gaston, pointing the flambeau to the
spot, "even then this red stain resisted all the attempts
made to destroy it."

Louis XIV. raised his head. Perhaps he was thinking of that
bloody trace that had once been shown him at the Louvre, and
which, as a pendant to that of Blois, had been made there
one day by the king his father with the blood of Concini.

"Let us go on," said he.

The march was resumed promptly, for emotion, no doubt, had
given to the voice of the young prince a tone of command
which was not customary with him. When arrived at the
apartment destined for the king, which communicated not only
with the little passage we have passed through, but further
with the great staircase leading to the court, --

"Will your majesty," said Gaston, "condescend to occupy this
apartment, all unworthy as it is to receive you?"

"Uncle," replied the young king, "I render you my thanks for
your cordial hospitality."

Gaston bowed to his nephew, embraced him, and then went out.

Of the twenty musketeers who had accompanied the king, ten
reconducted Monsieur to the reception-rooms, which were not
yet empty, notwithstanding the king had retired.

The ten others were posted by their officer, who himself
explored, in five minutes, all the localities, with that
cold and certain glance which not even habit gives unless
that glance belongs to genius.

Then, when all were placed, he chose as his headquarters the
ante-chamber, in which he found a large fauteuil, a lamp,
some wine, some water: and some dry bread.

He refreshed his lamp, drank half a glass of wine, curled
his lip with a smile full of expression, installed himself
in his large armchair, and made preparations for sleeping.




CHAPTER 9

In which the Unknown of the Hostelry
of Les Medici loses his Incognito.



This officer, who was sleeping, or preparing to sleep, was,
notwithstanding his careless air, charged with a serious
responsibility.

Lieutenant of the king's musketeers, he commanded all the
company which came from Paris, and that company consisted of
a hundred and twenty men; but, with the exception of the
twenty of whom we have spoken, the other hundred were
engaged in guarding the queen-mother, and more particularly
the cardinal.

Monsignor Giulio Mazarini economized the traveling expenses
of his guards; he consequently used the king's, and that
largely, since he took fifty of them for himself -- a
peculiarity which would not have failed to strike any one
unacquainted with the usages of that court.

That which would still further have appeared, if not
inconvenient, at least extraordinary, to a stranger, was,
that the side of the castle destined for monsieur le
cardinal was brilliant, light and cheerful. The musketeers
there mounted guard before every door, and allowed no one to
enter, except the couriers, who, even while he was
traveling, followed the cardinal for the carrying on of his
correspondence.

Twenty men were on duty with the queen-mother; thirty
rested, in order to relieve their companions the next day.

On the king's side, on the contrary, were darkness, silence,
and solitude. When once the doors were closed, there was no
longer an appearance of royalty. All the servitors had by
degrees retired. Monsieur le Prince had sent to know if his
majesty required his attendance; and on the customary "No"
of the lieutenant of musketeers, who was habituated to the
question and the reply, all appeared to sink into the arms
of sleep, as if in the dwelling of a good citizen.

And yet it was possible to hear from the side of the house
occupied by the young king the music of the banquet, and to
see the windows of the great hall richly illuminated.

Ten minutes after his installation in his apartment, Louis
XIV. had been able to learn, by movement much more
distinguished than marked his own leaving, the departure of
the cardinal, who, in his turn, sought his bedroom,
accompanied by a large escort of ladies and gentlemen.

Besides, to perceive this movement, he had nothing to do but
to look out at his window, the shutters of which had not
been closed.

His eminence crossed the court, conducted by Monsieur, who
himself held a flambeau, then followed the queen-mother, to
whom Madame familiarly gave her arm; and both walked
chatting away, like two old friends.

Behind these two couples filed nobles, ladies, pages and
officers; the flambeaux gleamed over the whole court, like
the moving reflections of a conflagration. Then the noise of
steps and voices became lost in the upper floors of the
castle.

No one was then thinking of the king, who, leaning on his
elbow at his window, had sadly seen pass away all that
light, and heard that noise die off -- no, not one, if it
was not that unknown of the hostelry des Medici, whom we
have seen go out, enveloped in his cloak.

He had come straight up to the castle, and had, with his
melancholy countenance, wandered round and round the palace,
from which the people had not yet departed; and finding that
no one guarded the great entrance, or the porch, seeing that
the soldiers of Monsieur were fraternizing with the royal
soldiers -- that is to say swallowing Beaugency at
discretion, or rather indiscretion -- the unknown penetrated
through the crowd, then ascended to the court, and came to
the landing of the staircase leading to the cardinal's
apartment.

What, according to all probability, induced him to direct
his steps that way, was the splendor of the flambeaux, and
the busy air of the pages and domestics. But he was stopped
short by a presented musket and the cry of the sentinel.

"Where are you going, my friend?" asked the soldier.

"I am going to the king's apartment," replied the unknown,
haughtily, but tranquilly.

The soldier called one of his eminence's officers, who, in
the tone in which a youth in office directs a solicitor to a
minister, let fall these words: "The other staircase, in
front."

And the officer, without further notice of the unknown,
resumed his interrupted conversation.

The stranger, without reply, directed his steps towards the
staircase pointed out to him. On this side there was no
noise, there were no more flambeaux.

Obscurity, through which a sentinel glided like a shadow;
silence, which permitted him to hear the sound of his own
footsteps, accompanied with the jingling of his spurs upon
the stone slabs.

This guard was one of the twenty musketeers appointed for
attendance upon the king, and who mounted guard with the
stiffness and consciousness of a statue.

"Who goes there?" said the guard.

"A friend," replied the unknown.

"What do you want?"

"To speak to the king."

"Do you, my dear monsieur? That's not very likely."

"Why not?"

"Because the king has gone to bed."

"Gone to bed already?"

"Yes."

"No matter: I must speak to him."

"And I tell you that is impossible."

"And yet ---- "

"Go back!"

"Do you require the word?"

"I have no account to render to you. Stand back!"

And this time the soldier accompanied his word with a
threatening gesture; but the unknown stirred no more than if
his feet had taken root.

"Monsieur le mousquetaire," said he, "are you a gentleman?"

"I have that honor."

"Very well! I also am one, and between gentlemen some
consideration ought to be observed."

The soldier lowered his arms, overcome by the dignity with
which these words were pronounced.

"Speak, monsieur," said he; "and if you ask me anything in
my power ---- "

"Thank you. You have an officer, have you not?"

"Our lieutenant? Yes, monsieur."

"Well, I wish to speak to him."

"Oh, that's a different thing. Come up, monsieur."

The unknown saluted the soldier in a lofty fashion, and
ascended the staircase; whilst a cry, "Lieutenant, a visit!"
transmitted from sentinel to sentinel, preceded the unknown,
and disturbed the slumbers of the officer.

Dragging on his boots, rubbing his eyes, and hooking his
cloak, the lieutenant made three steps towards the stranger.

"What can I do to serve you, monsieur?" asked he.

"You are the officer on duty, lieutenant of the musketeers,
are you?"

"I have that honor," replied the officer.

"Monsieur, I must absolutely speak to the king."

The lieutenant looked attentively at the unknown, and in
that look, however rapid, he saw all he wished to see --
that is to say, a person of high distinction in an ordinary
dress.

"I do not suppose you to be mad," replied he; "and yet you
seem to me to be in a condition to know, monsieur, that
people do not enter a king's apartments in this manner
without his consent."

"He will consent."

"Monsieur, permit me to doubt that. The king has retired
this quarter of an hour; he must be now undressing. Besides,
the word is given."

"When he knows who I am, he will recall the word."

The officer was more and more surprised, more and more
subdued.

"If I consent to announce you, may I at least know whom to
announce, monsieur?"

"You will announce His Majesty Charles II., King of England,
Scotland, and Ireland."

The officer uttered a cry of astonishment, drew back, and
there might be seen upon his pallid countenance one of the
most poignant emotions that ever an energetic man endeavored
to drive back to his heart.

"Oh, yes, sire; in fact," said he, "I ought to have
recognized you."

"You have seen my portrait, then?"

"No, sire."

"Or else you have seen me formerly at court, before I was
driven from France?"

"No, sire, it is not even that."

"How then could you have recognized me, if you have never
seen my portrait or my person?"

"Sire, I saw his majesty your father at a terrible moment."

"The day ---- "

"Yes."

A dark cloud passed over the brow of the prince; then,
dashing his hand across it, "Do you still see any difficulty
in announcing me?" said he.

"Sire, pardon me," replied the officer, "but I could not
imagine a king under so simple an exterior; and yet I had
the honor to tell your majesty just now that I had seen
Charles I. But pardon me, monsieur; I will go and inform the
king."

But returning after going a few steps, "Your majesty is
desirous, without doubt, that this interview should be a
secret?" said he.

"I do not require it; but if it were possible to preserve it
---- "

"It is possible, sire, for I can dispense with informing the
first gentleman on duty; but, for that, your majesty must
please to consent to give up your sword."

"True, true; I had forgotten that no one armed is permitted
to enter the chamber of a king of France."

"Your majesty will form an exception, if you wish it; but
then I shall avoid my responsibility by informing the king's
attendant."

"Here is my sword, monsieur. Will you now please to announce
me to his majesty?"

"Instantly, sire." And the officer immediately went and
knocked at the door of communication, which the valet opened
to him.

"His Majesty the King of England!" said the officer.

"His Majesty the King of England!" replied the valet de
chambre.

At these words a gentleman opened the folding-doors of the
king's apartment, and Louis XIV. was seen, without hat or
sword, and his pourpoint open, advancing with signs of the
greatest surprise.

"You, my brother -- you at Blois!" cried Louis XIV.,
dismissing with a gesture both the gentleman and the valet
de chambre, who passed out into the next apartment.

"Sire," replied Charles II., "I was going to Paris, in the
hope of seeing your majesty, when report informed me of your
approaching arrival in this city. I therefore prolonged my
abode here, having something very particular to communicate
to you."

"Will this closet suit you, my brother?"

"Perfectly well, sire; for I think no one can hear us here."

"I have dismissed my gentleman and my watcher; they are in
the next chamber. There, behind that partition, is a
solitary closet, looking into the ante-chamber, and in that
ante-chamber you found nobody but a solitary officer, did
you?"

"No, sire."

"Well, then, speak, my brother; I listen to you."

"Sire, I commence, and entreat your majesty to have pity on
the misfortunes of our house."

The king of France colored, and drew his chair closer to
that of the king of England.

"Sire," said Charles II., "I have no need to ask if your
majesty is acquainted with the details of my deplorable
history."

Louis XIV. blushed, this time more strongly than before;
then, stretching forth his hand to that of the king of
England, "My brother," said he, "I am ashamed to say so, but
the cardinal scarcely ever speaks of political affairs
before me. Still more, formerly I used to get Laporte, my
valet de chambre, to read historical subjects to me, but he
put a stop to these readings, and took away Laporte from me.
So that I beg my brother Charles to tell me all those
matters as to a man who knows nothing."

"Well, sire, I think that by taking things from the
beginning I shall have a better chance of touching the heart
of your majesty."

"Speak on, my brother -- speak on."

"You know, sire, that being called in 1650 to Edinburgh,
during Cromwell's expedition into Ireland, I was crowned at
Scone. A year after, wounded in one of the provinces he had
usurped, Cromwell returned upon us. To meet him was my
object; to leave Scotland was my wish."

"And yet," interrupted the young king, "Scotland is almost
your native country, is it not, my brother?"

"Yes; but the Scots were cruel compatriots for me, sire;
they had forced me to forsake the religion of my fathers;
they had hung Lord Montrose, the most devoted of my
servants, because he was not a Covenanter; and as the poor
martyr, to whom they had offered a favor when dying, had
asked that his body might be cut into as many pieces as
there are cities in Scotland, in order that evidence of his
fidelity might be met with everywhere, I could not leave one
city, or go into another, without passing under some
fragments of a body which had acted, fought, and breathed
for me.

"By a bold, almost desperate march, I passed through
Cromwell's army, and entered England. The Protector set out
in pursuit of this strange flight, which had a crown for its
object. If I had been able to reach London before him,
without doubt the prize of the race would have been mine;
but he overtook me at Worcester.

"The genius of England was no longer with us, but with him.
On the 5th of September, 1651, sire, the anniversary of the
other battle of Dunbar, so fatal to the Scots, I was
conquered. Two thousand men fell around me before I thought
of retreating a step. At length I was obliged to fly.

"From that moment my history became a romance. Pursued with
persistent inveteracy, I cut off my hair, I disguised myself
as a woodman. One day spent amidst the branches of an oak
gave to that tree the name of the royal oak, which it bears
to this day. My adventures in the county of Stafford, whence
I escaped with the daughter of my host on a pillion behind
me, still fill the tales of the country firesides, and would
furnish matter for ballads. I will some day write all this,
sire, for the instruction of my brother kings.

"I will first tell how, on arriving at the residence of Mr.
Norton, I met with a court chaplain, who was looking on at a
party playing at skittles, and an old servant who named me,
bursting into tears, and who was as near and as certainly
killing me by his fidelity as another might have been by
treachery. Then I will tell of my terrors -- yes, sire, of
my terrors -- when, at the house of Colonel Windham, a
farrier who came to shoe our horses declared they had been
shod in the north."

"How strange!" murmured Louis XIV. "I never heard anything
of all that; I was only told of your embarkation at
Brighthelmstone and your landing in Normandy."

"Oh!" exclaimed Charles, "if Heaven permits kings to be thus
ignorant of the histories of each other, how can they render
assistance to their brothers who need it?"

"But tell me," continued Louis XIV., "how, after being so
roughly received in England, you can still hope for anything
from that unhappy country and that rebellious people?"

"Oh, sire! since the battle of Worcester, everything is
changed there. Cromwell is dead, after having signed a
treaty with France, in which his name is placed above yours.
He died on the 5th of September, 1658, a fresh anniversary
of the battles of Dunbar and Worcester."

"His son has succeeded him."

"But certain men have a family, sire, and no heir. The
inheritance of Oliver was too heavy for Richard. Richard was
neither a republican nor a royalist; Richard allowed his
guards to eat his dinner, and his generals to govern the
republic; Richard abdicated the protectorate on the 22nd of
April, 1659, more than a year ago, sire.

"From that time England is nothing but a tennis-court, in
which the players throw dice for the crown of my father. The
two most eager players are Lambert and Monk. Well, sire, I,
in my turn, wish to take part in this game, where the stakes
are thrown upon my royal mantle. Sire, it only requires a
million to corrupt one of these players and make an ally of
him, or two hundred of your gentlemen to drive them out of
my palace at Whitehall, as Christ drove the money-changers
from the temple."

"You come, then," replied Louis XIV., "to ask me ---- "

"For your assistance, that is to say, not only for that
which kings owe to each other, but that which simple
Christians owe to each other -- your assistance, sire,
either in money or men. Your assistance, sire, and within a
month, whether I oppose Lambert to Monk, or Monk to Lambert,
I shall have reconquered my paternal inheritance, without
having cost my country a guinea, or my subjects a drop of
blood, for they are now all drunk with revolutions,
protectorates, and republics, and ask nothing better than to
fall staggering to sleep in the arms of royalty. Your
assistance, sire, and I shall owe you more than I owe my
father, -- my poor father, who bought at so dear a rate the
ruin of our house! You may judge, sire, whether I am
unhappy, whether I am in despair, for I accuse my own
father!"

And the blood mounted to the pale face of Charles II., who
remained for an instant with his head between his hands, and
as if blinded by that blood which appeared to revolt against
the filial blasphemy.

The young king was not less affected than his elder brother;
he threw himself about in his fauteuil, and could not find a
single word of reply.

Charles II., to whom ten years in age gave a superior
strength to master his emotions, recovered his speech the
first.

"Sire," said he, "your reply? I wait for it as a criminal
waits for his sentence. Must I die?"

"My brother," replied the French prince, "you ask me for a
million -- me, who was never possessed of a quarter of that
sum! I possess nothing. I am no more king of France than you
are king of England. I am a name, a cipher dressed in
fleur-de-lised velvet, -- that is all. I am upon a visible
throne; that is my only advantage over your majesty. I have
nothing -- I can do nothing."

"Can it be so?" exclaimed Charles II.

"My brother," said Louis, sinking his voice, "I have
undergone miseries with which my poorest gentlemen are
unacquainted. If my poor Laporte were here, he would tell
you that I have slept in ragged sheets, through the holes of
which my legs have passed; he would tell you that
afterwards, when I asked for carriages, they brought me
conveyances half-destroyed by the rats of the coach-houses;
he would tell you that when I asked for my dinner, the
servants went to the cardinal's kitchen to inquire if there
were any dinner for the king. And look! to-day, this very
day even, when I am twenty-two years of age, -- to-day, when
I have attained the grade of the majority of kings, --
to-day, when I ought to have the key of the treasury, the
direction of the policy, the supremacy in peace and war, --
cast your eyes around me, see how I am left! Look at this
abandonment -- this disdain -- this silence! -- Whilst
yonder -- look yonder! View the bustle, the lights, the
homage! There! -- there you see the real king of France, my
brother!

"In the cardinal's apartments?"

"Yes, in the cardinal's apartments."

"Then I am condemned, sire?"

Louis XIV. made no reply.

"Condemned is the word; for I will never solicit him who
left my mother and sister to die with cold and hunger -- the
daughter and grand-daughter of Henry IV. -- if M. de Retz
and the parliament had not sent them wood and bread."

"To die?" murmured Louis XIV.

"Well!" continued the king of England, "poor Charles II.,
grandson of Henry IV. as you are, sire, having neither
parliament nor Cardinal de Retz to apply to, will die of
hunger, as his mother and sister had nearly done."

Louis knitted his brow, and twisted violently the lace of
his ruffles.

This prostration, this immobility, serving as a mark to an
emotion so visible, struck Charles II., and he took the
young man's hand.

"Thanks!" said he, "my brother. You pity me, and that is all
I can require of you in your present situation."

"Sire," said Louis XIV., with a sudden impulse, and raising
his head, "it is a million you require, or two hundred
gentlemen, I think you say?"

"Sire, a million would be quite sufficient."

"That is very little."

"Offered to a single man it is a great deal. Convictions
have been purchased at a much lower price; and I should have
nothing to do but with venalities."

"Two hundred gentlemen! Reflect! -- that is little more than
a single company."

"Sire, there is in our family a tradition, and that is, that
four men, four French gentlemen, devoted to my father, were
near saving my father, though condemned by a parliament,
guarded by an army and surrounded by a nation."

"Then if I can procure you a million, or two hundred
gentlemen, you will be satisfied; and you will consider me
your well-affectioned brother?"

"I shall consider you as my saviour; and if I recover the
throne of my father, England will be, as long as I reign at
least, a sister to France, as you will have been a brother
to me."

"Well, my brother," said Louis, rising, "what you hesitate
to ask for, I will myself demand; that which I have never
done on my own account, I will do on yours. I will go and
find the king of France -- the other -- the rich, the
powerful one, I mean. I will myself solicit this million, or
these two hundred gentlemen; and -- we will see."

"Oh!" cried Charles, "you are a noble friend, sire -- a
heart created by God! You save me, my brother; and if you
should ever stand in need of the life you restore me, demand
it."

"Silence, my brother, -- silence!" said Louis, in a
suppressed voice. "Take care that no one hears you! We have
not obtained our end yet. To ask money of Mazarin -- that is
worse than traversing the enchanted forest, each tree of
which inclosed a demon. It is more than setting out to
conquer a world."

"But yet, sire, when you ask it ---- "

"I have already told you that I never asked," replied Louis
with a haughtiness that made the king of England turn pale.

And as the latter, like a wounded man, made a retreating
movement -- "Pardon me, my brother," replied he. "I have
neither a mother nor a sister who are suffering. My throne
is hard and naked, but I am firmly seated on my throne.
Pardon me that expression, my brother; it was that of an
egotist. I will retract it, therefore, by a sacrifice, -- I
will go to monsieur le cardinal. Wait for me, if you please
-- I will return."




CHAPTER 10

The Arithmetic of M. de Mazarin



Whilst the king was directing his course rapidly towards the
wing of the castle occupied by the cardinal, taking nobody
with him but his valet de chambre, the officer of musketeers
came out, breathing like a man who has for a long time been
forced to hold his breath, from the little cabinet of which
we have already spoken, and which the king believed to be
quite solitary. This little cabinet had formerly been part
of the chamber, from which it was only separated by a thin
partition. It resulted that this partition, which was only
for the eye, permitted the ear the least indiscreet to hear
every word spoken in the chamber.

There was no doubt, then, that this lieutenant of musketeers
had heard all that passed in his majesty's apartment.

Warned by the last words of the young king, he came out just
in time to salute him on his passage, and to follow him with
his eyes till he had disappeared in the corridor.

Then as soon as he had disappeared, he shook his head after
a fashion peculiarly his own, and in a voice which forty
years' absence from Gascony had not deprived of its Gascon
accent, "A melancholy service," said he, "and a melancholy
master!"

These words pronounced, the lieutenant resumed his place in
his fauteuil, stretched his legs and closed his eyes, like a
man who either sleeps or meditates.

During this short monologue and the mise en scene that had
accompanied it, whilst the king, through the long corridors
of the old castle, proceeded to the apartment of M. de
Mazarin, a scene of another sort was being enacted in those
apartments.

Mazarin was in bed, suffering a little from the gout. But as
he was a man of order, who utilized even pain, he forced his
wakefulness to be the humble servant of his labor. He had
consequently ordered Bernouin, his valet de chambre, to
bring him a little traveling-desk, so that he might write in
bed. But the gout is not an adversary that allows itself to
be conquered so easily; therefore, at each movement he made,
the pain from dull became sharp.

"Is Brienne there?" asked he of Bernouin.

"No, monseigneur," replied the valet de chambre; "M. de
Brienne, with your permission, is gone to bed. But, if it is
the wish of your eminence, he can speedily be called."

"No, it is not worth while. Let us see, however. Cursed
ciphers!"

And the cardinal began to think, counting on his fingers the
while.

"Oh, ciphers is it?" said Bernouin. "Very well! if your
eminence attempts calculations, I will promise you a pretty
headache to-morrow! And with that please to remember M.
Guenaud is not here."

"You are right, Bernouin. You must take Brienne's place, my
friend. Indeed, I ought to have brought M. Colbert with me.
That young man goes on very well, Bernouin, very well; a
very orderly youth."

"I do not know," said the valet de chambre, "but I don't
like the countenance of your young man who goes on so well."

"Well, well, Bernouin! We don't stand in need of your
advice. Place yourself there: take the pen and write."

"I am ready, monseigneur; what am I to write?"

"There, that's the place: after the two lines already
traced."

"I am there."

"Write seven hundred and sixty thousand livres."

"That is written."

"Upon Lyons ---- " The cardinal appeared to hesitate.

"Upon Lyons," repeated Bernouin.

"Three millions nine hundred thousand livres."

"Well, monseigneur?"

"Upon Bordeaux seven millions."

"Seven?" repeated Bernouin.

"Yes," said the cardinal, pettishly, "seven." Then,
recollecting himself, "You understand, Bernouin," added he,
"that all this money is to be spent?"

"Eh! monseigneur; whether it be to be spent or put away is
of very little consequence to me, since none of these
millions are mine."

"These millions are the king's; it is the king's money I am
reckoning. Well, what were we saying? You always interrupt
me!"

"Seven millions upon Bordeaux."

"Ah! yes; that's right. Upon Madrid four millions. I give
you to understand plainly to whom this money belongs,
Bernouin, seeing that everybody has the stupidity to believe
me rich in millions. I repel the silly idea. A minister,
besides, has nothing of his own. Come, go on. Rentrees
generales, seven millions; properties, nine millions. Have
you written that, Bernouin?"

"Yes, monseigneur."

"Bourse, six hundred thousand livres; various property, two
millions. Ah! I forgot -- the furniture of the different
chateaux ---- "

"Must I put of the crown?" asked Bernouin.

"No, no, it is of no use doing that -- that is understood.
Have you written that, Bernouin?"

"Yes, monseigneur."

"And the ciphers?"

"Stand straight under one another."

"Cast them up, Bernouin."

"Thirty-nine millions two hundred and sixty thousand livres,
monseigneur."

"Ah!" cried the cardinal, in a tone of vexation; "there are
not yet forty millions!"

Bernouin recommenced the addition.

"No, monseigneur; there want seven hundred and forty
thousand livres."

Mazarin asked for the account, and revised it carefully.

"Yes, but," said Bernouin, "thirty-nine millions two hundred
and sixty thousand livres make a good round sum."

"Ah, Bernouin, I wish the king had it."

"Your eminence told me that this money was his majesty's."

"Doubtless, as clear, as transparent as possible. These
thirty-nine millions are bespoken, and much more."

Bernouin smiled after his own fashion -- that is, like a man
who believes no more than he is willing to believe -- whilst
preparing the cardinal's night draught, and putting his
pillow to rights.

"Oh!" said Mazarin, when the valet had gone out; "not yet
forty millions! I must, however, attain that sum, which I
had set down for myself. But who knows whether I shall have
time? I sink, I am going, I shall never reach it! And yet,
who knows that I may not find two or three millions in the
pockets of my good friends the Spaniards? They discovered
Peru, those people did, and -- what the devil! they must
have something left."

As he was speaking thus, entirely occupied with his ciphers,
and thinking no more of his gout, repelled by a
preoccupation which, with the cardinal, was the most
powerful of all preoccupations, Bernouin rushed into the
chamber, quite in a fright.

"Well!" asked the cardinal, "what is the matter now?"

"The king, monseigneur, -- the king!"

"How? -- the king!" said Mazarin, quickly concealing his
paper. "The king here! the king at this hour! I thought he
was in bed long ago. What is the matter, then?"

The king could hear these last words, and see the terrified
gesture of the cardinal rising up in his bed, for he entered
the chamber at that moment.

"It is nothing, monsieur le cardinal, or at least nothing
which can alarm you. It is an important communication which
I wish to make to your eminence to-night -- that is all."

Mazarin immediately thought of that marked attention which
the king had given to his words concerning Mademoiselle de
Mancini, and the communication appeared to him probably to
refer to this source. He recovered his serenity then
instantly, and assumed his most agreeable air, a change of
countenance which inspired the king with the greatest joy;
and when Louis was seated, --

"Sire," said the cardinal, "I ought certainly to listen to
your majesty standing, but the violence of my complaint ----
"

"No ceremony between us, my dear monsieur le cardinal," said
Louis kindly: "I am your pupil, and not the king, you know
very well, and this evening in particular, as I come to you
as a petitioner, as a solicitor, and one very humble, and
desirous to be kindly received, too."

Mazarin, seeing the heightened color of the king, was
confirmed in his first idea; that is to say, that love
thoughts were hidden under all these fine words. This time,
political cunning, keen as it was, made a mistake; this
color was not caused by the bashfulness of a juvenile
passion, but only by the painful contraction of the royal
pride.

Like a good uncle, Mazarin felt disposed to facilitate the
confidence.

"Speak, sire," said he, "and since your majesty is willing
for an instant to forget that I am your subject, and call me
your master and instructor, I promise your majesty my most
devoted and tender consideration."

"Thanks, monsieur le cardinal," answered the king; "that
which I have to ask of your eminence has but little to do
with myself."

"So much the worse!" replied the cardinal, "so much the
worse! Sire, I should wish your majesty to ask of me
something of importance, even a sacrifice; but whatever it
may be that you ask me, I am ready to set your heart at rest
by granting it, my dear sire."

"Well, this is what brings me here," said the king, with a
beating of the heart that had no equal except the beating of
the heart of the minister; "I have just received a visit
from my brother, the king of England."

Mazarin bounded in his bed as if he had been put in relation
with a Leyden jar or a voltaic pile, at the same time that a
surprise, or rather a manifest disappointment, inflamed his
features with such a blaze of anger, that Louis XIV., little
diplomatist as he was, saw that the minister had hoped to
hear something else.

"Charles II.?" exclaimed Mazarin, with a hoarse voice and a
disdainful movement of his lips. "You have received a visit
from Charles II.?"

"From King Charles II.," replied Louis, according in a
marked manner to the grandson of Henry IV. the title which
Mazarin had forgotten to give him. "Yes, monsieur le
cardinal, that unhappy prince has touched my heart with the
relation of his misfortunes. His distress is great, monsieur
le cardinal, and it has appeared painful to me, who have
seen my own throne disputed, who have been forced in times
of commotion to quit my capital, -- to me, in short, who am
acquainted with misfortune, -- to leave a deposed and
fugitive brother without assistance."

"Eh!" said the cardinal, sharply; "why had he not, as you
have, a Jules Mazarin by his side? His crown would then have
remained intact."

"I know all that my house owes to your eminence," replied
the king, haughtily, "and you may believe well that I, on my
part, shall never forget it. It is precisely because my
brother the king of England has not about him the powerful
genius who has saved me, it is for that, I say, that I wish
to conciliate the aid of that same genius, and beg you to
extend your arm over his head, well assured, monsieur le
cardinal, that your hand, by touching him only, would know
how to replace upon his brow the crown which fell at the
foot of his father's scaffold."

"Sire," replied Mazarin, "I thank you for your good opinion
with regard to myself, but we have nothing to do yonder:
they are a set of madmen who deny God, and cut off the heads
of their kings. They are dangerous, observe, sire, and
filthy to the touch after having wallowed in royal blood and
covenantal murder. That policy has never suited me, -- I
scorn it and reject it."

"Therefore you ought to assist in establishing a better."

"What is that?"

"The restoration of Charles II., for example."

"Good heavens!" cried Mazarin, "does the poor prince flatter
himself with that chimera?"

"Yes, he does," replied the young king, terrified at the
difficulties opposed to this project, which he fancied he
could perceive in the infallible eye of his minister; "he
only asks for a million to carry out his purpose."

"Is that all -- a little million, if you please!" said the
cardinal, ironically, with an effort to conquer his Italian
accent. "A little million, if you please, brother! Bah! a
family of mendicants!"

"Cardinal," said Louis, raising his head, "that family of
mendicants is a branch of my family."

"Are you rich enough to give millions to other people, sire?
Have you millions to throw away?"

"Oh!" replied Louis XIV., with great pain, which he,
however, by a strong effort, prevented from appearing on his
countenance; -- "oh! yes, monsieur le cardinal, I am well
aware I am poor, and yet the crown of France is worth a
million, and to perform a good action I would pledge my
crown if it were necessary. I could find Jews who would be
willing to lend me a million."

"So, sire, you say you want a million?" said Mazarin.

"Yes, monsieur, I say so."

"You are mistaken, greatly mistaken, sire; you want much
more than that, -- Bernouin! -- you shall see, sire, how
much you really want."

"What, cardinal!" said the king, "are you going to consult a
lackey about my affairs?"

"Bernouin!" cried the cardinal again, without appearing to
remark the humiliation of the young prince. "Come here,
Bernouin, and tell me the figures I gave you just now."

"Cardinal, cardinal! did you not hear me?" said Louis,
turning pale with anger.

"Do not be angry, sire; I deal openly with the affairs of
your majesty. Every one in France knows that; my books are
as open as day. What did I tell you to do just now,
Bernouin?"

"Your eminence commanded me to cast up an account."

"You did it, did you not?"

"Yes, my lord."

"To verify the amount of which his majesty, at this moment,
stands in need. Did I not tell you so? Be frank, my friend."

"Your eminence said so."

"Well, what sum did I say I wanted?"

"Forty-five millions, I think."

"And what sum could we find, after collecting all our
resources?"

"Thirty-nine millions two hundred and sixty thousand."

"That is correct, Bernouin; that is all I wanted to know.
Leave us now," said the cardinal, fixing his brilliant eye
upon the young king, who sat mute with stupefaction.

"However ---- " stammered the king.

"What, do you still doubt, sire?" said the cardinal. "Well,
here is a proof of what I said."

And Mazarin drew from under his bolster the paper covered
with figures, which he presented to the king, who turned
away his eyes, his vexation was so deep.

"Therefore, as it is a million you want, sire, and that
million is not set down here, it is forty-six millions your
majesty stands in need of. Well I don't think that any Jews
in the world would lend such a sum, even upon the crown of
France."

The king, clenching his hands beneath his ruffles, pushed
away his chair.

"So it must be then!" said he, "my brother the king of
England will die of hunger."

"Sire," replied Mazarin, in the same tone, "remember this
proverb, which I give you as the expression of the soundest
policy: `Rejoice at being poor when your neighbor is poor
likewise.'"

Louis meditated for a few moments, with an inquisitive
glance directed to the paper, one end of which remained
under the bolster.

"Then," said he, "it is impossible to comply with my demand
for money, my lord cardinal, is it?"

"Absolutely, sire."

"Remember, this will secure me a future enemy, if he succeed
in recovering his crown without my assistance."

"If your majesty only fears that, you may be quite at ease,"
replied Mazarin, eagerly.

"Very well, I say no more about it," exclaimed Louis XIV.

"Have I at least convinced you, sire?" placing his hand upon
that of the young king.

"Perfectly."

"If there be anything else, ask it, sire, I shall be most
happy to grant it to you, having refused this."

"Anything else, my lord?"

"Why yes, am I not devoted body and soul to your majesty?
Hola! Bernouin! -- lights and guards for his majesty! His
majesty is returning to his own chamber."

"Not yet, monsieur: since you place your good-will at my
disposal, I will take advantage of it."

"For yourself, sire?" asked the cardinal, hoping that his
niece was at length about to be named.

"No, monsieur, not for myself," replied Louis, "but still
for my brother Charles."

The brow of Mazarin again became clouded, and he grumbled a
few words that the king could not catch.




CHAPTER 11

Mazarin's Policy



Instead of the hesitation with which he had accosted the
cardinal a quarter of an hour before, there might be read in
the eyes of the young king that will against which a
struggle might be maintained, and which might be crushed by
its own impotence, but which, at least, would preserve, like
a wound in the depth of the heart, the remembrance of its
defeat.

"This time, my lord cardinal, we have to deal with something
more easily found than a million."

"Do you think so, sire?" said Mazarin, looking at the king
with that penetrating eye which was accustomed to read to
the bottom of hearts.

"Yes, I think so; and when you know the object of my request
---- "

"And do you think I do not know it, sire?"

"You know what remains for me to say to you?"

"Listen, sire; these are King Charles's own words ---- "

"Oh, impossible!"

"Listen. `And if that miserly, beggarly Italian,' said he
---- "

"My lord cardinal!"

"That is the sense, if not the words. Eh! Good heavens! I
wish him no ill on that account, one is biased by his
passions. He said to you: `If that vile Italian refuses the
million we ask of him, sire, -- if we are forced, for want
of money, to renounce diplomacy, well, then, we will ask him
to grant us five hundred gentlemen.'"

The king started, for the cardinal was only mistaken in the
number.

"Is not that it, sire?" cried the minister, with a
triumphant accent. "And then he added some fine words: he
said, `I have friends on the other side of the channel, and
these friends only want a leader and a banner. When they see
me, when they behold the banner of France, they will rally
round me, for they will comprehend that I have your support.
The colors of the French uniform will be worth as much to me
as the million M. de Mazarin refuses us,' -- for he was
pretty well assured I should refuse him that million. -- `I
shall conquer with these five hundred gentlemen, sire, and
all the honor will be yours.' Now, that is what he said, or
to that purpose, was it not? -- turning those plain words
into brilliant metaphors and pompous images, for they are
fine talkers in that family! The father talked even on the
scaffold."

The perspiration of shame stood upon the brow of Louis. He
felt that it was inconsistent with his dignity to hear his
brother thus insulted, but he did not yet know how to act
with him to whom every one yielded, even his mother. At last
he made an effort.

"But," said he, "my lord cardinal, it is not five hundred
men, it is only two hundred."

"Well, but you see I guessed what he wanted."

"I never denied that you had a penetrating eye, and that was
why I thought you would not refuse my brother Charles a
thing so simple and so easy to grant him as what I ask of
you in his name, my lord cardinal, or rather in my own."

"Sire," said Mazarin, "I have studied policy thirty years;
first, under the auspices of M. le Cardinal de Richelieu;
and then alone. This policy has not always been over-honest,
it must be allowed, but it has never been unskillful. Now
that which is proposed to your majesty is dishonest and
unskillful at the same time."

"Dishonest, monsieur!"

"Sire, you entered into a treaty with Cromwell."

"Yes, and in that very treaty Cromwell signed his name above
mine."

"Why did you sign yours so low down, sire? Cromwell found a
good place, and he took it; that was his custom. I return,
then, to M. Cromwell. You have a treaty with him, that is to
say, with England, since when you signed that treaty M.
Cromwell was England."

"M. Cromwell is dead."

"Do you think so, sire?"

"No doubt he is, since his son Richard has succeeded him,
and has abdicated."

"Yes, that is it exactly. Richard inherited after the death
of his father, and England at the abdication of Richard. The
treaty formed part of the inheritance, whether in the hands
of M. Richard or in the hands of England. The treaty is,
then, still as good, as valid as ever. Why should you evade
it, sire? What is changed? Charles wants to-day what we were
not willing to grant him ten years ago; but that was
foreseen and provided against. You are the ally of England,
sire, and not of Charles II. It was doubtless wrong, from a
family point of view, to sign a treaty with a man who had
cut off the head of the king your father's brother-in-law,
and to contract an alliance with a parliament which they
call yonder the Rump Parliament; it was unbecoming, I
acknowledge, but it was not unskillful from a political
point of view, since, thanks to that treaty, I saved your
majesty, then a minor, the trouble and danger of a foreign
war, which the Fronde -- you remember the Fronde sire?" --
the young king hung his head -- "which the Fronde might have
fatally complicated. And thus I prove to your majesty that
to change our plan now; without warning our allies, would be
at once unskillful and dishonest. We should make war with
the aggression on our side, we should make it, deserving to
have it made against us, and we should have the appearance
of fearing it whilst provoking it, for a permission granted
to five hundred men, to two hundred men, to fifty men, to
ten men, is still a permission. One Frenchman, that is the
nation; one uniform, that is the army. Suppose, sire, for
example, that, sooner or later, you should have war with
Holland, which, sooner or later, will certainly happen; or
with Spain, which will perhaps ensue if your marriage fails"
(Mazarin stole a furtive glance at the king), "and there are
a thousand causes that might yet make your marriage fail, --
well, would you approve of England's sending to the United
Provinces or to Spain a regiment, a company, a squadron
even, of English gentlemen? Would you think that they kept
within the limits of their treaty of alliance?"

Louis listened; it seemed so strange to him that Mazarin
should invoke good faith, and he the author of so many
political tricks, called Mazarinades. "And yet," said the
king, "without any manifest authorization, I cannot prevent
gentlemen of my states from passing over into England, if
such should be their good pleasure."

"You should compel them to return, sire, or at least protest
against their presence as enemies in an allied country."

"But come, my lord cardinal, you who are so profound a
genius, try if you cannot find means to assist this poor
king, without compromising ourselves."

"And that is exactly what I am not willing to do, my dear
sire," said Mazarin. "If England were to act exactly
according to my wishes, she could not act better than she
does; if I directed the policy of England from this place, I
should not direct it otherwise. Governed as she is governed,
England is an eternal nest of contention for all Europe.
Holland protects Charles II., let Holland do so; they will
quarrel, they will fight. They are the only two maritime
powers. Let them destroy each other's navies, we can
construct ours with the wrecks of their vessels; when we
shall save our money to buy nails."

"Oh, how paltry and mean is all this that you are telling
me, monsieur le cardinal!"

"Yes, but nevertheless it is true, sire; you must confess
that. Still further. Suppose I admit, for a moment, the
possibility of breaking your word, and evading the treaty --
such a thing sometimes happens, but that is when some great
interest is to be promoted by it, or when the treaty is
found to be too troublesome -- well, you will authorize the
engagement asked of you: France -- her banner, which is the
same thing -- will cross the Straits and will fight; France
will be conquered."

"Why so?"

"Ma foi! we have a pretty general to fight under this
Charles II.! Worcester gave us good proofs of that."

"But he will no longer have to deal with Cromwell,
monsieur."

"But he will have to deal with Monk, who is quite as
dangerous. The brave brewer of whom we are speaking was a
visionary; he had moments of exaltation, of inflation,
during which he ran over like an over-filled cask; and from
the chinks there always escaped some drops of his thoughts,
and by the sample the whole of his thought was to be made
out. Cromwell has thus allowed us more than ten times to
penetrate into his very soul, when one would have conceived
that soul to be enveloped in triple brass, as Horace has it.
But Monk! Oh, sire, God defend you from ever having anything
to transact politically with Monk. It is he who has given
me, in one year, all the gray hairs I have. Monk is no
fanatic; unfortunately he is a politician; he does not
overflow, he keeps close together. For ten years he has had
his eyes fixed upon one object, and nobody has yet been able
to ascertain what. Every morning, as Louis XI. advised, he
burns his nightcap. Therefore, on the day when this plan
slowly and solitarily ripened, shall break forth, it will
break forthwith all the conditions of success which always
accompany an unforeseen event. That is Monk, sire, of whom
perhaps, you have never heard -- of whom, perhaps, you did
not even know the name before your brother Charles II., who
knows what he is, pronounced it before you. He is a marvel
of depth and tenacity, the two only things against which
intelligence and ardor are blunted. Sire, I had ardor when I
was young, I always was intelligent. I may safely boast of
it, because I am reproached with it. I have done very well
with these two qualities, since, from the son of a fisherman
of Piscina, I have become prime minister to the king of
France; and in that position your majesty will perhaps
acknowledge I have rendered some service to the throne of
your majesty. Well, sire, if I had met with Monk on my way,
instead of Monsieur de Beaufort, Monsieur de Retz, or
Monsieur le Prince -- well, we should have been ruined. If
you engage yourself rashly, sire, you will fall into the
talons of this politic soldier. The casque of Monk, sire, is
an iron coffer, in the recesses of which he shuts up his
thoughts, and no one has the key of it. Therefore, near him,
or rather before him, I bow, sire, for I have nothing but a
velvet cap."

"What do you think Monk wishes to do, then?"

"Eh! sire, if I knew that, I would not tell you to mistrust
him, for I should be stronger than he; but with him, I am
afraid to guess -- to guess! -- you understand my word? --
for if I thought I had guessed, I should stop at an idea,
and, in spite of myself, should pursue that idea. Since that
man has been in power yonder, I am like one of the damned in
Dante whose neck Satan has twisted, and who walk forward
looking behind them. I am traveling towards Madrid, but I
never lose sight of London. To guess, with that devil of a
man, is to deceive one's self, and to deceive one's self is
to ruin one's self. God keep me from ever seeking to guess
what he aims at; I confine myself to watching what he does,
and that is well enough. Now I believe -- you observe the
meaning of the word I believe? -- I believe, with respect to
Monk, ties one to nothing -- I believe that he has a strong
inclination to succeed Cromwell. Your Charles II. has
already caused proposals to be made to him by ten persons;
he has satisfied himself with driving these ten meddlers
from his presence, without saying anything to them but,
`Begone, or I will have you hung.' That man is a sepulcher!
At this moment Monk is affecting devotion to the Rump
Parliament; of this devotion, observe, I am not the dupe.
Monk has no wish to be assassinated, -- an assassination
would stop him in the midst of his operations, and his work
must be accomplished; -- so I believe -- but do not believe,
what I believe, sire: for I say I believe from habit -- I
believe that Monk is keeping on friendly terms with the
parliament till the day comes for dispersing it. You are
asked for swords, but they are to fight against Monk. God
preserve you from fighting against Monk sire; for Monk would
beat us, and I should never console myself after being
beaten by Monk. I should say to myself, Monk has foreseen
that victory ten years. For God's sake, sire, out of
friendship for you, if not out of consideration for himself,
let Charles II. keep quiet. Your majesty will give him a
little income here; give him one of your chateaux. Yes, yes
-- wait awhile. But I forgot the treaty -- that famous
treaty of which we were just now speaking. Your majesty has
not even the right to give him a chateau."

"How is that?"

"Yes, yes, your majesty is bound not to grant hospitality to
King Charles, and to compel him to leave France even. It was
on this account we forced him to quit you, and yet here he
is again. Sire, I hope you will give your brother to
understand that he cannot remain with us; that it is
impossible he should be allowed to compromise us, or I
myself ---- "

"Enough, my lord," said Louis XIV, rising. "In refusing me a
million, perhaps you may be right; your millions are your
own. In refusing me two hundred gentlemen, you are still
further in the right; for you are prime minister, and you
have, in the eyes of France, the responsibility of peace and
war. But that you should pretend to prevent me, who am king,
from extending my hospitality to the grandson of Henry IV.,
to my cousin-german, to the companion of my childhood --
there your power stops, and there begins my will."

"Sire," said Mazarin, delighted at being let off so cheaply,
and who had, besides, only fought so earnestly to arrive at
that, -- "sire, I shall always bend before the will of my
king. Let my king, then, keep near him, or in one of his
chateaux, the king of England; let Mazarin know it, but let
not the minister know it."

"Good-night, my lord," said Louis XIV., "I go away in
despair."

"But convinced, and that is all I desire, sire," replied
Mazarin.

The king made no answer, and retired quite pensive,
convinced, not of all Mazarin had told him, but of one thing
which he took care not to mention to him; and that was, that
it was necessary for him to study seriously both his own
affairs and those of Europe, for he found them very
difficult and very obscure. Louis found the king of England
seated in the same place where he had left him. On
perceiving him, the English prince arose; but at the first
glance he saw discouragement written in dark letters upon
his cousin's brow. Then, speaking first, as if to facilitate
the painful avowal that Louis had to make to him, --

"Whatever it may be," said he, "I shall never forget all the
kindness, all the friendship you have exhibited towards me."

"Alas!" replied Louis, in a melancholy tone, "only barren
good-will, my brother."

Charles II. became extremely pale; he passed his cold hand
over his brow, and struggled for a few instants against a
faintness that made him tremble. "I understand," said he at
last; "no more hope!"

Louis seized the hand of Charles II. "Wait, my brother,"
said he; "precipitate nothing, everything may change; hasty
resolutions ruin all causes, add another year of trial, I
implore you, to the years you have already undergone. You
have, to induce you to act now rather than at another time,
neither occasion nor opportunity. Come with me, my brother;
I will give you one of my residences, whichever you prefer,
to inhabit. I, with you, will keep my eyes upon events; we
will prepare. Come, then, my brother, have courage!"

Charles II. withdrew his hand from that of the king, and
drawing back, to salute him with more ceremony, "With all my
heart, thanks!" replied he, "sire; but I have prayed without
success to the greatest king on earth; now I will go and ask
a miracle of God." And he went out without being willing to
hear any more, his head carried loftily, his hand trembling,
with a painful contraction of his noble countenance, and
that profound gloom which, finding no more hope in the world
of men, appeared to go beyond it, and ask it in worlds
unknown. The officer of musketeers, on seeing him pass by
thus pale, bowed almost to his knees as he saluted him. He
then took a flambeau, called two musketeers, and descended
the deserted staircase with the unfortunate king, holding in
his left hand his hat, the plume of which swept the steps.
Arrived at the door, the musketeer asked the king which way
he was going, that he might direct the musketeers.

"Monsieur," replied Charles II., in a subdued voice, "you
who have known my father, say, did you ever pray for him? If
you have done so, do not forget me in your prayers. Now, I
am going alone, and beg of you not to accompany me, or have
me accompanied any further."

The officer bowed and sent away the musketeers into the
interior of the palace. But he himself remained an instant
under the porch watching the departing Charles II., till he
was lost in the turn of the next street. "To him as to his
father formerly," murmured he, "Athos, if he were here,
would say with reason, -- `Salute fallen majesty!'" Then,
reascending the staircase: "Oh! the vile service that I
follow!" said he at every step. "Oh! my pitiful master! Life
thus carried on is no longer tolerable, and it is at length
time that I should do something! No more generosity, no more
energy! The master has succeeded, the pupil is starved
forever. Mordioux! I will not resist. Come, you men,"
continued he, entering the ante-chamber, "why are you all
looking at me so? Extinguish these torches and return to
your posts. Ah! you were guarding me? Yes, you watch over
me, do you not, worthy fellows? Brave fools! I am not the
Duc de Guise. Begone! They will not assassinate me in the
little passage. Besides," added he, in a low voice, "that
would be a resolution, and no resolutions have been formed
since Monsieur le Cardinal de Richelieu died. Now, with all
his faults, that was a man! It is settled: to-morrow I will
throw my cassock to the nettles."

Then, reflecting: "No," said he, "not yet! I have one great
trial to make and I will make it; but that, and I swear it,
shall be the last, Mordioux!"

He had not finished speaking when a voice issued from the
king's chamber. "Monsieur le lieutenant!" said this voice.

"Here am I," replied he.

"The king desires to speak to you."

"Humph!" said the lieutenant; "perhaps of what I was
thinking about." And he went into the king's apartment.




CHAPTER 12

The King and the Lieutenant



As soon as the king saw the officer enter, he dismissed his
valet de chambre and his gentleman. "Who is on duty
to-morrow, monsieur?" asked he.

The lieutenant bowed his head with military politeness and
replied, "I am, sire."

"What! still you?"

"Always I, sire."

"How can that be, monsieur?"

"Sire, when traveling, the musketeers supply all the posts
of your majesty's household; that is to say, yours, her
majesty the queen's, and monsieur le cardinal's, the latter
of whom borrows of the king the best part, or rather the
most numerous part, of the royal guard."

"But in the interims?"

"There are no interims, sire, but for twenty or thirty men
who rest out of a hundred and twenty. At the Louvre it is
very different, and if I were at the Louvre I should rely
upon my brigadier; but, when traveling, sire, no one knows
what may happen, and I prefer doing my duty myself."

"Then you are on guard every day?"

"And every night. Yes, sire."

"Monsieur, I cannot allow that -- I will have you rest."

"That is very kind, sire, but I will not."

"What do you say?" said the king who did not at first
comprehend the full meaning of this reply.

"I say, sire, that I will not expose myself to the chance of
a fault. If the devil had a trick to play on me, you
understand, sire, as he knows the man with whom he has to
deal, he would choose the moment when I should not be there.
My duty and the peace of my conscience before everything,
sire."

"But such duty will kill you, monsieur."

"Eh! sire, I have performed it for thirty years, and in all
France and Navarre there is not a man in better health than
I am. Moreover, I entreat you, sire, not to trouble yourself
about me. That would appear very strange to me, seeing that
I am not accustomed to it."

The king cut short the conversation by a fresh question.
"Shall you be here, then, to-morrow morning?"

"As at present? yes, sire."

The king walked several times up and down his chamber; it
was very plain that he burned with a desire to speak, but
that he was restrained by some fear or other. The
lieutenant, standing motionless, hat in hand, watched him
making these evolutions, and, whilst looking at him,
grumbled to himself, biting his mustache:

"He has not half a crown worth of resolution! Parole
d'honneur! I would lay a wager he does not speak at all!"

The king continued to walk about, casting from time to time
a side glance at the lieutenant. "He is the very image of
his father," continued the latter, in his secret soliloquy,
"he is at once proud, avaricious, and timid. The devil take
his master, say I."

The king stopped. "Lieutenant," said he.

"I am here, sire."

"Why did you cry out this evening, down below in the salons
-- `The king's service! His majesty's musketeers!'"

"Because you gave me the order, sire."

"I?"

"Yourself."

"Indeed, I did not say a word, monsieur."

"Sire, an order is given by a sign, by a gesture, by a
glance, as intelligibly, as freely, and as clearly as by
word of mouth. A servant who has nothing but ears is not
half a good servant."

"Your eyes are very penetrating, then, monsieur."

"How is that, sire?"

"Because they see what is not."

"My eyes are good, though, sire, although they have served
their master long and much: when they have anything to see,
they seldom miss the opportunity. Now, this evening, they
saw that your majesty colored with endeavoring to conceal
the inclination to yawn, that your majesty looked with
eloquent supplications, first at his eminence, and then at
her majesty, the queen-mother, and at length to the entrance
door, and they so thoroughly remarked all I have said, that
they saw your majesty's lips articulate these words: `Who
will get me out of this?'"

"Monsieur!"

"Or something to this effect, sire -- `My musketeers!' I
could then no longer hesitate. That look was for me -- the
order was for me. I cried out instantly, `His Majesty's
musketeers!' And, besides, that was shown to be true, sire,
not only by your majesty's not saying I was wrong, but
proving I was right by going out at once."

The king turned away to smile; then, after a few seconds, he
again fixed his limpid eye upon that countenance, so
intelligent, so bold, and so firm, that it might have been
said to be the proud and energetic profile of the eagle
facing the sun. "That is all very well," said he, after a
short silence, during which he endeavored, in vain, to make
his officer lower his eyes.

But seeing the king said no more, the latter pirouetted on
his heels, and took three steps towards the door, muttering,
"He will not speak! Mordioux! he will not speak!"

"Thank you, monsieur," said the king at last.

"Humph!" continued the lieutenant; "there was only wanting
that. Blamed for having been less of a fool than another
might have been." And he went to the door, allowing his
spurs to jingle in true military style. But when he was on
the threshold, feeling that the king's desire drew him back,
he returned.

"Has your majesty told me all?" asked he, in a tone we
cannot describe, but which, without appearing to solicit the
royal confidence, contained so much persuasive frankness,
that the king immediately replied:

"Yes, but draw near, monsieur."

"Now then," murmured the officer, "he is coming to it at
last."

"Listen to me."

"I shall not lose a word, sire."

"You will mount on horseback to-morrow, at about half-past
four in the morning, and you will have a horse saddled for
me."

"From your majesty's stables?"

"No, one of your musketeers' horses."

"Very well, sire. Is that all?"

"And you will accompany me."

"Alone?"

"Alone."

"Shall I come to seek your majesty, or shall I wait?"

"You will wait for me."

"Where, sire?"

"At the little park-gate."

The lieutenant bowed, understanding that the king had told
him all he had to say. In fact, the king dismissed him with
a gracious wave of the hand. The officer left the chamber of
the king, and returned to place himself philosophically in
his fauteuil, where, far from sleeping, as might have been
expected, considering how late it was, he began to reflect
more deeply than he had ever reflected before. The result of
these reflections was not so melancholy as the preceding
ones had been.

"Come, he has begun," said he. "Love urges him on, and he
goes forward -- he goes forward! The king is nobody in his
own palace; but the man perhaps may prove to be worth
something. Well, we shall see to-morrow morning. Oh! oh!"
cried he, all at once starting up, "that is a gigantic idea,
mordioux! and perhaps my fortune depends, at least, upon
that idea!" After this exclamation, the officer arose and
marched, with his hands in the pockets of his justacorps,
about the immense ante-chamber that served him as an
apartment. The wax-light flamed furiously under the effects
of a fresh breeze which stole in through the chinks of the
door and the window, and cut the salle diagonally. It threw
out a reddish, unequal light, sometimes brilliant, sometimes
dull, and the tall shadow of the lieutenant was seen
marching on the wall, in profile, like a figure by Callot,
with his long sword and feathered hat.

"Certainly!" said he, "I am mistaken if Mazarin is not
laying a snare for this amorous boy. Mazarin, this evening,
gave an address, and made an appointment as complacently as
M. Dangeau himself could have done -- I heard him, and I
know the meaning of his words. `To-morrow morning,' said he,
`they will pass opposite the bridge of Blois. Mordioux! that
is clear enough, and particularly for a lover. That is the
cause of this embarrassment; that is the cause of this
hesitation; that is the cause of this order -- `Monsieur the
lieutenant of my musketeers, be on horseback to-morrow at
four o'clock in the morning.' Which is as clear as if he had
said, -- `Monsieur the lieutenant of my musketeers,
to-morrow, at four, at the bridge of Blois -- do you
understand?' Here is a state secret, then, which I, humble
as I am, have in my possession, while it is in action. And
how do I get it? Because I have good eyes, as his majesty
just now said. They say he loves this little Italian doll
furiously. They say he threw himself at his mother's feet,
to beg her to allow him to marry her. They say the queen
went so far as to consult the court of Rome, whether such a
marriage, contracted against her will, would be valid. Oh,
if I were but twenty-five! If I had by my side those I no
longer have! If I did not despise the whole world most
profoundly, I would embroil Mazarin with the queen-mother,
France with Spain, and I would make a queen after my own
fashion. But let that pass." And the lieutenant snapped his
fingers in disdain.

"This miserable Italian -- this poor creature -- this sordid
wretch -- who has just refused the king of England a
million, would not perhaps give me a thousand pistoles for
the news I could carry him. Mordioux! I am falling into
second childhood -- I am becoming stupid indeed! The idea of
Mazarin giving anything! ha! ha! ha!" and he laughed in a
subdued voice.

"Well, let us go to sleep -- let us go to sleep; and the
sooner the better. My mind is wearied with my evening's
work, and will see things to-morrow more clearly than
to-day."

And upon this recommendation, made to himself, he folded his
cloak around him, looking with contempt upon his royal
neighbor. Five minutes after this he was asleep, with his
hands clenched and his lips apart, giving escape, not to his
secret, but to a sonorous sound, which rose and spread
freely beneath the majestic roof of the ante-chamber.




CHAPTER 13

Mary de Mancini



The sun had scarcely shed its first beams on the majestic
trees of the park and the lofty turrets of the castle, when
the young king, who had been awake more than two hours,
possessed by the sleeplessness of love, opened his shutters
himself, and cast an inquiring look into the courts of the
sleeping palace. He saw that it was the hour agreed upon:
the great court clock pointed to a quarter past four. He did
not disturb his valet de chambre, who was sleeping soundly
at some distance; he dressed himself, and the valet, in a
great fright sprang up, thinking he had been deficient in
his duty; but the king sent him back again, commanding him
to preserve the most absolute silence. He then descended the
little staircase, went out at a lateral door, and perceived
at the end of the wall a mounted horseman holding another
horse by the bridle. This horseman could not be recognized
in his cloak and slouched hat. As to the horse, saddled like
that of a rich citizen, it offered nothing remarkable to the
most experienced eye. Louis took the bridle: the officer
held the stirrup without dismounting, and asked his
majesty's orders in a low voice.

"Follow me," replied the king.

The officer put his horse to the trot, behind that of his
master, and they descended the hill towards the bridge. When
they reached the other side of the Loire, --

"Monsieur," said the king, "you will please to ride on till
you see a carriage coming; then return and inform me. I will
wait here."

"Will your majesty deign to give me some description of the
carriage I am charged to discover?"

"A carriage in which you will see two ladies, and probably
their attendants likewise."

"Sire, I should not wish to make a mistake; is there no
other sign by which I may know this carriage?"

"It will bear, in all probability, the arms of monsieur le
cardinal."

"That is sufficient, sire," replied the officer, fully
instructed in the object of his search. He put his horse to
the trot, and rode sharply on in the direction pointed out
by the king. But he had scarcely gone five hundred paces
when he saw four mules and then a carriage, loom up from
behind a little hill. Behind this carriage came another. It
required only one glance to assure him that these were the
equipages he was in search of; he therefore turned his
bridle, and rode back to the king.

"Sire," said he, "here are the carriages. The first, as you
said, contains two ladies with their femmes de chambre; the
second contains the footmen, provisions, and necessaries."

"That is well," replied the king in an agitated voice.
"Please to go and tell those ladies that a cavalier of the
court wishes to pay his respects to them alone."

The officer set off at a gallop. "Mordioux!" said he, as he
rode on, "here is a new and an honorable employment, I hope!
I complained of being nobody. I am the king's confidant:
that is enough to make a musketeer burst with pride."

He approached the carriage, and delivered his message
gallantly and intelligently. There were two ladies in the
carriage: one of great beauty, although rather thin; the
other less favored by nature, but lively, graceful, and
uniting in the delicate lines of her brow all the signs of a
strong will. Her eyes, animated and piercing in particular,
spoke more eloquently than all the amorous phrases in
fashion in those days of gallantry. It was to her D'Artagnan
addressed himself, without fear of being mistaken, although
the other was, as we have said, the more handsome of the
two.

"Madame," said he, "I am the lieutenant of the musketeers,
and there is on the road a horseman who awaits you, and is
desirous of paying his respects to you."

At these words, the effect of which he watched closely, the
lady with the black eyes uttered a cry of joy, leant out of
the carriage window, and seeing the cavalier approaching,
held out her arms, exclaiming:

"Ah, my dear sire!" and the tears gushed from her eyes.

The coachman stopped his team; the women rose in confusion
from the back of the carriage, and the second lady made a
slight curtsey, terminated by the most ironical smile that
jealousy ever imparted to the lips of woman.

"Marie? dear Marie?" cried the king, taking the hand of the
black-eyed lady in both his. And opening the heavy door
himself, he drew her out of the carriage with so much ardor,
that she was in his arms before she touched the ground. The
lieutenant, posted on the other side of the carriage, saw
and heard all without being observed.

The king offered his arm to Mademoiselle de Mancini, and
made a sign to the coachman and lackeys to proceed. It was
nearly six o'clock; the road was fresh and pleasant; tall
trees with their foliage still inclosed in the golden down
of their buds let the dew of morning filter from their
trembling branches like liquid diamonds; the grass was
bursting at the foot of the hedges; the swallows, having
returned since only a few days, described their graceful
curves between the heavens and the water; a breeze, laden
with the perfumes of the blossoming woods, sighed along the
road, and wrinkled the surface of the waters of the river;
all these beauties of the day, all these perfumes of the
plants, all these aspirations of the earth towards heaven,
intoxicated the two lovers, walking side by side, leaning
upon each other, eyes fixed upon eyes, hand clasping hand,
and who, lingering as by a common desire, did not dare to
speak they had so much to say.

The officer saw that the king's horse, in wandering this way
and that, annoyed Mademoiselle de Mancini. He took advantage
of the pretext of securing the horse to draw near them, and
dismounting, walked between the two horses he led; he did
not lose a single word or gesture of the lovers. It was
Mademoiselle de Mancini who at length began.

"Ah, my dear sire!" said she, "you do not abandon me, then?"

"No, Marie," replied the king; "you see I do not."

"I had so often been told, though, that as soon as we should
be separated you would no longer think of me."

"Dear Marie, is it then to-day only that you have discovered
we are surrounded by people interested in deceiving us?"

"But, then, sire, this journey, this alliance with Spain?
They are going to marry you off!"

Louis hung his head. At the same time the officer could see
the eyes of Marie de Mancini shine in the sun with the
brilliancy of a dagger starting from its sheath. "And you
have done nothing in favor of our love?" asked the girl,
after a silence of a moment.

"Ah! mademoiselle, how could you believe that? I threw
myself at the feet of my mother; I begged her, I implored
her; I told her all my hopes of happiness were in you, I
even threatened ---- "

"Well?" asked Marie, eagerly.

"Well? the queen-mother wrote to the court of Rome, and
received as answer, that a marriage between us would have no
validity, and would be dissolved by the holy father. At
length, finding there was no hope for us, I requested to
have my marriage with the infanta at least delayed."

"And yet that does not prevent your being on the road to
meet her?"

"How can I help it? To my prayers, to my supplications, to
my tears, I received no answer but reasons of state."

"Well, well?"

"Well, what is to be done, mademoiselle, when so many wills
are leagued against me?"

It was now Marie's turn to hang her head. "Then I must bid
you adieu for ever," said she. "You know that I am being
exiled; you know that I am going to be buried alive; you
know still more that they want to marry me off, too."

Louis became very pale, and placed his hand upon his heart.

"If I had thought that my life only had, been at stake, I
have been so persecuted that I might have yielded; but I
thought yours was concerned, my dear sire, and I stood out
for the sake of preserving your happiness. "

"Oh, yes! my happiness, my treasure!" murmured the king,
more gallantly than passionately, perhaps.

"The cardinal might have yielded," said Marie, "if you had
addressed yourself to him, if you had pressed him. For the
cardinal to call the king of France his nephew! do you not
perceive, sire? He would have made war even for that honor;
the cardinal, assured of governing alone, under the double
pretext of having brought up the king and given his niece to
him in marriage -- the cardinal would have fought all
antagonists, overcome all obstacles. Oh, sire! I can answer
for that. I am a woman, and I see clearly into everything
where love is concerned."

These words produced a strange effect upon the king. Instead
of heightening his passion, they cooled it. He stopped, and
said hastily, --

"What is to be said, mademoiselle? Everything has failed."

"Except your will, I trust, my dear sire?"

"Alas!" said the king, coloring, "have I a will?"

"Oh!" said Mademoiselle de Mancini mournfully, wounded by
that expression.

"The king has no will but that which policy dictates, but
that which reasons of state impose upon him."

"Oh! it is because you have no love," cried Mary; "if you
loved, sire, you would have a will."

On pronouncing these words, Mary raised her eyes to her
lover, whom she saw more pale and more cast down than an
exile who is about to quit his native land forever. "Accuse
me," murmured the king, "but do not say I do not love you."

A long silence followed these words, which the young king
had pronounced with a perfectly true and profound feeling.
"I am unable to think that to-morrow, and after to-morrow, I
shall see you no more; I cannot think that I am going to end
my sad days at a distance from Paris; that the lips of an
old man, of an unknown, should touch that hand which you
hold within yours; no, in truth, I cannot think of all that,
my dear sire, without having my poor heart burst with
despair."

And Marie de Mancini did shed floods of tears. On his part,
the king, much affected, carried his handkerchief to his
mouth, and stifled a sob.

"See," said she, "the carriages have stopped, my sister
waits for me, the time is come; what you are about to decide
upon will be decided for life. Oh, sire! you are willing,
then, that I should lose you? You are willing, then, Louis,
that she to whom you have said `I love you,' should belong
to another than to her king; to her master, to her lover?
Oh! courage, Louis! courage! One word, a single word! Say `I
will!' and all my life is enchained to yours, and all my
heart is yours forever."

The king made no reply. Mary then looked at him as Dido
looked at AEneas in the Elysian fields, fierce and
disdainful.

"Farewell, then," said she; "farewell life! love! heaven!"

And she took a step away. The king detained her, seized her
hand, which he pressed to his lips, and despair prevailing
over the resolution he appeared to have inwardly formed, he
let fall upon that beautiful hand a burning tear of regret,
which made Mary start, so really had that tear burnt her.
She saw the humid eyes of the king, his pale brow, his
convulsed lips, and cried, with an accent that cannot be
described, --

"Oh, sire! you are a king, you weep, and yet I depart!"

As his sole reply, the king hid his face in his
handkerchief. The officer uttered something so like a roar
that it frightened the horses. Mademoiselle de Mancini,
quite indignant, quitted the king's arm, hastily entered the
carriage, crying to the coachman, "Go on, go on, and quick!"

The coachman obeyed, flogged his mules, and the heavy
carriage rocked upon its creaking axle, whilst the king of
France, alone, cast down, annihilated, did not dare to look
either behind or before him.




CHAPTER 14

In which the King and the Lieutenant each give Proofs of Memory



When the king, like all the people in the world who are in
love, had long and attentively watched disappear in the
distance the carriage which bore away his mistress; when he
had turned and turned again a hundred times to the same side
and had at length succeeded in somewhat calming the
agitation of his heart and thoughts, he recollected that he
was not alone. The officer still held the horse by the
bridle, and had not lost all hope of seeing the king recover
his resolution. He had still the resource of mounting and
riding after the carriage; they would have lost nothing by
waiting a little. But the imagination of the lieutenant of
the musketeers was too rich and too brilliant; it left far
behind it that of the king, who took care not to allow
himself to be carried away to any such excess. He contented
himself with approaching the officer, and in a doleful
voice, "Come," said he, "let us be gone; all is ended. To
horse!"

The officer imitated this carriage, this slowness, this
sadness, and leisurely mounted his horse. The king pushed on
sharply, the lieutenant followed him. At the bridge Louis
turned around for the last time. The lieutenant, patient as
a god who has eternity behind and before him, still hoped
for a return of energy. But it was groundless, nothing
appeared. Louis gained the street which led to the castle,
and entered as seven was striking. When the king had
returned, and the musketeer, who saw everything, had seen a
corner of the tapestry over the cardinal's window lifted up,
he breathed a profound sigh, like a man unloosed from the
tightest bounds, and said in a low voice:

"Now, then, my officer, I hope that it is over."

The king summoned his gentleman. "Please to understand I
shall receive nobody before two o'clock," said he.

"Sire," replied the gentleman, "there is, however, some one
who requests admittance."

"Who is that?"

"Your lieutenant of musketeers."

"He who accompanied me?"

"Yes, sire."

"Ah," said the king, "let him come in."

The officer entered. The king made a sign, and the gentleman
and the valet retired. Louis followed them with his eyes
until they had shut the door, and when the tapestries had
fallen behind them, -- "You remind me by your presence,
monsieur, of something I had forgotten to recommend to you,
that is to say, the most absolute discretion."

"Oh! sire, why does your majesty give yourself the trouble
of making me such a recommendation? It is plain you do not
know me."

"Yes, monsieur, that is true. I know that you are discreet;
but as I had prescribed nothing ---- "

The officer bowed. "Has your majesty nothing else to say to
me?"

"No, monsieur; you may retire."

"Shall I obtain permission not to do so till I have spoken
to the king, sire?"

"What have you to say to me? Explain yourself, monsieur."

"Sire, a thing without importance to you, but which
interests me greatly. Pardon me, then, for speaking of it.
Without urgency, without necessity, I never would have done
it, and I would have disappeared, mute and insignificant as
I always have been."

"How! Disappeared! I do not understand you, monsieur."

"Sire, in a word," said the officer, "I am come to ask for
my discharge from your majesty's service."

The king made a movement of surprise, but the officer
remained as motionless as a statue.

"Your discharge -- yours, monsieur? and for how long a time,
I pray?"

"Why, forever, sire."

"What, you are desirous of quitting my service, monsieur?"
said Louis, with an expression that revealed something more
than surprise.

"Sire, I regret to say that I am."

"Impossible!"

"It is so, however, sire. I am getting old; I have worn
harness now thirty-five years; my poor shoulders are tired;
I feel that I must give place to the young. I don't belong
to this age; I have still one foot in the old one; it
results that everything is strange in my eyes, everything
astonishes and bewilders me. In short, I have the honor to
ask your majesty for my discharge."

"Monsieur," said the king, looking at the officer, who wore
his uniform with an ease that would have caused envy in a
young man, "you are stronger and more vigorous than I am."

"Oh!" replied the officer, with an air of false modesty,
"your majesty says so because I still have a good eye and a
tolerably firm foot -- because I can still ride a horse, and
my mustache is black; but, sire, vanity of vanities all that
-- illusions all that -- appearance, smoke, sire! I have
still a youthful air, it is true, but I feel old, and within
six months I am certain I shall be broken down, gouty,
impotent. Therefore, then sire ---- "

"Monsieur," interrupted the king, "remember your words of
yesterday. You said to me in this very place where you now
are, that you were endowed with the best health of any man
in France; that fatigue was unknown to you! that you did not
mind spending whole days and nights at your post. Did you
tell me that, monsieur, or not? Try and recall, monsieur."

The officer sighed. "Sire," said he, "old age is boastful;
and it is pardonable for old men to praise themselves when
others no longer do it. It is very possible I said that; but
the fact is, sire, I am very much fatigued, and request
permission to retire."

"Monsieur," said the king, advancing towards the officer
with a gesture full of majesty, "you are not assigning me
the true reason. You wish to quit my service, it may be
true, but you disguise from me the motive of your retreat."

"Sire, believe that ---- "

"I believe what I see, monsieur; I see a vigorous, energetic
man, full of presence of mind, the best soldier in France,
perhaps; and this personage cannot persuade me the least in
the world that you stand in need of rest."

"Ah! sire," said the lieutenant, with bitterness, "what
praise! Indeed, your majesty confounds me! Energetic,
vigorous, brave, intelligent, the best soldier in the army!
But, sire, your majesty exaggerates my small portion of
merit to such a point, that however good an opinion I may
have of myself, I do not recognize myself; in truth I do
not. If I were vain enough to believe only half of your
majesty's words, I should consider myself a valuable,
indispensable man. I should say that a servant possessed of
such brilliant qualities was a treasure beyond all price.
Now, sire, I have been all my life -- I feel bound to say it
-- except at the present time, appreciated, in my opinion,
much below my value. I therefore repeat, your majesty
exaggerates."

The king knitted his brow, for he saw a bitter raillery
beneath the words of the officer. "Come, monsieur," said he,
"let us meet the question frankly. Are you dissatisfied with
my service, say? No evasions; speak boldly, frankly -- I
command you to do so."

The officer, who had been twisting his hat about in his
hands, with an embarrassed air, for several minutes, raised
his head at these words. "Oh! sire," said he, "that puts me
a little more at my ease. To a question put so frankly, I
will reply frankly. To tell the truth is a good thing, as
much from the pleasure one feels in relieving one's heart,
as on account of the rarity of the fact. I will speak the
truth, then, to my king, at the same time imploring him to
excuse the frankness of an old soldier."

Louis looked at his officer with anxiety, which he
manifested by the agitation of his gesture. "Well, then
speak," said he, "for I am impatient to hear the truths you
have to tell me."

The officer threw his hat upon a table, and his countenance,
always so intelligent and martial, assumed, all at once, a
strange character of grandeur and solemnity. "Sire," said
he, "I quit the king's service because I am dissatisfied.
The valet, in these times, can approach his master as
respectfully as I do, can give him an account of his labor,
bring back his tools, return the funds that have been
intrusted to him, and say, `Master, my day's work is done.
Pay me, if you please, and let us part.'"

"Monsieur! monsieur!" exclaimed the king, crimson with rage.

"Ah! sire," replied the officer, bending his knee for a
moment, "never was servant more respectful than I am before
your majesty; only you commanded me to tell the truth. Now I
have begun to tell it, it must come out, even if you command
me to hold my tongue."

There was so much resolution expressed in the deep-sunk
muscles of the officer's countenance, that Louis XIV. had no
occasion to tell him to continue; he continued, therefore,
whilst the king looked at him with a curiosity mingled with
admiration.

"Sire, I have, as I have said, now served the house of
France thirty-five years; few people have worn out so many
swords in that service as I have, and the swords I speak of
were good swords, too, sire. I was a boy, ignorant of
everything except courage, when the king your father guessed
that there was a man in me. I was a man, sire, when the
Cardinal de Richelieu, who was a judge of manhood,
discovered an enemy in me. Sire, the history of that enmity
between the ant and the lion may be read from the first to
the last line, in the secret archives of your family. If
ever you feel an inclination to know it, do so, sire; the
history is worth the trouble -- it is I who tell you so. You
will there read that the lion, fatigued, harassed, out of
breath, at length cried for quarter, and the justice must be
rendered him to say that he gave as much as he required. Oh!
those were glorious times, sire, strewed over with battles
like one of Tasso's or Ariosto's epics. The wonders of those
times, to which the people of ours would refuse belief, were
every-day occurrences. For five years together, I was a hero
every day; at least, so I was told by persons of judgment;
and that is a long period for heroism, trust me, sire, a
period of five years. Nevertheless, I have faith in what
these people told me, for they were good judges. They were
named M. de Richelieu, M. de Buckingham, M. de Beaufort, M.
de Retz, a mighty genius himself in street warfare, -- in
short, the king, Louis XIII., and even the queen, your noble
mother, who one day condescended to say, `Thank you.' I
don't know what service I had had the good fortune to render
her. Pardon me, sire, for speaking so boldly; but what I
relate to you, as I have already had the honor to tell your
majesty, is history."

The king bit his lips, and threw himself violently on a
chair.

"I appear importunate to your majesty," said the lieutenant.
"Eh! sire, that is the fate of truth; she is a stern
companion; she bristles all over with steel; she wounds
those whom she attacks, and sometimes him who speaks her."

"No, monsieur," replied the king; "I bade you speak -- speak
then."

"After the service of the king and the cardinal came the
service of the regency, sire; I fought pretty well in the
Fronde -- much less, though, than the first time. The men
began to diminish in stature. I have, nevertheless, led your
majesty's musketeers on some perilous occasions, which stand
upon the orders of the day of the company. Mine was a
beautiful luck at that time. I was the favorite of M. de
Mazarin. Lieutenant here! lieutenant there! lieutenant to
the right! lieutenant to the left! There was not a buffet
dealt in France, of which your humble servant did not have
the dealing; but soon France was not enough. The cardinal
sent me to England on Cromwell's account; another gentleman
who was not over gentle, I assure you, sire. I had the honor
of knowing him, and I was well able to appreciate him. A
great deal was promised me on account of that mission. So,
as I did much more than I had been bidden to do, I was
generously paid, for I was at length appointed captain of
the musketeers, that is to say, the most envied position in
court, which takes precedence over the marshals of France,
and justly, for who says captain of the musketeers says the
flower of chivalry and king of the brave."

"Captain, monsieur!" interrupted the king, "you make a
mistake. Lieutenant, you mean."

"Not at all, sire -- I make no mistake; your majesty may
rely upon me in that respect. Monsieur le cardinal gave me
the commission himself."

"Well!"

"But M. de Mazarin, as you know better than anybody, does
not often give, and sometimes takes back what he has given;
he took it back again as soon as peace was made and he was
no longer in want of me. Certainly I was not worthy to
replace M. de Treville, of illustrious memory; but they had
promised me, and they had given me; they ought to have
stopped there."

"Is that what dissatisfies you, monsieur? Well I shall make
inquiries. I love justice; and your claim, though made in
military fashion, does not displease me."

"Oh, sire!" said the officer, "your majesty has ill
understood me; I no longer claim anything now."

"Excess of delicacy, monsieur; but I will keep my eye upon
your affairs, and later ---- "

"Oh, sire! what a word! -- later! Thirty years have I lived
upon that promising word, which has been pronounced by so
many great personages, and which your mouth has, in its
turn, just pronounced. Later -- that is how I have received
a score of wounds, and how I have reached fifty-four years
of age without ever having had a louis in my purse, and
without ever having met with a protector on my way, -- I who
have protected so many people! So I change my formula, sire;
and when any one says to me `Later,' I reply `Now.' It is
rest that I solicit, sire. That may be easily granted me.
That will cost nobody anything."

"I did not look for this language, monsieur, particularly
from a man who has always lived among the great. You forget
you are speaking to the king, to a gentleman who is, I
suppose, of as good a house as yourself; and when I say
later, I mean a certainty."

"I do not at all doubt it, sire, but this is the end of the
terrible truth I had to tell you. If I were to see upon that
table a marshal's stick, the sword of constable, the crown
of Poland, instead of later, I swear to you, sire, that I
should still say Now! Oh, excuse me, sire! I am from the
country of your grandfather, Henry IV. I do not speak often;
but when I do speak, I speak all."

"The future of my reign has little temptation for you,
monsieur, it appears," said Louis, haughtily.

"Forgetfulness, forgetfulness everywhere!" cried the
officer, with a noble air; "the master has forgotten the
servant, so that the servant is reduced to forget his
master. I live in unfortunate times, sire. I see youth full
of discouragement and fear, I see it timid and despoiled,
when it ought to be rich and powerful. I yesterday evening,
for example, open the door to a king of England, whose
father, humble as I am, I was near saving, if God had not
been against me -- God, who inspired His elect, Cromwell! I
open, I said, the door, that is to say, the palace of one
brother to another brother, and I see -- stop, sire, that is
a load on my heart! -- I see the minister of that king drive
away the proscribed prince, and humiliate his master by
condemning to want another king, his equal. Then I see my
prince, who is young, handsome, and brave, who has courage
in his heart, and lightning in his eye, -- I see him tremble
before a priest, who laughs at him behind the curtain of his
alcove, where he digests all the gold of France, which he
afterwards stuffs into secret coffers. Yes -- I understand
your looks, sire. I am bold to madness; but what is to be
said? I am an old man, and I tell you here, sire, to you, my
king, things which I would cram down the throat of any one
who should dare to pronounce them before me. You have
commanded me to pour out the bottom of my heart before you,
sire, and I cast at the feet of your majesty the pent-up
indignation of thirty years, as I would pour out all my
blood, if your majesty commanded me to do so."

The king, without speaking a word, wiped the drops of cold
and abundant perspiration which trickled from his temples.
The moment of silence which followed this vehement outbreak
represented for him who had spoken, and for him who had
listened, ages of suffering.

"Monsieur," said the king at length, "you spoke the word
forgetfulness. I have heard nothing but that word; I will
reply, then, to it alone. Others have perhaps been able to
forget, but I have not, and the proof is, that I remember
that one day of riot, that one day when the furious people,
raging and roaring as the sea, invaded the royal palace;
that one day when I feigned sleep in my bed, one man alone,
naked sword in hand, concealed behind my curtain, watched
over my life, ready to risk his own for me, as he had before
risked it twenty times for the lives of my family. Was not
the gentleman, whose name I then demanded, called M.
d'Artagnan? say, monsieur."

"Your majesty has a good memory," replied the officer,
coldly.

"You see, then," continued the king, "if I have such
remembrances of my childhood, what an amount I may gather in
the age of reason."

"Your majesty has been richly endowed by God," said the
officer, in the same tone.

"Come, Monsieur d'Artagnan," continued Louis, with feverish
agitation, "ought you not to be as patient as I am? Ought
you not to do as I do? Come!"

"And what do you do, sire?"

"I wait."

"Your majesty may do so, because you are young; but I, sire,
have not time to wait; old age is at my door, and death is
behind it, looking into the very depths of my house. Your
majesty is beginning life, its future is full of hope and
fortune; but I, sire, I am on the other side of the horizon,
and we are so far from each other, that I should never have
time to wait till your majesty came up to me."

Louis made another turn in his apartment, still wiping the
moisture from his brow, in a manner that would have
terrified his physicians, if his physicians had witnessed
the state his majesty was in.

"It is very well, monsieur," said Louis XIV., in a sharp
voice; "you are desirous of having your discharge, and you
shall have it. You offer me your resignation of the rank of
lieutenant of the musketeers?"

"I deposit it humbly at your majesty's feet, sire."

"That is sufficient. I will order your pension."

"I shall have a thousand obligations to your majesty."

"Monsieur," said the king, with a violent effort, "I think
you are losing a good master."

"And I am sure of it, sire."

"Shall you ever find such another?"

"Oh, sire! I know that your majesty is alone in the world;
therefore will I never again take service with any king upon
earth, and will never again have other master than myself."

"You say so?"

"I swear so, your majesty."

"I shall remember that word, monsieur."

D'Artagnan bowed.

"And you know I have a good memory," said the king.

"Yes, sire, and yet I should desire that that memory should
fail your majesty in this instance, in order that you might
forget all the miseries I have been forced to spread before
your eyes. Your majesty is so much above the poor and the
mean that I hope ---- "

"My majesty, monsieur, will act like the sun, which looks
upon all, great and small, rich and poor, giving luster to
some, warmth to others, and life to all. Adieu Monsieur
d'Artagnan -- adieu: you are free."

And the king, with a hoarse sob, which was lost in his
throat, passed quickly into the next room. D'Artagnan took
up his hat from the table upon which he had thrown it, and
went out.




CHAPTER 15

The Proscribed



D'Artagnan had not reached the bottom of the staircase, when
the king called his gentleman. "I have a commission to give
you, monsieur," said he.

"I am at your majesty's commands."

"Wait, then." And the young king began to write the
following letter, which cost him more than one sigh,
although, at the same time, something like a feeling of
triumph glittered in his eyes:



"My Lord Cardinal, -- Thanks to your good counsels and,
above all, thanks to your firmness, I have succeeded in
overcoming a weakness unworthy of a king. You have too ably
arranged my destiny to allow gratitude not to stop me at the
moment when I was about to destroy your work. I felt I was
wrong to wish to make my life turn from the course you had
marked out for it. Certainly it would have been a misfortune
to France and my family if a misunderstanding had taken
place between me and my minister. This, however, would
certainly have happened if I had made your niece my wife. I
am perfectly aware of this, and will henceforth oppose
nothing to the accomplishment of my destiny. I am prepared,
then, to wed the infanta, Maria Theresa. You may at once
open the conference. -- Your affectionate Louis."



The king, after reperusing the letter, sealed it himself.
"This letter for my lord cardinal," said he.

The gentleman took it. At Mazarin's door he found Bernouin
waiting with anxiety.

"Well?" asked the minister's valet de chambre.

"Monsieur," said the gentleman, "here is a letter for his
eminence."

"A letter! Ah! we expected one after the little journey of
the morning."

"Oh! you know, then, that his majesty ---- "

"As first minister, it belongs to the duties of our charge
to know everything. And his majesty prays and implores, I
presume."

"I don't know, but he sighed frequently whilst he was
writing."

"'Yes, yes, yes; we understand all that; people sigh
sometimes from happiness as well as from grief, monsieur."

"And yet the king did not look very happy when he returned,
monsieur."

"You did not see clearly. Besides, you only saw his majesty
on his return, for he was only accompanied by the lieutenant
of the guards. But I had his eminence's telescope, I looked
through it when he was tired, and I am sure they both wept."

"Well! was it for happiness they wept?"

"No, but for love, and they vowed to each other a thousand
tendernesses, which the king asks no better than to keep.
Now this letter is a beginning of the execution."

"And what does his eminence think of this love, which is, by
the bye, no secret to anybody?"

Bernouin took the gentleman by the arm, and whilst ascending
the staircase, -- "In confidence," said he, in a low voice,
"his eminence looks for success in the affair. I know very
well we shall have war with Spain; but, bah! war will please
the nobles. My lord cardinal, besides, can endow his niece
royally, nay, more than royally. There will be money,
festivities, and fireworks -- everybody will be delighted."

"Well, for my part," replied the gentleman, shaking his
head, "it appears to me that this letter is very light to
contain all that."

"My friend," replied Bernouin, "I am certain of what I tell
you. M. d'Artagnan related all that passed to me."

"Ay, ay! and what did he tell you? Let us hear."

"I accosted him by asking him, on the part of the cardinal,
if there were any news, without discovering my designs,
observe, for M. d'Artagnan is a cunning hand. `My dear
Monsieur Bernouin,' he replied, `the king is madly in love
with Mademoiselle de Mancini, that is all I have to tell
you.' And then I asked him `Do you think, to such a degree
that it will urge him to act contrary to the designs of his
eminence?' `Ah! don't ask me,' said he; `I think the king
capable of anything; he has a will of iron, and what he
wills he wills in earnest. If he takes it into his head to
marry Mademoiselle de Mancini, he will marry her, depend
upon it.' And thereupon he left me and went straight to the
stables, took a horse, saddled it himself, jumped upon its
back, and set off as if the devil were at his heels."

"So that you believe, then ---- "

"I believe that monsieur the lieutenant of the guards knew
more than he was willing to say."

"In your opinion, then, M. d'Artagnan ---- "

"Is gone, according to all probability, after the exiles, to
carry out all that can facilitate the success of the king's
love."

Chatting thus, the two confidants arrived at the door of his
eminence's apartment. His eminence's gout had left him; he
was walking about his chamber in a state of great anxiety,
listening at doors and looking out of windows. Bernouin
entered, followed by the gentleman, who had orders from the
king to place the letter in the hands of the cardinal
himself. Mazarin took the letter, but before opening it, he
got up a ready smile, a smile of circumstance, able to throw
a veil over emotions of whatever sort they might be. So
prepared, whatever was the impression received from the
letter, no reflection of that impression was allowed to
transpire upon his countenance.

"Well," said he, when he had read and reread the letter,
"very well, monsieur. Inform the king that I thank him for
his obedience to the wishes of the queen-mother, and that I
will do everything for the accomplishment of his will."

The gentlemen left the room. The door had scarcely closed
before the cardinal, who had no mask for Bernouin, took off
that which had so recently covered his face, and with a most
dismal expression, -- "Call M. de Brienne," said he. Five
minutes afterward the secretary entered.

"Monsieur," said Mazarin, "I have just rendered a great
service to the monarchy, the greatest I have ever rendered
it. You will carry this letter, which proves it, to her
majesty the queen-mother, and when she shall have returned
it to you, you will lodge it in portfolio B., which is
filled with documents and papers relative to my ministry."

Brienne went as desired, and, as the letter was unsealed,
did not fail to read it on his way. There is likewise no
doubt that Bernouin, who was on good terms with everybody,
approached so near to the secretary as to be able to read
the letter over his shoulder; so that the news spread with
such activity through the castle, that Mazarin might have
feared it would reach the ears of the queen-mother before M.
de Brienne could convey Louis XIV.'s letter to her. A moment
after orders were given for departure, and M. de Conde
having been to pay his respects to the king on his pretended
rising, inscribed the city of Poitiers upon his tablets, as
the place of sojourn and rest for their majesties.

Thus in a few instants was unraveled an intrigue which had
covertly occupied all the diplomacies of Europe. It had
nothing, however, very clear as a result, but to make a poor
lieutenant of musketeers lose his commission and his
fortune. It is true, that in exchange he gained his liberty.
We shall soon know how M. d'Artagnan profited by this. For
the moment, if the reader will permit us, we shall return to
the hostelry of les Medici, of which one of the windows
opened at the very moment the orders were given for the
departure of the king.

The window that opened was that of one of the rooms of
Charles II. The unfortunate prince had passed the night in
bitter reflections, his head resting on his hands, and his
elbows on the table, whilst Parry, infirm and old, wearied
in body and in mind, had fallen asleep in a corner. A
singular fortune was that of this faithful servant, who saw
beginning for the second generation the fearful series of
misfortunes which had weighed so heavily on the first. When
Charles II. had well thought over the fresh defeat he had
experienced, when he perfectly comprehended the complete
isolation into which he had just fallen, on seeing his fresh
hope left behind him, he was seized as with a vertigo, and
sank back in the large armchair in which he was seated. Then
God took pity on the unhappy prince, and sent to console him
sleep, the innocent brother of death. He did not wake till
half-past six, that is to say, till the sun shone brightly
into his chamber, and Parry, motionless with fear of waking
him, was observing with profound grief the eyes of the young
man already red with wakefulness, and his cheeks pale with
suffering and privations.

At length the noise of some heavy carts descending towards
the Loire awakened Charles. He arose, looked around him like
a man who has forgotten everything, perceived Parry, shook
him by the hand, and commanded him to settle the reckoning
with Master Cropole. Master Cropole, being called upon to
settle his account with Parry, acquitted himself, it must be
allowed, like an honest man; he only made his customary
remark, that the two travelers had eaten nothing, which had
the double disadvantage of being humiliating for his
kitchen, and of forcing him to ask payment for a repast not
consumed, but not the less lost. Parry had nothing to say to
the contrary, and paid.

"I hope," said the king, "it has not been the same with the
horses. I don't see that they have eaten at your expense,
and it would be a misfortune for travelers like us, who have
a long journey to make, to have our horses fail us."

But Cropole, at this doubt, assumed his majestic air, and
replied that the stables of les Medici were not less
hospitable than its refectory.

The king mounted his horse; his old servant did the same,
and both set out towards Paris, without meeting a single
person on their road, in the streets or the faubourgs of the
city. For the prince the blow was the more severe, as it was
a fresh exile. The unfortunates cling to the smallest hopes,
as the happy do to the greatest good; and when they are
obliged to quit the place where that hope has soothed their
hearts, they experience the mortal regret which the banished
man feels when he places his foot upon the vessel which is
to bear him into exile. It appears that the heart already
wounded so many times suffers from the least scratch; it
appears that it considers as a good the momentary absence of
evil, which is nothing but the absence of pain; and that
God, into the most terrible misfortunes, has thrown hope as
the drop of water which the rich bad man in hell entreated
of Lazarus.

For one instant even the hope of Charles II. had been more
than a fugitive joy; -- that was when he found himself so
kindly welcomed by his brother king; then it had taken a
form that had become a reality; then, all at once, the
refusal of Mazarin had reduced the fictitious reality to the
state of a dream. This promise of Louis XIV., so soon
retracted, had been nothing but a mockery; a mockery like
his crown -- like his scepter -- like his friends -- like
all that had surrounded his royal childhood, and which had
abandoned his proscribed youth. Mockery! everything was a
mockery for Charles II. except the cold, black repose
promised by death.

Such were the ideas of the unfortunate prince while sitting
listlessly upon his horse, to which he abandoned the reins;
he rode slowly along beneath the warm May sun, in which the
somber misanthropy of the exile perceived a last insult to
his grief.




CHAPTER 16

"Remember!"



A horseman was going rapidly along the road leading towards
Blois, which he had left nearly half an hour before, passed
the two travelers, and, though apparently in haste, raised
his hat as he passed them. The king scarcely observed this
young man, who was about twenty-five years of age, and who,
turning round several times, made friendly signals to a man
standing before the gate of a handsome white-and-red house;
that is to say, built of brick and stone, with a slated
roof, situated on the left hand of the road the prince was
traveling.

This man, old, tall, and thin, with white hair, -- we speak
of the one standing by the gate; -- this man replied to the
farewell signals of the young one by signs of parting as
tender as could have been made by a father, The young man
disappeared at the first turn of the road, bordered by fine
trees, and the old man was preparing to return to the house,
when the two travelers, arriving in front of the gate,
attracted his attention.

The king, we have said, was riding with his head cast down,
his arms inert, leaving his horse to go what pace he liked,
whilst Parry, behind him, the better to imbibe the genial
influence of the sun, had taken off his hat, and was looking
about right and left. His eyes encountered those of the old
man leaning against the gate; the latter, as if struck by
some strange spectacle, uttered an exclamation, and made one
step towards the two travelers. From Parry his eyes
immediately turned towards the king, upon whom they rested
for an instant. This exclamation, however rapid, was
instantly reflected in a visible manner upon the features of
the tall old man. For scarcely had he recognized the younger
of the travelers -- and we say recognized, for nothing but a
perfect recognition could have explained such an act --
scarcely, we say, had he recognized the younger of the two
travelers, than he clapped his hands together, with
respectful surprise, and, raising his hat from his head,
bowed so profoundly that it might have been said he was
kneeling. This demonstration, however absent, or rather,
however absorbed was the king in his reflections, attracted
his attention instantly; and checking his horse and turning
towards Parry, he exclaimed, "Good God, Parry, who is that
man who salutes me in such a marked manner? Can he know me,
think you?"

Parry, much agitated and very pale, had already turned his
horse towards the gate. "Ah, sire!" said he, stopping
suddenly at five of six paces' distance from the still
bending man: "sire, I am seized with astonishment, for I
think I recognize that brave man. Yes, it must be he! Will
your majesty permit me to speak to him?"

"Certainly."

"Can it be you, Monsieur Grimaud?" asked Parry.

"Yes, it is I," replied the tall old man, drawing himself
up, but without losing his respectful demeanor.

"Sire," then said Parry, "I was not deceived. This good man
is the servant of the Comte de la Fere, and the Comte de la
Fere, if you remember, is the worthy gentleman of whom I
have so often spoken to your majesty that the remembrance of
him must remain, not only in your mind, but in your heart."

"He who assisted my father at his last moments?" asked
Charles, evidently affected at the remembrance.

"The same, sire."

"Alas!" said Charles; and then addressing Grimaud, whose
penetrating and intelligent eyes seemed to search and divine
his thoughts, -- "My friend," said he, "does your master,
Monsieur le Comte de la Fere, live in this neighborhood?"

"There," replied Grimaud, pointing with his outstretched arm
to the white-and-red house behind the gate.

"And is Monsieur le Comte de la Fere at home at present?"

"At the back, under the chestnut trees."

"Parry," said the king, "I will not miss this opportunity,
so precious for me, to thank the gentleman to whom our house
is indebted for such a noble example of devotedness and
generosity. Hold my horse, my friend, if you please." And,
throwing the bridle to Grimaud, the king entered the abode
of Athos, quite alone, as one equal enters the dwelling of
another. Charles had been informed by the concise
explanation of Grimaud, -- "At the back, under the chestnut
trees;" he left, therefore, the house on the left, and went
straight down the path indicated. The thing was easy; the
tops of those noble trees, already covered with leaves and
flowers, rose above all the rest.

On arriving under the lozenges, by turns luminous and dark,
which checkered the ground of this path according as the
trees were more or less in leaf, the young prince perceived
a gentleman walking with his arms behind him, apparently
plunged in a deep meditation. Without doubt, he had often
had this gentleman described to him, for, without
hesitating, Charles II. walked straight up to him. At the
sound of his footsteps, the Comte de la Fere raised his
head, and seeing an unknown man of noble and elegant
carriage coming towards him, he raised his hat and waited.
At some paces from him, Charles II. likewise took off his
hat. Then, as if in reply to the comte's mute interrogation,
--

"Monsieur le Comte," said he," I come to discharge a duty
towards you. I have, for a long time, had the expression of
a profound gratitude to bring you. I am Charles II., son of
Charles Stuart, who reigned in England, and died on the
scaffold."

On hearing this illustrious name, Athos felt a kind of
shudder creep through his veins, but at the sight of the
young prince standing uncovered before him, and stretching
out his hand towards him, two tears, for an instant, dimmed
his brilliant eyes. He bent respectfully, but the prince
took him by the hand.

"See how unfortunate I am, my lord count; it is only due to
chance that I have met with you. Alas! I ought to have
people around me whom I love and honor, whereas I am reduced
to preserve their services in my heart, and their names in
my memory: so that if your servant had not recognized mine,
I should have passed by your door as by that of a stranger."

"It is but too true," said Athos, replying with his voice to
the first part of the king's speech, and with a bow to the
second; "it is but too true, indeed, that your majesty has
seen many evil days."

"And the worst, alas!" replied Charles, "are perhaps still
to come."

"Sire, let us hope."

"Count, count," continued Charles, shaking his head, "I
entertained hope till last night, and that of a good
Christian, I swear."

Athos looked at the king as if to interrogate him.

"Oh, the history is soon related," said Charles.
"Proscribed, despoiled, disdained, I resolved, in spite of
all my repugnance, to tempt fortune one last time. Is it not
written above, that, for our family, all good fortune and
all bad fortune shall eternally come from France? You know
something of that, monsieur, -- you, who are one of the
Frenchmen whom my unfortunate father found at the foot of
his scaffold, on the day of his death, after having found
them at his right hand on the day of battle."

"Sire," said Athos modestly, "I was not alone. My companions
and I did, under the circumstances, our duty as gentlemen,
and that was all. Your majesty was about to do me the honor
to relate ---- "

"That is true. I had the protection, -- pardon my
hesitation, count, but, for a Stuart, you, who understand
everything, you will comprehend that the word is hard to
pronounce; -- I had, I say, the protection of my cousin the
stadtholder of Holland; but without the intervention, or at
least without the authorization of France, the stadtholder
would not take the initiative. I came, then, to ask this
authorization of the king of France, who has refused me."

"The king has refused you, sire!"

"Oh, not he; all justice must be rendered to my younger
brother Louis; but Monsieur de Mazarin ---- "

Athos bit his lips.

"You perhaps think I should have expected this refusal?"
said the king, who had noticed the movement.

"That was, in truth, my thought, sire," replied Athos,
respectfully, "I know that Italian of old."

"Then I determined to come to the test, and know at once the
last word of my destiny. I told my brother Louis, that, not
to compromise either France or Holland, I would tempt
fortune myself in person, as I had already done, with two
hundred gentlemen, if he would give them to me, and a
million, if he would lend it me."

"Well, sire?"

"Well, monsieur, I am suffering at this moment something
strange, and that is, the satisfaction of despair. There is
in certain souls, -- and I have just discovered that mine is
of the number, -- a real satisfaction in the assurance that
all is lost, and the time is come to yield."

"Oh, I hope," said Athos, "that your majesty is not come to
that extremity."

"To say so, my lord count, to endeavor to revive hope in my
heart, you must have ill understood what I have just told
you. I came to Blois to ask of my brother Louis the alms of
a million, with which I had the hopes of re-establishing my
affairs; and my brother Louis has refused me. You see, then,
plainly, that all is lost."

"Will your majesty permit me to express a contrary opinion?"

"How is that, count? Do you think my heart of so low an
order that I do not know how to face my position?"

"Sire, I have always seen that it was in desperate positions
that suddenly the great turns of fortune have taken place."

"Thank you, count, it is some comfort to meet with a heart
like yours, that is to say, sufficiently trustful in God and
in monarchy, never to despair of a royal fortune, however
low it may be fallen. Unfortunately, my dear count, your
words are like those remedies they call `sovereign,' and
which, though able to cure curable wounds or diseases, fail
against death. Thank you for your perseverance in consoling
me, count, thanks for your devoted remembrance, but I know
in what I must trust -- nothing will save me now. And see,
my friend, I was so convinced, that I was taking the route
of exile with my old Parry; I was returning to devour my
poignant griefs in the little hermitage offered me by
Holland. There, believe me, count, all will soon be over,
and death will come quickly, it is called so often by this
body, eaten up by its soul, and by this soul, which aspires
to heaven."

"Your majesty has a mother, a sister, and brothers; your
majesty is the head of the family, and ought, therefore, to
ask a long life of God, instead of imploring Him for a
prompt death. Your majesty is an exile, a fugitive, but you
have right on your side; you ought to aspire to combats,
dangers, business, and not to rest in heavens."

"Count," said Charles II., with a smile of indescribable
sadness, "have you ever heard of a king who reconquered his
kingdom with one servant of the age of Parry, and with three
hundred crowns which that servant carried in his purse?"

"No, sire; but I have heard -- and that more than once --
that a dethroned king has recovered his kingdom with a firm
will, perseverance, some friends, and a million skillfully
employed."

"But you cannot have understood me. The million I asked of
my brother Louis was refused me."

"Sire," said Athos, "will your majesty grant me a few
minutes, and listen attentively to what remains for me to
say to you?"

Charles II. looked earnestly at Athos. "Willingly,
monsieur," said he.

"Then I will show your majesty the way," resumed the count,
directing his steps towards the house. He then conducted the
king to his study, and begged him to be seated. "Sire," said
he, "your majesty just now told me that, in the present
state of England, a million would suffice for the recovery
of your kingdom."

"To attempt it at least, monsieur, and to die as a king if I
should not succeed."

"Well, then, sire, let your majesty, according to the
promise you have made me, have the goodness to listen to
what I have to say." Charles made an affirmative sign with
his head. Athos walked straight up to the door, the bolts of
which he drew, after looking to see if anybody was near, and
then returned. "Sire," said he, "your majesty has kindly
remembered that I lent assistance to the very noble and very
unfortunate Charles I., when his executioners conducted him
from St. James's to Whitehall."

"Yes, certainly, I do remember it, and always shall remember
it."

"Sire, it is a dismal history to be heard by a son who no
doubt has had it related to him many times; and yet I ought
to repeat it to your majesty without omitting one detail."

"Speak on, monsieur."

"When the king your father ascended the scaffold, or rather
when he passed from his chamber to the scaffold on a level
with his window, everything was prepared for his escape. The
executioner was got out of the way; a hole contrived under
the floor of his apartment; I myself was beneath the funeral
vault, which I heard all at once creak beneath his feet."

"Parry has related to me all these terrible details,
monsieur."

Athos bowed, and resumed. "But here is something he has not
related to you, sire, for what follows passed between God,
your father, and myself; and never has the revelation of it
been made even to my dearest friends. `Go a little further
off,' said the august patient to the executioner; `it is but
for an instant, and I know that I belong to you; but
remember not to strike till I give the signal. I wish to
offer up my prayers in freedom.'"

"Pardon me," said Charles II., turning very pale, "but you,
count, who know so many details of this melancholy event, --
details which, as you said just now, have never been
revealed to anyone, -- do you know the name of that infernal
executioner, of that base wretch who concealed his face that
he might assassinate a king with impunity?"

Athos became slightly pale. "His name?" said he, "yes, I
know it, but cannot tell it."

"And what is become of him, for nobody in England knows his
destiny?"

"He is dead."

"But he did not die in his bed; he did not die a calm and
peaceful death, he did not die the death of the good?"

"He died a violent death, in a terrible night, rendered so
by the passions of man and a tempest from God. His body,
pierced by a dagger, sank to the depths of the ocean. God
pardon his murderer!"

"Proceed, then," said Charles II., seeing that the count was
unwilling to say more.

"The king of England, after having, as I have said, spoken
thus to the masked executioner, added, -- `Observe, you will
not strike till I shall stretch out my arms saying --
REMEMBER!'"

"I was aware," said Charles, in an agitated voice, "that
that was the last word pronounced by my unfortunate father.
But why and for whom?"

"For the French gentleman placed beneath his scaffold."

"For you, then, monsieur?"

"Yes, sire; and every one of the words which he spoke to me,
through the planks of the scaffold covered with a black
cloth, still sounds in my ears. The king knelt down on one
knee: `Comte de la Fere,' said he, `are you there?' `Yes,
sire,' replied I. Then the king stooped towards the boards."

Charles II., also palpitating with interest, burning with
grief, stooped towards Athos, to catch, one by one, every
word that escaped from him. His head touched that of the
comte.

"Then," continued Athos, "the king stooped. `Comte de la
Fere,' said he, `I could not be saved by you: it was not to
be. Now, even though I commit a sacrilege, I must speak to
you. Yes, I have spoken to men -- yes, I have spoken to God,
and I speak to you the last. To sustain a cause which I
thought sacred, I have lost the throne of my fathers and the
heritage of my children.'"

Charles II. concealed his face in his hands, and a bitter
tear glided between his white and slender fingers.

"`I have still a million in gold,' continued the king. `I
buried it in the vaults of the castle of Newcastle, a moment
before I left that city.'" Charles raised his head with an
expression of such painful joy that it would have drawn
tears from any one acquainted with his misfortunes.

"A million!" murmured he. "Oh, count!"

"`You alone know that this money exists: employ it when you
think it can be of the greatest service to my eldest son.
And now, Comte de la Fere, bid me adieu!'

"`Adieu, adieu, sire!' cried I."

Charles arose, and went and leant his burning brow against
the window.

"It was then," continued Athos, "that the king pronounced
the word, `REMEMBER!' addressed to me. You see, sire, that I
have remembered."

The king could not resist or conceal his emotion. Athos
beheld the movement of his shoulders, which undulated
convulsively; he heard the sobs which burst from his
overcharged breast. He was silent himself, suffocated by the
flood of bitter remembrances he had just poured upon that
royal head. Charles II., with a violent effort, left the
window, devoured his tears, and came and sat by Athos.
"Sire," said the latter, "I thought till to-day that the
time had not yet arrived for the employment of that last
resource; but, with my eyes fixed upon England, I felt it
was approaching. To-morrow I meant to go and inquire in what
part of the world your majesty was, and then I purposed
going to you. You come to me, sire; that is an indication
that God is with us."

"My lord," said Charles, in a voice choked by emotion, "you
are, for me, what an angel sent from heaven would be, -- you
are a preserver sent to me from the tomb of my father
himself; but, believe me, for ten years' civil war has
passed over my country, striking down men, tearing up the
soil, it is no more probable that gold should remain in the
entrails of the earth, than love in the hearts of my
subjects."

"Sire, the spot in which his majesty buried the million is
well known to me, and no one, I am sure, has been able to
discover it. Besides, is the castle of Newcastle quite
destroyed? Have they demolished it stone by stone, and
uprooted the soil to the last tree?"

"No, it is still standing: but at this moment General Monk
occupies it and is encamped there. The only spot from which
I could look for succor, where I possess a single resource,
you see, is invaded by my enemies."

"General Monk, sire, cannot have discovered the treasure
which I speak of."

"Yes, but can I go and deliver myself up to Monk, in order
to recover this treasure? Ah! count, you see plainly I must
yield to destiny, since it strikes me to the earth every
time I rise. What can I do with Parry as my only servant,
with Parry, whom Monk has already driven from his presence?
No, no, no, count, we must yield to this last blow."

"But what your majesty cannot do, and what Parry can no more
attempt, do you not believe that I could succeed in
accomplishing?"

"You -- you, count -- you would go?"

"If it please your majesty," said Athos, bowing to the king,
"yes, I will go, sire."

"What! you so happy here, count?"

"I am never happy when I have a duty left to accomplish, and
it is an imperative duty which the king your father left me
to watch over your fortunes, and make a royal use of his
money. So, if your majesty honors me with a sign, I will go
with you."

"Ah, monsieur!" said the king, forgetting all royal
etiquette, and throwing his arms around the neck of Athos,
"you prove to me that there is a God in heaven, and that
this God sometimes sends messengers to the unfortunate who
groan on the earth."

Athos, exceedingly moved by this burst of feeling of the
young man, thanked him with profound respect, and approached
the window. "Grimaud!" cried he, "bring out my horses."

"What, now -- immediately!" said the king. "Ah, monsieur,
you are indeed a wonderful man!"

"Sire," said Athos, "I know nothing more pressing than your
majesty's service. Besides," added he, smiling, "it is a
habit contracted long since, in the service of the queen
your aunt, and of the king your father. How is it possible
for me to lose it at the moment your majesty's service calls
for it?"

"What a man!" murmured the king.

Then after a moment's reflection, -- "But no, count, I
cannot expose you to such privations. I have no means of
rewarding such services."

"Bah!" said Athos, laughing. "Your majesty is joking, have
you not a million? Ah! why am I not possessed of half such a
sum! I would already have raised a regiment. But, thank God!
I have still a few rolls of gold and some family diamonds
left. Your majesty will, I hope, deign to share with a
devoted servant."

"With a friend -- yes, count, but on condition that, in his
turn, that friend will share with me hereafter!"

"Sire!" said Athos, opening a casket, from which he drew
both gold and jewels, "you see, sire, we are too rich.
Fortunately, there are four of us, in the event of our
meeting with thieves."

Joy made the blood rush to the pale cheeks of Charles II.,
as he saw Athos's two horses, led by Grimaud, already booted
for the journey, advance towards the porch.

"Blaisois, this letter for the Vicomte de Bragelonne. For
everybody else I am gone to Paris. I confide the house to
you, Blaisois." Blaisois bowed, shook hands with Grimaud,
and shut the gate.




CHAPTER 17

In which Aramis is sought and only Bazin is found



Two hours had scarcely elapsed since the departure of the
master of the house, who, in Blaisois's sight, had taken the
road to Paris, when a horseman, mounted on a good pied
horse, stopped before the gate, and with a sonorous "hola!"
called the stable-boys who, with the gardeners, had formed a
circle round Blaisois, the historian-in-ordinary to the
household of the chateau. This "hola," doubtless well known
to Master Blaisois, made him turn his head and exclaim --
"Monsieur d'Artagnan! run quickly, you chaps, and open the
gate."

A swarm of eight brisk lads flew to the gate, which was
opened as if it had been made of feathers; and every one
loaded him with attentions, for they knew the welcome this
friend was accustomed to receive from their master; and for
such remarks the eye of the valet may always be depended
upon.

"Ah!" said M. d'Artagnan, with an agreeable smile, balancing
himself upon his stirrup to jump to the ground, "where is
that dear count?"

"Ah! how unfortunate you are, monsieur!" said Blaisois: "and
how unfortunate will monsieur le comte our master, think
himself when he hears of your coming! As ill luck will have
it, monsieur le comte left home two hours ago."

D'Artagnan did not trouble himself about such trifles. "Very
good!" said he. "You always speak the best French in the
world; you shall give me a lesson in grammar and correct
language, whilst I wait the return of your master."

"That is impossible, monsieur," said Blaisois; "you would
have to wait too long."

"Will he not come back to-day, then?"

"No, nor to-morrow, nor the day after to-morrow. Monsieur le
comte has gone on a journey."

"A journey!" said D'Artagnan, surprised; "that's a fable,
Master Blaisois."

"Monsieur, it is no more than the truth. Monsieur has done
me the honor to give me the house in charge; and he added,
with his voice so full of authority and kindness -- that is
all one to me: `You will say I have gone to Paris.'"

"Well!" cried D'Artagnan, "since he is gone towards Paris,
that is all I wanted to know! you should have told me so at
first, booby! He is then two hours in advance?"

"Yes, monsieur."

"I shall soon overtake him. Is he alone?"

"No, monsieur."

"Who is with him, then?"

"A gentleman whom I don't know, an old man, and M. Grimaud."

"Such a party cannot travel as fast as I can -- I will
start."

"Will monsieur listen to me an instant?" said Blaisois,
laying his hand gently on the reins of the horse.

"Yes, if you don't favor me with fine speeches, and make
haste."

"Well, then, monsieur, that word Paris appears to me to be
only an excuse."

"Oh, oh!" said D'Artagnan, seriously, "an excuse, eh?"

"Yes, monsieur; and monsieur le comte is not going to Paris,
I will swear."

"What makes you think so?"

"This -- M. Grimaud always knows where our master is going;
and he had promised me that the first time he went to Paris,
he would take a little money for me to my wife."

"What, have you a wife, then?"

"I had one -- she was of this country; but monsieur thought
her a noisy scold, and I sent her to Paris; it is sometimes
inconvenient, but very agreeable at others."

"I understand; but go on. You do not believe the count gone
to Paris?"

"No, monsieur; for then M. Grimaud would have broken his
word; he would have perjured himself, and that is
impossible."

"That is impossible," repeated D'Artagnan, quite in a study,
because he was quite convinced. "Well, my brave Blaisois,
many thanks to you."

Blaisois bowed.

"Come, you know I am not curious -- I have serious business
with your master. Could you not, by a little bit of a word
-- you who speak so well -- give me to understand -- one
syllable, only -- I will guess the rest."

"Upon my word, monsieur, I cannot. I am quite ignorant where
monsieur le comte is gone. As to listening at doors, that is
contrary to my nature; and besides it is forbidden here."

"My dear fellow," said D'Artagnan, "this is a very bad
beginning for me. Never mind, you know when monsieur le
comte will return, at least?"

"As little, monsieur, as the place of his destination."

"Come, Blaisois, come, search."

"Monsieur doubts my sincerity? Ah, monsieur, that grieves me
much."

"The devil take his gilded tongue!" grumbled D'Artagnan. "A
clown with a word would be worth a dozen of him. Adieu!"

"Monsieur, I have the honor to present you my respects."

"Cuistre!" said D'Artagnan to himself, "the fellow is
unbearable." He gave another look up to the house, turned
his horse's head, and set off like a man who has nothing
either annoying or embarrassing in his mind. When he was at
the end of the wall, and out of sight, -- "Well, now, I
wonder," said he, breathing quickly, "whether Athos was at
home. No; all those idlers, standing with their arms
crossed, would have been at work if the eye of the master
was near. Athos gone a journey? -- that is incomprehensible.
Bah! it is all devilish mysterious! And then -- no -- he is
not the man I want. I want one of a cunning, patient mind.
My business is at Melun, in a certain presbytery I am
acquainted with. Forty-five leagues -- four days and a half!
Well, it is fine weather, and I am free. Never mind the
distance!"

And he put his horse into a trot, directing his course
towards Paris. On the fourth day he alighted at Melun as he
had intended.

D'Artagnan was never in the habit of asking any one on the
road for any common information. For these sorts of details,
unless in very serious circumstances, he confided in his
perspicacity, which was so seldom at fault, in his
experience of thirty years, and in a great habit of reading
the physiognomies of houses, as well as those of men. At
Melun, D'Artagnan immediately found the presbytery -- a
charming house, plastered over red brick, with vines
climbing along the gutters, and a cross, in carved stone,
surmounting the ridge of the roof. From the ground-floor of
this house came a noise, or rather a confusion of voices,
like the chirping of young birds when the brood is just
hatched under the down. One of these voices was spelling the
alphabet distinctly. A voice, thick, yet pleasant, at the
same time scolded the talkers and corrected the faults of
the reader. D'Artagnan recognized that voice, and as the
window of the ground-floor was open, he leant down from his
horse under the branches and red fibers of the vine and
cried "Bazin, my dear Bazin! good-day to you."

A short, fat man, with a flat face, a craniun ornamented
with a crown of gray hairs, cut short, in imitation of a
tonsure, and covered with an old black velvet cap, arose as
soon as he heard D'Artagnan -- we ought not to say arose,
but bounded up. In fact, Bazin bounded up, carrying with him
his little low chair, which the children tried to take away,
with battles more fierce than those of the Greeks
endeavoring to recover the body of Patroclus from the hands
of the Trojans. Bazin did more than bound; he let fall both
his alphabet and his ferule. "You!" said he, "you, Monsieur
d'Artagnan?"

"Yes, myself! Where is Aramis -- no, M. le Chevalier
d'Herblay -- no, I am still mistaken -- Monsieur le
Vicaire-General?"

"Ah, monsieur," said Bazin, with dignity, "monseigneur is at
his diocese."

"What did you say?" said D'Artagnan. Bazin repeated the
sentence.

"Ah, ah! but has Aramis a diocese?"

"Yes, monsieur. Why not?"

"Is he a bishop, then?"

"Why, where can you come from," said Bazin, rather
irreverently, "that you don't know that?"

"My dear Bazin, we pagans, we men of the sword, know very
well when a man is made a colonel, or maitre-de-camp, or
marshal of France; but if he be made a bishop, archbishop,
or pope -- devil take me if the news reaches us before the
three quarters of the earth have had the advantage of it!"

"Hush! hush!" said Bazin, opening his eyes: "do not spoil
these poor children, in whom I am endeavoring to inculcate
such good principles." In fact, the children had surrounded
D'Artagnan, whose horse, long sword, spurs, and martial air
they very much admired. But above all, they admired his
strong voice; so that, when he uttered his oath, the whole
school cried out, "The devil take me!" with fearful bursts
of laughter, shouts, and bounds, which delighted the
musketeer, and bewildered the old pedagogue.

"There!" said he, "hold your tongues, you brats! You have
come, M. d'Artagnan, and all my good principles fly away.
With you, as usual, comes disorder. Babel is revived. Ah!
Good Lord! Ah! the wild little wretches!" And the worthy
Bazin distributed right and left blows which increased the
cries of his scholars by changing the nature of them.

"At least," said he, "you will no longer decoy any one
here."

"Do you think so?" said D'Artagnan, with a smile which made
a shudder creep over the shoulders of Bazin.

"He is capable of it," murmured he.

"Where is your master's diocese?"

"Monseigneur Rene is bishop of Vannes."

"Who had him nominated?"

"Why, monsieur le surintendant, our neighbor."

"What! Monsieur Fouquet?"

"To be sure he did."

"Is Aramis on good terms with him, then?"

"Monseigneur preached every Sunday at the house of monsieur
le surintendant at Vaux; then they hunted together."

"Ah!"

"And monseigneur composed his homilies -- no, I mean his
sermons -- with monsieur le surintendant."

"Bah! he preached in verse, then, this worthy bishop?"

"Monsieur, for the love of heaven, do not jest with sacred
things."

"There, Bazin, there! So, then, Aramis is at Vannes?"

"At Vannes, in Bretagne."

"You are a deceitful old hunks, Bazin; that is not true."

"See, monsieur, if you please; the apartments of the
presbytery are empty."

"He is right there," said D'Artagnan, looking attentively at
the house, the aspect of which announced solitude.

"But monseigneur must have written you an account of his
promotion."

"When did it take place?"

"A month back."

"Oh! then there is no time lost. Aramis cannot yet have
wanted me. But how is it, Bazin, you do not follow your
master?"

"Monsieur, I cannot; I have occupations."

"Your alphabet?"

"And my penitents."

"What, do you confess, then? Are you a priest?"

"The same as one. I have such a call."

"But the orders?"

"Oh," said Bazin, without hesitation, "now that monseigneur
is a bishop, I shall soon have my orders, or at least my
dispensations." And he rubbed his hands.

"Decidedly," said D'Artagnan to himself, "there will be no
means of uprooting these people. Get me some supper Bazin."

"With pleasure, monsieur."

"A fowl, a bouillon, and a bottle of wine."

"This is Saturday, monsieur -- it is a day of abstinence."

"I have a dispensation," said D'Artagnan.

Bazin looked at him suspiciously.

"Ah, ah, master hypocrite!" said the musketeer, "for whom do
you take me? If you, who are the valet, hope for
dispensation to commit a crime, shall not I, the friend of
your bishop, have dispensation for eating meat at the call
of my stomach? Make yourself agreeable with me, Bazin, or,
by heavens! I will complain to the king, and you shall never
confess. Now you know that the nomination of bishops rests
with the king -- I have the king, I am the stronger."

Bazin smiled hypocritically. "Ah, but we have monsieur le
surintendant," said he.

"And you laugh at the king, then?"

Bazin made no reply; his smile was sufficiently eloquent.

"My supper," said D'Artagnan, "it is getting towards seven
o'clock."

Bazin turned round and ordered the eldest of the pupils to
inform the cook. In the meantime, D'Artagnan surveyed the
presbytery.

"Phew!" said he, disdainfully, "monseigneur lodged his
grandeur very meanly here."

"We have the Chateau de Vaux," said Bazin.

"Which is perhaps equal to the Louvre?" said D'Artagnan,
jeeringly.

"Which is better," replied Bazin, with the greatest coolness
imaginable.

"Ah, ah!" said D'Artagnan.

He would perhaps have prolonged the discussion, and
maintained the superiority of the Louvre, but the lieutenant
perceived that his horse remained fastened to the bars of a
gate.

"The devil!" said he. "Get my horse looked after; your
master the bishop has none like him in his stables."

Bazin cast a sidelong glance at the horse, and replied,
"Monsieur le surintendant gave him four from his own
stables; and each of the four is worth four of yours."

The blood mounted to the face of D'Artagnan. His hand itched
and his eye glanced over the head of Bazin, to select the
place upon which he should discharge his anger. But it
passed away; reflection came, and D'Artagnan contented
himself with saying, --

"The devil! the devil! I have done well to quit the service
of the king. Tell me, worthy Master Bazin," added he, "how
many musketeers does monsieur le surintendant retain in his
service?"

"He could have all there are in the kingdom with his money,"
replied Bazin, closing his book, and dismissing the boys
with some kindly blows of his cane.

"The devil! the devil!" repeated D'Artagnan, once more, as
if to annoy the pedagogue. But as supper was now announced,
he followed the cook, who introduced him into the refectory,
where it awaited him. D'Artagnan placed himself at the
table, and began a hearty attack upon his fowl.

"It appears to me," said D'Artagnan, biting with all his
might at the tough fowl they had served up to him, and which
they had evidently forgotten to fatten, -- "it appears that
I have done wrong in not seeking service with that master
yonder. A powerful noble this intendant, seemingly! In good
truth, we poor fellows know nothing at the court, and the
rays of the sun prevent our seeing the large stars, which
are also suns, at a little greater distance from our earth,
-- that is all."

As D'Artagnan delighted, both from pleasure and system, in
making people talk about things which interested him, he
fenced in his best style with Master Bazin, but it was pure
loss of time; beyond the tiresome and hyperbolical praises
of monsieur le surintendant of the finances, Bazin, who, on
his side, was on his guard, afforded nothing but platitudes
to the curiosity of D'Artagnan, so that our musketeer, in a
tolerably bad humor, desired to go to bed as soon as he had
supped. D'Artagnan was introduced by Bazin into a mean
chamber, in which there was a poor bed; but D'Artagnan was
not fastidious in that respect. He had been told that Aramis
had taken away the key of his own private apartment, and as
he knew Aramis was a very particular man, and had generally
many things to conceal in his apartment, he had not been
surprised. He, therefore, although it appeared comparatively
even harder, attacked the bed as bravely as he had done the
fowl; and, as he had as good an inclination to sleep as he
had had to eat, he took scarcely longer time to be snoring
harmoniously than he had employed in picking the last bones
of the bird.

Since he was no longer in the service of any one, D'Artagnan
had promised himself to indulge in sleeping as soundly as he
had formerly slept lightly; but with whatever good faith
D'Artagnan had made himself this promise, and whatever
desire he might have to keep it religiously, he was awakened
in the middle of the night by a loud noise of carriages, and
servants on horseback. A sudden illumination flashed over
the walls of his chamber; he jumped out of bed and ran to
the window in his shirt. "Can the king be coming this way?"
he thought, rubbing his eyes; "in truth, such a suite can
only be attached to royalty."

"Vive monsieur le surintendant!" cried, or rather
vociferated, from a window on the ground-floor, a voice
which he recognized as Bazin's, who at the same time waved a
handkerchief with one hand, and held a large candle in the
other. D'Artagnan then saw something like a brilliant human
form leaning out of the principal carriage; at the same time
loud bursts of laughter, caused, no doubt, by the strange
figure of Bazin, and issuing from the same carriage, left,
as it were, a train of joy upon the passage of the rapid
cortege.

"I might easily see it was not the king," said D'Artagnan;
"people don't laugh so heartily when the king passes. Hola,
Bazin!" cried he to his neighbor, three-quarters of whose
body still hung out of the window, to follow the carriage
with his eyes as long as he could. "What is all that about?"

"It is M. Fouquet," said Bazin, in a patronizing tone.

"And all those people?"

"That is the court of M. Fouquet."

"Oh, oh!" said D'Artagnan; "what would M. de Mazarin say to
that if he heard it?" And he returned to his bed, asking
himself how Aramis always contrived to be protected by the
most powerful personages in the kingdom. "Is it that he has
more luck than I, or that I am a greater fool than he? Bah!"
that was the concluding word by the aid of which D'Artagnan,
having become wise, now terminated every thought and every
period of his style. Formerly he said, "Mordioux!" which was
a prick of the spur, but now he had become older, and he
murmured that philosophical "Bah!" which served as a bridle
to all the passions.




CHAPTER 18

In which D'Artagnan seeks Porthos, and only finds Mousqueton



When D'Artagnan had perfectly convinced himself that the
absence of the Vicar-General d'Herblay was real, and that
his friend was not to be found at Melun or in its vicinity,
he left Bazin without regret, cast an ill-natured glance at
the magnificent Chateau de Vaux which was beginning to shine
with that splendor which brought on its ruin, and,
compressing his lips like a man full of mistrust and
suspicion, he put spurs to his pied horse, saying, "Well,
well! I have still Pierrefonds left, and there I shall find
the best man and the best filled coffer. And that is all I
want, for I have an idea of my own."

We will spare our readers the prosaic incidents of
D'Artagnan's journey, which terminated on the morning of the
third day within sight of Pierrefonds. D'Artagnan came by
the way of Nanteuil-le-Hardouin and Crepy. At a distance he
perceived the Castle of Louis of Orleans, which, having
become part of the crown domain, was kept by an old
concierge. This was one of those marvelous manors of the
middle ages, with walls twenty feet in thickness, and a
hundred in height.

D'Artagnan rode slowly past its walls, measured its towers
with his eye and descended into the valley. From afar he
looked down upon the chateau of Porthos, situated on the
shores of a small lake, and contiguous to a magnificent
forest. It was the same place we have already had the honor
of describing to our readers; we shall therefore satisfy
ourselves with naming it. The first thing D'Artagnan
perceived after the fine trees, the May sun gilding the
sides of the green hills, the long rows of feather-topped
trees which stretched out towards Compiegne, was a large
rolling box, pushed forward by two servants and dragged by
two others. In this box there was an enormous green-and-gold
thing, which went along the smiling glades of the park, thus
dragged and pushed. This thing, at a distance, could not be
distinguished, and signified absolutely nothing; nearer, it
was a hogshead muffled in gold-bound green cloth; when
close, it was a man, or rather a poussa, the interior
extremity of whom, spreading over the interior of the box,
entirely filled it, when still closer, the man was
Mousqueton -- Mousqueton, with gray hair and a face as red
as Punchinello's.

"Pardieu!" cried D'Artagnan; "why, that's my dear Monsieur
Mousqueton!"

"Ah!" cried the fat man -- "ah! what happiness! what joy!
There's M. d'Artagnan. Stop, you rascals!" These last words
were addressed to the lackeys who pushed and dragged him.
The box stopped, and the four lackeys, with a precision
quite military, took off their laced hats and ranged
themselves behind it.

"Oh, Monsieur d'Artagnan!" said Mousqueton, "why can I not
embrace your knees? But I have become impotent, as you see."

"Dame! my dear Mousqueton, it is age."

"No, monsieur, it is not age; it is infirmities --
troubles."

"Troubles! you, Mousqueton?" said D'Artagnan making the tour
of the box; "are you out of your mind, my dear friend? Thank
God! you are as hearty as a three-hundred-year-old oak."

"Ah! but my legs, monsieur, my legs!" groaned the faithful
servant.

"What's the matter with your legs?"

"Oh, they will no longer bear me!"

"Ah, the ungrateful things! And yet you feed them well,
Mousqueton, apparently."

"Alas, yes! They can reproach me with nothing in that
respect," said Mousqueton, with a sigh; "I have always done
what I could for my poor body; I am not selfish." And
Mousqueton sighed afresh.

"I wonder whether Mousqueton wants to be a baron, too, as he
sighs after that fashion?" thought D'Artagnan.

"Mon Dieu, monsieur!" said Mousqueton, as if rousing himself
from a painful reverie; "how happy monseigneur will be that
you have thought of him!"

"Kind Porthos!" cried D'Artagnan, "I am anxious to embrace
him."

"Oh!" said Mousqueton, much affected, "I shall certainly
write to him."

"What!" cried D'Artagnan, "you will write to him?"

"This very day; I shall not delay it an hour."

"Is he not here, then?"

"No, monsieur."

"But is he near at hand? -- is he far off?"

"Oh, can I tell, monsieur, can I tell?"

"Mordioux!" cried the musketeer, stamping with his foot, "I
am unfortunate. Porthos such a stay-at-home!"

"Monsieur, there is not a more sedentary man than
monseigneur, but ---- "

"But what?"

"When a friend presses you ---- "

"A friend?"

"Doubtless -- the worthy M. d'Herblay."

"What, has Aramis pressed Porthos?"

"This is how the thing happened, Monsieur d'Artagnan. M.
d'Herblay wrote to monseigneur ---- "

"Indeed!"

"A letter, monsieur, such a pressing letter that it threw us
all into a bustle."

"Tell me all about it, my dear friend." said D'Artagnan;
"but remove these people a little further off first."

Mousqueton shouted, "Fall back, you fellows," with such
powerful lungs that the breath, without the words, would
have been sufficient to disperse the four lackeys.
D'Artagnan seated himself on the shaft of the box and opened
his ears. "Monsieur," said Mousqueton, "monseigneur, then,
received a letter from M. le Vicaire-General d'Herblay,
eight or nine days ago; it was the day of the rustic
pleasures, yes, it must have been Wednesday."

"What do you mean?" said D'Artagnan. "The day of rustic
pleasures?"

"Yes, monsieur; we have so many pleasures to take in this
delightful country, that we were encumbered by them; so much
so, that we have been forced to regulate the distribution of
them."

"How easily do I recognize Porthos's love of order in that!
Now, that idea would never have occurred to me; but then I
am not encumbered with pleasures."

"We were, though," said Mousqueton.

"And how did you regulate the matter, let me know?" said
D'Artagnan.

"It is rather long, monsieur."

"Never mind, we have plenty of time; and you speak so well,
my dear Mousqueton, that it is really a pleasure to hear
you."

"It is true," said Mousqueton, with a sigh of satisfaction,
which emanated evidently from the justice which had been
rendered him, "it is true I have made great progress in the
company of monseigneur."

"I am waiting for the distribution of the pleasures,
Mousqueton, and with impatience. I want to know if I have
arrived on a lucky day."

"Oh, Monsieur d'Artagnan," said Mousqueton in a melancholy
tone, "since monseigneur's departure all the pleasures have
gone too!"

"Well, my dear Mousqueton, refresh your memory."

"With what day shall I begin?"

"Eh, pardieux! begin with Sunday; that is the Lord's day."

"Sunday, monsieur?"

"Yes."

"Sunday pleasures are religious: monseigneur goes to mass,
makes the bread-offering, and has discourses and
instructions made to him by his almoner-in-ordinary. That is
not very amusing, but we expect a Carmelite from Paris who
will do the duty of our almonry, and who, we are assured,
speaks very well, which will keep us awake, whereas our
present almoner always sends us to sleep. These are Sunday
religious pleasures. On Monday, worldly pleasures."

"Ah, ah!" said D'Artagnan, "what do you mean by that? Let us
have a glimpse at your worldly pleasures."

"Monsieur, on Monday we go into the world; we pay and
receive visits, we play on the lute, we dance, we make
verses, and burn a little incense in honor of the ladies."

"Peste! that is the height of gallantry," said the
musketeer, who was obliged to call to his aid all the
strength of his facial muscles to suppress an enormous
inclination to laugh.

"Tuesday, learned pleasures."

"Good!" cried D'Artagnan. "What are they? Detail them, my
dear Mousqueton."

"Monseigneur has bought a sphere or globe, which I shall
show you; it fills all the perimeter of the great tower,
except a gallery which he has had built over the sphere:
there are little strings and brass wires to which the sun
and moon are hooked. It all turns; and that is very
beautiful. Monseigneur points out to me seas and distant
countries. We don't intend to visit them, but it is very
interesting."

"Interesting! yes, that's the word," repeated D'Artagnan.
"And Wednesday?"

"Rustic pleasures, as I have had the honor to tell you,
monsieur le chevalier. We look over monseigneur's sheep and
goats; we make the shepherds dance to pipes and reeds, as is
written in a book monseigneur has in his library, which is
called `Bergeries.' The author died about a month ago."

"Monsieur Racan, perhaps," said D'Artagnan,

"Yes, that was his name -- M. Racan. But that is not all: we
angle in the little canal, after which we dine, crowned with
flowers. That is Wednesday."

"Peste!" said D'Artagnan, "you don't divide your pleasures
badly. And Thursday? -- what can be left for poor Thursday?"

"It is not very unfortunate, monsieur," said Mousqueton,
smiling. "Thursday, Olympian pleasures. Ah, monsieur, that
is superb! We get together all monseigneur's young vassals,
and we make them throw the disc, wrestle, and run races.
Monseigneur can't run now, no more can I; but monseigneur
throws the disc as nobody else can throw it. And when he
does deal a blow, oh, that proves a misfortune!"

"How so?"

"Yes, monsieur, we were obliged to renounce the cestus. He
cracked heads; he broke jaws -- beat in ribs. It was
charming sport; but nobody was willing to play with him."

"Then his wrist ---- "

"Oh, monsieur, firmer than ever. Monseigneur gets a trifle
weaker in his legs, -- he confesses that himself; but his
strength has all taken refuge in his arms, so that ---- "

"So that he can knock down bullocks, as he used formerly."

"Monsieur, better than that -- he beats in walls. Lately,
after having supped with one of our farmers -- you know how
popular and kind monseigneur is -- after supper as a joke,
he struck the wall a blow. The wall crumbled away beneath
his hand, the roof fell in, and three men and an old woman
were stifled."

"Good God, Mousqueton! And your master?"

"Oh, monseigneur, a little skin was rubbed off his head. We
bathed the wounds with some water which the monks gave us.
But there was nothing the matter with his hand."

"Nothing?"

"No, nothing, monsieur."

"Deuce take the Olympic pleasures! They must cost your
master too dear, for widows and orphans ---- "

"They all had pensions, monsieur; a tenth of monseigneur's
revenue was spent in that way."

"Then pass on to Friday," said D'Artagnan.

"Friday, noble and warlike pleasures. We hunt, we fence, we
dress falcons and break horses. Then, Saturday is the day
for intellectual pleasures: we adorn our minds; we look at
monseigneur's pictures and statues; we write, even, and
trace plans: and then we fire monseigneur's cannon."

"You draw plans, and fire cannon?"

"Yes, monsieur."

"Why, my friend," said D'Artagnan, "M. du Vallon, in truth,
possesses the most subtle and amiable mind that I know. But
there is one kind of pleasure you have forgotten, it appears
to me."

"What is that, monsieur?" asked Mousqueton, with anxiety.

"The material pleasures."

Mousqueton colored. "What do you mean by that, monsieur?"
said he, casting down his eyes.

"I mean the table -- good wine -- evenings occupied in
passing the bottle."

"Ah, monsieur, we don't reckon those pleasures, -- we
practice them every day."

"My brave Mousqueton," resumed D'Artagnan, "pardon me, but I
was so absorbed in your charming recital that I have
forgotten the principal object of our conversation, which
was to learn what M. le Vicaire-General d'Herblay could have
to write to your master about."

"That is true, monsieur," said Mousqueton; "the pleasures
have misled us. Well, monsieur, this is the whole affair."

"I am all attention, Mousqueton."

"On Wednesday ---- "

"The day of the rustic pleasures?"

"Yes -- a letter arrived; he received it from my hands. I
had recognized the writing."

"Well?"

"Monseigneur read it and cried out, `Quick, my horses! my
arms!'"

"Oh, good Lord! then it was for some duel?" said D'Artagnan.

"No, monsieur, there were only these words: `Dear Porthos,
set out, if you would wish to arrive before the Equinox. I
expect you.'"

"Mordioux!" said D'Artagnan, thoughtfully, "that was
pressing, apparently."

"I think so; therefore," continued Mousqueton, "monseigneur
set out the very same day with his secretary, in order to
endeavor to arrive in time."

"And did he arrive in time?"

"I hope so. Monseigneur, who is hasty, as you know,
monsieur, repeated incessantly, `Tonno Dieu! What can this
mean? The Equinox? Never mind, a fellow must be well mounted
to arrive before I do.'"

"And you think Porthos will have arrived first, do you?"
asked D'Artagnan.

"I am sure of it. This Equinox, however rich he may be, has
certainly no horses so good as monseigneur's."

D'Artagnan repressed his inclination to laugh, because the
brevity of Aramis's letter gave rise to reflection. He
followed Mousqueton, or rather Mousqueton's chariot, to the
castle. He sat down to a sumptuous table, of which they did
him the honors as to a king. But he could draw nothing from
Mousqueton, -- the faithful servant seemed to shed tears at
will, but that was all.

D'Artagnan, after a night passed in an excellent bed,
reflected much upon the meaning of Aramis's letter; puzzled
himself as to the relation of the Equinox with the affairs
of Porthos; and being unable to make anything out unless it
concerned some amour of the bishop's, for which it was
necessary that the days and nights should be equal,
D'Artagnan left Pierrefonds as he had left Melun, as he had
left the chateau of the Comte de la Fere. It was not,
however, without a melancholy, which might in good sooth
pass for one of the most dismal of D'Artagnan's moods. His
head cast down, his eyes fixed, he suffered his legs to hang
on each side of his horse, and said to himself, in that
vague sort of reverie which ascends sometimes to the
sublimest eloquence:

"No more friends! no more future! no more anything! My
energies are broken like the bonds of our ancient
friendship. Oh, old age is coming, cold and inexorable; it
envelops in its funereal crape all that was brilliant, all
that was embalming in my youth; then it throws that sweet
burthen on its shoulders and carries it away with the rest
into the fathomless gulf of death."

A shudder crept through the heart of the Gascon, so brave
and so strong against all the misfortunes of life; and
during some moments the clouds appeared black to him, the
earth slippery and full of pits as that of cemeteries.

"Whither am I going?" said he to himself. "What am I going
to do! Alone, quite alone -- without family, without
friends! Bah!" cried he all at once. And he clapped spurs to
his horse, who, having found nothing melancholy in the heavy
oats of Pierrefonds profited by this permission to show his
gayety in a gallop which absorbed two leagues. "To Paris!"
said D'Artagnan to himself. And on the morrow he alighted in
Paris. He had devoted six days to this journey.




CHAPTER 19

What D'Artagnan went to Paris for



The lieutenant dismounted before a shop in the Rue des
Lombards, at the sign of the Pilon d'Or. A man of good
appearance, wearing a white apron, and stroking his gray
mustache with a large hand, uttered a cry of joy on
perceiving the pied horse. "Monsieur le chevalier," said he,
"ah, is that you?"

"Bon jour, Planchet," replied D'Artagnan, stooping to enter
the shop.

"Quick, somebody," cried Planchet, "to look after Monsieur
d'Artagnan's horse, -- somebody to get ready his room, --
somebody to prepare his supper."

"Thanks, Planchet. Good-day, my children!" said D'Artagnan
to the eager boys.

"Allow me to send off this coffee, this treacle, and these
raisins," said Planchet; "they are for the store-room of
monsieur le surintendant."

"Send them off, send them off!"

"That is only the affair of a moment, then we shall sup."

"Arrange it that we may sup alone; I want to speak to you."

Planchet looked at his old master in a significant manner.

"Oh, don't be uneasy, it is nothing unpleasant," said
D'Artagnan .

"So much the better -- so much the better!" And Planchet
breathed freely again, whilst D'Artagnan seated himself
quietly down in the shop, upon a bale of corks, and made a
survey of the premises. The shop was well stocked; there was
a mingled perfume of ginger, cinnamon, and ground pepper,
which made D'Artagnan sneeze. The shop-boy, proud of being
in company with so renowned a warrior, of a lieutenant of
musketeers, who approached the person of the king, began to
work with an enthusiasm which was something like delirium,
and to serve the customers with a disdainful haste that was
noticed by several.

Planchet put away his money, and made up his accounts,
amidst civilities addressed to his former master. Planchet
had with his equals the short speech and the haughty
familiarity of the rich shopkeeper who serves everybody and
waits for nobody. D'Artagnan observed this habit with a
pleasure which we shall analyze presently. He saw night come
on by degrees, and at length Planchet conducted him to a
chamber on the first story, where, amidst bales and chests,
a table very nicely set out awaited the two guests.

D'Artagnan took advantage of a moment's pause to examine the
countenance of Planchet, whom he had not seen for a year.
The shrewd Planchet had acquired a slight protuberance in
front, but his countenance was not puffed. His keen eye
still played with facility in its deep-sunk orbit; and fat,
which levels all the characteristic saliences of the human
face, had not yet touched either his high cheek-bones, the
sign of cunning and cupidity, or his pointed chin, the sign
of acuteness and perseverance. Planchet reigned with as much
majesty in his dining-room as in his shop. He set before his
master a frugal, but perfectly Parisian repast: roast meat,
cooked at the baker's, with vegetables, salad, and a dessert
borrowed from the shop itself. D'Artagnan was pleased that
the grocer had drawn from behind the fagots a bottle of that
Anjou wine which during all his life had been D'Artagnan's
favorite wine.

"Formerly, monsieur," said Planchet, with a smile full of
bonhomie, "it was I who drank your wine; now you do me the
honor to drink mine."

"And, thank God, friend Planchet, I shall drink it for a
long time to come, I hope; for at present I am free."

"Free? You have leave of absence, monsieur?"

"Unlimited."

"You are leaving the service?" said Planchet, stupefied.

"Yes, I am resting."

"And the king?" cried Planchet, who could not suppose it
possible that the king could do without the services of such
a man as D'Artagnan.

"The king will try his fortune elsewhere. But we have supped
well, you are disposed to enjoy yourself; you invite me to
confide in you. Open your ears, then."

"They are open." And Planchet, with a laugh more frank than
cunning, opened a bottle of white wine.

"Leave me my reason, at least."

"Oh, as to you losing your head -- you, monsieur!"

"Now my head is my own, and I mean to take better care of it
than ever. In the first place we shall talk business. How
fares our money-box?"

"Wonderfully well, monsieur. The twenty thousand livres I
had of you are still employed in my trade, in which they
bring me nine per cent. I give you seven, so I gain two by
you."

"And you are still satisfied?"

"Delighted. Have you brought me any more?"

"Better than that. But do you want any?"

"Oh! not at all. Every one is willing to trust me now. I am
extending my business."

"That was your intention."

"I play the banker a little. I buy goods of my needy
brethren; I lend money to those who are not ready for their
payments."

"Without usury?"

"Oh! monsieur, in the course of the last week I have had two
meetings on the boulevards, on account of the word you have
just pronounced."

"What?"

"You shall see: it concerned a loan. The borrower gives me
in pledge some raw sugars, on condition that I should sell
if repayment were not made within a fixed period. I lend a
thousand livres. He does not pay me and I sell the sugars
for thirteen hundred livres. He learns this and claims a
hundred crowns. Ma foi! I refused, pretending that I could
not sell them for more than nine hundred livres. He accused
me of usury. I begged him to repeat that word to me behind
the boulevards. He was an old guard, and he came: and I
passed your sword through his left thigh."

"Tu dieu! what a pretty sort of banker you make!" said
D'Artagnan.

"For above thirteen per cent. I fight," replied Planchet;
"that is my character."

"Take only twelve," said D'Artagnan, "and call the rest
premium and brokerage."

"You are right, monsieur; but to your business."

"Ah! Planchet, it is very long and very hard to speak."

"Do speak it, nevertheless."

D'Artagnan twisted his mustache like a man embarrassed with
the confidence he is about to make and mistrustful of his
confidant.

"Is it an investment?" asked Planchet.

"Why, yes."

"At good profit?"

"A capital profit, -- four hundred per cent., Planchet."

Planchet gave such a blow with his fist upon the table, that
the bottles bounded as if they had been frightened.

"Good heavens! is that possible?"

"I think it will be more," replied D'Artagnan coolly; "but I
like to lay it at the lowest!"

"The devil!" said Planchet, drawing nearer. "Why monsieur,
that is magnificent! Can one put much money in it?"

"Twenty thousand livres each, Planchet."

"Why, that is all you have, monsieur. For how long a time?"

"For a month."

"And that will give us ---- "

"Fifty thousand livres each, profit."

"It is monstrous! It is worth while to fight for such
interest as that!"

"In fact, I believe it will be necessary to fight not a
little," said D'Artagnan, with the same tranquillity; "but
this time there are two of us, Planchet, and I shall take
all the blows to myself."

"Oh! monsieur, I will not allow that."

"Planchet, you cannot be concerned in it; you would be
obliged to leave your business and your family."

"The affair is not in Paris, then?"

"No."

"Abroad?"

"In England."

"A speculative country, that is true," said Planchet, -- "a
country that I know well. What sort of an affair, monsieur,
without too much curiosity?"

"Planchet, it is a restoration."

"Of monuments?"

"Yes, of monuments; we shall restore Whitehall."

"That is important. And in a month, you think?"

"I shall undertake it."

"That concerns you, monsieur, and when once you are engaged
---- "

"Yes, that concerns me. I know what I am about;
nevertheless, I will freely consult with you."

"You do me great honor; but I know very little about
architecture."

"Planchet, you are wrong; you are an excellent architect,
quite as good as I am, for the case in question."

"Thanks, monsieur. But your old friends of the musketeers?"

"I have been, I confess, tempted to speak of the thing to
those gentlemen, but they are all absent from their houses.
It is vexatious, for I know none more bold or more able."

"Ah! then it appears there will be an opposition, and the
enterprise will be disputed?"

"Oh, yes, Planchet, yes."

"I burn to know the details, monsieur."

"Here they are, Planchet -- close all the doors tight."

"Yes, monsieur." And Planchet double-locked them.

"That is well; now draw near." Planchet obeyed.

"And open the window, because the noise of the passers-by
and the carts will deafen all who might hear us." Planchet
opened the window as desired, and the gust of tumult which
filled the chamber with cries, wheels, barkings, and steps
deafened D'Artagnan himself, as he had wished. He then
swallowed a glass of white wine and began in these terms:
"Planchet, I have an idea."

"Ah! monsieur, I recognize you so well in that!" replied
Planchet, panting with emotion.




CHAPTER 20

Of the Society which was formed in the Rue des Lombards,
at the Sign of the Pilon d'Or, to carry out M. d'Artagnan's Idea



After a moment's silence, in which D'Artagnan appeared to be
collecting, not one idea, but all his ideas -- "It cannot
be, my dear Planchet," said he, "that you have not heard of
his majesty Charles I. of England?"

"Alas! yes, monsieur, since you left France in order to
assist him, and that, in spite of that assistance, he fell,
and was near dragging you down in his fall."

"Exactly so; I see you have a good memory, Planchet."

"Peste! the astonishing thing would be, if I could have lost
that memory, however bad it might have been. When one has
heard Grimaud, who, you know, is not given to talking,
relate how the head of King Charles fell, how you sailed the
half of a night in a scuttled vessel, and saw floating on
the water that good M. Mordaunt with a certain gold-hafted
dagger buried in his breast, one is not very likely to
forget such things."

"And yet there are people who forget them, Planchet."

"Yes, such as have not seen them, or have not heard Grimaud
relate them."

"Well, it is all the better that you recollect all that; I
shall only have to remind you of one thing, and that is that
Charles I. had a son."

"Without contradicting you, monsieur, he had two," said
Planchet; "for I saw the second one in Paris, M. le Duke of
York, one day, as he was going to the Palais Royal, and I
was told that he was not the eldest son of Charles I. As to
the eldest, I have the honor of knowing him by name, but not
personally."

"That is exactly the point, Planchet, we must come to: it is
to this eldest son, formerly called the Prince of Wales, and
who is now styled Charles II., king of England."

"A king without a kingdom, monsieur," replied Planchet,
sententiously.

"Yes, Planchet, and you may add an unfortunate prince, more
unfortunate than the poorest man of the people lost in the
worst quarter of Paris."

Planchet made a gesture full of that sort of compassion
which we grant to strangers with whom we think we can never
possibly find ourselves in contact. Besides, he did not see
in this politico-sentimental operation any sign of the
commercial idea of M. d'Artagnan, and it was in this idea
that D'Artagnan, who was, from habit, pretty well acquainted
with men and things, had principally interested Planchet.

"I am coming to our business. This young Prince of Wales, a
king without a kingdom, as you have so well said, Planchet,
has interested me. I, D'Artagnan, have seen him begging
assistance of Mazarin, who is a miser, and the aid of Louis,
who is a child, and it appeared to me, who am acquainted
with such things, that in the intelligent eye of the fallen
king, in the nobility of his whole person, a nobility
apparent above all his miseries, I could discern the stuff
of a man and the heart of a king."

Planchet tacitly approved of all this; but it did not at
all, in his eyes at least, throw any light upon D'Artagnan's
idea. The latter continued: "This, then, is the reasoning
which I made with myself. Listen attentively, Planchet, for
we are coming to the conclusion."

"I am listening."

"Kings are not so thickly sown upon the earth, that people
can find them whenever they want them. Now, this king
without a kingdom is, in my opinion, a grain of seed which
will blossom in some season or other, provided a skillful,
discreet, and vigorous hand sow it duly and truly, selecting
soil, sky, and time."

Planchet still approved by a nod of his head, which showed
that he did not perfectly comprehend all that was said.

"`Poor little seed of a king,' said I to myself, and really
I was affected, Planchet, which leads me to think I am
entering upon a foolish business. And that is why I wished
to consult you, my friend."

Planchet colored with pleasure and pride.

"`Poor little seed of a king! I will pick you up and cast
you into good ground.'"

"Good God!" said Planchet, looking earnestly at his old
master, as if in doubt as to the state of his reason.

"Well, what is it?" said D'Artagnan; "who hurts you?"

"Me! nothing, monsieur."

"You said, `Good God!'"

"Did I?"

"I am sure you did. Can you already understand?"

"I confess, M. d'Artagnan, that I am afraid ---- "

"To understand?"

"Yes."

"To understand that I wish to replace upon his throne this
King Charles II., who has no throne? Is that it?"

Planchet made a prodigious bound in his chair. "Ah, ah!"
said he, in evident terror, "that is what you call a
restoration!"

"Yes, Planchet; is it not the proper term for it?"

"Oh, no doubt, no doubt! But have you reflected seriously?"

"Upon what?"

"Upon what is going on yonder."

"Where?"

"In England."

"And what is that? let us see, Planchet."

"In the first place, monsieur, I ask your pardon for
meddling in these things, which have nothing to do with my
trade; but since it is an affair that you propose to me --
for you are proposing an affair, are you not? ---- "

"A superb one, Planchet."

"But as it is business you propose to me, I have the right
to discuss it."

"Discuss it, Planchet; out of discussion is born light."

"Well, then, since I have monsieur's permission, I will tell
him that there is yonder, in the first place, the
parliament."

"Well, next?"

"And then the army."

"Good! Do you see anything else?"

"Why, then the nation."

"Is that all?"

"The nation which consented to the overthrow and death of
the late king, the father of this one, and which will not be
willing to belie its acts."

"Planchet," said D'Artagnan, "you argue like a cheese! The
nation -- the nation is tired of these gentlemen who give
themselves such barbarous names, and who sing songs to it.
Chanting for chanting, my dear Planchet; I have remarked
that nations prefer singing a merry chant to the plain
chant. Remember the Fronde; what did they sing in those
times? Well those were good times."

"Not too good, not too good! I was near being hung in those
times."

"Well, but you were not."

"No."

"And you laid the foundation of your fortune in the midst of
all those songs?"

"That is true."

"Then you have nothing to say against them."

"Well, I return, then, to the army and parliament."

"I say that I borrow twenty thousand livres of M. Planchet,
and that I put twenty thousand livres of my own to it, and
with these forty thousand livres I raise an army."

Planchet clasped his hands; he saw that D'Artagnan was in
earnest, and, in good truth, he believed his master had lost
his senses.

"An army! -- ah, monsieur," said he, with his most agreeable
smile, for fear of irritating the madman, and rendering him
furious, -- "an army! -- how many?"

"Of forty men," said D'Artagnan.

"Forty against forty thousand! that is not enough. I know
very well that you, M. d'Artagnan, alone, are equal to a
thousand men, but where are we to find thirty-nine men equal
to you? Or, if we could find them, who would furnish you
with money to pay them?"

"Not bad, Planchet. Ah, the devil! you play the courtier."

"No, monsieur, I speak what I think, and that is exactly why
I say that, in the first pitched battle you fight with your
forty men, I am very much afraid ---- "

"Therefore I shall fight no pitched battles, my dear
Planchet," said the Gascon, laughing. "We have very fine
examples in antiquity of skillful retreats and marches,
which consisted in avoiding the enemy instead of attacking
them. You should know that, Planchet, you who commanded the
Parisians the day on which they ought to have fought against
the musketeers, and who so well calculated marches and
countermarches, that you never left the Palais Royal."

Planchet could not help laughing. "It is plain," replied he,
"that if your forty men conceal themselves, and are not
unskillful, they may hope not to be beaten: but you propose
obtaining some result, do you not?"

"No doubt. This, then, in my opinion, is the plan to be
proceeded upon in order quickly to replace his majesty
Charles II. on his throne."

"Good!" said Planchet, increasing his attention; "let us see
your plan. But in the first place it seems to me we are
forgetting something."

"What is that?"

"We have set aside the nation, which prefers singing merry
songs to psalms, and the army, which we will not fight: but
the parliament remains, and that seldom sings."

"Nor does it fight. How is it, Planchet, that an intelligent
man like you should take any heed of a set of brawlers who
call themselves Rumps and Barebones. The parliament does not
trouble me at all, Planchet."

"As soon as it ceases to trouble you, monsieur, let us pass
on."

"Yes, and arrive at the result. You remember Cromwell,
Planchet?"

"I have heard a great deal of talk about him."

"He was a rough soldier."

"And a terrible eater, moreover."

"What do you mean by that?"

"Why, at one gulp he swallowed all England."

"Well, Planchet, the evening before the day on which he
swallowed England, if any one had swallowed M. Cromwell?"

"Oh, monsieur, it is one of the axioms of mathematics that
the container must be greater than the contained."

"Very well! That is our affair, Planchet."

"But M. Cromwell is dead, and his container is now the
tomb."

"My dear Planchet, I see with pleasure that you have not
only become a mathematician, but a philosopher."

"Monsieur, in my grocery business I use much printed paper,
and that instructs me."

"Bravo! You know then, in that case -- for you have not
learnt mathematics and philosophy without a little history
-- that after this Cromwell so great, there came one who was
very little."

"Yes; he was named Richard, and he has done as you have, M.
d'Artagnan -- he has tendered his resignation."

"Very well said -- very well! After the great man who is
dead, after the little one who tendered his resignation,
there came a third. This one is named Monk; he is an able
general, considering he has never fought a battle; he is a
skillful diplomatist, considering that he never speaks in
public, and that having to say `good-day' to a man, he
meditates twelve hours, and ends by saying `good-night;'
which makes people exclaim `miracle!' seeing that it falls
out correctly."

"That is rather strong," said Planchet; "but I know another
political man who resembles him very much."

"M. Mazarin you mean?"

"Himself."

"You are right, Planchet; only M. Mazarin does not aspire to
the throne of France; and that changes everything. Do you
see? Well, this M. Monk, who has England ready-roasted in
his plate, and who is already opening his mouth to swallow
it -- this M. Monk, who says to the people of Charles II.,
and to Charles II. himself, `Nescio vos' ---- "

"I don't understand English," said Planchet.

"Yes, but I understand it," said D'Artagnan. "`Nescio vos'
means `I do not know you.' This M. Monk, the most important
man in England, when he shall have swallowed it ---- "

"Well?" asked Planchet.

"Well, my friend, I shall go over yonder, and with my forty
men, I shall carry him off, pack him up, and bring him into
France, where two modes of proceeding present themselves to
my dazzled eyes."

"Oh! and to mine too," cried Planchet, transported with
enthusiasm. "We will put him in a cage and show him for
money."

"Well, Planchet, that is a third plan, of which I had not
thought."

"Do you think it a good one?"

"Yes, certainly, but I think mine better."

"Let us see yours, then."

"In the first place, I shall set a ransom on him."

"Of how much?"

"Peste! a fellow like that must be well worth a hundred
thousand crowns."

"Yes, yes!"

"You see, then -- in the first place, a ransom of a hundred
thousand crowns."

"Or else ---- "

"Or else, what is much better, I deliver him up to King
Charles, who, having no longer either a general or an army
to fear, nor a diplomatist to trick him, will restore
himself, and when once restored, will pay down to me the
hundred thousand crowns in question. That is the idea I have
formed; what do you say to it, Planchet?"

"Magnificent, monsieur!" cried Planchet, trembling with
emotion. "How did you conceive that idea?"

"It came to me one morning on the banks of the Loire, whilst
our beloved king, Louis XIV., was pretending to weep upon
the hand of Mademoiselle de Mancini."

"Monsieur, I declare the idea is sublime. But ---- "

"Ah! is there a but?"

"Permit me! But this is a little like the skin of that fine
bear -- you know -- that they were about to sell, but which
it was necessary to take from the back of the living bear.
Now, to take M. Monk, there will be a bit of scuffle, I
should think."

"No doubt; but as I shall raise an army to ---- "

"Yes, yes -- I understand, parbleu! -- a coup-de-main. Yes,
then, monsieur, you will triumph, for no one equals you in
such sorts of encounters."

"I certainly am lucky in them," said D'Artagnan, with a
proud simplicity. "You know that if for this affair I had my
dear Athos, my brave Porthos, and my cunning Aramis, the
business would be settled; but they are all lost, as it
appears, and nobody knows where to find them. I will do it,
then, alone. Now, do you find the business good, and the
investment advantageous?"

"Too much so -- too much so."

"How can that be?"

"Because fine things never reach the expected point."

"This is infallible, Planchet, and the proof is that I
undertake it. It will be for you a tolerably pretty gain,
and for me a very interesting stroke. It will be said, `Such
was the old age of M. d'Artagnan,' and I shall hold a place
in tales and even in history itself, Planchet. I am greedy
of honor."

"Monsieur," cried Planchet, "when I think that it is here,
in my home, in the midst of my sugar, my prunes, and my
cinnamon, that this gigantic project is ripened, my shop
seems a palace to me."

"Beware, beware, Planchet! If the least report of this
escapes, there is the Bastile for both of us. Beware, my
friend, for this is a plot we are hatching. M. Monk is the
ally of M. Mazarin -- beware!"

"Monsieur, when a man has had the honor to belong to you, he
knows nothing of fear; and when he has the advantage of
being bound up in interests with you, he holds his tongue."

"Very well, that is more your affair than mine, seeing that
in a week I shall be in England."

"Depart, monsieur, depart -- the sooner the better."

"Is the money, then, ready?"

"It will be to-morrow, to-morrow you shall receive it from
my own hands. Will you have gold or silver?"

"Gold; that is most convenient. But how are we going to
arrange this? Let us see."

"Oh, good Lord! in the simplest way possible. You shall give
me a receipt, that is all."

"No, no," said D'Artagnan, warmly; "we must preserve order
in all things."

"That is likewise my opinion; but with you, M. d'Artagnan
---- "

"And if I should die yonder -- if I should be killed by a
musket-ball -- if I should burst from drinking beer?"

"Monsieur, I beg you to believe that in that case I should
be so much afflicted at your death, that I should not think
about the money."

"Thank you, Planchet; but no matter. We shall, like two
lawyers' clerks, draw up together an agreement, a sort of
act, which may be called a deed of company."

"Willingly, monsieur."

"I know it is difficult to draw such a thing up, but we can
try."

"Let us try, then." And Planchet went in search of pens,
ink, and paper. D'Artagnan took the pen and wrote: --
"Between Messire d'Artagnan, ex-lieutenant of the king's
musketeers, at present residing in the Rue Tiquetonne, Hotel
de la Chevrette; and the Sieur Planchet, grocer, residing in
the Rue les Lombards, at the sign of the Pilon d'Or, it has
been agreed as follows: -- A company, with a capital of
forty thousand livres, and formed for the purpose of
carrying out an idea conceived by M. d'Artagnan, and the
said Planchet approving of it in all points, will place
twenty thousand livres in the hands of M. d'Artagnan. He
will require neither repayment nor interest before the
return of M. d'Artagnan from a journey he is about to take
into England. On his part, M. d'Artagnan undertakes to find
twenty thousand livres, which he will join to the twenty
thousand already laid down by the Sieur Planchet. He will
employ the said sum of forty thousand livres according to
his judgment in an undertaking which is described below. On
the day when M. d'Artagnan shall have re-established, by
whatever means, his majesty King Charles II. upon the throne
of England, he will pay into the hands of M. Planchet the
sum of ---- "

"The sum of a hundred and fifty thousand livres," said
Planchet, innocently, perceiving that D'Artagnan hesitated.

"Oh, the devil, no!" said D'Artagnan, "the division cannot
be made by half; that would not be just."

"And yet, monsieur; we each lay down half," objected
Planchet, timidly.

"Yes; but listen to this clause, my dear Planchet, and if
you do not find it equitable in every respect when it is
written, well, we can scratch it out again: --
`Nevertheless, as M. d'Artagnan brings to the association,
besides his capital of twenty thousand livres, his time, his
idea, his industry and his skin, -- things which he
appreciates strongly, particularly the last, -- M.
d'Artagnan will keep, of the three hundred thousand livres
two hundred thousand livres for himself, which will make his
share two-thirds."

"Very well," said Planchet.

"Is it just?" asked D'Artagnan.

"Perfectly just, monsieur."

"And you will be contented with a hundred thousand livres?"

"Peste! I think so. A hundred thousand for twenty thousand!"

"And in a month, understand."

"How, in a month?"

"Yes, I only ask one month."

"Monsieur," said Planchet, generously, "I give you six
weeks."

"Thank you," replied the musketeer, politely; after which
the two partners reperused their deed.

"That is perfect, monsieur," said Planchet, "and the late M.
Coquenard, the first husband of Madame la Baronne du Vallon,
could not have done it better."

"Do you find it so? Let us sign it, then." And both affixed
their signatures.

"In this fashion," said D'Artagnan, "I shall be under
obligations to no one."

"But I shall be under obligations to you," said Planchet.

"No; for whatever store I set by it, Planchet, I may lose my
skin yonder, and you will lose all. A propos -- peste! --
that makes me think of the principal, an indispensable
clause. I shall write it: -- `In the case of M. d'Artagnan
dying in this enterprise, liquidation will be considered
made, and the Sieur Planchet will give quittance from that
moment to the shade of Messire d'Artagnan for the twenty
thousand livres paid by him into the hands of the said
company.'"

This last clause made Planchet knit his brows a little, but
when he saw the brilliant eye, the muscular hand, the supple
and strong back of his associate, he regained his courage,
and, without regret, he at once added another stroke to his
signature. D'Artagnan did the same. Thus was drawn the first
known company contract; perhaps such things have been abused
a little since, both in form and principle.

"Now," said Planchet, pouring out the last glass of Anjou
wine for D'Artagnan, -- "now go to sleep, my dear master."

"No," replied D'Artagnan; "for the most difficult part now
remains to be done, and I will think over that difficult
part."

"Bah!" said Planchet; "I have such great confidence in you,
M. d'Artagnan, that I would not give my hundred thousand
livres for ninety thousand livres down."

"And devil take me if I don't think you are right!" Upon
which D'Artagnan took a candle and went up to his bedroom.




CHAPTER 21

In which D'Artagnan prepares to travel
for the Firm of Planchet and Company



D'Artagnan reflected to such good purpose during the night
that his plan was settled by morning. "This is it," said he,
sitting up in bed, supporting his elbow on his knee, and his
chin in his hand; -- "this is it. I shall seek out forty
steady, firm men, recruited among people a little
compromised, but having habits of discipline. I shall
promise them five hundred livres for a month if they return,
nothing if they do not return, or half for their kindred. As
to food and lodging, that concerns the English, who have
cattle in their pastures, bacon in their bacon-racks, fowls
in their poultry-yards, and corn in their barns. I will
present myself to General Monk with my little body of
troops. He will receive me. I shall win his confidence, and
take advantage of it, as soon as possible."

But without going farther, D'Artagnan shook his head and
interrupted himself. "No," said he; "I should not dare to
relate this to Athos; the way is therefore not honorable. I
must use violence," continued he, -- "very certainly I must,
but without compromising my loyalty. With forty men I will
traverse the country as a partisan. But if I fall in with,
not forty thousand English, as Planchet said, but purely and
simply with four hundred, I shall be beaten. Supposing that
among my forty warriors there should be found at least ten
stupid ones -- ten who will allow themselves to be killed
one after the other, from mere folly? No; it is, in fact,
impossible to find forty men to be depended upon -- they do
not exist. I must learn how to be contented with thirty.
With ten men less I should have the right of avoiding any
armed encounter, on account of the small number of my
people; and if the encounter should take place, my chance is
better with thirty men than forty. Besides, I should save
five thousand francs; that is to say, the eighth of my
capital; that is worth the trial. This being so, I should
have thirty men. I shall divide them into three bands, -- we
will spread ourselves about over the country, with an
injunction to reunite at a given moment; in this fashion,
ten by ten, we should excite no suspicion -- we should pass
unperceived. Yes, yes, thirty -- that is a magic number.
There are three tens -- three, that divine number! And then,
truly, a company of thirty men, when all together, will look
rather imposing. Ah! stupid wretch that I am!" continued
D'Artagnan, "I want thirty horses. That is ruinous. Where
the devil was my head when I forgot the horses? We cannot,
however, think of striking such a blow without horses. Well,
so be it, that sacrifice must be made; we can get the horses
in the country -- they are not bad, besides. But I forgot --
peste! Three bands -- that necessitates three leaders; there
is the difficulty. Of the three commanders I have already
one -- that is myself; -- yes, but the two others will of
themselves cost almost as much money as all the rest of the
troop. No; positively I must have but one lieutenant. In
that ease, then, I should reduce my troop to twenty men. I
know very well that twenty men is but very little; but since
with thirty I was determined not to seek to come to blows, I
should do so more carefully still with twenty. Twenty --
that is a round number; that, besides, reduces the number of
the horses by ten, which is a consideration; and then, with
a good lieutenant -- Mordioux! what things patience and
calculation are! Was I not going to embark with forty men,
and I have now reduced them to twenty for an equal success?
Ten thousand livres saved at one stroke, and more safety;
that is well! Now, then, let us see; we have nothing to do
but to find this lieutenant -- let him be found, then; and
after -- That is not so easy; he must be brave and good, a
second myself. Yes, but a lieutenant must have my secret,
and as that secret is worth a million, and I shall only pay
my man a thousand livres, fifteen hundred at the most, my
man will sell the secret to Monk. Mordioux! no lieutenant.
Besides, this man, were he as mute as a disciple of
Pythagoras, -- this man would be sure to have in the troop
some favourite soldier, whom he would make his sergeant, the
sergeant would penetrate the secret of the lieutenant, in
case the latter should be honest and unwilling to sell it.
Then the sergeant, less honest and less ambitious, will give
up the whole for fifty thousand livres. Come, come! that is
impossible. The lieutenant is impossible. But then I must
have no fractions; I cannot divide my troop into two, and
act upon two points, at once, without another self, who --
But what is the use of acting upon two points, as we have
only one man to take? What can be the good of weakening a
corps by placing the right here, and the left there? A
single corps -- Mordioux! a single one, and that commanded
by D'Artagnan. Very well. But twenty men marching in one
band are suspected by everybody; twenty horsemen must not be
seen marching together, or a company will be detached
against them and the password will be required; the which
company, upon seeing them embarrassed to give it, would
shoot M. d'Artagnan and his men like so many rabbits. I
reduce myself then to ten men; in this fashion I shall act
simply and with unity; I shall be forced to be prudent,
which is half the success in an affair of the kind I am
undertaking; a greater number might, perhaps, have drawn me
into some folly. Ten horses are not many, either to buy or
take. A capital idea; what tranquillity it infuses into my
mind! no more suspicions -- no passwords -- no more dangers!
Ten men, they are valets or clerks. Ten men, leading ten
horses laden with merchandise of whatever kind, are
tolerated, well received everywhere. Ten men travel on
account of the house of Planchet & Co., of France -- nothing
can be said against that. These ten men, clothed like
manufacturers, have a good cutlass or a good musket at their
saddle-bow, and a good pistol in the holster. They never
allow themselves to be uneasy, because they have no evil
designs. They are, perhaps, in truth, a little disposed to
be smugglers, but what harm is in that? Smuggling is not,
like polygamy, a hanging offense. The worst that can happen
to us is the confiscation of our merchandise. Our
merchandise confiscated -- fine affair that! Come, come! it
is a superb plan. Ten men only -- ten men, whom I will
engage for my service; ten men who shall be as resolute as
forty, who would cost me four times as much, and to whom,
for greater security, I will never open my mouth as to my
designs, and to whom I shall only say, `My friends, there is
a blow to be struck.' Things being after this fashion, Satan
will be very malicious if he plays me one of his tricks.
Fifteen thousand livres saved -- that's superb -- out of
twenty!"

Thus fortified by his laborious calculations, D'Artagnan
stopped at this plan, and determined to change nothing in
it. He had already on a list furnished by his inexhaustible
memory, ten men illustrious amongst the seekers of
adventures, ill-treated by fortune, and not on good terms
with justice. Upon this D'Artagnan rose, and instantly set
off on the search, telling Planchet not to expect him to
breakfast, and perhaps not to dinner. A day and a half spent
in rummaging amongst certain dens of Paris sufficed for his
recruiting; and, without allowing his adventurers to
communicate with each other, he had picked up and got
together, in less than thirty hours, a charming collection
of ill-looking faces, speaking a French less pure than the
English they were about to attempt. These men were, for the
most part, guards, whose merit D'Artagnan had had an
opportunity of appreciating in various encounters, whom
drunkenness, unlucky sword-thrusts, unexpected winnings at
play, or the economical reforms of Mazarin, had forced to
seek shade and solitude, those two great consolers of
irritated and chafing spirits. They bore upon their
countenances and in their vestments the traces of the
heartaches they had undergone. Some had their visages
scarred, -- all had their clothes in rags. D'Artagnan
comforted the most needy of these brotherly miseries by a
prudent distribution of the crowns of the society; then,
having taken care that these crowns should be employed in
the physical improvement of the troop, he appointed a
trysting place in the north of France, between Berghes and
Saint Omer. Six days were allowed as the utmost term, and
D'Artagnan was sufficiently acquainted with the good-will,
the good-humor, and the relative probity of these
illustrious recruits, to be certain that not one of them
would fail in his appointment. These orders given, this
rendezvous fixed, he went to bid farewell to Planchet, who
asked news of his army. D'Artagnan did not think proper to
inform him of the reduction he had made in his personnel. He
feared that the confidence of his associate would be abated
by such an avowal. Planchet was delighted to learn that the
army was levied, and that he (Planchet) found himself a kind
of half king, who from his throne-counter kept in pay a body
of troops destined to make war against perfidious Albion,
that enemy of all true French hearts. Planchet paid down in
double louis, twenty thousand livres to D'Artagnan, on the
part of himself (Planchet), and twenty thousand livres,
still in double louis, in account with D'Artagnan.
D'Artagnan placed each of the twenty thousand francs in a
bag, and weighing a hag in each hand, -- "This money is very
embarrassing, my dear Planchet," said he. "Do you know this
weighs thirty pounds?"

"Bah! your horse will carry that like a feather."

D'Artagnan shook his head. "Don't tell me such things,
Planchet: a horse overloaded with thirty pounds, in addition
to the rider and his portmanteau, cannot cross a river so
easily -- cannot leap over a wall or ditch so lightly; and
the horse failing, the horseman fails. It is true that you,
Planchet, who have served in the infantry, may not be aware
of all that."

"Then what is to be done, monsieur?" said Planchet, greatly
embarrassed.

"Listen to me," said D'Artagnan. "I will pay my army on its
return home. Keep my half of twenty thousand livres, which
you can use during that time."

"And my half?" said Planchet.

"I shall take that with me."

"Your confidence does me honor," said Planchet: "but
supposing you should not return?"

"That is possible, though not very probable. Then, Planchet,
in case I should not return -- give me a pen! I will make my
will." D'Artagnan took a pen and some paper, and wrote upon
a plain sheet, -- "I, D'Artagnan, possess twenty thousand
livres, laid up cent by cent during thirty years that I have
been in the service of his majesty the king of France. I
leave five thousand to Athos, five thousand to Porthos and
five thousand to Aramis, that they may give the said sums in
my name and their own to my young friend Raoul, Vicomte de
Bragelonne. I give the remaining five thousand to Planchet,
that he may distribute the fifteen thousand with less regret
among my friends. With which purpose I sign these presents.
-- D'Artagnan.

Planchet appeared very curious to know what D'Artagnan had
written.

"Here," said the musketeer, "read it"

On reading the last lines the tears came into Planchet's
eyes. "You think, then, that I would not have given the
money without that? Then I will have none of your five
thousand francs."

D'Artagnan smiled. "Accept it, accept it, Planchet; and in
that way you will only lose fifteen thousand francs instead
of twenty thousand, and you will not be tempted to disregard
the signature of your master and friend, by losing nothing
at all."

How well that dear Monsieur d'Artagnan knew the hearts of
men and grocers! They who have pronounced Don Quixote mad
because he rode out to the conquest of an empire with nobody
but Sancho, his squire, and they who have pronounced Sancho
mad because he accompanied his master in his attempt to
conquer the said empire, -- they certainly will have no
hesitation in extending the same judgment to D'Artagnan and
Planchet. And yet the first passed for one of the most
subtle spirits among the astute spirits of the court of
France. As to the second, he had acquired by good right the
reputation of having one of the longest heads among the
grocers of the Rue des Lombards; consequently of Paris, and
consequently of France. Now, to consider these two men from
the point of view from which you would consider other men,
and the means by the aid of which they contemplated to
restore a monarch to his throne, compared with other means,
the shallowest brains of the country where brains are most
shallow must have revolted against the presumptuous madness
of the lieutenant and the stupidity of his associate.
Fortunately, D'Artagnan was not a man to listen to the idle
talk of those around him, or to the comments that were made
on himself. He had adopted the motto, "Act well, and let
people talk." Planchet on his part, had adopted this, "Act
and say nothing." It resulted from this, that, according to
the custom of all superior geniuses, these two men flattered
themselves intra pectus, with being in the right against all
who found fault with them.

As a beginning, D'Artagnan set out in the finest of possible
weather, without a cloud in the heavens -- without a cloud
on his mind, joyous and strong, calm and decided, great in
his resolution, and consequently carrying with him a tenfold
dose of that potent fluid which the shocks of mind cause to
spring from the nerves, and which procure for the human
machine a force and an influence of which future ages will
render, according to all probability, a more arithmetical
account than we can possibly do at present. He was again, as
in times past, on that same road of adventures which had led
him to Boulogne, and which he was now traveling for the
fourth time. It appeared to him that he could almost
recognize the trace of his own steps upon the road, and that
of his first upon the doors of the hostelries; -- his
memory, always active and present, brought back that youth
which neither thirty years later his great heart nor his
wrist of steel would have belied. What a rich nature was
that of this man! He had all the passions, all the defects,
all the weaknesses, and the spirit of contradiction familiar
to his understanding changed all these imperfections into
corresponding qualities. D'Artagnan, thanks to his ever
active imagination, was afraid of a shadow; and ashamed of
being afraid, he marched straight up to that shadow, and
then became extravagant in his bravery if the danger proved
to be real. Thus everything in him was emotion, and
therefore enjoyment. He loved the society of others, but
never became tired of his own; and more than once, if he
could have been heard when he was alone, he might have been
seen laughing at the jokes he related to himself or the
tricks his imagination created just five minutes before
ennui might have been looked for. D'Artagnan was not perhaps
so gay this time as he would have been with the prospect of
finding some good friends at Calais, instead of joining the
ten scamps there; melancholy, however, did not visit him
more than once a day, and it was about five visits that he
received from that somber deity before he got sight of the
sea at Boulogne, and then these visits were indeed but
short. But when once D'Artagnan found himself near the field
of action, all other feelings but that of confidence
disappeared never to return. From Boulogne he followed the
coast to Calais. Calais was the place of general rendezvous,
and at Calais he had named to each of his recruits the
hostelry of "Le Grand Monarque," where living was not
extravagant, where sailors messed, and where men of the
sword, with sheath of leather, be it understood, found
lodging, table, food, and all the comforts of life, for
thirty sous per diem. D'Artagnan proposed to himself to take
them by surprise in flagrante delicto of wandering life, and
to judge by the first appearance if he could count on them
as trusty companions.

He arrived at Calais at half past four in the afternoon.




CHAPTER 22

D'Artagnan travels for the House of Planchet and Company



The hostelry of "Le Grand Monarque" was situated in a little
street parallel to the port without looking out upon the
port itself. Some lanes cut -- as steps cut the two
parallels of the ladder -- the two great straight lines of
the port and the street. By these lanes passengers came
suddenly from the port into the street, or from the street
on to the port. D'Artagnan, arrived at the port, took one of
these lanes, and came out in front of the hostelry of "Le
Grand Monarque." The moment was well chosen and might remind
D'Artagnan of his start in life at the hostelry of the
"Franc-Meunier" at Meung. Some sailors who had been playing
at dice had started a quarrel, and were threatening each
other furiously. The host, hostess, and two lads were
watching with anxiety the circle of these angry gamblers,
from the midst of which war seemed ready to break forth,
bristling with knives and hatchets. The play, nevertheless,
was continued. A stone bench was occupied by two men, who
appeared thence to watch the door; four tables, placed at
the back of the common chamber, were occupied by eight other
individuals. Neither the men at the door, nor those at the
tables, took any part in the play or the quarrel. D'Artagnan
recognized his ten men in these cold, indifferent
spectators. The quarrel went on increasing. Every passion
has, like the sea, its tide which ascends and descends.
Reaching the climax of passion, one sailor overturned the
table and the money which was upon it. The table fell, and
the money rolled about. In an instant all belonging to the
hostelry threw themselves upon the stakes, and many a piece
of silver was picked up by people who stole away whilst the
sailors were scuffling with each other.

The two men on the bench and the eight at the tables,
although they seemed perfect strangers to each other, these
ten men alone, we say, appeared to have agreed to remain
impassible amidst the cries of fury and the chinking of
money. Two only contented themselves with pushing with their
feet combatants who came under their table. Two others,
rather than take part in this disturbance, buried their
hands in their pockets; and another two jumped upon the
table they occupied, as people do to avoid being submerged
by overflowing water.

"Come, come," said D'Artagnan to himself, not having lost
one of the details we have related, "this is a very fair
gathering -- circumspect, calm, accustomed to disturbance,
acquainted with blows! Peste! I have been lucky."

All at once his attention was called to a particular part of
the room. The two men who had pushed the strugglers with
their feet were assailed with abuse by the sailors, who had
become reconciled. One of them, half drunk with passion, and
quite drunk with beer, came, in a menacing manner, to demand
of the shorter of these two sages by what right he had
touched with his foot creatures of the good God, who were
not dogs. And whilst putting this question, in order to make
it more direct, he applied his great fist to the nose of
D'Artagnan's recruit.

This man became pale, without its being to be discerned
whether his pallor arose from anger or from fear; seeing
which, the sailor concluded it was from fear, and raised his
fist with the manifest intention of letting it fall upon the
head of the stranger. But though the threatened man did not
appear to move, he dealt the sailor such a severe blow in
the stomach that he sent him rolling and howling to the
other side of the room. At the same instant, rallied by the
esprit de corps, all the comrades of the conquered man fell
upon the conqueror.

The latter, with the same coolness of which he had given
proof, without committing the imprudence of touching his
weapons, took up a beer-pot with a pewter-lid, and knocked
down two or three of his assailants; then, as he was about
to yield to numbers, the seven other silent men at the
tables, who had not stirred, perceived that their cause was
at stake, and came to the rescue. At the same time, the two
indifferent spectators at the door turned round with
frowning brows, indicating their evident intention of taking
the enemy in the rear, if the enemy did not cease their
aggressions.

The host, his helpers, and two watchmen who were passing,
and who from curiosity had penetrated too far into the room,
were mixed up in the tumult and showered with blows. The
Parisians hit like Cyclops, with an ensemble and a tactic
delightful to behold. At length, obliged to beat a retreat
before superior numbers, they formed an intrenchment behind
the large table, which they raised by main force; whilst the
two others, arming themselves each with a trestle, and using
it like a great sledge-hammer, knocked down at a blow eight
sailors upon whose heads they had brought their monstrous
catapult in play. The floor was already strewn with wounded,
and the room filled with cries and dust, when D'Artagnan,
satisfied with the test, advanced, sword in hand, and
striking with the pommel every head that came in his way, he
uttered a vigorous hola! which put an instantaneous end to
the conflict. A great backflood directly took place from the
center to the sides of the room, so that D'Artagnan found
himself isolated and dominator.

"What is all this about?" then demanded he of the assembly,
with the majestic tone of Neptune pronouncing the Quos ego.

At the very instant, at the first sound of his voice, to
carry on the Virgilian metaphor, D'Artagnan's recruits,
recognizing each his sovereign lord, discontinued their
plank-fighting and trestle blows. On their side, the
sailors, seeing that long naked sword, that martial air, and
the agile arm which came to the rescue of their enemies, in
the person of a man who seemed accustomed to command, the
sailors picked up their wounded and their pitchers. The
Parisians wiped their brows, and viewed their leader with
respect. D'Artagnan was loaded with thanks by the host of
"Le Grand Monarque." He received them like a man who knows
that nothing is being offered that does not belong to him,
and then said he would go and walk upon the port till supper
was ready. Immediately each of the recruits, who understood
the summons, took his hat, brushed the dust off his clothes,
and followed D'Artagnan. But D'Artagnan whilst walking and
observing, took care not to stop; he directed his course
towards the downs, and the ten men -- surprised at finding
themselves going in the track of each other, uneasy at
seeing on their right, on their left, and behind them,
companions upon whom they had not reckoned -- followed him,
casting furtive glances at each other. It was not till he
had arrived at the hollow part of the deepest down that
D'Artagnan, smiling to see them outdone, turned towards
them, making a friendly sign with his hand.

"Eh! come, come, gentlemen," said he, "let us not devour
each other; you are made to live together, to understand
each other in all respects, and not to devour one another."

Instantly all hesitation ceased; the men breathed as if they
had been taken out of a coffin, and examined each other
complacently. After this examination they turned their eyes
towards their leader, who had long been acquainted with the
art of speaking to men of that class, and who improvised the
following little speech, pronounced with an energy truly
Gascon:

"Gentlemen, you all know who I am. I have engaged you from
knowing you to be brave, and willing to associate you with
me in a glorious enterprise. Imagine that in laboring for me
you labor for the king. I only warn you that if you allow
anything of this supposition to appear, I shall be forced to
crack your skulls immediately, in the manner most convenient
to me. You are not ignorant, gentlemen, that state secrets
are like a mortal poison: as long as that poison is in its
box and the box is closed, it is not injurious; out of the
box, it kills. Now draw near and you shall know as much of
this secret as I am able to tell you." All drew close to him
with an expression of curiosity. "Approach," continued
D'Artagnan, "and let not the bird which passes over our
heads, the rabbit which sports on the downs, the fish which
bounds from the waters, hear us. Our business is to learn
and to report to monsieur le surintendant of the finances to
what extent English smuggling is injurious to the French
merchants. I shall enter every place, and see everything. We
are poor Picard fishermen, thrown upon the coast by a storm.
It is certain that we must sell fish, neither more nor less,
like true fishermen. Only people might guess who we are, and
might molest us; it is therefore necessary that we should be
in a condition to defend ourselves. And this is why I have
selected men of spirit and courage. We shall lead a steady
life, and not incur much danger; seeing that we have behind
us a powerful protector, thanks to whom no embarrassment is
possible. One thing alone puzzles me; but I hope that after
a short explanation, you will relieve me from that
difficulty. The thing which puzzles me is taking with me a
crew of stupid fishermen, which crew will annoy me
immensely, whilst if, by chance, there were among you any
who have seen the sea ---- "

"Oh! don't let that trouble you," said one of the recruits;
"I was a prisoner among the pirates of Tunis three years,
and can maneuver a boat like an admiral."

"See," said D'Artagnan, "what an admirable thing chance is!"
D'Artagnan pronounced these words with an indefinable tone
of feigned bonhomie, for he knew very well that the victim
of pirates was an old corsair, and had engaged him in
consequence of that knowledge. But D'Artagnan never said
more than there was need to say, in order to leave people in
doubt. He paid himself with the explanation, and welcomed
the effect, without appearing to be preoccupied with the
cause.

"And I," said a second, "I, by chance, had an uncle who
directed the works of the port of La Rochelle. When quite a
child, I played about the boats, and I know how to handle an
oar or a sail as well as the best Ponantais sailor." The
latter did not lie much more than the first, for he had
rowed on board his majesty's galleys six years, at Ciotat.
Two others were more frank: they confessed honestly that
they had served on board a vessel as soldiers on punishment,
and did not blush for it. D'Artagnan found himself, then,
the leader of ten men of war and four sailors, having at
once a land army and a sea force, which would have earned
the pride of Planchet to its height, if Planchet had known
the details.

Nothing was now left but arranging the general orders, and
D'Artagnan gave them with precision. He enjoined his men to
be ready to set out for the Hague, some following the coast
which leads to Breskens, others the road to Antwerp. The
rendezvous was given, by calculating each day's march, a
fortnight from that time upon the chief place at the Hague.
D'Artagnan recommended his men to go in couples, as they
liked best, from sympathy. He himself selected from among
those with the least disreputable look, two guards whom he
had formerly known, and whose only faults were being
drunkards and gamblers. These men had not entirely lost all
ideas of civilization, and under proper garments their
hearts would beat again. D'Artagnan, not to create any
jealousy with the others, made the rest go forward. He kept
his two selected ones, clothed them from his own wardrobe,
and set out with them.

It was to these two, whom he seemed to honor with an
absolute confidence, that D'Artagnan imparted a false
secret, destined to secure the success of the expedition. He
confessed to them that the object was not to learn to what
extent the French merchants were injured by English
smuggling, but to learn how far French smuggling could annoy
English trade. These men appeared convinced; they were
effectively so. D'Artagnan was quite sure that at the first
debauch when thoroughly drunk, one of the two would divulge
the secret to the whole band. His game appeared infallible.

A fortnight after all we have said had taken place at
Calais, the whole troop assembled at the Hague.

Then D'Artagnan perceived that all his men, with remarkable
intelligence, had already travestied themselves into
sailors, more or less ill-treated by the sea. D'Artagnan
left them to sleep in a den in Newkerke street, whilst he
lodged comfortably upon the Grand Canal. He learned that the
king of England had come back to his old ally, William II.
of Nassau, stadtholder of Holland. He learned also that the
refusal of Louis XIV. had a little cooled the protection
afforded him up to that time, and in consequence he had gone
to reside in a little village house at Scheveningen,
situated in the downs, on the sea-shore, about a league from
the Hague.

There, it was said, the unfortunate banished king consoled
himself in his exile, by looking, with the melancholy
peculiar to the princes of his race, at that immense North
Sea, which separated him from his England, as it had
formerly separated Mary Stuart from France. There behind the
trees of the beautiful wood of Scheveningen on the fine sand
upon which grows the golden broom of the down, Charles II.
vegetated as it did, more unfortunate, for he had life and
thought, and he hoped and despaired by turns.

D'Artagnan went once as far as Scheveningen, in order to be
certain that all was true that was said of the king. He
beheld Charles II., pensive and alone, coming out of a
little door opening into the wood, and walking on the beach
in the setting sun, without even attracting the attention of
the fishermen, who, on their return in the evening, drew,
like the ancient mariners of the Archipelago, their barks up
upon the sand of the shore.

D'Artagnan recognized the king; he saw him fix his
melancholy look upon the immense extent of the waters, and
absorb upon his pale countenance the red rays of the sun
already cut by the black line of the horizon. Then Charles
returned to his isolated abode, always alone, slow and sad,
amusing himself with making the friable and moving sand
creak beneath his feet.

That very evening D'Artagnan hired for a thousand livres a
fishing-boat worth four thousand. He paid a thousand livres
down, and deposited the three thousand with a Burgomaster,
after which he brought on board without their being seen,
the ten men who formed his land army; and with the rising
tide, at three o'clock in the morning, he got into the open
sea, maneuvering ostensibly with the four others, and
depending upon the science of his galley slave as upon that
of the first pilot of the port.




CHAPTER 23

In which the Author, very unwillingly, is forced to write a Little History



While kings and men were thus occupied with England, which
governed itself quite alone, and which, it must be said in
its praise, had never been so badly governed, a man upon
whom God had fixed his eye, and placed his finger, a man
predestined to write his name in brilliant letters upon the
page of history, was pursuing in the face of the world a
work full of mystery and audacity. He went on, and no one
knew whither he meant to go, although not only England, but
France, and Europe, watched him marching with a firm step
and head held high. All that was known of this man we are
about to tell.

Monk had just declared himself in favor of the liberty of
the Rump Parliament, a parliament which General Lambert,
imitating Cromwell, whose lieutenant he had been, had just
blocked up so closely, in order to bring it to his will,
that no member, during all the blockade, was able to go out,
and only one, Peter Wentworth, had been able to get in.

Lambert and Monk -- everything was summed up in these two
men; the first representing military despotism, the second
pure republicanism. These men were the two sole political
representatives of that revolution in which Charles I. had
first lost his crown, and afterwards his head. As regarded
Lambert, he did not dissemble his views; he sought to
establish a military government, and to be himself the head
of that government.

Monk, a rigid republican, some said, wished to maintain the
Rump Parliament, that visible though degenerated
representative of the republic. Monk, artful and ambitious,
said others, wished simply to make of this parliament, which
he affected to protect, a solid step by which to mount the
throne which Cromwell had left empty, but upon which he had
never dared to take his seat.

Thus Lambert by persecuting the parliament, and Monk by
declaring for it, had mutually proclaimed themselves enemies
of each other. Monk and Lambert, therefore, had at first
thought of creating an army each for himself: Monk in
Scotland, where were the Presbyterians and the royalists,
that is to say, the malcontents; Lambert in London, where
was found, as is always the case, the strongest opposition
to the existing power which it had beneath its eyes.

Monk had pacified Scotland, he had there formed for himself
an army, and found an asylum. The one watched the other.
Monk knew that the day was not yet come, the day marked by
the Lord for a great change; his sword, therefore, appeared
glued to the sheath. Inexpugnable, in his wild and
mountainous Scotland, an absolute general, king of an army
of eleven thousand old soldiers, whom he had more than once
led on to victory; as well informed, nay, even better, of
the affairs of London, than Lambert, who held garrison in
the city, -- such was the position of Monk, when, at a
hundred leagues from London, he declared himself for the
parliament. Lambert, on the contrary, as we have said, lived
in the capital. That was the center of all his operations,
and he there collected around him all his friends, and all
the people of the lower class, eternally inclined to cherish
the enemies of constituted power.

It was then in London that Lambert learnt the support that,
from the frontiers of Scotland, Monk lent to the parliament.
He judged there was no time to be lost, and that the Tweed
was not so far distant from the Thames that an army could
not march from one river to the other, particularly when it
was well commanded. He knew, besides, that as fast as the
soldiers of Monk penetrated into England, they would form on
their route that ball of snow, the emblem of the globe of
fortune, which is for the ambitious nothing but a step
growing unceasingly higher to conduct him to his object. He
got together, therefore, his army, formidable at the same
time for its composition and its numbers, and hastened to
meet Monk, who, on his part, like a prudent navigator
sailing amidst rocks, advanced by very short marches,
listening to the reports and scenting the air which came
from London.

The two armies came in sight of each other near Newcastle,
Lambert, arriving first, encamped in the city itself. Monk,
always circumspect, stopped where he was, and placed his
general quarters at Coldstream, on the Tweed. The sight of
Lambert spread joy through Monk's army, whilst, on the
contrary, the sight of Monk threw disorder into Lambert's
army. It might have been thought that these intrepid
warriors, who had made such a noise in the streets of
London, had set out with the hopes of meeting no one, and
that now seeing that they had met an army, and that that
army hoisted before them not only a standard, but still
further, a cause and a principle, -- it might have been
believed, we say, that these intrepid warriors had begun to
reflect, that they were less good republicans than the
soldiers of Monk, since the latter supported the parliament;
whilst Lambert supported nothing, not even himself.

As to Monk, if he had had to reflect, or if he did reflect,
it must have been after a sad fashion, for history relates
-- and that modest dame, it is well known, never lies --
history relates, that the day of his arrival at Coldstream
search was made in vain throughout the place for a single
sheep.

If Monk had commanded an English army, that was enough to
have brought about a general desertion. But it is not with
the Scotch as it is with the English, to whom that fluid
flesh which is called blood is a paramount necessity; the
Scotch, a poor and sober race, live upon a little barley
crushed between two stones, diluted with the water of the
fountain, and cooked upon another stone, heated.

The Scotch, their distribution of barley being made, cared
very little whether there was or was not any meat in
Coldstream. Monk, little accustomed to barley-cakes, was
hungry, and his staff, at least as hungry as himself, looked
with anxiety right and left, to know what was being prepared
for supper.

Monk ordered search to be made; his scouts had on arriving
in the place found it deserted and the cupboards empty; upon
butchers and bakers it was of no use depending in
Coldstream. The smallest morsel of bread, then, could not be
found for the general's table.

As accounts succeeded each other, all equally
unsatisfactory, Monk, seeing terror and discouragement upon
every face, declared that he was not hungry; besides they
should eat on the morrow, since Lambert was there probably
with the intention of giving battle, and consequently would
give up his provisions, if he were forced from Newcastle, or
forever to relieve Monk's soldiers from hunger if he
conquered.

This consolation was only efficacious upon a very small
number; but of what importance was it to Monk? for Monk was
very absolute, under the appearance of the most perfect
mildness. Every one, therefore, was obliged to be satisfied,
or at least to appear so. Monk quite as hungry as his
people, but affecting perfect indifference for the absent
mutton, cut a fragment of tobacco, half an inch long, from
the carotte of a sergeant who formed part of his suite, and
began to masticate the said fragment, assuring his
lieutenants that hunger was a chimera, and that, besides,
people were never hungry when they had anything to chew.

This joke satisfied some of those who had resisted Monk's
first deduction drawn from the neighborhood of Lambert's
army; the number of the dissentients diminished greatly; the
guard took their posts, the patrols began, and the general
continued his frugal repast beneath his open tent.

Between his camp and that of the enemy stood an old abbey,
of which, at the present day, there only remain some ruins,
but which then was in existence, and was called Newcastle
Abbey. It was built upon a vast site, independent at once of
the plain and of the river, because it was almost a marsh
fed by springs and kept up by rains. Nevertheless, in the
midst of these pools of water, covered with long grass,
rushes, and reeds, were seen solid spots of ground, formerly
used as the kitchen-garden, the park, the pleasure-gardens,
and other dependencies of the abbey, looking like one of
those great sea-spiders, whose body is round, whilst the
claws go diverging round from this circumference.

The kitchen-garden, one of the longest claws of the abbey,
extended to Monk's camp. Unfortunately it was, as we have
said, early in June, and the kitchen-garden, being
abandoned, offered no resources.

Monk had ordered this spot to be guarded, as most subject to
surprises. The fires of the enemy's general were plainly to
be perceived on the other side of the abbey. But between
these fires and the abbey extended the Tweed, unfolding its
luminous scales beneath the thick shade of tall green oaks.
Monk was perfectly well acquainted with this position,
Newcastle and its environs having already more than once
been his headquarters. He knew that by day his enemy might
without doubt throw a few scouts into these ruins and
promote a skirmish, but that by night he would take care to
abstain from such a risk. He felt himself, therefore, in
security.

Thus his soldiers saw him, after what he boastingly called
his supper -- that is to say, after the exercise of
mastication reported by us at the commencement of this
chapter -- like Napoleon on the eve of Austerlitz, seated
asleep in his rush chair, half beneath the light of his
lamp, half beneath the reflection of the moon, commencing
its ascent in the heavens, which denoted that it was nearly
half past nine in the evening. All at once Monk was roused
from his half sleep, fictitious perhaps, by a troop of
soldiers, who came with joyous cries, and kicked the poles
of his tent with a humming noise as if on purpose to wake
him. There was no need of so much noise; the general opened
his eyes quickly.

"Well, my children, what is going on now?" asked the
general.

"General!" replied several voices at once, "General! you
shall have some supper."

"I have had my supper, gentlemen," replied he, quietly, "and
was comfortably digesting it, as you see. But come in, and
tell me what brings you hither."

"Good news, general."

"Bah! Has Lambert sent us word that he will fight
to-morrow?"

"No, but we have just captured a fishing-boat conveying fish
to Newcastle."

"And you have done very wrong, my friends. These gentlemen
from London are delicate, must have their first course; you
will put them sadly out of humor this evening, and to-morrow
they will be pitiless. It would really be in good taste to
send back to Lambert both his fish and his fishermen, unless
---- " and the general reflected an instant.

"Tell me," continued he, "what are these fishermen, if you
please?"

"Some Picard seamen who were fishing on the coasts of France
or Holland, and who have been thrown upon ours by a gale of
wind."

"Do any among them speak our language?"

"The leader spoke some few words of English."

The mistrust of the general was awakened in proportion as
fresh information reached him. "That is well," said he. "I
wish to see these men, bring them to me."

An officer immediately went to fetch them.

"How many are there of them?" continued Monk; "and what is
their vessel?"

"There are ten or twelve of them, general, and they were
aboard of a kind of chasse-maree, as it is called --
Dutch-built, apparently."

"And you say they were carrying fish to Lambert's camp?"

"Yes, general, and they seem to have had good luck in their
fishing."

"Humph! we shall see that," said Monk.

At this moment the officer returned, bringing the leader of
the fishermen with him. He was a man from fifty to
fifty-five years old, but good-looking for his age. He was
of middle height, and wore a justaucorps of coarse wool, a
cap pulled down over his eyes, a cutlass hung from his belt,
and he walked with the hesitation peculiar to sailors, who,
never knowing, thanks to the movement of the vessel, whether
their foot will be placed upon the plank or upon nothing,
give to every one of their steps a fall as firm as if they
were driving a pile. Monk, with an acute and penetrating
look, examined the fisherman for some time, while the latter
smiled, with that smile half cunning, half silly, peculiar
to French peasants.

"Do you speak English?" asked Monk, in excellent French.

"Ah! but badly, my lord," replied the fisherman.

This reply was made much more with the lively and sharp
accentuation of the people beyond the Loire, than with the
slightly-drawling accent of the countries of the west and
north of France.

"But you do speak it?" persisted Monk, in order to examine
his accent once more.

"Eh! we men of the sea," replied the fisherman, "speak a
little of all languages."

"Then you are a sea fisherman?"

"I am at present, my lord -- a fisherman, and a famous
fisherman too. I have taken a barbel that weighs at least
thirty pounds, and more than fifty mullets; I have also some
little whitings that will fry beautifully."

"You appear to me to have fished more frequently in the Gulf
of Gascony than in the Channel," said Monk, smiling.

"Well, I am from the south; but does that prevent me from
being a good fisherman, my lord?"

"Oh! not at all; I shall buy your fish. And now speak
frankly; for whom did you destine them?"

"My lord, I will conceal nothing from you. I was going to
Newcastle, following the coast, when a party of horsemen who
were passing along in an opposite direction made a sign to
my bark to turn back to your honor's camp, under penalty of
a discharge of musketry. As I was not armed for fighting,"
added the fisherman, smiling, "I was forced to submit."

"And why did you go to Lambert's camp in preference to
mine?"

"My lord, I will be frank; will your lordship permit me?"

"Yes, and even if need be shall command you to be so."

"Well, my lord, I was going to M. Lambert's camp because
those gentlemen from the city pay well -- whilst your
Scotchmen, Puritans, Presbyterians, Covenanters, or whatever
you choose to call them, eat but little, and pay for
nothing."

Monk shrugged his shoulders, without, however, being able to
refrain from smiling at the same time. "How is it that,
being from the south, you come to fish on our coasts?"

"Because I have been fool enough to marry in Picardy."

"Yes; but even Picardy is not England."

"My lord, man shoves his boat into the sea, but God and the
wind do the rest, and drive the boat where they please."

"You had, then, no intention of landing on our coasts?"

"Never."

"And what route were you steering?"

"We were returning from Ostend, where some mackerel had
already been seen, when a sharp wind from the south drove us
from our course; then, seeing that it was useless to
struggle against it, we let it drive us. It then became
necessary, not to lose our fish, which were good, to go and
sell them at the nearest English port, and that was
Newcastle. We were told the opportunity was good, as there
was an increase of population in the camp, an increase of
population in the city; both, we were told, were full of
gentlemen, very rich and very hungry. So we steered our
course towards Newcastle."

"And your companions, where are they?"

"Oh, my companions have remained on board; they are sailors
without the least instruction."

"Whilst you ---- " said Monk.

"Who, I?" said the patron, laughing; "I have sailed about
with my father, and I know what is called a sou, a crown, a
pistole, a louis, and a double louis, in all the languages
of Europe; my crew, therefore, listen to me as they would to
an oracle, and obey me as if I were an admiral."

"Then it was you who preferred M. Lambert as the best
customer?"

"Yes, certainly. And, to be frank, my lord, was I wrong?"

"You will see that by and by."

"At all events, my lord, if there is a fault, the fault is
mine; and my comrades should not be dealt hardly with on
that account."

"This is decidedly an intelligent, sharp fellow," thought
Monk. Then, after a few minutes, silence employed in
scrutinizing the fisherman, -- "You come from Ostend, did
you not say?" asked the general.

"Yes, my lord, in a straight line."

"You have then heard of the affairs of the day; for I have
no doubt that both in France and Holland they excite
interest. What is he doing who calls himself king of
England?"

"Oh, my lord!" cried the fisherman, with loud and expansive
frankness, "that is a lucky question, and you could not put
it to anybody better than to me, for in truth I can make you
a famous reply. Imagine, my lord, that when putting into
Ostend to sell the few mackerel we had caught, I saw the
ex-king walking on the downs waiting for his horses, which
were to take him to the Hague. He is a rather tall, pale
man, with black hair, and somewhat hard-featured. He looks
ill, and I don't think the air of Holland agrees with him."

Monk followed with the greatest attention the rapid,
heightened, and diffuse conversation of the fisherman, in a
language which was not his own, but which, as we have said,
he spoke with great facility. The fisherman on his part,
employed sometimes a French word, sometimes an English word,
and sometimes a word which appeared not to belong to any
language, but was, in truth, pure Gascon. Fortunately his
eyes spoke for him, and that so eloquently, that it was
possible to lose a word from his mouth, but not a single
intention from his eyes. The general appeared more and more
satisfied with his examination. "You must have heard that
this ex-king, as you call him, was going to the Hague for
some purpose?"

"Oh, yes," said the fisherman, "I heard that."

"And what was his purpose?"

"Always the same," said the fisherman. "Must he not always
entertain the fixed idea of returning to England?"

"That is true," said Monk, pensively.

"Without reckoning," added the fisherman, "that the
stadtholder -- you know, my lord, William II.?"

"Well?"

"He will assist him with all his power."

"Ah! did you hear that said?"

"No, but I think so."

"You are quite a politician, apparently," said Monk.

"Why, we sailors, my lord, who are accustomed to study the
water and the air -- that is to say, the two most changeable
things in the world -- are seldom deceived as to the rest."

"Now, then," said Monk, changing the conversation, "I am
told you are going to provision us."

"I shall do my best, my lord."

"How much do you ask for your fish in the first place?"

"Not such a fool as to name a price, my lord."

"Why not?"

"Because my fish is yours."

"By what right?"

"By that of the strongest."

"But my intention is to pay you for it."

"That is very generous of you, my lord."

"And the worth of it ---- "

"My lord, I fix no price."

"What do you ask, then?"

"I only ask to be permitted to go away."

"Where? -- to General Lambert's camp?"

"I!" cried the fisherman; "what should I go to Newcastle
for, now I have no longer any fish?"

"At all events, listen to me."

"I do, my lord."

"I shall give you some advice."

"How, my lord! -- pay me and give me good advice likewise!
You overwhelm me, my lord."

Monk looked more earnestly than ever at the fisherman, about
whom he still appeared to entertain some suspicion. "Yes, I
shall pay you, and give you a piece of advice, for the two
things are connected. If you return, then, to General
Lambert ---- "

The fisherman made a movement of his head and shoulders,
which signified, "If he persists in it, I won't contradict
him."

"Do not cross the marsh," continued Monk: "you will have
money in your pocket, and there are in the marsh some Scotch
ambuscaders I have placed there. Those people are very
intractable; they understand but very little of the language
which you speak, although it appears to me to be composed of
three languages. They might take from you what I had given
you, and, on your return to your country, you would not fail
to say that General Monk has two hands, the one Scotch, and
the other English; and that he takes back with the Scotch
hand what he has given with the English hand."

"Oh! general, I shall go where you like, be sure of that,"
said the fisherman, with a fear too expressive not to be
exaggerated. "I only wish to remain here, if you will allow
me to remain."

"I readily believe you," said Monk, with an imperceptible
smile, "but I cannot, nevertheless, keep you in my tent."

"I have no such wish, my lord, and desire only that your
lordship should point out where you will have me posted. Do
not trouble yourself about us -- with us a night soon passes
away."

"You shall be conducted to your bark."

"As your lordship pleases. Only, if your lordship would
allow me to be taken back by a carpenter, I should be
extremely grateful."

"Why so?"

"Because the gentlemen of your army, in dragging my boat up
the river with a cable pulled by their horses, have battered
it a little upon the rocks of the shore, so that I have at
least two feet of water in my hold, my lord."

"The greater reason why you should watch your boat, I
think."

"My lord, I am quite at your orders," said the fisherman; "I
shall empty my baskets where you wish; then you will pay me,
if you please to do so; and you will send me away, if it
appears right to you. You see I am very easily managed and
pleased, my lord."

"Come, come, you are a very good sort of a fellow," said
Monk, whose scrutinizing glance had not been able to find a
single shade in the clear eye of the fisherman. "Holloa,
Digby!" An aide-de-camp appeared. "You will conduct this
good fellow and his companions to the little tents of the
canteens, in front of the marshes, so that they will be near
their bark, and yet will not sleep on board to-night. What
is the matter, Spithead?"

Spithead was the sergeant from whom Monk had borrowed a
piece of tobacco for his supper. Spithead, having entered
the general's tent without being sent for, had drawn this
question from Monk.

"My lord," said he, "a French gentleman has just presented
himself at the outposts and wishes to speak to your honor."

All this was said, be it understood, in English; but
notwithstanding, it produced a slight emotion in the
fisherman, which Monk, occupied with his sergeant, did not
remark.

"Who is the gentleman?" asked Monk.

"My lord," replied Spithead, "he told it me, but those
devils of French names are so difficult to pronounce for a
Scotch throat, that I could not retain it. I believe,
however, from what the guards say, that it is the same
gentleman who presented himself yesterday at the halt, and
whom your honor would not receive."

"That is true; I was holding a council of officers."

"Will your honor give any orders respecting this gentleman?"

"Yes, let him be brought here."

"Must we take any precautions?"

"Such as what?"

"Binding his eyes, for instance."

"To what purpose? He can only see what I desire should be
seen; that is to say, that I have around me eleven thousand
brave men, who ask no better than to have their throats cut
in honor of the parliament of Scotland and England."

"And this man, my lord?" said Spithead, pointing to the
fisherman, who, during this conversation, had remained
standing and motionless, like a man who sees but does not
understand.

"Ah, that is true," said Monk. Then turning towards the
fisherman, -- "I shall see you again, my brave fellow," said
he; "I have selected a lodging for you. Digby, take him to
it. Fear nothing: your money shall be sent to you
presently."

"Thank you, my lord," said the fisherman, and after having
bowed, he left the tent, accompanied by Digby. Before he had
gone a hundred paces he found his companions, who were
whispering with a volubility which did not appear exempt
from uneasiness, but he made them a sign which seemed to
reassure them. "Hola, you fellows!" said the patron, "come
this way. His lordship, General Monk, has the generosity to
pay us for our fish, and the goodness to give us hospitality
for to-night."

The fishermen gathered round their leader, and, conducted by
Digby, the little troop proceeded towards the canteens, the
post, as may be remembered, which had been assigned them. As
they went along in the dark, the fishermen passed close to
the guards who were conducting the French gentleman to
General Monk. This gentleman was on horseback, and enveloped
in a large cloak, which prevented the patron from seeing
him, however great his curiosity might be. As to the
gentleman, ignorant that he was elbowing compatriots, he did
not pay any attention to the little troop.

The aid-de-camp settled his guests in a tolerably
comfortable tent, from which was dislodged an Irish canteen
woman, who went, with her six children, to sleep where she
could. A large fire was burning in front of this tent, and
threw its purple light over the grassy pools of the marsh,
rippled by a fresh breeze. The arrangements made, the
aid-de-camp wished the fishermen good-night, calling to
their notice that they might see from the door of the tent
the masts of their bark, which was tossing gently on the
Tweed, a proof that it had not yet sunk. The sight of this
appeared to delight the leader of the fishermen infinitely.




CHAPTER 24

The Treasure



The French gentleman whom Spithead had announced to Monk,
and who, closely wrapped in his cloak, had passed by the
fishermen who left the general's tent five minutes before he
entered it, -- the French gentleman went through the various
posts without even casting his eyes around him, for fear of
appearing indiscreet. As the order had been given, he was
conducted to the tent of the general. The gentleman was left
alone in the sort of ante-chamber in front of the principal
body of the tent, where he awaited Monk, who only delayed
till he had heard the report of his people, and observed
through the opening of the canvas the countenance of the
person who solicited an audience.

Without doubt, the report of those who had accompanied the
French gentleman established the discretion with which he
had behaved, for the first impression the stranger received
of the welcome made him by the general was more favorable
than he could have expected at such a moment, and on the
part of so suspicious a man. Nevertheless, according to his
custom, when Monk found himself in the presence of a
stranger, he fixed upon him his penetrating eyes, which
scrutiny, the stranger, on his part, sustained without
embarrassment or notice. At the end of a few seconds, the
general made a gesture with his hand and head in sign of
attention.

"My lord," said the gentleman, in excellent English. "I have
requested an interview with your honor, for an affair of
importance."

"Monsieur," replied Monk, in French, "you speak our language
well for a son of the continent. I ask your pardon -- for
doubtless the question is indiscreet -- do you speak French
with the same purity?"

"There is nothing surprising, my lord, in my speaking
English tolerably; I resided for some time in England in my
youth, and since then I have made two voyages to this
country." These words were spoken in French, and with a
purity of accent that bespoke not only a Frenchman, but a
Frenchman from the vicinity of Tours.

"And what part of England have you resided in, monsieur?"

"In my youth, London, my lord, then, about 1635, I made a
pleasure trip to Scotland; and lastly, in 1648, I lived for
some time at Newcastle, particularly in the convent, the
gardens of which are now occupied by your army."

"Excuse me, monsieur, but you must comprehend that these
questions are necessary on my part -- do you not?"

"It would astonish me, my lord, if they were not asked."

"Now, then, monsieur, what can I do to serve you? What do
you wish?"

"This, my lord; -- but, in the first place, are we alone?"

"Perfectly so, monsieur, except, of course, the post which
guards us." So saying, Monk pulled open the canvas with his
hand, and pointed to the soldier placed at ten paces from
the tent, and who, at the first call could have rendered
assistance in a second.

"In that case my lord," said the gentleman, in as calm a
tone as if he had been for a length of time in habits of
intimacy with his interlocutor, I have made up my mind to
address myself to you, because I believe you to be an honest
man. Indeed, the communication I am about to make to you
will prove to you the esteem in which I hold you."

Monk, astonished at this language, which established between
him and the French gentleman equality at least, raised his
piercing eye to the stranger's face, and with a sensible
irony conveyed by the inflection of his voice alone, for not
a muscle of his face moved, -- "I thank you, monsieur," said
he; "but, in the first place, to whom have I the honor of
speaking?"

"I sent you my name by your sergeant, my lord."

"Excuse him, monsieur, he is a Scotchman, -- he could not
retain it."

"I am called the Comte de la Fere, monsieur," said Athos,
bowing.

"The Comte de la Fere?" said Monk, endeavoring to recollect
the name. "Pardon me, monsieur, but this appears to be the
first time I have ever heard that name. Do you fill any post
at the court of France?"

"None; I am a simple gentleman."

"What dignity?"

"King Charles I. made me a knight of the Garter, and Queen
Anne of Austria has given me the cordon of the Holy Ghost.
These are my only dignities."

"The Garter! the Holy Ghost! Are you a knight of those two
orders, monsieur?"

"Yes."

"And on what occasions have such favors been bestowed upon
you?"

"For services rendered to their majesties."

Monk looked with astonishment at this man, who appeared to
him so simple and so great at the same time. Then, as if he
had renounced endeavoring to penetrate this mystery of a
simplicity and grandeur upon which the stranger did not seem
disposed to give him any other information than that which
he had already received, -- "Did you present yourself
yesterday at our advanced posts?"

"And was sent back? Yes, my lord."

"Many officers, monsieur, would permit no one to enter their
camp, particularly on the eve of a probable battle. But I
differ from my colleagues, and like to leave nothing behind
me. Every advice is good to me; all danger is sent to me by
God, and I weigh it in my hand with the energy He has given
me. So, yesterday, you were only sent back on account of the
council I was holding. To-day I am at liberty, -- speak."

"My lord, you have done much better in receiving me, for
what I have to say has nothing to do with the battle you are
about to fight with General Lambert, or with your camp; and
the proof is, that I turned away my head that I might not
see your men, and closed my eyes that I might not count your
tents. No, I come to speak to you, my lord, on my own
account."

"Speak, then, monsieur," said Monk.

"Just now " continued Athos, "I had the honor of telling
your lordship that for a long time I lived in Newcastle; it
was in the time of Charles I., and when the king was given
up to Cromwell by the Scots."

"I know," said Monk, coldly.

"I had at that time a large sum in gold, and on the eve of
the battle, from a presentiment perhaps of the turn which
things would take on the morrow, I concealed it in the
principal vault of the convent of Newcastle, in the tower
whose summit you now see silvered by the moonbeams. My
treasure has then remained interred there, and I have come
to entreat your honor to permit me to withdraw it before,
perhaps, the battle turning that way, a mine or some other
war engine has destroyed the building and scattered my gold,
or rendered it so apparent that the soldiers will take
possession of it."

Monk was well acquainted with mankind, he saw in the
physiognomy of this gentleman all the energy, all the
reason, all the circumspection possible, he could therefore
only attribute to a magnanimous confidence the revelation
the Frenchman had made him, and he showed himself profoundly
touched by it.

"Monsieur," said he, "you have augured well of me. But is
the sum worth the trouble to which you expose yourself? Do
you even believe that it can be in the place where you left
it?"

"It is there, monsieur, I do not doubt."

"That is a reply to one question; but to the other. I asked
you if the sum was so large as to warrant your exposing
yourself thus."

"It is really large; yes, my lord, for it is a million I
inclosed in two barrels."

"A million!" cried Monk, at whom this time, in turn, Athos
looked earnestly and long. Monk perceived this, and his
mistrust returned.

"Here is a man," said he, "who is laying a snare for me. So
you wish to withdraw this money, monsieur," replied he, "as
I understand?"

"If you please, my lord."

"To-day?"

"This very evening, and that on account of the circumstances
I have named."

"But, monsieur," objected Monk, "General Lambert is as near
the abbey where you have to act as I am. Why, then, have you
not addressed yourself to him?"

"Because, my lord, when one acts in important matters, it is
best to consult one's instinct before everything. Well,
General Lambert does not inspire me with so much confidence
as you do."

"Be it so, monsieur. I shall assist you in recovering your
money, if, however, it can still be there; for that is far
from likely. Since 1648 twelve years have rolled away, and
many events have taken place." Monk dwelt upon this point to
see if the French gentleman would seize the evasions that
were open to him, but Athos did not hesitate.

"I assure you, my lord," he said firmly, "that my conviction
is, that the two barrels have neither changed place nor
master." This reply had removed one suspicion from the mind
of Monk, but it had suggested another. Without doubt this
Frenchman was some emissary sent to entice into error the
protector of the parliament; the gold was nothing but a
lure; and by the help of this lure they thought to excite
the cupidity of the general. This gold might not exist. It
was Monk's business, then, to seize the Frenchman in the act
of falsehood and trick, and to draw from the false step
itself in which his enemies wished to entrap him, a triumph
for his renown. When Monk was determined how to act, --

"Monsieur," said he to Athos, "without doubt you will do me
the honor to share my supper this evening?"

"Yes, my lord," replied Athos, bowing, "for you do me an
honor of which I feel myself worthy, by the inclination
which drew me towards you."

"It is so much the more gracious on your part to accept my
invitation with such frankness, as my cooks are but few and
inexperienced, and my providers have returned this evening
empty-handed; so that if it had not been for a fisherman of
your nation who strayed into our camp, General Monk would
have gone to bed without his supper to-day; I have, then,
some fresh fish to offer you, as the vendor assures me."

"My lord, it is principally for the sake of having the honor
to pass another hour with you."

After this exchange of civilities, during which Monk had
lost nothing of his circumspection, the supper, or what was
to serve for one, had been laid upon a deal table. Monk
invited the Comte de la Fere to be seated at this table, and
took his place opposite to him. A single dish of boiled
fish, set before the two illustrious guests, was more
tempting to hungry stomachs than to delicate palates.

Whilst supping, that is, while eating the fish, washed down
with bad ale, Monk got Athos to relate to him the last
events of the Fronde, the reconciliation of M. de Conde with
the king, and the probable marriage of the infanta of Spain;
but he avoided, as Athos himself avoided it, all allusion to
the political interests which united, or rather which
disunited at this time, England, France and Holland.

Monk, in this conversation, convinced himself of one thing,
which he must have remarked after the first words exchanged:
that was, that he had to deal with a man of high
distinction. He could not be an assassin, and it was
repugnant to Monk to believe him to be a spy, but there was
sufficient finesse and at the same time firmness in Athos to
lead Monk to fancy he was a conspirator. When they had
quitted table, "You still believe in your treasure, then,
monsieur?" asked Monk.

"Yes, my lord."

"Quite seriously?"

"Seriously."

"And you think you can find the place again where it was
buried?"

"At the first inspection."

"Well, monsieur, from curiosity I shall accompany you. And
it is so much the more necessary that I should accompany
you, that you would find great difficulties in passing
through the camp without me or one of my lieutenants."

"General, I would not suffer you to inconvenience yourself
if I did not, in fact, stand in need of your company; but as
I recognize that this company is not only honorable, but
necessary, I accept it."

"Do you desire we should take any people with us?" asked
Monk.

"General, I believe that would be useless, if you yourself
do not see the necessity for it. Two men and a horse will
suffice to transport the two casks on board the felucca
which brought me hither."

"But it will be necessary to pick, dig and remove the earth,
and split stones; you don't intend doing this work yourself,
monsieur, do you?"

"General, there is no picking or digging required. The
treasure is buried in the sepulchral vault of the convent,
under a stone in which is fixed a large iron ring and under
which are four steps leading down. The two casks are there,
placed end to end, covered with a coat of plaster in the
form of a bier. There is, besides, an inscription, which
will enable me to recognize the stone; and as I am not
willing, in an affair of delicacy and confidence, to keep
the secret from your honor, here is the inscription: -- `Hic
jacet venerabilis, Petrus Gulielmus Scott, Canon Honorab.
Conventus Novi Castelli. Obiit quarta et decima. Feb. ann.
Dom. MCCVIII. Requiescat in pace.'"

Monk did not lose a single word.- He was astonished either
at the marvelous duplicity of this man and the superior
style in which he played his part, or at the good loyal
faith with which he presented his request, in a situation in
which concerning a million of money, risked against the blow
from a dagger, amidst an army that would have looked upon
the theft as a restitution.

"Very well," said he; "I shall accompany you; and the
adventure appears to me so wonderful, that I shall carry the
torch myself." And saying these words, he girded on a short
sword, placed a pistol in his belt, disclosing in this
movement, which opened his doublet a little, the fine rings
of a coat of mail, destined to protect him from the first
dagger-thrust of an assassin. After which he took a Scotch
dirk in his left hand, and then turning to Athos, "Are you
ready, monsieur?" said he.

"I am."

Athos, as if in opposition to what Monk had done, unfastened
his poniard, which he placed upon the table; unhooked his
sword-belt, which he laid close to his poniard; and, without
affectation, opening his doublet as if to look for his
handkerchief, showed beneath his fine cambric shirt his
naked breast, without weapons either offensive or defensive.

"This is truly a singular man," said Monk; "he is without
any arms; he has an ambuscade placed somewhere yonder."

"General," said he, as if he had divined Monk's thought,
"you wish we should be alone; that is very right, but a
great captain ought never to expose himself with temerity.
It is night, the passage of the marsh may present dangers;
be accompanied."

"You are right," replied he, calling Digby. The aid-de-camp
appeared. "Fifty men with swords and muskets," said he,
looking at Athos.

"That is too few if there is danger, too many if there is
not."

"I will go alone," said Monk; "I want nobody. Come,
monsieur."




CHAPTER 25

The March



Athos and Monk passed over, in going from the camp towards
the Tweed, that part of the ground which Digby had traversed
with the fishermen coming from the Tweed to the camp. The
aspect of this place, the aspect of the changes man had
wrought in it, was of a nature to produce a great effect
upon a lively and delicate imagination like that of Athos.
Athos looked at nothing but these desolate spots; Monk
looked at nothing but Athos -- at Athos, who, with his eyes
sometimes directed towards heaven, and sometimes towards the
earth, sought, thought, and sighed.

Digby, whom the last orders of the general, and particularly
the accent with which he had given them, had at first a
little excited, followed the pair at about twenty paces, but
the general having turned round as if astonished to find his
orders had not been obeyed, the aid-de-camp perceived his
indiscretion and returned to his tent.

He supposed that the general wished to make, incognito, one
of those reviews of vigilance which every experienced
captain never fails to make on the eve of a decisive
engagement: he explained to himself the presence of Athos in
this case as an inferior explains all that is mysterious on
the part of his leader. Athos might be, and, indeed, in the
eyes of Digby, must be, a spy, whose information was to
enlighten the general.

At the end of a walk of about ten minutes among the tents
and posts, which were closer together near the headquarters,
Monk entered upon a little causeway which diverged into
three branches. That on the left led to the river, that in
the middle to Newcastle Abbey on the marsh, that on the
right crossed the first lines of Monk's camp, that is to
say, the lines nearest to Lambert's army. Beyond the river
was an advanced post belonging to Monk's army, which watched
the enemy; it was composed of one hundred and fifty Scots.
They had swum across the Tweed, and, in case of attack, were
to recross it in the same manner, giving the alarm; but as
there was no post at that spot, and as Lambert's soldiers
were not so prompt at taking to the water as Monk's were,
the latter appeared not to have much uneasiness on that
side. On this side of the river, at about five hundred paces
from the old abbey, the fishermen had taken up their abode
amidst a crowd of small tents raised by the soldiers of the
neighboring clans, who had with them their wives and
children. All this confusion, seen by the moon's light,
presented a striking coup d'oeil; the half shadow enlarged
every detail, and the light, that flatterer which only
attaches itself to the polished side of things, courted upon
each rusty musket the point still left intact, and upon
every rag of canvas the whitest and least sullied part.

Monk arrived then with Athos, crossing this spot, illumined
with a double light, the silver splendor of the moon, and
the red blaze of the fires at the meeting of the three
causeways; there he stopped, and addressing his companion,
-- "Monsieur," said he, "do you know your road?"

"General, if I am not mistaken, the middle causeway leads
straight to the abbey."

"That is right; but we shall want lights to guide us in the
vaults." Monk turned round.

"Ah! I thought Digby was following us!" said he. "So much
the better; he will procure us what we want."

"Yes, general, there is a man yonder who has been walking
behind us for some time."

"Digby!" cried Monk. "Digby! come here, if you please."

But, instead of obeying, the shadow made a motion of
surprise, and, retreating instead of advancing, it bent down
and disappeared along the jetty on the left, directing its
course towards the lodging of the fishermen.

"It appears not to be Digby," said Monk.

Both had followed the shadow which had vanished. But it was
not so rare a thing for a man to be wandering about at
eleven o'clock at night, in a camp in which are reposing ten
or eleven thousand men, as to give Monk and Athos any alarm
at his disappearance.

"As it is so," said Monk, "and we must have a light, a
lantern, a torch, or something by which we may see where to
set our feet, let us seek this light."

"General, the first soldier we meet will light us."

"No," said Monk, in order to discover if there were not any
connivance between the Comte de la Fere and the fisherman.
"No, I should prefer one of these French sailors who came
this evening to sell me their fish. They leave to-morrow,
and the secret will be better kept by them; whereas, if a
report should be spread in the Scotch army, that treasures
are to be found in the abbey of Newcastle, my Highlanders
will believe there is a million concealed beneath every
slab, and they will not leave stone upon stone in the
building."

"Do as you think best, general," replied Athos in a natural
tone of voice, making evident that soldier or fisherman was
the same to him, and that he had no preference.

Monk approached the causeway behind which had disappeared
the person he had taken for Digby, and met a patrol who,
making the tour of the tents, was going towards
headquarters; he was stopped with his companion, gave the
password, and went on. A soldier, roused by the noise,
unrolled his plaid, and looked up to see what was going
forward. "Ask him," said Monk to Athos, "where the fishermen
are; if I were to speak to him, he would know me."

Athos went up to the soldier, who pointed out the tent to
him; immediately Monk and Athos turned towards it. It
appeared to the general that at the moment they came up, a
shadow like that they had already seen glided into this
tent; but on drawing nearer he perceived he must have been
mistaken, for all of them were asleep pele mele, and nothing
was seen but arms and legs joined, crossed, and mixed.
Athos, fearing lest he should be suspected of connivance
with some of his compatriots, remained outside the tent.

"Hola!" said Monk, in French, "wake up here." Two or three
of the sleepers got up.

"I want a man to light me," continued Monk.

"Your honor may depend upon us," said a voice which made
Athos start. "Where do you wish us to go?"

"You shall see. A light! come, quickly!"

"Yes, your honor. Does it please your honor that I should
accompany you?"

"You or another, it is of very little consequence, provided
I have a light."

"It is strange!" thought Athos, "what a singular voice that
man has!"

"Some fire, you fellows!" cried the fisherman; "come, make
haste!"

Then addressing his companion nearest to him in a low voice:
-- "Get a light, Menneville," said he, "and hold yourself
ready for anything."

One of the fishermen struck light from a stone, set fire to
some tinder, and by the aid of a match lit a lantern. The
light immediately spread all over the tent.

"Are you ready, monsieur?" said Monk to Athos, who had
turned away, not to expose his face to the light.

"Yes, general," replied he.

"Ah! the French gentleman!" said the leader of the fishermen
to himself. "Peste! I have a great mind to charge you with
the commission, Menneville; he may know me. Light! light!"
This dialogue was pronounced at the back of the tent, and in
so low a voice that Monk could not hear a syllable of it; he
was, besides, talking with Athos. Menneville got himself
ready in the meantime, or rather received the orders of his
leader.

"Well?" said Monk.

"I am ready, general," said the fisherman.

Monk, Athos, and the fisherman left the tent.

"It is impossible!" thought Athos. "What dream could put
that into my head?"

"Go forward; follow the middle causeway, and stretch out
your legs," said Monk to the fisherman.

They were not twenty paces on their way when the same shadow
that had appeared to enter the tent came out of it again,
crawled along as far as the piles, and, protected by that
sort of parapet placed along the causeway, carefully
observed the march of the general. All three disappeared in
the night haze. They were walking towards Newcastle, the
white stones of which appeared to them like sepulchres.
After standing for a few seconds under the porch, they
penetrated into the interior. The door had been broken open
by hatchets. A post of four men slept in safety in a corner,
so certain were they that the attack would not take place on
that side.

"Will not these men be in your way?" said Monk to Athos.

"On the contrary, monsieur, they will assist in rolling out
the barrels, if your honor will permit them."

"You are right."

The post, though fast asleep, roused up at the first steps
of the three visitors amongst the briars and grass that
invaded the porch. Monk gave the password, and penetrated
into the interior of the convent, preceded by the light. He
walked last, watching the least movement of Athos, his naked
dirk in his sleeve, and ready to plunge it into the back of
the gentleman at the first suspicious gesture he should see
him make. But Athos, with a firm and sure step, crossed the
chambers and courts.

Not a door, not a window was left in this building. The
doors had been burnt, some on the spot, and the charcoal of
them was still jagged with the action of the fire, which had
gone out of itself, powerless, no doubt, to get to the heart
of those massive joints of oak fastened together with iron
nails. As to the windows, all the panes having been broken,
night birds, alarmed by the torch, flew away through their
holes. At the same time, gigantic bats began to trace their
vast, silent circles around the intruders, whilst the light
of the torch made their shadows tremble on the high stone
walls. Monk concluded there could be no man in the convent,
since wild beasts and birds were there still, and fled away
at his approach.

After having passed the rubbish, and torn away more than one
branch of ivy that had made itself a guardian of the
solitude, Athos arrived at the vaults situated beneath the
great hall, but the entrance of which was from the chapel.
There he stopped. "Here we are, general," said he.

"This, then, is the slab?"

"Yes."

"Ay, and here is the ring -- but the ring is sealed into the
stone."

"We must have a lever."

"That's a thing very easy to find."

Whilst looking round them, Athos and Monk perceived a little
ash of about three inches in diameter, which had shot up in
an angle of the wall, reaching a window, concealed by its
branches.

"Have you a knife?" said Monk to the fisherman.

"Yes, monsieur."

"Cut down this tree; then."

The fisherman obeyed, but not without notching his cutlass.
When the ash was cut and fashioned into the shape of a
lever, the three men penetrated into the vault.

"Stop where you are," said Monk to the fisherman. "We are
going to dig up some powder; your light may be dangerous."

The man drew back in a sort of terror, and faithfully kept
to the post assigned him, whilst Monk and Athos turned
behind a column at the foot of which, penetrating through a
crack, was a moonbeam, reflected exactly on the stone which
the Comte de la Fere had come so far in search.

"This is it," said Athos, pointing out to the general the
Latin inscription.

"Yes," said Monk.

Then, as if still willing to leave the Frenchman one means
of evasion, --

"Do you not observe that this vault has already been broken
into," continued he, "and that several statues have been
knocked down?"

"My lord, you have, without doubt, heard that the religious
respect of your Scots loves to confide to the statues of the
dead the valuable objects they have possessed during their
lives. Therefore, the soldiers had reason to think that
under the pedestals of the statues which ornament most of
these tombs, a treasure was hidden. They have consequently
broken down pedestal and statue: but the tomb of the
venerable canon, with which we have to do, is not
distinguished by any monument. It is simple, therefore it
has been protected by the superstitious fear which your
Puritans have always had of sacrilege. Not a morsel of the
masonry of this tomb has been chipped off."

"That is true," said Monk.

Athos seized the lever.

"Shall I help you?" said Monk.

"Thank you, my lord; but I am not willing that your honor
should lend your hand to a work of which, perhaps, you would
not take the responsibility if you knew the probable
consequences of it."

Monk raised his head.

"What do you mean by that, monsieur?"

"I mean -- but that man ---- "

"Stop," said Monk; "I perceive what you are afraid of. I
shall make a trial." Monk turned towards the fisherman, the
whole of whose profile was thrown upon the wall.

"Come here, friend!" said he in English, and in a tone of
command.

The fisherman did not stir.

"That is well," continued he: "he does not know English.
Speak to me, then, in English, if you please, monsieur."

"My lord," replied Athos, "I have frequently seen men in
certain circumstances have sufficient command over
themselves not to reply to a question put to them in a
language they understood. The fisherman is perhaps more
learned than we believe him to be. Send him away, my lord, I
beg you."

"Decidedly," said Monk, "he wishes to have me alone in this
vault. Never mind, we shall go through with it; one man is
as good as another man; and we are alone. My friend," said
Monk to the fisherman, "go back up the stairs we have just
descended, and watch that nobody comes to disturb us." The
fisherman made a sign of obedience. "Leave your torch," said
Monk; "it would betray your presence, and might procure you
a musket-ball."

The fisherman appeared to appreciate the counsel; he laid
down the light, and disappeared under the vault of the
stairs. Monk took up the torch, and brought it to the foot
of the column.

"Ah, ah!" said he; "money, then, is concealed under this
tomb?"

"Yes, my lord; and in five minutes you will no longer doubt
it."

At the same time Athos struck a violent blow upon the
plaster, which split, presenting a chink for the point of
the lever. Athos introduced the bar into this crack, and
soon large pieces of plaster yielded, rising up like rounded
slabs. Then the Comte de la Fere seized the stones and threw
them away with a force that hands so delicate as his might
not have been supposed capable of having.

"My lord," said Athos, "this is plainly the masonry of which
I told your honor."

"Yes; but I do not yet see the casks," said Monk.

"If I had a dagger," said Athos, looking round him, "you
should soon see them, monsieur. Unfortunately, I left mine
in your tent."

"I would willingly offer you mine," said Monk, "but the
blade is too thin for such work."

Athos appeared to look around him for a thing of some kind
that might serve as a substitute for the weapon he desired.
Monk did not lose one of the movements of his hands, or one
of the expressions of his eyes. "Why do you not ask the
fisherman for his cutlass?" said Monk; "he has a cutlass."

"Ah! that is true," said Athos, "for he cut the tree down
with it." And he advanced towards the stairs.

"Friend," said he to the fisherman, "throw me down your
cutlass, if you please; I want it."

The noise of the falling weapon sounded on the steps.

"Take it," said Monk; "it is a solid instrument, as I have
seen, and a strong hand might make good use of it."

Athos only appeared to give to the words of Monk the natural
and simple sense under which they were to be heard and
understood. Nor did he remark, or at least appear to remark,
that when he returned with the weapon, Monk drew back,
placing his left hand on the stock of his pistol; in the
right he already held his dirk. He went to work then,
turning his back to Monk, placing his life in his hands,
without possible defense. He then struck, during several
seconds, so skillfully and sharply upon the intermediary
plaster, that it separated into two parts, and Monk was able
to discern two barrels placed end to end, and which their
weight maintained motionless in their chalky envelope.

"My lord," said Athos, "you see that my presentiments have
not been disappointed."

"Yes, monsieur," said Monk, "and I have good reason to
believe you are satisfied; are you not?"

"Doubtless, I am; the loss of this money would have been
inexpressibly great to me: but I was certain that God, who
protects the good cause, would not have permitted this gold,
which should procure its triumph, to be diverted to baser
purposes."

"You are, upon my honor, as mysterious in your words as in
your actions, monsieur," said Monk. "Just now I did not
perfectly understand you when you said that you were not
willing to throw upon me the responsibility of the work we
were accomplishing."

"I had reason to say so, my lord."

"And now you speak to me of the good cause. What do you mean
by the words `the good cause'? We are defending at this
moment, in England, five or six causes, which does not
prevent every one from considering his own not only as the
good cause, but as the best. What is yours, monsieur? Speak
boldly, that we may see if, upon this point, to which you
appear to attach a great importance, we are of the same
opinion."

Athos fixed upon Monk one of those penetrating looks which
seem to convey to him to whom they are directed a challenge
to conceal a single one of his thoughts; then, taking off
his hat, he began in a solemn voice, while his interlocutor,
with one hand upon his visage, allowed that long and nervous
hand to compress his mustache and beard, while his vague and
melancholy eye wandered about the recesses of the vaults.




CHAPTER 26

Heart and Mind



"My lord," said the Comte de la Fere, "you are a noble
Englishman, you are a loyal man; you are speaking to a noble
Frenchman, to a man of heart. The gold contained in these
two casks before us, I have told you was mine. I was wrong
-- it is the first lie I have pronounced in my life, a
temporary lie, it is true. This gold is the property of King
Charles II., exiled from his country, driven from his
palaces, the orphan at once of his father and his throne,
and deprived of everything, even of the melancholy happiness
of kissing on his knees the stone upon which the hands of
his murderers have written that simple epitaph which will
eternally cry out for vengeance upon them: -- `Here lies
Charles I.'"

Monk grew slightly pale, and an imperceptible shudder crept
over his skin and raised his gray mustache.

"I," continued Athos, "I, Comte de la Fere, the last, only
faithful friend the poor abandoned prince has left, I have
offered him to come hither to find the man upon whom now
depends the fate of royalty and of England; and I have come,
and placed myself under the eye of this man, and have placed
myself naked and unarmed in his hands, saying: -- `My lord,
here are the last resources of a prince whom God made your
master, whom his birth made your king; upon you, and you
alone, depend his life and his future. Will you employ this
money in consoling England for the evils it must have
suffered from anarchy; that is to say, will you aid, and if
not aid, will you allow King Charles II. to act? You are
master, you are king, all-powerful master and king, for
chance sometimes defeats the work of time and God. I am here
alone with you, my lord: if divided success alarms you, if
my complicity annoys you, you are armed, my lord, and here
is a grave ready dug; if, on the contrary, the enthusiasm of
your cause carries you away, if you are what you appear to
be, if your hand in what it undertakes obeys your mind, .and
your mind your heart, here are the means of ruining forever
the cause of your enemy, Charles Stuart. Kill, then, the man
you have before you, for that man will never return to him
who has sent him without bearing with him the deposit which
Charles I., his father, confided to him, and keep the gold
which may assist in carrying on the civil war. Alas! my
lord, it is the fate of this unfortunate prince. He must
either corrupt or kill, for everything resists him,
everything repulses him, everything is hostile to him; and
yet he is marked with the divine seal, and he must, not to
belie his blood, reascend the throne, or die upon the sacred
soil of his country.'

"My lord, you have heard me. To any other but the
illustrious man who listens to me, I would have said: `My
lord, you are poor; my lord, the king offers you this
million as an earnest of an immense bargain; take it, and
serve Charles II. as I served Charles I., and I feel assured
that God, who listens to us, who sees us, who alone reads in
your heart, shut from all human eyes, -- I am assured God
will give you a happy eternal life after a happy death.' But
to General Monk, to the illustrious man of whose standard I
believe I have taken measure, I say: `My lord, there is for
you in the history of peoples and kings a brilliant place,
an immortal, imperishable glory, if alone, without any other
interest but the good of your country and the interests of
justice, you become the supporter of your king. Many others
have been conquerors and glorious usurpers; you, my lord,
you will be content with being the most virtuous, the most
honest, and the most incorruptible of men: you will have
held a crown in your hand, and instead of placing it upon
your own brow, you will have deposited it upon the head of
him for whom it was made. Oh, my lord, act thus, and you
will leave to posterity the most enviable of names, in which
no human creature can rival you.'"

Athos stopped. During the whole time that the noble
gentleman was speaking, Monk had not given one sign of
either approbation or disapprobation; scarcely even, during
this vehement appeal, had his eyes been animated with that
fire which bespeaks intelligence. The Comte de la Fere
looked at him sorrowfully, and on seeing that melancholy
countenance, felt discouragement penetrate to his very
heart. At length Monk appeared to recover, and broke the
silence.

"Monsieur," said he, in a mild, calm tone, "in reply to you,
I will make use of your own words. To any other but yourself
I would reply by expulsion, imprisonment, or still worse,
for, in fact, you tempt me and you force me at the same
time. But you are one of those men, monsieur, to whom it is
impossible to refuse the attention and respect they merit;
you are a brave gentleman, monsieur -- I say so, and I am a
judge. You just now spoke of a deposit which the late king
transmitted through you to his son -- are you, then, one of
those Frenchmen who, as I have heard, endeavored to carry
off Charles I. from Whitehall?"

"Yes, my lord, it was I who was beneath the scaffold during
the execution; I, who had not been able to redeem it,
received upon my brow the blood of the martyred king. I
received, at the same time, the last word of Charles I., it
was to me he said, `Remember!' and in saying, `Remember!' he
alluded to the money at your feet, my lord."

"I have heard much of you, monsieur," said Monk, "but I am
happy to have, in the first place, appreciated you by my own
observations, and not by my remembrances. I will give you,
then, explanations that I have given to no other, and you
will appreciate what a distinction I make between you and
the persons who have hitherto been sent to me."

Athos bowed, and prepared to absorb greedily the words which
fell, one by one, from the mouth of Monk, -- those words
rare and precious as the dew in the desert.

"You spoke to me," said Monk, "of Charles II.; but pray,
monsieur, of what consequence to me is that phantom of a
king? I have grown old in a war and in a policy which are
nowadays so closely linked together, that every man of the
sword must fight in virtue of his rights or his ambition
with a personal interest, and not blindly behind an officer,
as in ordinary wars. For myself, I perhaps desire nothing,
but I fear much. In the war of to-day rests the liberty of
England, and, perhaps, that of every Englishman. How can you
expect that I, free in the position I have made for myself,
should go willingly and hold out my hands to the shackles of
a stranger? That is all Charles is to me. He has fought
battles here which he has lost, he is therefore a bad
captain; he has succeeded in no negotiation, he is therefore
a bad diplomatist; he has paraded his wants and his miseries
in all the courts of Europe, he has therefore a weak and
pusillanimous heart. Nothing noble, nothing great, nothing
strong has hitherto emanated from that genius which aspires
to govern one of the greatest kingdoms of the earth. I know
this Charles, then, under none but bad aspects, and you
would wish me, a man of good sense, to go and make myself
gratuitously the slave of a creature who is inferior to me
in military capacity, in politics, and in dignity! No,
monsieur. When some great and noble action shall have taught
me to value Charles, I shall perhaps recognize his rights to
a throne from which we have cast the father because he
wanted the virtues which his son has hitherto lacked, but,
in fact of rights, I only recognize my own; the revolution
made me a general, my sword will make me protector, if I
wish it. Let Charles show himself, let him present himself,
let him enter the competition open to genius, and, above
all, let him remember that he is of a race from whom more
will be expected than from any other. Therefore, monsieur,
say no more about him. I neither refuse nor accept: I
reserve myself -- I wait."

Athos knew Monk to be too well informed of all concerning
Charles to venture to urge the discussion further; it was
neither the time nor the place. "My lord," then said he, "I
have nothing to do but to thank you."

"And why, monsieur? Because you have formed a correct
opinion of me, or because I have acted according to your
judgment? Is that, in truth, worthy of thanks? This gold
which you are about to carry to Charles will serve me as a
test for him, by seeing the use he will make of it. I shall
have an opinion which now I have not."

"And yet does not your honor fear to compromise yourself by
allowing such a sum to be carried away for the service of
your enemy?"

"My enemy, say you? Eh, monsieur, I have no enemies. I am in
the service of the parliament, which orders me to fight
General Lambert and Charles Stuart -- its enemies, and not
mine. I fight them. If the parliament, on the contrary,
ordered me to unfurl my standards on the port of London, and
to assemble my soldiers on the banks to receive Charles II.
---- "

"You would obey?" cried Athos, joyfully.

"Pardon me," said Monk, smiling, "I was going -- I, a
gray-headed man -- in truth, how could I forget myself? was
going to speak like a foolish young man."

"Then you would not obey?" said Athos.

"I do not say that either, monsieur. The welfare of my
country before everything. God, who has given me the power,
has, no doubt, willed that I should have that power for the
good of all, and He has given me, at the same time,
discernment. If the parliament were to order such a thing, I
should reflect."

The brow of Athos became clouded. "Then I may positively say
that your honor is not inclined to favor King Charles II.?"

"You continue to question me, monsieur le comte; allow me to
do so in turn, if you please."

"Do, monsieur; and may God inspire you with the idea of
replying to me as frankly as I shall reply to you."

"When you shall have taken this money back to your prince,
what advice will you give him?"

Athos fixed upon Monk a proud and resolute look.

"My lord," said he, "with this million, which others would
perhaps employ in negotiating, I would advise the king to
raise two regiments, to enter Scotland, which you have just
pacified: to give to the people the franchises which the
revolution promised them, and in which it has not, in all
cases, kept its word. I should advise him to command in
person this little army, which would, believe me, increase,
and to die, standard in hand, and sword in its sheath,
saying, `Englishmen! I am the third king of my race you have
killed; beware of the justice of God!'"

Monk hung down his head, and mused for an instant. "If he
succeeded," said he, "which is very improbable, but not
impossible -- for everything is possible in this world --
what would you advise him to do?"

"To think that by the will of God he lost his crown but by
the good will of men he recovered it."

An ironical smile passed over the lips of Monk.

"Unfortunately, monsieur," said he, "kings do not know how
to follow good advice."

"Ah, my lord, Charles II. is not a king," replied Athos,
smiling in his turn, but with a very different expression
from Monk.

"Let us terminate this, monsieur le comte, -- that is your
desire, is it not?"

Athos bowed.

"I shall give orders to have these two casks transported
whither you please. Where are you lodging, monsieur?"

"In a little hamlet at the mouth of the river, your honor."

"Oh, I know the hamlet; it consists of five or six houses,
does it not?"

"Exactly. Well, I inhabit the first, -- two net-makers
occupy it with me; it is their bark which brought me
ashore."

"But your own vessel, monsieur?"

"My vessel is at anchor, a quarter of a mile at sea, and
waits for me."

"You do not think, however, of setting out immediately?"

"My lord, I shall try once more to convince your honor."

"You will not succeed," replied Monk; "but it is of
consequence that you should depart from Newcastle without
leaving of your passage the least suspicion that might prove
injurious to me or you. To-morrow my officers think Lambert
will attack me. I, on the contrary, am convinced that he
will not stir; it is in my opinion impossible. Lambert leads
an army devoid of homogeneous principles, and there is no
possible army with such elements. I have taught my soldiers
to consider my authority subordinate to another, therefore
after me, round me, and beneath me they still look for
something. It would result that if I were dead, whatever
might happen, my army would not be demoralized all at once;
it results, that if I choose to absent myself, for instance,
as it does please me to do sometimes, there would not be in
the camp the shadow of uneasiness or disorder. I am the
magnet -- the sympathetic and natural strength of the
English. All those scattered irons that will be sent against
me I shall attract to myself. Lambert, at this moment,
commands eighteen thousand deserters, but I have never
mentioned that to my officers, you may easily suppose.
Nothing is more useful to an army than the expectation of a
coming battle; everybody is awake -- everybody is on guard.
I tell you this that you may live in perfect security. Do
not be in a hurry, then, to cross the seas; within a week
there will be something fresh, either a battle or an
accomodation. Then, as you have judged me to be a honorable
man, and confided your secret to me, I have to thank you for
this confidence, and I shall come and pay you a visit or
send for you. Do not go before I send you word. I repeat the
request."

"I promise you, general," cried Athos, with a joy so great,
that in spite of all his circumspection, he could not
prevent its sparkling in his eyes.

Monk surprised this flash, and immediately extinguished it
by one of those silent smiles which always caused his
interlocutors to know they had made no inroad on his mind.

"Then, my lord, it is a week that you desire me to wait?"

"A week? yes, monsieur."

"And during these days what shall I do?"

"If there should be a battle, keep at a distance from it, I
beseech you. I know the French delight in such amusements,
-- you might take a fancy to see how we fight, and you might
receive some chance shot. Our Scotchmen are very bad
marksmen, and I do not wish that a worthy gentleman like you
should return to France wounded. Nor should I like to be
obliged myself, to send to your prince his million left here
by you, for then it would be said, and with some reason,
that I paid the Pretender to enable him to make war against
the parliament. Go, then, monsieur, and let it be done as
has been agreed upon."

"Ah, my lord," said Athos, "what joy it would give me to be
the first that penetrated to the noble heart which beats
beneath that cloak!"

"You think, then, that I have secrets," said Monk, without
changing the half cheerful expression of his countenance.
"Why, monsieur, what secret can you expect to find in the
hollow head of a soldier? But it is getting late, and our
torch is almost out; let us call our man."

"Hola!" cried Monk in French, approaching the stairs; "hola!
fisherman!"

The fisherman, benumbed by the cold night air, replied in a
hoarse voice, asking what they wanted of him.

"Go to the post," said Monk, "and order a sergeant, in the
name of General Monk, to come here immediately."

This was a commission easily performed; for the sergeant,
uneasy at the general's being in that desolate abbey, had
drawn nearer by degrees, and was not much further off than
the fisherman. The general's order was therefore heard by
him, and he hastened to obey it.

"Get a horse and two men," said Monk.

"A horse and two men?" repeated the sergeant.

"Yes," replied Monk. "Have you any means of getting a horse
with a pack-saddle or two paniers?"

"No doubt, at a hundred paces off, in the Scotch camp."

"Very well."

"What shall I do with the horse, general?"

"Look here."

The sergeant descended the three steps which separated him
from Monk, and came into the vault.

"You see," said Monk, "that gentleman yonder?"

"Yes, general."

"And you see these two casks?"

"Perfectly."

"They are two casks, one containing powder, and the other
balls; I wish these casks to be transported to the little
hamlet at the mouth of the river, and which I intend to
occupy to-morrow with two hundred muskets. You understand
that the commission is a secret one, for it is a movement
that may decide the fate of the battle."

"Oh, general!" murmured the sergeant.

"Mind, then! Let these casks be fastened on to the horse,
and let them be escorted by two men and you to the residence
of this gentleman, who is my friend. But take care that
nobody knows it."

"I would go by the marsh if I knew the road," said the
sergeant.

"I know one myself," said Athos; "it is not wide, but it is
solid, having been made upon piles; and with care we shall
get over safely enough."

"Do everything this gentleman shall order you to do."

"Oh! oh! the casks are heavy," said the sergeant, trying to
lift one.

"They weigh four hundred pounds each, if they contain what
they ought to contain, do they not, monsieur?"

"Thereabouts," said Athos.

The sergeant went in search of the two men and the horse.
Monk, left alone with Athos, affected to speak to him on
nothing but indifferent subjects while examining the vault
in a cursory manner. Then, hearing the horse's steps, --

"I leave you with your men, monsieur," said he, "and return
to the camp. You are perfectly safe."

"I shall see you again, then, my lord?" asked Athos.

"That is agreed upon, monsieur, and with much pleasure."

Monk held out his hand to Athos.

"Ah! my lord, if you would!" murmured Athos.

"Hush! monsieur, it is agreed that we shall speak no more of
that." And bowing to Athos, he went up the stairs, meeting
about half-way his men, who were coming down. He had not
gone twenty paces, when a faint but prolonged whistle was
heard at a distance. Monk listened, but seeing nothing and
hearing nothing, he continued his route, Then he remembered
the fisherman, and looked about for him; but the fisherman
had disappeared. If he had, however, looked with more
attention, he might have seen that man, bent double, gliding
like a serpent along the stones and losing himself in the
mist that floated over the surface of the marsh. He might
have equally seen, had he attempted to pierce that mist, a
spectacle that might have attracted his attention; and that
was the rigging of the vessel, which had changed place, and
was now nearer the shore. But Monk saw nothing; and thinking
he had nothing to fear, he entered the deserted causeway
which led to his camp. It was then that the disappearance of
the fisherman appeared strange, and that a real suspicion
began to take possession of his mind. He had just placed at
the orders of Athos the only post that could protect him. He
had a mile of causeway to traverse before he could regain
his camp. The fog increased with such intensity that he
could scarcely distinguish objects at ten paces' distance.
Monk then thought he heard the sound of an oar over the
marsh on the right. "Who goes there?" said he.

But nobody answered; then he cocked his pistol, took his
sword in his hand, and quickened his pace without, however,
being willing to call anybody. Such a summons, for which
there was no absolute necessity, appeared unworthy of him.




CHAPTER 27

The Next Day



It was seven o'clock in the morning, the first rays of day
lightened the pools of the marsh, in which the sun was
reflected like a red ball, when Athos, awaking and opening
the window of his bed-chamber, which looked out upon the
banks of the river, perceived, at fifteen paces' distance
from him, the sergeant and the men who had accompanied him
the evening before, and who, after having deposited the
casks at his house, had returned to the camp by the causeway
on the right.

Why had these men come back after having returned to the
camp? That was the question which first presented itself to
Athos. The sergeant, with his head raised, appeared to be
watching the moment when the gentleman should appear, to
address him. Athos, surprised to see these men, whom he had
seen depart the night before, could not refrain from
expressing his astonishment to them.

"There is nothing surprising in that, monsieur," said the
sergeant; "for yesterday the general commanded me to watch
over your safety, and I thought it right to obey that
order."

"Is the general at the camp?" asked Athos.

"No doubt he is, monsieur; as when he left you he was going
back."

"Well, wait for me a moment; I am going thither to render an
account of the fidelity with which you fulfilled your duty,
and to get my sword, which I left upon the table in the
tent."

"That happens very well," said the sergeant, "for we were
about to request you to do so."

Athos fancied he could detect an air of equivocal bonhomie
upon the countenance of the sergeant; but the adventure of
the vault might have excited the curiosity of the man, and
it was not surprising that he allowed some of the feelings
which agitated his mind to appear in his face. Athos closed
the doors carefully, confiding the keys to Grimaud, who had
chosen his domicile beneath the shed itself, which led to
the cellar where the casks had been deposited. The sergeant
escorted the Comte de la Fere to the camp. There a fresh
guard awaited him, and relieved the four men who had
conducted Athos.

This fresh guard was commanded by the aid-de-camp Digby,
who, on their way, fixed upon Athos looks so little
encouraging, that the Frenchman asked himself whence arose,
with regard to him, this vigilance and this severity, when
the evening before he had been left perfectly free. He
nevertheless continued his way to the headquarters, keeping
to himself the observations which men and things forced him
to make. He found in the general's tent, to which he had
been introduced the evening before, three superior officers:
these were Monk's lieutenant and two colonels. Athos
perceived his sword; it was still on the table where he left
it. Neither of the officers had seen Athos, consequently
neither of them knew him. Monk's lieutenant asked, at the
appearance of Athos, if that were the same gentleman with
whom the General had left the tent.

"Yes, your honor," said the sergeant; "it is the same."

"But," said Athos haughtily, "I do not deny it, I think; and
now, gentlemen, in turn, permit me to ask you to what
purpose these questions are asked, and particularly some
explanation upon the tone in which you ask them?"

"Monsieur," said the lieutenant, "if we address these
questions to you, it is because we have a right to do so,
and if we make them in a particular tone, it is because that
tone, believe me, agrees with the circumstances."

"Gentlemen," said Athos, "you do not know who I am; but I
must tell you I acknowledge no one here but General Monk as
my equal. Where is he? Let me be conducted to him, and if he
has any questions to put to me, I will answer him and to his
satisfaction, I hope. I repeat, gentlemen, where is the
general?"

"Eh! good God! you know better than we do where he is," said
the lieutenant.

"I?"

"Yes, you."

"Monsieur," said Athos, "I do not understand you."

"You will understand me -- and, in the first place, do not
speak so loud."

Athos smiled disdainfully.

"We don't ask you to smile," said one of the colonels
warmly; "we require you to answer."

"And I, gentlemen, declare to you that I will not reply
until I am in the presence of the general."

"But," replied the same colonel who had already spoken, "you
know very well that is impossible."

"This is the second time I have received this strange reply
to the wish I express," said Athos. "Is the general absent?"

This question was made with such apparent good faith, and
the gentleman wore an air of such natural surprise, that the
three officers exchanged a meaning look. The lieutenant, by
a tacit convention with the other two, was spokesman."

"Monsieur, the general left you last night on the borders of
the monastery."

"Yes, monsieur."

"And you went ---- "

"It is not for me to answer you, but for those who have
accompanied me. They were your soldiers, ask them."

"But if we please to question you?"

"Then it will please me to reply, monsieur, that I do not
recognize any one here, that I know no one here but the
general, and that it is to him alone I will reply."

"So be it, monsieur; but as we are the masters, we
constitute ourselves a council of war, and when you are
before judges you must reply."

The countenance of Athos expressed nothing but astonishment
and disdain, instead of the terror the officers expected to
read in it at this threat.

"Scotch or English judges upon me, a subject of the king of
France; upon me, placed under the safeguard of British
honor! You are mad, gentlemen!" said Athos, shrugging his
shoulders.

The officers looked at each other. "Then, monsieur," said
one of them, "do you pretend not to know where the general
is?"

"To that, monsieur, I have already replied."

"Yes, but you have already replied an incredible thing."

"It is true, nevertheless, gentlemen. Men of my rank are not
generally liars. I am a gentleman, I have told you, and when
I have at my side the sword which, by an excess of delicacy,
I left last night upon the table whereon it still lies,
believe me, no man says that to me which I am unwilling to
hear. I am at this moment disarmed; if you pretend to be my
judges, try me; if you are but my executioners, kill me."

"But, monsieur ---- " asked the lieutenant, in a more
courteous voice, struck with the lofty coolness of Athos.

"Sir, I came to speak confidentially with your general about
affairs of importance. It was not an ordinary welcome that
he gave me. The accounts your soldiers can give you may
convince you of that. If, then, the general received me in
that manner, he knew my titles to his esteem. Now, you do
not suspect, I should think that I should reveal my secrets
to you, and still less his."

"But these casks, what do they contain?"

"Have you not put that question to your soldiers? What was
their reply?"

"That they contained powder and ball."

"From whom had they that information? They must have told
you that."

"From the general; but we are not dupes."

"Beware, gentlemen, it is not to me you are now giving the
lie, it is to your leader."

The officers again looked at each other. Athos continued:
"Before your soldiers the general told me to wait a week,
and at the expiration of that week he would give me the
answer he had to make me. Have I fled away? No, I wait."

"He told you to wait a week!" cried the lieutenant.

"He told me that so clearly, sir, that I have a sloop at the
mouth of the river, which I could with ease have joined
yesterday, and embarked. Now, if I have remained, it was
only in compliance with the desire of your general, his
honor having requested me not to depart without a last
audience, which fixed at a week hence. I repeat to you,
then, I am waiting."

The lieutenant turned towards the other officers, and said,
in a low voice: "If this gentleman speaks truth, there may
still be some hope. The general may be carrying out some
negotiations so secret, that he thought it imprudent to
inform even us. Then the time limited for his absence would
be a week." Then, turning towards Athos: "Monsieur," said
he, "your declaration is of the most serious importance; are
you willing to repeat it under the seal of an oath?"

"Sir," replied Athos, "I have always lived in a world where
my simple word was regarded as the most sacred of oaths."

"This time, however, monsieur, the circumstance is more
grave than any you may have been placed in. The safety of
the whole army is at stake. Reflect, the general has
disappeared, and our search for him has been vain. Is this
disappearance natural? Has a crime been committed? Are we
not bound to carry our investigations to extremity? Have we
any right to wait with patience? At this moment, everything,
monsieur, depends upon the words you are about to
pronounce."

"Thus questioned, gentlemen, I no longer hesitate," said
Athos. "Yes, I came hither to converse confidentially with
General Monk, and ask him for an answer regarding certain
interests; yes, the general being, doubtless, unable to
pronounce before the expected battle, begged me to remain a
week in the house I inhabit, promising me that in a week I
should see him again. Yes, all this is true, and I swear it
by the God who is the absolute master of my life and yours."
Athos pronounced these words with so much grandeur and
solemnity, that the three officers were almost convinced.
Nevertheless, one of the colonels made a last attempt.

"Monsieur," said he, "although we may be now persuaded of
the truth of what you say, there is yet a strange mystery in
all this. The general is too prudent a man to have thus
abandoned his army on the eve of a battle without having at
least given notice of it to one of us. As for myself, I
cannot believe but that some strange event has been the
cause of this disappearance. Yesterday some foreign
fishermen came to sell their fish here; they were lodged
yonder among the Scots; that is to say, on the road the
general took with this gentleman, to go to the abbey, and to
return from it. It was one of those fishermen that
accompanied the general with a light. And this morning, bark
and fishermen have all disappeared, carried away by the
night's tide."

"For my part," said the lieutenant, "I see nothing in that
that is not quite natural, for these people were not
prisoners."

"No, but I repeat it was one of them who lighted the general
and this gentleman to the abbey, and Digby assures us that
the general had strong suspicions concerning those people.
Now, who can say whether these people were not connected
with this gentleman; and that, the blow being struck, the
gentleman, who is evidently brave, did not remain to
reassure us by his presence, and to prevent our researches
being made in a right direction?"

This speech made an impression upon the other two officers.

"Sir," said Athos, "permit me to tell you, that your
reasoning, though specious in appearance, nevertheless wants
consistency, as regards me. I have remained, you say, to
divert suspicion. Well! on the contrary, suspicions arise in
me as well as in you; and I say, it is impossible,
gentlemen, that the general, on the eve of a battle, should
leave his army without saying anything to at least one of
his officers. Yes, there is some strange event connected
with this; instead of being idle and waiting, you must
display all the activity and all the vigilance possible. I
am your prisoner, gentlemen, upon parole or otherwise. My
honor is concerned in ascertaining what has become of
General Monk, and to such a point, that if you were to say
to me, `Depart!' I should reply `No, I will remain!' And if
you were to ask my opinion, I should add: `Yes, the general
is the victim of some conspiracy, for, if he had intended to
leave the camp he would have told me so.' Seek then, search
the land, search the sea; the general has not gone of his
own good will."

The lieutenant made a sign to the other two officers.

"No, monsieur," said he, "no; in your turn you go too far.
The general has nothing to suffer from these events, and, no
doubt, has directed them. What Monk is now doing he has
often done before. We are wrong in alarming ourselves; his
absence will, doubtless, be of short duration; therefore,
let us beware, lest by a pusillanimity which the general
would consider a crime, of making his absence public, and by
that means demoralize the army. The general gives a striking
proof of his confidence in us; let us show ourselves worthy
of it. Gentlemen, let the most profound silence cover all
this with an impenetrable veil; we will detain this
gentleman, not from mistrust of him with regard to the
crime, but to assure more effectively the secret of the
general's absence by keeping among ourselves; therefore,
until fresh orders, the gentleman will remain at
headquarters."

"Gentlemen," said Athos, "you forget that last night the
general confided to me a deposit over which I am bound to
watch. Give me whatever guard you like, chain me if you
like, but leave me the house I inhabit for my prison. The
general, on his return, would reproach you, I swear on the
honor of a gentleman, for having displeased him in this."

"So be it, monsieur," said the lieutenant; "return to your
abode."

Then they placed over Athos a guard of fifty men, who
surrounded his house, without losing sight of him for a
minute.

The secret remained secure, but hours, days passed away
without the general's returning, or without anything being
heard of him.




CHAPTER 28

Smuggling



Two days after the events we have just related, and while
General Monk was expected every minute in the camp to which
he did not return, a little Dutch felucca, manned by eleven
men, cast anchor upon the coast of Scheveningen, nearly
within cannon-shot of the port. It was night, the darkness
was great, the tide rose in the darkness; it was a capital
time to land passengers and merchandise.

The road of Scheveningen forms a vast crescent; it is not
very deep and not very safe; therefore, nothing is seen
stationed there but large Flemish hoys, or some of those
Dutch barks which fishermen draw up on the sand on rollers,
as the ancients did, according to Virgil. When the tide is
rising, and advancing on land, it is not prudent to bring
the vessels too close inshore, for, if the wind is fresh,
the prows are buried in the sand; and the sand of that coast
is spongy; it receives easily, but does not yield so well.
It was on this account, no doubt, that a boat was detached
from the bark as soon as the latter had cast anchor, and
came with eight sailors, amidst whom was to be seen an
object of an oblong form, a sort of large pannier or bale.

The shore was deserted; the few fishermen inhabiting the
down were gone to bed. The only sentinel that guarded the
coast (a coast very badly guarded, seeing that a landing
from large ships was impossible), without having been able
to follow the example of the fishermen, who were gone to
bed, imitated them so far, that he slept at the back of his
watch-box as soundly as they slept in their beds. The only
noise to be heard, then, was the whistling of the night
breeze among the bushes and the brambles of the downs. But
the people who were approaching were doubtless mistrustful
people, for this real silence and apparent solitude did not
satisfy them. Their boat, therefore, scarcely as visible as
a dark speck upon the ocean, glided along noiselessly,
avoiding the use of their oars for fear of being heard, and
gained the nearest land.

Scarcely had it touched the ground when a single man jumped
out of the boat, after having given a brief order, in a
manner which denoted the habit of commanding. In consequence
of this order, several muskets immediately glittered in the
feeble light reflected from that mirror of the heavens, the
sea; and the oblong bale of which we spoke, containing no
doubt some contraband object, was transported to land, with
infinite precautions. Immediately after that, the man who
had landed first set off at a rapid pace diagonally towards
the village of Scheveningen, directing his course to the
nearest point of the wood. When there, he sought for that
house already described as the temporary residence -- and a
very humble residence -- of him who was styled by courtesy
king of England.

All were asleep there, as everywhere else, only a large dog,
of the race of those which the fishermen of Scheveningen
harness to little carts to carry fish to the Hague, began to
bark formidably as soon as the stranger's steps were audible
beneath the windows. But the watchfulness, instead of
alarming the newly-landed man, appeared, on the contrary, to
give him great joy, for his voice might perhaps have proved
insufficient to rouse the people of the house, whilst, with
an auxiliary of that sort, his voice became almost useless.
The stranger waited, then, till these reiterated and
sonorous barkings should, according to all probability, have
produced their effect, and then he ventured a summons. On
hearing his voice, the dog began to roar with such violence
that another voice was soon heard from the interior,
quieting the dog. With that the dog was quieted.

"What do you want?" asked that voice, at the same time weak,
broken, and civil.

"I want his majesty King Charles II., king of England," said
the stranger.

"What do you want with him?"

"I want to speak to him."

"Who are you?"

"Ah! Mordioux! you ask too much; I don't like talking
through doors."

"Only tell me your name."

"I don't like to declare my name in the open air, either;
besides, you may be sure I shall not eat your dog, and I
hope to God he will be as reserved with respect to me."

"You bring news, perhaps, monsieur, do you not?" replied the
voice, patient and querulous as that of an old man.

"I will answer for it, I bring you news you little expect.
Open the door, then, if you please, hein!"

"Monsieur," persisted the old man, "do you believe, upon
your soul and conscience, that your news is worth waking the
king?"

"For God's sake, my dear monsieur, draw your bolts; you will
not be sorry, I swear, for the trouble it will give you. I
am worth my weight in gold, parole d'honneur!"

"Monsieur, I cannot open the door till you have told me your
name."

"Must I, then?"

"It is by the order of my master, monsieur."

"Well, my name is -- but, I warn you, my name will tell you
absolutely nothing."

"Never mind, tell it, notwithstanding."

"Well, I am the Chevalier d'Artagnan."

The voice uttered an exclamation.

"Oh! good heavens!" said a voice on the other side of the
door. "Monsieur d'Artagnan. What happiness! I could not help
thinking I knew that voice."

"Humph!" said D'Artagnan. "My voice is known here! That's
flattering."

"Oh! yes, we know it," said the old man, drawing the bolts;
"and here is the proof." And at these words he let in
D'Artagnan, who, by the light of the lantern he carried in
his hand, recognized his obstinate interlocutor.

"Ah! Mordioux!" cried he: "why, it is Parry! I ought to have
known that."

"Parry, yes, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan, it is I. What joy
to see you once again!"

"You are right there, what joy!" said D'Artagnan, pressing
the old man's hand. "There, now you'll go and inform the
king, will you not?"

"But the king is asleep, my dear monsieur."

"Mordioux! then wake him. He won't scold you for having
disturbed him, I will promise you."

"You come on the part of the count, do you not?"

"The Comte de la Fere?"

"From Athos?"

"Ma foi! no; I come on my own part. Come, Parry, quick! The
king -- I want the king."

Parry did not think it his duty to resist any longer; he
knew D'Artagnan of old; he knew that, although a Gascon, his
words never promised more than they could stand to. He
crossed a court and a little garden, appeased the dog, that
seemed most anxious to taste of the musketeer's flesh, and
went to knock at the window of a chamber forming the
ground-floor of a little pavilion. Immediately a little dog
inhabiting that chamber replied to the great dog inhabiting
the court.

"Poor king!" said D'Artagnan to himself, "these are his
body-guards. It is true he is not the worse guarded on that
account."

"What is wanted with me?" asked the king, from the back of
the chamber.

"Sire, it is M. le Chevalier d'Artagnan, who brings you some
news."

A noise was immediately heard in the chamber, a door was
opened, and a flood of light inundated the corridor and the
garden. The king was working by the light of a lamp. Papers
were lying about upon his desk, and he had commenced the
foul copy of a letter which showed, by the numerous
erasures, the trouble he had had in writing it.

"Come in, monsieur le chevalier," said he, turning around.
Then perceiving the fisherman, "What do you mean, Parry?
Where is M. le Chevalier d'Artagnan?" asked Charles.

"He is before you, sire," said M. d'Artagnan.

"What, in that costume?"

"Yes; look at me, sire; do you not remember having seen me
at Blois, in the ante-chambers of King Louis XIV.?"

"Yes, monsieur, and I remember I was much pleased with you."

D'Artagnan bowed. "It was my duty to behave as I did, the
moment I knew that I had the honor of being near your
majesty."

"You bring me news, do you say?"

"Yes, sire."

"From the king of France?"

"Ma foi! no, sire," replied D'Artagnan. "Your majesty must
have seen yonder that the king of France is only occupied
with his own majesty."

Charles raised his eyes towards heaven.

"No, sire, no," continued D'Artagnan. "I bring news entirely
composed of personal facts. Nevertheless, I hope your
majesty will listen to the facts and news with some favor."

"Speak, monsieur."

"If I am not mistaken, sire, your majesty spoke a great
deal, at Blois, of the embarrassed state in which the
affairs of England are."

Charles colored. "Monsieur," said he, "it was to the king of
France I related ---- "

"Oh! your majesty is mistaken," said the musketeer, coolly;
"I know how to speak to kings in misfortune. It is only when
they are in misfortune that they speak to me; once
fortunate, they look upon me no more. I have, then, for your
majesty, not only the greatest respect, but, still more, the
most absolute devotion; and that, believe me, with me, sire,
means something. Now, hearing your majesty complain of fate,
I found that you were noble and generous, and bore
misfortune well."

"In truth," said Charles, much astonished, "I do not know
which I ought to prefer, your freedoms or your respects."

"You will choose presently, sire," said D'Artagnan. "Then
your majesty complained to your brother, Louis XIV., of the
difficulty you experienced in returning to England and
regaining your throne for want of men and money."

Charles allowed a movement of impatience to escape him.

"And the principal object your majesty found in your way,"
continued D'Artagnan, "was a certain general commanding the
armies of the parliament, and who was playing yonder the
part of another Cromwell. Did not your majesty say so?"

"Yes, but I repeat to you, monsieur, those words were for
the king's ears alone."

"And you will see, sire, that it is very fortunate that they
fell into those of his lieutenant of musketeers. That man so
troublesome to your majesty was one General Monk, I believe;
did I not hear his name correctly, sire?"

"Yes, monsieur, but once more, to what purpose are all these
questions?"

"Oh! I know very well, sire, that etiquette will not allow
kings to be questioned. I hope, however, presently you will
pardon my want of etiquette. Your majesty added that,
notwithstanding, if you could see him, confer with him, and
meet him face to face, you would triumph, either by force or
persuasion, over that obstacle -- the only serious one, the
only insurmountable one, the only real one you met with on
your road."

"All that is true, monsieur: my destiny, my future, my
obscurity, or my glory depend upon that man; but what do you
draw from that?"

"One thing alone, that if this General Monk is troublesome
to the point your majesty describes, it would be expedient
to get rid of him or to make an ally of him."

"Monsieur, a king who has neither army nor money, as you
have heard my conversation with my brother Louis, has no
means of acting against a man like Monk."

"Yes, sire, that was your opinion, I know very well; but,
fortunately, for you, it was not mine."

"What do you mean by that?"

"That, without an army and without a million, I have done --
I, myself -- what your majesty thought could alone be done
with an army and a million."

"How! What do you say? What have you done?"

"What have I done? Eh! well, sire, I went yonder to take
this man who is so troublesome to your majesty."

"In England?"

"Exactly, sire."

"You went to take Monk in England?"

"Should I by chance have done wrong, sire?"

"In truth, you are mad, monsieur!"

"Not the least in the world, sire."

"You have taken Monk?"

"Yes, sire."

"Where?"

"In the midst of his camp."

The king trembled with impatience.

"And having taken him on the causeway of Newcastle, I bring
him to your majesty," said D'Artagnan, simply.

"You bring him to me!" cried the king, almost indignant at
what he considered a mystification.

"Yes, sire," replied D'Artagnan, the same tone, "I bring him
to you; he is down below yonder, in a large chest pierced
with holes, so as to allow him to breathe."

"Good God!"

"Oh! don't be uneasy, sire, we have taken the greatest
possible care of him. He comes in good state, and in perfect
condition. Would your majesty please to see him, to talk
with him, or to have him thrown into the sea?"

"Oh, heavens!" repeated Charles, "oh, heavens! do you speak
the truth, monsieur? Are you not insulting me with some
unworthy joke? You have accomplished this unheard-of act of
audacity and genius -- impossible!"

"Will your majesty permit me to open the window?" said
D'Artagnan, opening it.

The king had not time to reply, yes on no. D'Artagnan gave a
shrill and prolonged whistle, which he repeated three times
through the silence of the night.

"There!" said he, "he will be brought to your majesty."




CHAPTER 29

In which D'Artagnan begins to fear he has placed his
Money and that of Planchet in the Sinking Fund



The king could not overcome his surprise, and looked
sometimes at the smiling face of the musketeer, and
sometimes at the dark window which opened into the night.
But before he had fixed his ideas, eight of D'Artagnan's
men, for two had remained to take care of the bark, brought
to the house, where Parry received him, that object of an
oblong form, which, for the moment inclosed the destinies of
England. Before he left Calais, D'Artagnan had had made in
that city a sort of coffin, large and deep enough for a man
to turn in it at his ease. The bottom and sides, properly
upholstered, formed a bed sufficiently soft to prevent the
rolling of the ship turning this kind of cage into a
rat-trap. The little grating, of which D'Artagnan had spoken
to the king, like the visor of a helmet, was placed opposite
to the man's face. It was so constructed that, at the least
cry, a sudden pressure would stifle that cry, and, if
necessary, him who had uttered that cry.

D'Artagnan was so well acquainted with his crew and his
prisoner, that during the whole voyage he had been in dread
of two things: either that the general would prefer death to
this sort of imprisonment, and would smother himself by
endeavoring to speak, or that his guards would allow
themselves to be tempted by the offers of the prisoner, and
put him, D'Artagnan, into the box instead of Monk.

D'Artagnan, therefore, had passed the two days and the two
nights of the voyage close to the coffin, alone with the
general, offering him wine and food, which the latter had
refused, and constantly endeavoring to reassure him upon the
destiny which awaited him at the end of this singular
captivity. Two pistols on the table and his naked sword made
D'Artagnan easy with regard to indiscretions from without.

When once at Scheveningen he had felt completely reassured.
His men greatly dreaded any conflict with the lords of the
soil. He had, besides, interested in his cause him who had
morally served him as lieutenant, and whom we have seen
reply to the name of Menneville. The latter, not being a
vulgar spirit, had more to risk than the others, because he
had more conscience. He believed in a future in the service
of D'Artagnan, and consequently would have allowed himself
to be cut to pieces, rather than violate the order given by
his leader. Thus it was that, once landed, it was to him
D'Artagnan had confided the care of the chest and the
general's breathing. It was he, too, he had ordered to have
the chest brought by the seven men as soon as he should hear
the triple whistle. We have seen that the lieutenant obeyed.
The coffer once in the house, D'Artagnan dismissed his men
with a gracious smile, saying, "Messieurs, you have rendered
a great service to King Charles II., who in less than six
weeks will be king of England. Your gratification will then
be doubled. Return to the boat and wait for me." Upon which
they departed with such shouts of joy as terrified even the
dog himself.

D'Artagnan had caused the coffer to be brought as far as the
king's ante-chamber. He then, with great care, closed the
door of this ante-chamber, after which he opened the coffer,
and said to the general:

"General, I have a thousand excuses to make to you; my
manner of acting has not been worthy of such a man as you, I
know very well; but I wished you to take me for the captain
of a bark. And then England is a very inconvenient country
for transports. I hope, therefore, you will take all that
into consideration. But now, general, you are at liberty to
get up and walk." This said, he cut the bonds which fastened
the arms and hands of the general. The latter got up, and
then sat down with the countenance of a man who expects
death. D'Artagnan opened the door of Charles's study, and
said, "Sire, here is your enemy, M. Monk; I promised myself
to perform this service for your majesty. It is done; now
order as you please. M. Monk," added he, turning towards the
prisoner, "you are in the presence of his majesty Charles
II., sovereign lord of Great Britain."

Monk raised towards the prince his coldly stoical look, and
replied: "I know no king of Great Britain; I recognize even
here no one worthy of bearing the name of gentleman: for it
is in the name of King Charles II. that an emissary, whom I
took for an honest man, came and laid an infamous snare for
me. I have fallen into that snare; so much the worse for me.
Now, you the tempter," said he to the king, "you the
executor," said he to D'Artagnan; "remember what I am about
to say to you; you have my body, you may kill it, and I
advise you to do so, for you shall never have my mind or my
will. And now, ask me not a single word, as from this moment
I will not open my mouth even to cry out. I have said."

And he pronounced these words with the savage, invincible
resolution of the most mortified Puritan. D'Artagnan looked
at his prisoner like a man, who knows the value of every
word, and who fixes that value according to the accent with
which it has been pronounced.

"The fact is," said he, in a whisper to the king, "the
general is an obstinate man; he would not take a mouthful of
bread, nor swallow a drop of wine, during the two days of
our voyage. But as from this moment it is your majesty who
must decide his fate, I wash my hands of him."

Monk, erect, pale, and resigned, waited with his eyes fixed
and his arms folded. D'Artagnan turned towards him. "You
will please to understand perfectly," said he, "that your
speech, otherwise very fine, does not suit anybody, not even
yourself. His majesty wished to speak to you, you refused
him an interview; why, now that you are face to face, that
you are here by a force independent of your will, why do you
confine yourself to rigors which I consider useless and
absurd? Speak! what the devil! speak, if only to say `No.'"

Monk did not unclose his lips, Monk did not turn his eyes;
Monk stroked his mustache with a thoughtful air, which
announced that matters were going on badly.

During all this time Charles II. had fallen into a profound
reverie. For the first time he found himself face to face
with Monk; with the man he had so much desired to see; and,
with that peculiar glance which God has given to eagles and
kings, he had fathomed the abyss of his heart. He beheld
Monk, then, resolved positively to die rather than speak,
which was not to be wondered at in so considerable a man,
the wound in whose mind must at the moment have been cruel.
Charles II. formed, on the instant, one of those resolutions
upon which an ordinary man risks his life, a general his
fortune, and a king his kingdom. "Monsieur," said he to
Monk, "you are perfectly right upon certain points; I do
not, therefore, ask you to answer me, but to listen to me."

There was a moment's silence, during which the king looked
at Monk, who remained impassible.

"You have made me just now a painful reproach, monsieur,"
continued the king; "you said that one of my emissaries had
been to Newcastle to lay a snare for you, and that,
parenthetically, cannot be understood by M. d'Artagnan,
here, and to whom, before everything, I owe sincere thanks
for his generous, his heroic devotion."

D'Artagnan bowed with respect; Monk took no notice.

"For M. d'Artagnan -- and observe, M. Monk, I do not say
this to excuse myself -- for M. d'Artagnan," continued the
king, "went to England of his free will, without interest,
without orders, without hope, like a true gentleman as he
is, to render a service to an unfortunate king, and to add
to the illustrious actions of an existence, already so well
filled, one glorious deed more."

D'Artagnan colored a little, and coughed to keep his
countenance. Monk did not stir.

"You do not believe what I tell you, M. Monk," continued the
king. "I can understand that, -- such proofs of devotion are
so rare, that their reality may well be put in doubt."

"Monsieur would do wrong not to believe you, sire," cried
D'Artagnan: "for that which your majesty has said is the
exact truth, and the truth so exact that it seems, in going
to fetch the general, I have done something which sets
everything wrong. In truth, if it be so, I am in despair."

"Monsieur d'Artagnan," said the king, pressing the hand of
the musketeer, "you have obliged me as much as if you had
promoted the success of my cause, for you have revealed to
me an unknown friend, to whom I shall ever be grateful, and
whom I shall always love." And the king pressed his hand
cordially. "And," continued he, bowing to Monk, "an enemy
whom I shall henceforth esteem at his proper value."

The eyes of the Puritan flashed, but only once, and his
countenance, for an instant, illuminated by that flash,
resumed its somber impassibility.

"Then, Monsieur d'Artagnan," continued Charles, "this is
what was about to happen: M. le Comte de la Fere, whom you
know, I believe, has set out for Newcastle."

"What, Athos!" exclaimed D'Artagnan.

"Yes, that was his nom de guerre, I believe. The Comte de la
Fere had then set out for Newcastle, and was going, perhaps,
to bring the general to hold a conference with me or with
those of my party, when you violently, as it appears,
interfered with the negotiation."

"Mordioux!" replied D'Artagnan, "he entered the camp the
very evening in which I succeeded in getting into it with my
fishermen ---- "

An almost imperceptible frown on the brow of Monk told
D'Artagnan that he had surmised rightly.

"Yes, yes," muttered he; "I thought I knew his person; I
even fancied I knew his voice. Unlucky wretch that I am! Oh!
sire, pardon me! I thought I had so successfully steered my
bark."

"There is nothing ill in it, sir," said the king, "except
that the general accuses me of having laid a snare for him,
which is not the case. No, general, those are not the arms
which I contemplated employing with you as you will soon
see. In the meanwhile, when I give you my word upon the
honor of a gentleman, believe me, sir, believe me! Now,
Monsieur d'Artagnan, a word with you, if you please."

"I listen on my knees, sire."

"You are truly at my service, are you not?"

"Your majesty has seen I am, too much so."

"That is well; from a man like you one word suffices. In
addition to that word you bring actions. General, have the
goodness to follow me. Come with us, M. d'Artagnan."

D'Artagnan, considerably surprised, prepared to obey.
Charles II. went out, Monk followed him, D'Artagnan followed
Monk. Charles took the path by which D'Artagnan had come to
his abode; the fresh sea breezes soon caressed the faces of
the three nocturnal travelers, and, at fifty paces from the
little gate which Charles opened, they found themselves upon
the down in the face of the ocean, which, having ceased to
rise, reposed upon the shore like a wearied monster. Charles
II. walked pensively along, his head hanging down and his
hand beneath his cloak. Monk followed him, with crossed arms
and an uneasy look. D'Artagnan came last, with his hand on
the hilt of his sword.

"Where is the boat in which you came, gentlemen?" said
Charles to the musketeer.

"Yonder, sire, I have seven men and an officer waiting me in
that little bark which is lighted by a fire."

"Yes, I see; the boat is drawn upon the sand, but you
certainly did not come from Newcastle in that frail bark?"

"No, sire; I freighted a felucca, at my own expense, which
is at anchor within cannon-shot of the downs. It was in that
felucca we made the voyage."

"Sir," said the king to Monk, "you are free."

However firm of his will, Monk could not suppress an
exclamation. The king added an affirmative motion of his
head, and continued: "We shall waken a fisherman of the
village, who will put his boat to sea immediately, and will
take you back to any place you may command him. M.
d'Artagnan here will escort your honor. I place M.
d'Artagnan under the safeguard of your loyalty, M. Monk."

Monk allowed a murmur of surprise to escape him, and
D'Artagnan a profound sigh. The king, without appearing to
notice either, knocked against the deal trellis which
inclosed the cabin of the principal fisherman inhabiting the
down.

"Hey! Keyser!" cried he, "awake!"

"Who calls me?" asked the fisherman.

"I, Charles the king."

"Ah, my lord!" cried Keyser, rising ready dressed from the
sail in which he slept, as people sleep in a hammock. "What
can I do to serve you?"

"Captain Keyser," said Charles, "you must set sail
immediately. Here is a traveler who wishes to freight your
bark, and will pay you well; serve him well." And the king
drew back a few steps to allow Monk to speak to the
fisherman.

"I wish to cross over into England," said Monk, who spoke
Dutch enough to make himself understood.

"This minute," said the patron, "this very minute, if you
wish it."

"But will that be long?" said Monk.

"Not half an hour, your honor. My eldest son is at this
moment preparing the boat, as we were going out fishing at
three o'clock in the morning."

"Well, is all arranged?" asked the king, drawing near.

"All but the price," said the fisherman; "yes, sire."

"That is my affair," said Charles, "the gentleman is my
friend."

Monk started and looked at Charles on hearing this word.

"Very well, my lord," replied Keyser. And at that moment
they heard Keyser's eldest son, signaling from the shore
with the blast of a bull's horn.

"Now, gentlemen," said the king, "depart."

"Sire," said D'Artagnan, "will it please your majesty to
grant me a few minutes? I have engaged men, and I am going
without them; I must give them notice."

"Whistle to them," said Charles, smiling.

D'Artagnan, accordingly, whistled, whilst the patron Keyser
replied to his son; and four men, led by Menneville,
attended the first summons.

"Here is some money in account," said D'Artagnan, putting
into their hands a purse containing two thousand five
hundred livres in gold. "Go and wait for me at Calais, you
know where." And D'Artagnan heaved a profound sigh, as he
let the purse fall into the hands of Menneville.

"What, are you leaving us?" cried the men.

"For a short time," said D'Artagnan, "or for a long time,
who knows? But with 2,500 livres, and the 2,500 you have
already received, you are paid according to our agreement.
We are quits, then, my friend."

"But the boat?"

"Do not trouble yourself about that."

"Our things are on board the felucca."

"Go and seek them, and then set off immediately."

"Yes, captain."

D'Artagnan returned to Monk, saying, -- "Monsieur, I await
your orders, for I understand we are to go together, unless
my company be disagreeable to you."

"On the contrary, monsieur," said Monk.

"Come, gentlemen, on board," cried Keyser's son.

Charles bowed to the general with grace and dignity, saying,
-- "You will pardon me this unfortunate accident, and the
violence to which you have been subjected, when you are
convinced that I was not the cause of them."

Monk bowed profoundly without replying. On his side, Charles
affected not to say a word to D'Artagnan in private, but
aloud, -- "Once more, thanks, monsieur le chevalier," said
he, "thanks for your services. They will be repaid you by
the Lord God, who, I hope, reserves trials and troubles for
me alone."

Monk followed Keyser, and his son embarked with them.
D'Artagnan came after, muttering to himself, -- "Poor
Planchet! poor Planchet! I am very much afraid we have made
a bad speculation."




CHAPTER 30

The Shares of Planchet and Company rise again to Par



During the passage, Monk only spoke to D'Artagnan in cases
of urgent necessity. Thus, when the Frenchman hesitated to
come and take his meals, poor meals, composed of salt fish,
biscuit, and Hollands gin, Monk called him, saying, -- "To
table, monsieur, to table!"

This was all. D'Artagnan, from being himself on all great
occasions extremely concise, did not draw from the general's
conciseness a favorable augury of the result of his mission.
Now, as D'Artagnan had plenty of time for reflection, he
battered his brains during this time in endeavoring to find
out how Athos had seen King Charles, how he had conspired
his departure with him, and lastly, how he had entered
Monk's camp; and the poor lieutenant of musketeers plucked a
hair from his mustache every time he reflected that the
horseman who accompanied Monk on the night of the famous
abduction must have been Athos.

At length, after a passage of two nights and two days, the
patron Keyser touched at the point where Monk, who had given
all the orders during the voyage, had commanded they should
land. It was exactly at the mouth of the little river, near
which Athos had chosen his abode.

Daylight was waning, a splendid sun, like a red steel
buckler, was plunging the lower extremity of its disc
beneath the blue line of the sea. The felucca was making
fair way up the river, tolerably wide in that part, but
Monk, in his impatience, desired to be landed, and Keyser's
boat set him and D'Artagnan upon the muddy bank, amidst the
reeds. D'Artagnan, resigned to obedience, followed Monk
exactly as a chained bear follows his master; but the
position humiliated him not a little, and he grumbled to
himself that the service of kings was a bitter one, and that
the best of them was good for nothing. Monk walked with long
and hasty strides; it might be thought that he did not yet
feel certain of having reached English land. They had
already begun to perceive distinctly a few of the cottages
of the sailors and fishermen spread over the little quay of
this humble port, when, all at once, D'Artagnan cried out,
-- "God pardon me, there is a house on fire!"

Monk raised his eyes, and perceived there was, in fact, a
house which the flames were beginning to devour. It had
begun at a little shed belonging to the house, the roof of
which had caught. The fresh evening breeze agitated the
fire. The two travelers quickened their steps, hearing loud
cries, and seeing, as they drew nearer, soldiers with their
glittering arms pointing towards the house on fire. It was
doubtless this menacing occupation which had made them
neglect to signal the felucca. Monk stopped short for an
instant, and, for the first time, formulated his thoughts
into words. "Eh! but," said he, "perhaps they are not my
soldiers, but Lambert's."

These words contained at once a sorrow, an apprehension, and
a reproach perfectly intelligible to D'Artagnan. In fact,
during the general's absence, Lambert might have given
battle, conquered, and dispersed the parliament's army, and
taken with his own the place of Monk's army, deprived of its
strongest support. At this doubt, which passed from the mind
of Monk to his own, D'Artagnan reasoned in this manner: "One
of two things is going to happen; either Monk has spoken
correctly, and there are no longer any but Lambertists in
the country -- that is to say, enemies, who would receive me
wonderfully well, since it is to me they owe their victory;
or nothing is changed, and Monk, transported with joy at
finding his camp still in the same place, will not prove too
severe in his settlement with me." Whilst thinking thus, the
two travelers advanced, and began to mingle with a little
knot of sailors, who looked on with sorrow at the burning
house, but did not dare to say anything on account of the
threats of the soldiers.

Monk addressed one of these sailors: -- "What is going on
here?" asked he.

"Sir," replied the man, not recognizing Monk as an officer,
under the thick cloak which enveloped him, "that house was
inhabited by a foreigner, and this foreigner became
suspected by the soldiers. They wanted to get into his house
under pretense of taking him to the camp; but he, without
being frightened by their number, threatened death to the
first who should cross the threshold of his door, and as
there was one who did venture, the Frenchman stretched him
on the earth with a pistol-shot."

"Ah! he is a Frenchman, is he?" said D'Artagnan, rubbing his
hands. "Good!"

"How good?" replied the fisherman.

"No, I don't mean that. -- What then -- my tongue slipped."

"What then, sir -- why, the other men became as enraged as
so many lions: they fired more than a hundred shots at the
house; but the Frenchman was sheltered by the wall, and
every time they tried to enter by the door they met with a
shot from his lackey, whose aim is deadly, d'ye see? Every
time they threatened the window, they met with a pistol-shot
from the master. Look and count -- there are seven men down.

"Ah! my brave countryman," cried D'Artagnan, "wait a little,
wait a little. I will be with you, and we will settle with
this rabble."

"One instant, sir," said Monk, "wait."

"Long?"

"No; only the time to ask a question." Then, turning towards
the sailor, "My friend," asked he with an emotion which, in
spite of all his self-command, he could not conceal, "whose
soldiers are these, pray tell me?"

"Whose should they be but that madman, Monk's?"

"There has been no battle, then?"

"A battle, ah, yes! for what purpose? Lambert's army is
melting away like snow in April. All come to Monk, officers
and soldiers. In a week Lambert won't have fifty men left."

The fisherman was interrupted by a fresh discharge directed
against the house, and by another pistol-shot which replied
to the discharge and struck down the most daring of the
aggressors. The rage of the soldiers was at its height. The
fire still continued to increase, and a crest of flame and
smoke whirled and spread over the roof of the house.
D'Artagnan could no longer contain himself. "Mordioux!" said
he to Monk, glancing at him sideways: "you are a general,
and allow your men to burn houses and assassinate people,
while you look on and warm your hands at the blaze of the
conflagration? Mordioux! you are not a man."

"Patience, sir, patience!" said Monk, smiling.

"Patience! yes, until that brave gentleman is roasted -- is
that what you mean?" And D'Artagnan rushed forward.

"Remain where you are, sir," said Monk, in a tone of
command. And he advanced towards the house, just as an
officer had approached it, saying to the besieged: "The
house is burning, you will be roasted within an hour! There
is still time -- come, tell us what you know of General
Monk, and we will spare your life. Reply, or by Saint
Patrick ---- "

The besieged made no answer; he was no doubt reloading his
pistol.

"A reinforcement is expected," continued the officer; "in a
quarter of an hour there will be a hundred men around your
house."

"I reply to you," said the Frenchman. "Let your men be sent
away; I will come out freely and repair to the camp alone,
or else I will be killed here!"

"Mille tonnerres!" shouted D'Artagnan; "why that's the voice
of Athos! Ah, canailles!" and the sword of D'Artagnan
flashed from its sheath. Monk stopped him and advanced
himself, exclaiming, in a sonorous voice: "Hola! what is
going on here? Digby, whence this fire? why these cries?"

"The general!" cried Digby, letting the point of his sword
fall.

"The general!" repeated the soldiers.

"Well, what is there so astonishing in that?" said Monk, in
a calm tone. Then, silence being re-established -- "Now,"
said he, "who lit this fire?"

The soldiers hung their heads.

"What! do I ask a question, and nobody answers me?" said
Monk. "What! do I find a fault, and nobody repairs it? The
fire is still burning, I believe."

Immediately the twenty men rushed forward, seizing pails,
buckets, jars, barrels, and extinguishing the fire with as
much ardor as they had, an instant before employed in
promoting it. But already, and before all the rest,
D'Artagnan had applied a ladder to the house crying, "Athos!
it is I, D'Artagnan! Do not kill me my dearest friend!" And
in a moment the count was clasped in his arms.

In the meantime, Grimaud, preserving his calmness,
dismantled the fortification of the ground-floor, and after
having opened the door, stood with his arms folded quietly
on the sill. Only, on hearing the voice of D'Artagnan, he
uttered an exclamation of surprise. The fire being
extinguished, the soldiers presented themselves, Digby at
their head.

"General," said he, "excuse us; what we have done was for
love of your honor, whom we thought lost."

"You are mad, gentlemen. Lost! Is a man like me to be lost?
Am I not permitted to be absent, according to my pleasure,
without giving formal notice? Do you, by chance, take me for
a citizen from the city? Is a gentleman, my friend, my
guest, to be besieged, entrapped, and threatened with death,
because he is suspected? What signifies that word,
suspected? Curse me if I don't have every one of you shot
like dogs that the brave gentleman has left alive!"

"General," said Digby, piteously, "there were twenty-eight
of us, and see, there are eight on the ground."

"I authorize M. le Comte de la Fere to send the twenty to
join the eight," said Monk, stretching out his hand to
Athos. "Let them return to camp. Mr. Digby, you will
consider yourself under arrest for a month."

"General ---- "

"That is to teach you, sir, not to act, another time,
without orders."

"I had those of the lieutenant, general."

"The lieutenant has no such orders to give you, and he shall
be placed under arrest, instead of you, if he has really
commanded you to burn this gentleman."

"He did not command that, general; he commanded us to bring
him to the camp; but the count was not willing to follow
us."

"I was not willing that they should enter and plunder my
house," said Athos to Monk, with a significant look.

"And you were quite right. To the camp, I say." The soldiers
departed with dejected looks. "Now we are alone," said Monk
to Athos, "have the goodness to tell me, monsieur, why you
persisted in remaining here, whilst you had your felucca
---- "

"I waited for you, general," said Athos. "Had not your honor
appointed to meet me in a week?"

An eloquent look from D'Artagnan made it clear to Monk that
these two men, so brave and so loyal, had not acted in
concert for his abduction. He knew already it could not be
so.

"Monsieur," said he to D'Artagnan, "you were perfectly
right. Have the kindness to allow me a moment's conversation
with M. le Comte de la Fere?"

D'Artagnan took advantage of this to go and ask Grimaud how
he was. Monk requested Athos to conduct him to the chamber
he lived in.

This chamber was still full of smoke and rubbish. More than
fifty balls had passed through the windows and mutilated the
walls. They found a table, inkstand, and materials for
writing. Monk took up a pen, wrote a single line, signed it,
folded the paper, sealed the letter with the seal of his
ring, and handed over the missive to Athos, saying,
"Monsieur, carry, if you please, this letter to King Charles
II., and set out immediately, if nothing detains you here
any longer."

"And the casks?" said Athos.

"The fisherman who brought me hither will assist you in
transporting them on board. Depart, if possible, within an
hour."

"Yes, general," said Athos.

"Monsieur d'Artagnan!" cried Monk, from the window.
D'Artagnan ran up precipitately

"Embrace your friend and bid him adieu, sir; he is returning
to Holland."

"To Holland!" cried D'Artagnan; "and I?"

"You are at liberty to follow him, monsieur, but I request
you to remain," said Monk. "Will you refuse me?"

"Oh, no, general; I am at your orders."

D'Artagnan embraced Athos, and only had time to bid him
adieu. Monk watched them both. Then he took upon himself the
preparations for the departure, the transportation of the
casks on board, and the embarking of Athos; then, taking
D'Artagnan by the arm, who was quite amazed and agitated, he
led him towards Newcastle. Whilst going along, the general
leaning on his arm, D'Artagnan could not help murmuring to
himself, -- "Come, come, it seems to me that the shares of
the firm of Planchet and Company are rising."




CHAPTER 31

Monk reveals himself



D'Artagnan, although he flattered himself with better
success, had, nevertheless, not too well comprehended his
situation. It was a strange and grave subject for him to
reflect upon -- this voyage of Athos into England; this
league of the king with Athos, and that extraordinary
combination of his design with that of the Comte de la Fere.
The best way was to let things follow their own train. An
imprudence had been committed, and, whilst having succeeded,
as he had promised, D'Artagnan found that he had gained no
advantage by his success. Since everything was lost, he
could risk no more.

D'Artagnan followed Monk through his camp. The return of the
general had produced a marvelous effect, for his people had
thought him lost. But Monk, with his austere look and icy
demeanor, appeared to ask of his eager lieutenants and
delighted soldiers the cause of all this joy. Therefore, to
the lieutenants who had come to meet him, and who expressed
the uneasiness with which they had learnt his departure, --

"Why is all this?" said he; "am I obliged to give you an
account of myself?"

"But, your honor, the sheep may well tremble without the
shepherd."

"Tremble!" replied Monk, in his calm and powerful voice;
"ah, monsieur, what a word! Curse me, if my sheep have not
both teeth and claws; I renounce being their shepherd. Ah,
you tremble, gentlemen, do you?"

"Yes, general, for you."

"Oh! pray meddle with your own concerns. If I have not the
wit God gave to Oliver Cromwell, I have that which He has
sent to me: I am satisfied with it, however little it may
be."

The officer made no reply; and Monk, having imposed silence
on his people, all remained persuaded that he had
accomplished some important work or made some important
trial. This was forming a very poor conception of his
patience and scrupulous genius. Monk, if he had the good
faith of the Puritans, his allies, must have returned
fervent thanks to the patron saint who had taken him from
the box of M. d'Artagnan. Whilst these things were going on,
our musketeer could not help constantly repeating, --

"God grant that M. Monk may not have as much pride as I
have; for I declare if any one had put me into a coffer with
that grating over my mouth, and carried me packed up, like a
calf, across the seas, I should cherish such a memory of my
piteous looks in that coffer, and such an ugly animosity
against him who had inclosed me in it, I should dread so
greatly to see a sarcastic smile blooming upon the face of
the malicious wretch, or in his attitude any grotesque
imitation of my position in the box, that, Mordioux! I
should plunge a good dagger into his throat in compensation
for the grating, and would nail him down in a veritable
bier, in remembrance of the false coffin in which I had been
left to grow moldy for two days."

And D'Artagnan spoke honestly when he spoke thus; for the
skin of our Gascon was a very thin one. Monk, fortunately,
entertained other ideas. He never opened his mouth to his
timid conqueror concerning the past; but he admitted him
very near to his person in his labors, took him with him to
several reconnoiterings, in such a way as to obtain that
which he evidently warmly desired, -- a rehabilitation in
the mind of D'Artagnan. The latter conducted himself like a
past-master in the art of flattery: he admired all Monk's
tactics, and the ordering of his camp, he joked very
pleasantly upon the circumvallations of Lambert's camp, who
had, he said, very uselessly given himself the trouble to
inclose a camp for twenty thousand men, whilst an acre of
ground would have been quite sufficient for the corporal and
fifty guards who would perhaps remain faithful to him.

Monk, immediately after his arrival, had accepted the
proposition made by Lambert the evening before, for an
interview, and which Monk's lieutenants had refused under
the pretext that the general was indisposed. This interview
was neither long nor interesting: Lambert demanded a
profession of faith from his rival. The latter declared he
had no other opinion than that of the majority. Lambert
asked if it would not be more expedient to terminate the
quarrel by an alliance than by a battle. Monk hereupon
demanded a week for consideration. Now, Lambert could not
refuse this: and Lambert, nevertheless, had come, saying
that he should devour Monk's army. Therefore, at the end of
the interview, which Lambert's party watched with
impatience, nothing was decided -- neither treaty nor battle
-- the rebel army, as M. d'Artagnan had foreseen, began to
prefer the good cause to the bad one, and the parliament,
rumpish as it was, to the pompous nothings of Lambert's
designs.

They remembered, likewise, the good feasts of London ---the
profusion of ale and sherry with which the citizens of
London paid their friends the soldiers; -- they looked with
terror at the black war bread, at the troubled waters of the
Tweed, -- too salt for the glass, not enough so for the pot;
and they said to themselves, "Are not the roast meats kept
warm for Monk in London?" From that time nothing was heard
of but desertion in Lambert's army. The soldiers allowed
themselves to be drawn away by the force of principles,
which are, like discipline, the obligatory tie in everybody
constituted for any purpose. Monk defended the parliament --
Lambert attacked it. Monk had no more inclination to support
parliament than Lambert, but he had it inscribed on his
standards, so that all those of the contrary party were
reduced to write upon theirs "Rebellion," which sounded ill
to puritan ears. They flocked, then, from Lambert to Monk,
as sinners flock from Baal to God.

Monk made his calculations, at a thousand desertions a day
Lambert had men enough to last twenty days; but there is in
sinking things such a growth of weight and swiftness, which
combine with each other, that a hundred left the first day,
five hundred the second, a thousand the third. Monk thought
he had obtained his rate. But from one thousand the
deserters increased to two thousand, then to four thousand,
and, a week after, Lambert, perceiving that he had no longer
the possibility of accepting battle, if it were offered to
him, took the wise resolution of decamping during the night,
returning to London, and being beforehand with Monk in
constructing a power with the wreck of the military party.

But Monk, free and without uneasiness, marched towards
London as a conqueror, augmenting his army with all the
floating parties on his way. He encamped at Barnet, that is
to say, within four leagues of the capital, cherished by the
parliament, which thought it beheld in him a protector, and
awaited by the people, who were anxious to see him reveal
himself, that they might judge him. D'Artagnan himself had
not been able to fathom his tactics; he observed -- he
admired. Monk could not enter London with a settled
determination without bringing about civil war. He
temporized for a short time.

Suddenly, when least expected, Monk drove the military party
out of London, and installed himself in the city amidst the
citizens, by order of the parliament; then, at the moment
when the citizens were crying out against Monk -- at the
moment when the soldiers themselves were accusing their
leader -- Monk, finding himself certain of a majority,
declared to the Rump Parliament that it must abdicate -- be
dissolved -- and yield its place to a government which would
not be a joke. Monk pronounced this declaration, supported
by fifty thousand swords, to which, that same evening, were
united, with shouts of delirious joy, the five hundred
thousand inhabitants of the good city of London. At length,
at the moment when the people, after their triumphs and
festive repasts in the open streets, were looking about for
a master, it was affirmed that a vessel had left the Hague,
bearing Charles II. and his fortunes.

"Gentlemen," said Monk to his officers, "I am going to meet
the legitimate king. He who loves me will follow me." A
burst of acclamations welcomed these words, which D'Artagnan
did not hear without the greatest delight.

"Mordioux!" said he to Monk, "that is bold, monsieur."

"You will accompany me, will you not?" said Monk.

"Pardieu! general. But tell me, I beg, what you wrote by
Athos, that is to say, the Comte de la Fere -- you know --
the day of our arrival?"

"I have no secrets from you now," replied Monk. "I wrote
these words: `Sire, I expect your majesty in six weeks at
Dover.'"

"Ah!" said D'Artagnan, "I no longer say it is bold; I say it
is well played; it is a fine stroke!"

"You are something of a judge in such matters," replied
Monk.

And this was the only time the general had ever made an
allusion to his voyage to Holland.




CHAPTER 32

Athos and D'Artagnan meet once more at the Hostelry of the Corne du Cerf



The king of England made his entree into Dover with great
pomp, as he afterwards did in London. He had sent for his
brothers; he had brought over his mother and sister. England
had been for so long a time given up to herself -- that is
to say, to tyranny, mediocrity, and nonsense -- that this
return of Charles II., whom the English only knew as the son
of the man whose head they had cut off, was a festival for
the three kingdoms. Consequently, all the good wishes, all
the acclamations which accompanied his return, struck the
young king so forcibly that he stooped and whispered in the
ear of James of York, his younger brother, "In truth, James,
it seems to have been our own fault that we were so long
absent from a country where we are so much beloved!" The
pageant was magnificent. Beautiful weather favored the
solemnity. Charles had regained all his youth, all his good
humor; he appeared to be transfigured; hearts seemed to
smile on him like the sun. Amongst this noisy crowd of
courtiers and worshippers, who did not appear to remember
they had conducted to the scaffold at Whitehall the father
of the new king, a man, in the garb of a lieutenant of
musketeers, looked, with a smile upon his thin, intellectual
lips, sometimes at the people vociferating their blessings,
and sometimes at the prince, who pretended emotion, and who
bowed most particularly to the women, whose bouquets fell
beneath his horse's feet.

"What a fine trade is that of king!" said this man, so
completely absorbed in contemplation that he stopped in the
middle of his road, leaving the cortege to file past. "Now,
there is, in good truth, a prince all bespangled over with
gold and diamonds, enamelled with flowers like a spring
meadow; he is about to plunge his empty hands into the
immense coffer in which his now faithful -- but so lately
unfaithful -- subjects have amassed one or two cartloads of
ingots of gold. They cast bouquets enough upon him to
smother him; and yet, if he had presented himself to them
two months ago, they would have sent as many bullets and
balls at him as they now throw flowers. Decidedly it is
worth something to be born in a certain sphere, with due
respect to the lowly, who pretend that it is of very little
advantage to them to be born lowly." The cortege continued
to file on, and, with the king, the acclamations began to
die away in the direction of the palace which, however, did
not prevent our officer from being pushed about.

"Mordioux!" continued the reasoner, "these people tread upon
my toes and look upon me as of very little consequence, or
rather of none at all, seeing that they are Englishmen and I
am a Frenchman. If all these people were asked, -- `Who is
M. d'Artagnan?' they would reply, `Nescio vos.' But let any
one say to them, `There is the king going by,' `There is M.
Monk going by,' they would run away, shouting, -- `Vive le
roi!' `Vive M. Monk!' till their lungs were exhausted. And
yet," continued he, surveying, with that look sometimes so
keen and sometimes so proud, the diminishing crowd, -- "and
yet, reflect a little, my good people, on what your king has
done, on what M. Monk has done, and then think what has been
done by this poor unknown, who is called M. d'Artagnan! It
is true you do not know him, since he is here unknown, and
that prevents your thinking about the matter! But, bah! what
matters it! All that does not prevent Charles II. from being
a great king, although he has been exiled twelve years, or
M. Monk from being a great captain, although he did make a
voyage to Holland in a box. Well, then, since it is admitted
that one is a great king and the other a great captain, --
`Hurrah for King Charles II.! -- Hurrah for General Monk!'"
And his voice mingled with the voices of the hundreds of
spectators, over which it sounded for a moment. Then, the
better to play the devoted man, he took off his hat and
waved it in the air. Some one seized his arm in the very
height of his expansive royalism. (In 1660 that was so
termed which we now call royalism.)

"Athos!" cried D'Artagnan, "you here!" And the two friends
seized each other's hands.

"You here! -- and being here," continued the musketeer, "you
are not in the midst of all these courtiers my dear comte!
What! you, the hero of the fete, you are not prancing on the
left hand of the king, as M. Monk is prancing on the right?
In truth, I cannot comprehend your character, nor that of
the prince who owes you so much!"

"Always scornful, my dear D'Artagnan!" said Athos. "Will you
never correct yourself of that vile habit?"

"But, you do not form part of the pageant?"

"I do not, because I was not willing to do so."

"And why were you not willing?"

"Because I am neither envoy nor ambassador, nor
representative of the king of France; and it does not become
me to exhibit myself thus near the person of another king
than the one God has given me for a master."

"Mordioux! you came very near to the person of the king, his
father."

"That was another thing, my friend; he was about to die."

"And yet that which you did for him ---- "

"I did it because it was my duty to do it. But you know I
hate all ostentation. Let King Charles II., then, who no
longer stands in need of me, leave me to my rest, and in the
shadow; that is all I claim of him."

D'Artagnan sighed.

"What is the matter with you?" said Athos. "One would say
that this happy return of the king to London saddens you, my
friend; you who have done at least as much for his majesty
as I have."

"Have I not," replied D'Artagnan, with his Gascon laugh,
"have I not done much for his majesty, without any one
suspecting it?"

"Yes, yes, but the king is well aware of it my friend,"
cried Athos.

"He is aware of it!" said the musketeer bitterly. "By my
faith! I did not suspect so, and I was even a moment ago
trying to forget it myself."

"But he, my friend, will not forget it, I will answer for
him."

"You tell me that to console me a little, Athos."

"For what?"

"Mordioux! for all the expense I incurred. I have ruined
myself, my friend, ruined myself for the restoration of this
young prince who has just passed, cantering on his isabelle
colored horse."

"The king does not know you have ruined yourself, my friend,
but he knows he owes you much."

"And say, Athos, does that advance me in any respect? for,
to do you justice, you have labored nobly. But I -- I, who
in appearance marred your combinations, it was I who really
made them succeed. Follow my calculations; closely, you
might not have, by persuasions or mildness convinced General
Monk, whilst I so roughly treated this dear general, that I
furnished your prince with an opportunity of showing himself
generous: this generosity was inspired in him by the fact of
my fortunate mistake, and Charles is paid by the restoration
which Monk has brought about."

"All that, my dear friend, is strikingly true," replied
Athos.

"Well, strikingly true as it may be, it is not less true, my
friend, that I shall return -- greatly beloved by M. Monk,
who calls me dear captain all day long, although I am
neither dear to him nor a captain; -- and much appreciated
by the king, who has already forgotten my name; -- it is not
less true, I say, that I shall return to my beautiful
country, cursed by the soldiers I had raised with the hopes
of large pay, cursed by the brave Planchet, of whom I
borrowed a part of his fortune."

"How is that? What the devil had Planchet to do in all
this?"

"Ah, yes, my friend, but this king, so spruce, so smiling,
so adored, M. Monk fancies he has recalled him, you fancy
you have supported him, I fancy I have brought him back, the
people fancy they have reconquered him, he himself fancies
he has negotiated his restoration; and yet nothing of all
this is true, for Charles II., king of England, Scotland,
and Ireland, has been replaced upon the throne by a French
grocer, who lives in the Rue des Lombards, and is named
Planchet. And such is grandeur! `Vanity!' says the
Scripture: `vanity, all is vanity.'"

Athos could not help laughing at this whimsical outbreak of
his friend.

"My dear D'Artagnan," said he, pressing his hand
affectionately, "should you not exercise a little more
philosophy? Is it not some further satisfaction to you to
have saved my life as you did by arriving so fortunately
with Monk, when those damned parliamentarians wanted to burn
me alive?"

"Well, but you, in some degree, deserved a little burning,
my friend."

"How so? What, for having saved King Charles's million?"

"What million?"

"Ah, that is true! you never knew that, my friend; but you
must not be angry, for it was not my secret. That word
`Remember' which the king pronounced upon the scaffold."

"And which means `souviens-toi!'"

"Exactly. That was signified. `Remember there is a million
buried in the vaults of Newcastle Abbey, and that that
million belongs to my son.'"

"Ah! very well, I understand. But what I understand
likewise, and what is very frightful, is, that every time
his majesty Charles II. will think of me, he will say to
himself: `There is the man who came very near making me lose
my crown. Fortunately I was generous, great, full of
presence of mind.' That will be said by the young gentleman
in a shabby black doublet, who came to the chateau of Blois,
hat in hand, to ask me if I would give him access to the
king of France."

"D'Artagnan! D'Artagnan!" said Athos, laying his hand on the
shoulder of the musketeer, "you are unjust."

"I have a right to be so."

"No -- for you are ignorant of the future."

D'Artagnan looked his friend full in the face, and began to
laugh. "In truth, my dear Athos," said he, "you have some
sayings so superb, that they only belong to you and M. le
Cardinal Mazarin."

Athos frowned slightly.

"I beg your pardon," continued D'Artagnan, laughing, "I beg
your pardon, if I have offended you. The future! Nein! what
pretty words are words that promise, and how well they fill
the mouth in default of other things! Mordioux! After having
met with so many who promised, when shall I find one who
will give? But, let that pass!" continued D'Artagnan. "What
are you doing here, my dear Athos? Are you the king's
treasurer?"

"How -- why the king's treasurer?"

"Well, since the king possesses a million, he must want a
treasurer. The king of France, although he is not worth a
sou, has still a superintendent of finance, M. Fouquet. It
is true that, in exchange, M. Fouquet, they say, has a good
number of millions of his own."

"Oh! our million was spent long ago," said Athos, laughing
in his turn.

"I understand, it was frittered away in satin, precious
stones, velvet, and feathers of all sorts and colors. All
these princes and princesses stood in great need of tailors
and dressmakers. Eh! Athos, do you remember what we fellows
spent in equipping ourselves for the campaign of La
Rochelle, and to make our appearance on horseback? Two or
three thousand livres, by my faith! But a king's robe is
more ample; it would require a million to purchase the
stuff. At least, Athos, if you are not treasurer, you are on
a good footing at court."

"By the faith of a gentleman, I know nothing about it," said
Athos, simply.

"What! you know nothing about it?"

"No! I have not seen the king since we left Dover."

"Then he has forgotten you, too! Mordioux! That is
shameful!"

"His majesty has had so much business to transact."

"Oh!" cried D'Artagnan, with one of those intelligent
grimaces which he alone knew how to make, "that is enough to
make me recover my love for Monseigneur Giulio Mazarini.
What, Athos the king has not seen you since then?"

"No."

"And you are not furious?"

"I! Why should I be? Do you imagine, my dear D'Artagnan,
that it was on the king's account I acted as I have done? I
did not know the young man. I defended the father, who
represented a principle -- sacred in my eyes, and I allowed
myself to be drawn towards the son from sympathy for this
same principle. Besides, he was a worthy knight, a noble
creature, that father: do you remember him?"

"Yes; that is true; he was a brave, an excellent man, who
led a sad life, but made a fine end."

"Well, my dear D'Artagnan, understand this; to that king, to
that man of heart, to that friend of my thoughts, if I durst
venture to say so, I swore at the last hour to preserve
faithfully the secret of a deposit which was to be
transmitted to his son, to assist him in his hour of need.
This young man came to me; he described his destitution; he
was ignorant that he was anything to me save a living memory
of his father. I have accomplished towards Charles II. what
I promised Charles I.; that is all! Of what consequence is
it to me, then, whether he be grateful or not? It is to
myself I have rendered a service, by relieving myself of
this responsibility, and not to him."

"Well, I have always said," replied D'Artagnan, with a sigh,
"that disinterestedness was the finest thing in the world."

"Well, and you, my friend," resumed Athos, "are you not in
the same situation as myself? If I have properly understood
your words, you allowed yourself to be affected by the
misfortunes of this young man; that, on your part, was much
greater than it was upon mine, for I had a duty to fulfill,
whilst you were under no obligation to the son of the
martyr. You had not, on your part, to pay him the price of
that precious drop of blood which he let fall upon my brow,
through the floor of his scaffold. That which made you act
was heart alone -- the noble and good heart which you
possess beneath your apparent skepticism and sarcastic
irony; you have engaged the fortune of a servitor, and your
own, I suspect, my benevolent miser! and your sacrifice is
not acknowledged! Of what consequence is it? You wish to
repay Planchet his money. I can comprehend that, my friend:
for it is not becoming in a gentleman to borrow from his
inferior, without returning to him principal and interest.
Well, I will sell La Fere if necessary, and if not, some
little farm. You shall pay Planchet, and there will be
enough, believe me, of corn left in my granaries for us two
and Raoul. In this way, my friend, you will be under
obligations to nobody but yourself, and, if I know you well,
it will not be a small satisfaction to your mind to be able
to say, `I have made a king!' Am I right?"

"Athos! Athos!" murmured D'Artagnan, thoughtfully, "I have
told you more than once that the day on which you will
preach I shall attend the sermon; the day on which you will
tell me there is a hell -- Mordioux! I shall be afraid of
the gridiron and the pitchforks. You are better than I, or
rather, better than anybody, and I only acknowledge the
possession of one quality, and that is, of not being
jealous. Except that defect, damme, as the English say, if I
have not all the rest."

"I know no one equal to D'Artagnan," replied Athos; "but
here we are, having quietly reached the house I inhabit.
Will you come in, my friend?"

"Eh! why, this is the tavern of the Corne du Cerf, I think,"
said D'Artagnan.

"I confess I chose it on purpose. I like old acquaintances;
I like to sit down on that place, whereon I sank, overcome
by fatigue, overwhelmed with despair, when you returned on
the 31st of January."

"After having discovered the abode of the masked
executioner? Yes, that was a terrible day!"

"Come in, then," said Athos, interrupting him.

They entered the large apartment, formerly the common one.
The tavern, in general, and this room in particular, had
undergone great changes; the ancient host of the musketeers,
having become tolerably rich for an innkeeper, had closed
his shop, and made of this room of which we were speaking, a
store-room for colonial provisions. As for the rest of the
house, he let it ready furnished to strangers. It was with
unspeakable emotion D'Artagnan recognized all the furniture
of the chamber of the first story; the wainscoting, the
tapestries, and even that geographical chart which Porthos
had so fondly studied in his moments of leisure.

"It is eleven years ago," cried D'Artagnan. "Mordioux! it
appears to me a century!"

"And to me but a day," said Athos. "Imagine the joy I
experience, my friend, in seeing you there, in pressing your
hand, in casting from me sword and dagger, and tasting
without mistrust this glass of sherry. And, oh! what still
further joy it would be, if our two friends were there, at
the two corners of the tables, and Raoul, my beloved Raoul,
on the threshold, looking at us with his large eyes, at once
so brilliant and so soft!"

"Yes, yes," said D'Artagnan, much affected, "that is true. I
approve particularly of the first part of your thought; it
is very pleasant to smile there where we have so
legitimately shuddered in thinking that from one moment to
another M. Mordaunt might appear upon the landing."

At this moment the door opened, and D'Artagnan, brave as he
was, could not restrain a slight movement of fright. Athos
understood him, and, smiling, --

"It is our host," said he, "bringing me a letter."

"Yes, my lord," said the good man; "here is a letter for
your honor."

"Thank you," said Athos, taking the letter without looking
at it. "Tell me, my dear host, if you do not remember this
gentleman?"

The old man raised his head, and looked attentively at
D'Artagnan.

"No," said he.

"It is," said Athos, "one of those friends of whom I have
spoken to you, and who lodged here with me eleven years
ago."

"Oh! but," said the old man, "so many strangers have lodged
here!"

"But we lodged here on the 30th of January, 1649," added
Athos, believing he should stimulate the lazy memory of the
host by this remark.

"That is very possible," replied he, smiling; "but it is so
long ago!" and he bowed, and went out.

"Thank you," said D'Artagnan -- "perform exploits,
accomplish revolutions, endeavor to engrave your name in
stone or bronze with strong swords! there is something more
rebellious, more hard, more forgetful than iron, bronze, or
stone, and that is, the brain of a lodging-house keeper who
has grown rich in the trade, -- he does not know me! Well, I
should have known him, though."

Athos, smiling at his friend's philosophy, unsealed his
letter.

"Ah!" said he, "a letter from Parry."

"Oh! oh!" said D'Artagnan; "read it, my friend, read it! No
doubt it contains news."

Athos shook his head, and read:



Monsieur le Comte. -- The king has experienced much regret
at not seeing you to-day beside him, at his entrance. His
majesty commands me to say so, and to recall him to your
memory. His majesty will expect you this evening, at the
palace of St. James, between nine and ten o'clock.

"I am, respectfully, monsieur le comte, your honor's very
humble and very obedient servant, -- Parry."



"You see, my dear D'Artagnan," said Athos, "we must not
despair of the hearts of kings."

"Not despair! you are right to say so!" replied D'Artagnan.

"Oh! my dear, very dear friend," resumed Athos, whom the
almost imperceptible bitterness of D'Artagnan had not
escaped. "Pardon me! can I have unintentionally wounded my
best comrade?"

"You are mad, Athos, and to prove it, I shall conduct you to
the palace; to the very gate, I mean; the walk will do me
good."

"You shall go in with me, my friend; I will speak to his
majesty."

"No, no!" replied D'Artagnan, with true pride, free from all
mixture; "if there is anything worse than begging yourself,
it is making others beg for you. Come, let us go, my friend,
the walk will be charming; on the way I shall show you the
house of M. Monk, who has detained me with him. A beautiful
house, by my faith. Being a general in England is better
than being a marechal in France, please to know."

Athos allowed himself to be led along, quite saddened by
D'Artagnan's forced attempts at gayety. The whole city was
in a state of joy; the two friends were jostled at every
moment by enthusiasts who required them, in their
intoxication, to cry out, "Long live good King Charles!"
D'Artagnan replied by a grunt, and Athos by a smile. They
arrived thus in front of Monk's house, before which, as we
have said, they had to pass on their way to St. James's.

Athos and D'Artagnan said but little on the road, for the
simple reason that they would have had so many things to
talk about if they had spoken. Athos thought that by
speaking he should evince satisfaction, and that might wound
D'Artagnan. The latter feared that in speaking he should
allow some little bitterness to steal into his words which
would render his company unpleasant to his friend. It was a
singular emulation of silence between contentment and
ill-humor. D'Artagnan gave way first to that itching at the
tip of his tongue which he so habitually experienced.

"Do you remember, Athos," said he, "the passage of the
`Memoires de D'Aubigny,' in which that devoted servant, a
Gascon like myself, poor as myself, and, I was going to add,
brave as myself, relates instances of the meanness of Henry
IV.? My father always told me, I remember, that D'Aubigny
was a liar. But, nevertheless, examine how all the princes,
the issue of the great Henry, keep up the character of the
race."

"Nonsense!" said Athos, "the kings of France misers? You are
mad, my friend."

"Oh! you are so perfect yourself, you never agree to the
faults of others. But, in reality, Henry IV. was covetous,
Louis XIII., his son, was so likewise; we know something of
that, don't we? Gaston carried this vice to exaggeration,
and has made himself, in this respect, hated by all who
surround him. Henriette, poor woman, might well be
avaricious, she who did not eat every day, and could not
warm herself every winter; and that is an example she has
given to her son Charles II., grandson of the great Henry
IV., who is as covetous as his mother and his grandfather.
See if I have well traced the genealogy of the misers?"

"D'Artagnan, my friend," cried Athos, "you are very rude
towards that eagle race called the Bourbons."

"Eh! and I have forgotten the best instance of all -- the
other grandson of the Bearnais, Louis XIV., my ex-master.
Well, I hope he is miserly enough, he who would not lend a
million to his brother Charles! Good! I see you are
beginning to be angry. Here we are, by good luck, close to
my house, or rather to that of my friend, M. Monk."

"My dear D'Artagnan, you do not make me angry, you make me
sad; it is cruel, in fact, to see a man of your deserts out
of the position his services ought to have acquired; it
appears to me, my dear friend, that your name is as radiant
as the greatest names in war and diplomacy. Tell me if the
Luynes, the Ballegardes, and the Bassompierres have merited,
as we have, fortunes and honors? You are right, my friend, a
hundred times right."

D'Artagnan sighed, and preceded his friend under the porch
of the mansion Monk inhabited, at the extremity of the city.
"Permit me," said he, "to leave my purse at home; for if in
the crowd those clever pickpockets of London, who are much
boasted of, even in Paris, were to steal from me the
remainder of my poor crowns, I should not be able to return
to France. Now, content I left France, and wild with joy I
should return to it, seeing that all my prejudices of former
days against England have returned, accompanied by many
others."

Athos made no reply.

"So then, my dear friend, one second, and I will follow
you," said D'Artagnan. "I know you are in a hurry to go
yonder to receive your reward, but, believe me, I am not
less eager to partake of your joy, although from a distance.
Wait for me." And D'Artagnan was already passing through the
vestibule, when a man, half servant, half soldier, who
filled in Monk's establishment the double functions of
porter and guard, stopped our musketeer, saying to him in
English:

"I beg your pardon, my Lord d'Artagnan!"

"Well," replied the latter: "what is it? Is the general
going to dismiss me? I only needed to be expelled by him."

These words, spoken in French, made no impression upon the
person to whom they were addressed and who himself only
spoke an English mixed with the rudest Scotch. But Athos was
grieved at them, for he began to think D'Artagnan was not
wrong.

The Englishman showed D'Artagnan a letter: "From the
general," said he.

"Aye! that's it, my dismissal!" replied the Gascon. "Must I
read it, Athos?"

"You must be deceived," said Athos, "or I know no more
honest people in the world but you and myself."

D'Artagnan shrugged his shoulders and unsealed the letter,
while the impassible Englishman held for him a large
lantern, by the light of which he was enabled to read it.

"Well, what is the matter?" said Athos, seeing the
countenance of the reader change.

"Read it yourself," said the musketeer.

Athos took the paper and read:



Monsieur d'Artagnan. -- The king regrets very much you did
not come to St. Paul's with his cortege. He missed you, as I
also have missed you, my dear captain. There is but one
means of repairing all this. His majesty expects me at nine
o'clock at the palace of St. James's: will you be there at
the same time with me? His gracious majesty appoints that
hour for an audience he grants you."



This letter was from Monk.




CHAPTER 33

The Audience.



"Well?" cried Athos with a mild look of reproach when
D'Artagnan had read the letter addressed to him by Monk.

"Well!" said D'Artagnan, red with pleasure, and a little
with shame, at having so hastily accused the king and Monk.
"This is a politeness, -- which leads to nothing, it is
true, but yet it is a politeness."

"I had great difficulty in believing the young prince
ungrateful," said Athos.

"The fact is, that his present is still too near his past,"
replied D'Artagnan; "after all, everything to the present
moment proved me right."

"I acknowledge it, my dear friend, I acknowledge it. Ah!
there is your cheerful look returned. You cannot think how
delighted I am."

"Thus you see," said D'Artagnan, "Charles II. receives M.
Monk at nine o'clock; he will receive me at ten; it is a
grand audience, of the sort which at the Louvre are called
`distributions of court holy water.' Come, let us go and
place ourselves under the spout, my dear friend! Come
along."

Athos replied nothing; and both directed their steps, at a
quick pace, towards the palace of St. James's, which the
crowd still surrounded, to catch, through the windows, the
shadows of the courtiers, and the reflection of the royal
person. Eight o'clock was striking when the two friends took
their places in the gallery filled with courtiers and
politicians. Every one looked at these simply-dressed men in
foreign costumes, at these two noble heads so full of
character and meaning. On their side, Athos and D'Artagnan,
having with two glances taken the measure of the whole
assembly, resumed their chat.

A great noise was suddenly heard at the extremity of the
gallery, -- it was General Monk, who entered, followed by
more than twenty officers, all eager for a smile, as only
the evening before he was master of all England, and a
glorious morrow was looked to, for the restorer of the
Stuart family.

"Gentlemen," said Monk, turning round, "henceforward I beg
you to remember that I am no longer anything. Lately I
commanded the principal army of the republic; now that army
is the king's, into whose hands I am about to surrender, at
his command, my power of yesterday."

Great surprise was painted on all the countenances, and the
circle of adulators and suppliants which surrounded Monk an
instant before, was enlarged by degrees, and ended by being
lost in the large undulations of the crowd. Monk was going
into the ante-chamber as others did. D'Artagnan could not
help remarking this to the Comte de la Fere, who frowned on
beholding it. Suddenly the door of the royal apartment
opened, and the young king appeared, preceded by two
officers of his household.

"Good evening, gentlemen," said he. "Is General Monk here?"

"I am here, sire," replied the old general.

Charles stepped hastily towards him, and seized his hand
with the warmest demonstration of friendship. "General,"
said the king, aloud, "I have just signed your patent, --
you are Duke of Albemarle; and my intention is that no one
shall equal you in power and fortune in this kingdom, where
-- the noble Montrose excepted -- no one has equaled you in
loyalty, courage, and talent. Gentlemen, the duke is
commander of our armies of land and sea; pay him your
respects, if you please, in that character."

Whilst every one was pressing round the general, who
received all this homage without losing his impassibility
for an instant, D'Artagnan said to Athos: "When one thinks
that this duchy, this commander of the land and sea forces,
all these grandeurs, in a word, have been shut up in a box
six feet long and three feet wide ---- "

"My friend," replied Athos, "much more imposing grandeurs
are confined in boxes still smaller, -- and remain there
forever."

All at once Monk perceived the two gentlemen, who held
themselves aside until the crowd had diminished; he made
himself a passage towards them, so that he surprised them in
the midst of their philosophical reflections. "Were you
speaking of me?" said he, with a smile.

"My lord," replied Athos, "we were speaking likewise of
God."

Monk reflected for a moment, and then replied gayly:
"Gentlemen, let us speak a little of the king likewise, if
you please; for you have, I believe, an audience of his
majesty."

"At nine o'clock," said Athos.

"At ten o'clock," said D'Artagnan.

"Let us go into this closet at once," replied Monk, making a
sign to his two companions to precede him; but to that
neither would consent.

The king, during this discussion so characteristic of the
French, had returned to the center of the gallery.

"Oh! my Frenchmen!" said he, in that tone of careless gayety
which, in spite of so much grief and so many crosses, he had
never lost. "My Frenchmen! my consolation!" Athos and
D'Artagnan bowed.

"Duke, conduct these gentlemen into my study. I am at your
service, messieurs," added he in French. And he promptly
expedited his court, to return to his Frenchmen, as he
called them. "Monsieur d'Artagnan," said he, as he entered
his closet, "I am glad to see you again."

"Sire, my joy is at its height, at having the honor to
salute your majesty in your own palace of St. James's."

"Monsieur, you have been willing to render me a great
service, and I owe you my gratitude for it. If I did not
fear to intrude upon the rights of our commanding general, I
would offer you some post worthy of you near our person."

"Sire," replied D'Artagnan, "I have quitted the service of
the king of France, making a promise to my prince not to
serve any other king."

"Humph!" said Charles, "I am sorry to hear that; I should
like to do much for you; I like you very much."

"Sire ---- "

"But let us see," said Charles with a smile, "if we cannot
make you break your word. Duke, assist me. If you were
offered, that is to say, if I offered you the chief command
of my musketeers?" D'Artagnan bowed lower than before.

"I should have the regret to refuse what your gracious
majesty would offer me," said he; "a gentleman has but his
word, and that word, as I have had the honor to tell your
majesty, is engaged to the king of France."

"We shall say no more about it, then," said the king,
turning towards Athos, and leaving D'Artagnan plunged in the
deepest pangs of disappointment.

"Ah! I said so!" muttered the musketeer. "Words! words!
Court holy water! Kings have always a marvellous talent for
offering us that which they know we will not accept, and in
appearing generous without risk. So be it! -- triple fool
that I was to have hoped for a moment!"

During this time Charles took the hand of Athos. "Comte,"
said he, "you have been to me a second father; the services
you have rendered me are above all price. I have,
nevertheless, thought of a recompense. You were created by
my father a Knight of the Garter ---that is an order which
all the kings of Europe cannot bear; by the queen regent,
Knight of the Holy Ghost -- which is an order not less
illustrious; I join to it that of the Golden Fleece sent me
by the king of France, to whom the king of Spain, his
father-in-law, gave two on the occasion of his marriage; but
in return, I have a service to ask of you."

"Sire," said Athos. with confusion, "the Golden Fleece for
me! when the king of France is the only person in my country
who enjoys that distinction?"

I wish you to be in your country and all others the equal of
all those whom sovereigns have honored with their favor,"
said Charles, drawing the chain from his neck; "and I am
sure, comte, my father smiles on me from his grave."

"It is unaccountably strange," said D'Artagnan to himself,
whilst his friend, on his knees, received the eminent order
which the king conferred on him -- "it is almost incredible
that I have always seen showers of prosperity fall upon all
who surrounded me, and that not a drop ever reached me! If I
were a jealous man it would be enough to make one tear one's
hair, parole d'honneur!"

Athos rose from his knees, and Charles embraced him
tenderly. "General!" said he to Monk -- then stopping with a
smile, "pardon me, duke, I mean. No wonder if I make a
mistake; the word duke is too short for me, I always seek
some title to lengthen it. I should wish to see you so near
my throne, that I might say to you as to Louis XIV., my
brother! Oh! I have it, and you will be almost my brother,
for I make you viceroy of Ireland and of Scotland. my dear
duke. So, after that fashion, henceforward I shall not make
a mistake."

The duke seized the hand of the king, but without
enthusiasm, without joy, as he did everything. His heart,
however, had been moved by this last favor. Charles, by
skillfully husbanding his generosity, had given the duke
time to wish, although he might not have wished for so much
as was given him.

"Mordioux!" grumbled D'Artagnan, "there is the shower
beginning again! Oh! it is enough to turn one's brain!" and
he turned away with an air so sorrowful and so comically
piteous, that the king, who caught it, could not restrain a
smile. Monk was preparing to leave the room, to take leave
of Charles.

"What! my trusty and well-beloved!" said the king to the
duke, "are you going?"

"With your majesty's permission, for in truth I am weary.
The emotions of the day have worn me out; I stand in need of
rest."

"But," said the king, "you are not going without M.
d'Artagnan, I hope."

"Why not, sire?" said the old warrior.

"Well! you know very well why," said the king.

Monk looked at Charles with astonishment.

"Oh! it may be possible; but if you forget, you, M.
d'Artagnan, do not."

Astonishment was painted on the face of the musketeer.

"Well, then, duke," said the king, "do you not lodge with M.
d'Artagnan?"

"I had the honor of offering M. d'Artagnan a lodging; yes,
sire."

"That idea is your own, and yours solely?"

"Mine and mine only; yes, sire."

"Well! but it could not be otherwise -- the prisoner always
lodges with his conqueror."

Monk colored in his turn. "Ah! that is true," said he, "I am
M. d'Artagnan's prisoner."

"Without doubt, duke, since you are not yet ransomed, but
have no care of that; it was I who took you out of M.
d'Artagnan's hands, and it is I who will pay your ransom."

The eyes of D'Artagnan regained their gayety and their
brilliancy. The Gascon began to understand. Charles advanced
towards him.

"The general," said he, "is not rich, and cannot pay you
what he is worth. I am richer, certainly, but now that he is
a duke, and if not a king, almost a king, he is worth a sum
I could not perhaps pay. Come, M. d'Artagnan, be moderate
with me; how much do I owe you?"

D'Artagnan, delighted at the turn things were taking, but
not for a moment losing his self-possession, replied, --
"Sire, your majesty has no occasion to be alarmed. When I
had the good fortune to take his grace, M. Monk was only a
general; it is therefore only a general's ransom that is due
to me. But if the general will have the kindness to deliver
me his sword, I shall consider myself paid; for there is
nothing in the world but the general's sword which is worth
so much as himself."

"Odds fish! as my father said," cried Charles. "That is a
gallant proposal, and a gallant man, is he not, duke?"

"Upon my honor, yes, sire," and he drew his sword.
"Monsieur," said he to D'Artagnan, "here is what you demand.
Many may have handled a better blade; but however modest
mine may be, I have never surrendered it to any one."

D'Artagnan received with pride the sword which had just made
a king.

"Oh! oh!" cried Charles II.; "what, a sword that has
restored me to my throne -- to go out of the kingdom -- and
not, one day, to figure among the crown jewels. No, on my
soul! that shall not be! Captain d'Artagnan, I will give you
two hundred thousand crowns for your sword! If that is too
little, say so."

"It is too little, sire," replied D'Artagnan, with
inimitable seriousness. "In the first place, I do not at all
wish to sell it; but your majesty desires me to do so, and
that is an order. I obey, then, but the respect I owe to the
illustrious warrior who hears me commands me to estimate at
a third more the reward of my victory. I ask then three
hundred thousand crowns for the sword, or I shall give it to
your majesty for nothing." And taking it by the point he
presented it to the king. Charles broke into hilarious
laughter.

"A gallant man, and a merry companion! Odds fish! is he not,
duke? is he not, comte? He pleases me! I like him! Here,
Chevalier d'Artagnan, take this." And going to the table, he
took a pen and wrote an order upon his treasurer for three
hundred thousand crowns.

D'Artagnan took it, and turning gravely towards Monk: "I
have still asked too little, I know," said he, "but believe
me, your grace, I would rather have died than allow myself
to be governed by avarice."

The king began to laugh again, like the happiest cockney of
his kingdom.

"You will come and see me again before you go, chevalier?"
said he; "I shall want to lay in a stock of gayety now my
Frenchmen are leaving me."

"Ah! sire, it will not be with the gayety as with the duke's
sword; I will give it to your majesty gratis," replied
D'Artagnan, whose feet scarcely seemed to touch the ground.

"And you, comte," added Charles, turning towards Athos,
"come again, also, I have an important message to confide to
you. Your hand, duke." Monk pressed the hand of the king.

"Adieu! gentlemen," said Charles, holding out each of his
hands to the two Frenchmen, who carried them to their lips.

"Well," said Athos, when they were out of the palace, "are
you satisfied?"

"Hush!" said D'Artagnan, wild with joy, "I have not yet
returned from the treasurer's -- a shutter may fall upon my
head."




CHAPTER 34

Of the Embarrassment of Riches



D'Artagnan lost no time, and as soon as the thing was
suitable and opportune, he paid a visit to the lord
treasurer of his majesty. He had then the satisfaction to
exchange a piece of paper, covered with very ugly writing,
for a prodigious number of crowns, recently stamped with the
effigies of his very gracious majesty Charles II.

D'Artagnan easily controlled himself: and yet, on this
occasion, he could not help evincing a joy which the reader
will perhaps comprehend, if he deigns to have some
indulgence for a man who, since his birth, had never seen so
many pieces and rolls of pieces juxtaplaced in an order
truly agreeable to the eye. The treasurer placed all the
rolls in bags, and closed each bag with a stamp sealed with
the arms of England, a favor which treasurers do not grant
to everybody. Then impassible, and just as polite as he
ought to be towards a man honored with the friendship of the
king, he said to D'Artagnan:

"Take away your money, sir." Your money! These words made a
thousand chords vibrate in the heart of D'Artagnan, which he
had never felt before. He had the bags packed in a small
cart, and returned home meditating deeply. A man who
possesses three hundred thousand crowns can no longer expect
to wear a smooth brow; a wrinkle for every hundred thousand
livres is not too much.

D'Artagnan shut himself up, ate no dinner, closed his door
to everybody, and, with a lighted lamp, and a loaded pistol
on the table, he watched all night, ruminating upon the
means of preventing these lovely crowns, which from the
coffers of the king had passed into his coffers, from
passing from his coffers into the pockets of any thief
whatever. The best means discovered by the Gascon was to
inclose his treasure, for the present, under locks so solid
that no wrist could break them, and so complicated that no
master-key could open them. D'Artagnan remembered that the
English are masters in mechanics and conservative industry;
and he determined to go in the morning in search of a
mechanic who would sell him a strong box. He did not go far;
Master Will Jobson, dwelling in Piccadilly, listened to his
propositions, comprehended his wishes, and promised to make
him a safety lock that should relieve him from all future
fear.

"I will give you," said he, "a piece of mechanism entirely
new. At the first serious attempt upon your lock, an
invisible plate will open of itself and vomit forth a pretty
copper bullet of the weight of a mark -- which will knock
down the intruder, and not without a loud report. What do
you think of it?"

"I think it very ingenious," cried D'Artagnan, "the little
copper bullet pleases me mightily. So now, sir mechanic, the
terms?"

"A fortnight for the execution, and fifteen hundred crowns
payable on delivery," replied the artisan.

D'Artagnan's brow darkened. A fortnight was delay enough to
allow the thieves of London time to remove all occasion for
the strong box. As to the fifteen hundred crowns -- that
would be paying too dear for what a little vigilance would
procure him for nothing.

"I will think of it," said he, "thank you, sir." And he
returned home at full speed; nobody had yet touched his
treasure. That same day Athos paid a visit to his friend and
found him so thoughtful that he could not help expressing
his surprise.

"How is this?" said he, "you are rich and not gay -- you,
who were so anxious for wealth!"

"My friend, the pleasures to which we are not accustomed
oppress us more than the griefs with which we are familiar.
Give me your opinion, if you please. I can ask you, who have
always had money: when we have money, what do we do with
it?"

"That depends."

"What have you done with yours, seeing that it has not made
you a miser or a prodigal? For avarice dries up the heart,
and prodigality drowns it -- is not that so?"

"Fabricius could not have spoken more justly. But in truth,
my money has never been a burden to me."

"How so? Do you place it out at interest?"

"No; you know I have a tolerably handsome house; and that
house composes the better part of my property."

"I know it does."

"So that you can be as rich as I am, and, indeed more rich,
whenever you like, by the same means."

"But your rents, -- do you lay them by?"

"What do you think of a chest concealed in a wall?"

"I never made use of such a thing."

"Then you must have some confidant, some safe man of
business who pays you interest at a fair rate."

"Not at all."

"Good heavens! what do you do with it, then?"

"I spend all I have, and I only have what I spend, my dear
D'Artagnan."

"Ah that may be. But you are something of a prince, fifteen
or sixteen thousand livres melt away between your fingers;
and then you have expenses and appearances ---- "

"Well, I don't see why you should be less of a noble than I
am, my friend; your money would be quite sufficient."

"Three hundred thousand crowns! Two-thirds too much!"

"I beg your pardon -- did you not tell me? -- I thought I
heard you say -- I fancied you had a partner ---- "

"Ah! Mordioux! that's true," cried D'Artagnan, coloring;
"there is Planchet. I had forgotten Planchet, upon my life!
Well! there are my three hundred thousand crowns broken
into. That's a pity! it was a round sum, and sounded well.
That is true, Athos; I am no longer rich. What a memory you
have!"

"Tolerably good; yes, thank God!"

"The worthy Planchet!" grumbled D'Artagnan; "his was not a
bad dream! What a speculation! Peste! Well! what is said is
said."

"How much are you to give him?"

"Oh!" said D'Artagnan, "he is not a bad fellow; I shall
arrange matters with him. I have had a great deal of
trouble, you see, and expenses; all that must be taken into
account."

"My dear friend, I can depend upon you, and have no fear for
the worthy Planchet; his interests are better in your hands
than in his own. But now that you have nothing more to do
here, we shall depart, if you please. You can go and thank
his majesty, ask if he has any commands, and in six days we
may be able to get sight of the towers of Notre Dame."

"My friend, I am most anxious to be off, and will go at once
and pay my respects to the king."

"I," said Athos, "am going to call upon some friends in the
city, and shall then be at your service."

"Will you lend me Grimaud?"

"With all my heart. What do you want to do with him?"

"Something very simple, and which will not fatigue him; I
shall only beg him to take charge of my pistols, which lie
there on the table near that coffer."

"Very well!" replied Athos, imperturbably.

"And he will not stir, will he?"

"Not more than the pistols themselves."

"Then I shall go and take leave of his majesty. Au revoir!"

D'Artagnan arrived at St. James's, where Charles II. who was
busy writing, kept him in the ante-chamber a full hour.
Whilst walking about in the gallery, from the door to the
window, from the window to the door, he thought he saw a
cloak like Athos's cross the vestibule; but at the moment he
was going to ascertain if it were he, the usher summoned him
to his majesty's presence. Charles II. rubbed his hands
while receiving the thanks of our friend.

"Chevalier," said he, "you are wrong to express gratitude to
me; I have not paid you a quarter of the value of the
history of the box into which you put the brave general --
the excellent Duke of Albemarle, I mean." And the king
laughed heartily.

D'Artagnan did not think it proper to interrupt his majesty,
and bowed with much modesty.

"A propos," continued Charles, "do you think my dear Monk
has really pardoned you?"

"Pardoned me! yes, I hope so, sire!"

"Eh! -- but it was a cruel trick! Odds fish! to pack up the
first personage of the English revolution like a herring. In
your place I would not trust him, chevalier."

"But, sire ---- "

"Yes, I know very well that Monk calls you his friend, but
he has too penetrating an eye not to have a memory, and too
lofty a brow not to be very proud, you know grande
supercilium."

"I shall certainly learn Latin," said D'Artagnan to himself.

"But stop," cried the merry monarch, "I must manage your
reconciliation; I know how to set about it; so ---- "

D'Artagnan bit his mustache. "Will your majesty permit me to
tell you the truth?"

"Speak, chevalier, speak."

"Well, sire, you alarm me greatly. If your majesty
undertakes the affair, as you seem inclined to do, I am a
lost man; the duke will have me assassinated."

The king burst into a fresh roar of laughter, which changed
D'Artagnan's alarm into downright terror.

"Sire, I beg you to allow me to settle this matter myself,
and if your majesty has no further need of my services ----
"

"No, chevalier. What, do you want to leave us?" replied
Charles, with a hilarity that grew more and more alarming.

"If your majesty has no more commands for me."

Charles became more serious.

"One single thing. See my sister, the Lady Henrietta. Do you
know her?"

"No, sire, but -- an old soldier like me is not an agreeable
spectacle for a young and gay princess."

"Ah! but my sister must know you; she must in case of need
have you to depend upon."

"Sire, every one that is dear to your majesty will be sacred
to me."

"Very well! -- Parry! Come here, Parry!"

The side door opened and Parry entered, his face beaming
with pleasure as soon as he saw D'Artagnan.

"What is Rochester doing?" said the king.

"He is on the canal with the ladies," replied Parry.

"And Buckingham?"

"He is there also."

"That is well. You will conduct the chevalier to Villiers;
that is the Duke of Buckingham, chevalier; and beg the duke
to introduce M. d'Artagnan to the Princess Henrietta."

Parry bowed and smiled to D'Artagnan.

"Chevalier," continued the king, "this is your parting
audience; you can afterwards set out as soon as you please."

"Sire, I thank you."

"But be sure you make your peace with Monk!"

"Oh, sire ---- "

"You know there is one of my vessels at your disposal?"

"Sire, you overpower me; I cannot think of putting your
majesty's officers to inconvenience on my account."

The king slapped D'Artagnan upon the shoulder.

"Nobody will be inconvenienced on your account, chevalier,
but for that of an ambassador I am about sending to France,
and to whom you will willingly serve as a companion, I
fancy, for you know him."

D'Artagnan appeared astonished.

"He is a certain Comte de la Fere, -- whom you call Athos,"
added the king, terminating the conversation, as he had
begun it, by a joyous burst of laughter. "Adieu, chevalier,
adieu. Love me as I love you." And thereupon making a sign
to Parry to ask if there were any one waiting for him in the
adjoining closet, the king disappeared into that closet,
leaving the chevalier perfectly astonished by this singular
audience. The old man took his arm in a friendly way, and
led him towards the garden.




CHAPTER 35

On the Canal



Upon the green waters of the canal bordered with marble,
upon which time had already scattered black spots and tufts
of mossy grass, there glided majestically a long, flat bark
adorned with the arms of England, surmounted by a dais, and
carpeted with long damasked stuffs, which trailed their
fringes in the water. Eight rowers, leaning lazily to their
oars, made it move upon the canal with the graceful slowness
of the swans, which, disturbed in their ancient possessions
by the approach of the bark, looked from a distance at this
splendid and noisy pageant. We say noisy -- for the bark
contained four guitar and lute players, two singers, and
several courtiers, all sparkling with gold and precious
stones, and showing their white teeth in emulation of each
other, to please the Lady Henrietta Stuart, grand-daughter
of Henry IV., daughter of Charles I., and sister of Charles
II., who occupied the seat of honor under the dais of the
bark. We know this young princess, we have seen her at the
Louvre with her mother, wanting wood, wanting bread, and fed
by the coadjuteur and the parliament. She had, therefore,
like her brothers, passed through an uneasy youth; then, all
at once, she had just awakened from a long and horrible
dream, seated on the steps of a throne, surrounded by
courtiers and flatterers. Like Mary Stuart on leaving
prison, she aspired not only to life and liberty, but to
power and wealth.

The Lady Henrietta, in growing, had attained remarkable
beauty, which the recent restoration had rendered
celebrated. Misfortune had taken from her the luster of
pride, but prosperity had restored it to her. She was
resplendent, then, in her joy and her happiness, -- like
those hot-house flowers which, forgotten during a frosty
autumn night, have hung their heads, but which on the
morrow, warmed once more by the atmosphere in which they
were born, rise again with greater splendor than ever.
Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, son of him who played so
conspicuous a part in the early chapters of this history, --
Villiers of Buckingham, a handsome cavalier, melancholy with
women, a jester with men, -- and Wilmot, Lord Rochester, a
jester with both sexes, were standing at this moment before
the Lady Henrietta, disputing the privilege of making her
smile. As to that young and beautiful princess, reclining
upon a cushion of velvet bordered with gold, her hands
hanging listlessly so as to dip in the water, she listened
carelessly to the musicians without hearing them, and heard
the two courtiers without appearing to listen to them.

This Lady Henrietta -- this charming creature -- this woman
who joined the graces of France to the beauties of England,
not having yet loved, was cruel in her coquetry. The smile,
then, -- that innocent favor of young girls, -- did not even
lighten her countenance; and if, at times, she did raise her
eyes, it was to fasten them upon one or other of the
cavaliers with such a fixity, that their gallantry, bold as
it generally was, took the alarm, and became timid.

In the meanwhile the boat continued its course, the
musicians made a great noise, and the courtiers began, like
them, to be out of breath. Besides, the excursion became
doubtless monotonous to the princess, for all at once,
shaking her head with an air of impatience, -- "Come,
gentlemen, -- enough of this; -- let us land."

"Ah, madam," said Buckingham, "we are very unfortunate! We
have not succeeded in making the excursion agreeable to your
royal highness."

"My mother expects me," replied the princess; "and I must
frankly admit, gentlemen, I am bored." And whilst uttering
this cruel word, Henrietta endeavored to console by a look
each of the two young men, who appeared terrified at such
frankness. The look produced its effect -- the two faces
brightened; but immediately, as if the royal coquette
thought she had done too much for simple mortals, she made a
movement, turned her back on both her adorers, and appeared
plunged in a reverie in which it was evident they had no
part.

Buckingham bit his lips with anger, for he was truly in love
with Lady Henrietta, and, in that case, took everything in a
serious light. Rochester bit his lips likewise; but his wit
always dominated over his heart, it was purely and simply to
repress a malicious smile. The princess was then allowing
the eyes she turned from the young nobles to wander over the
green and flowery turf of the park, when she perceived Parry
and D'Artagnan at a distance.

"Who is coming yonder?" said she.

The two young men turned round with the rapidity of
lightning.

"Parry," replied Buckingham, "nobody but Parry."

"I beg your pardon," said Rochester, "but I think he has a
companion."

"Yes," said the princess, at first with languor, but then,
-- "What mean those words, `Nobody but Parry;' say, my
lord?"

"Because, madam," replied Buckingham, piqued, "because the
faithful Parry, the wandering Parry, the eternal Parry, is
not, I believe, of much consequence."

"You are mistaken, duke. Parry -- the wandering Parry, as
you call him -- has always wandered in the service of my
family, and the sight of that old man always gives me
satisfaction."

The Lady Henrietta followed the usual progress of pretty
women, particularly coquettish women; she passed from
caprice to contradiction; -- the gallant had undergone the
caprice, the courtier must bend beneath the contradictory
humor. Buckingham bowed, but made no reply.

"It is true, madam," said Rochester, bowing in his turn,
"that Parry is the model of servants; but, madam, he is no
longer young, and we laugh only when we see cheerful
objects. Is an old man a gay object?"

"Enough, my lord," said the princess, coolly; "the subject
of conversation is unpleasant to me."

Then, as if speaking to herself, "It is really
unaccountable," said she, "how little regard my brother's
friends have for his servants."

"Ah, madam," cried Buckingham, "your royal highness pierces
my heart with a dagger forged by your own hands."

"What is the meaning of that speech, which is turned so like
a French madrigal, duke? I do not understand it."

"It means, madam, that you yourself, so good, so charming,
so sensible, you have laughed sometimes -- smiled, I should
say -- at the idle prattle of that good Parry, for whom your
royal highness to-day entertains such a marvelous
susceptibility."

"Well, my lord, if I have forgotten myself so far," said
Henrietta, "you do wrong to remind me of it." And she made a
sign of impatience. "The good Parry wants to speak to me, I
believe: please order them to row to the shore, my Lord
Rochester."

Rochester hastened to repeat the princess's command; and a
moment later the boat touched the bank.

"Let us land, gentlemen," said Henrietta, taking the arm
which Rochester offered her, although Buckingham was nearer
to her, and had presented his. Then Rochester, with an
ill-dissembled pride, which pierced the heart of the unhappy
Buckingham through and through, led the princess across the
little bridge which the rowers had cast from the royal boat
to the shore.

"Which way will your royal highness go?" asked Rochester.

"You see, my lord, towards that good Parry, who is
wandering, as my lord of Buckingham says, and seeking me
with eyes weakened by the tears he has shed over our
misfortunes."

"Good heavens!" said Rochester, "how sad your royal highness
is to-day; in truth we seem ridiculous fools to you, madam."

"Speak for yourself, my lord," interrupted Buckingham with
vexation; "for my part, I displease her royal highness to
such a degree, that I appear absolutely nothing to her."

Neither Rochester nor the princess made any reply; Henrietta
only urged her companion more quickly on. Buckingham
remained behind, and took advantage of this isolation to
give himself up to his anger; he bit his handkerchief so
furiously that it was soon in shreds.

"Parry my good Parry," said the princess, with her gentle
voice, "come hither. I see you are seeking me, and I am
waiting for you."

"Ah, madam," said Rochester, coming charitably to the help
of his companion, who had remained, as we have said, behind,
"if Parry cannot see your royal highness, the man who
follows him is a sufficient guide, even for a blind man, for
he has eyes of flame. That man is a double-lamped lantern."

"Lighting a very handsome martial countenance," said the
princess, determined to be as ill-natured as possible.
Rochester bowed. "One of those vigorous soldiers' heads seen
nowhere but in France," added the princess, with the
perseverance of a woman sure of impunity.

Rochester and Buckingham looked at each other, as much as to
say, -- "What can be the matter with her?"

"See, my lord of Buckingham, what Parry wants," said
Henrietta. "Go!"

The young man, who considered this order as a favor, resumed
his courage, and hastened to meet Parry, who, followed by
D'Artagnan, advanced slowly on account of his age.
D'Artagnan walked slowly but nobly, as D'Artagnan, doubled
by the third of a million, ought to walk, that is to say,
without conceit or swagger, but without timidity. When
Buckingham, very eager to comply with the desire of the
princess, who had seated herself on a marble bench, as if
fatigued with the few steps she had gone, -- when
Buckingham, we say, was at a distance of only a few paces
from Parry, the latter recognized him.

"Ah I my lord!" cried he, quite out of breath, "will your
grace obey the king?"

"In what, Mr. Parry?" said the young man, with a kind of
coolness tempered by a desire to make himself agreeable to
the princess.

"Well, his majesty begs your grace to present this gentleman
to her royal highness the Princess Henrietta."

"In the first place, what is the gentleman's name?" said the
duke, haughtily.

D'Artagnan, as we know, was easily affronted, and the Duke
of Buckingham's tone displeased him. He surveyed the
courtier from head to foot, and two flashes beamed from
beneath his bent brows. But, after a struggle, -- "Monsieur
le Chevalier d'Artagnan, my lord," replied he, quietly.

"Pardon me, sir, that name teaches me your name but nothing
more."

"You mean ---- "

"I mean I do not know you."

"I am more fortunate than you, sir," replied D'Artagnan,
"for I have had the honor of knowing your family, and
particularly my lord Duke of Buckingham, your illustrious
father."

"My father?" said Buckingham. "Well, I think I now remember.
Monsieur le Chevalier d'Artagnan, do you say?"

D'Artagnan bowed. "In person," said he.

"Pardon me, but are you one of those Frenchmen who had
secret relations with my father?"

"Exactly, my lord duke, I am one of those Frenchmen."

"Then, sir, permit me to say that it was strange my father
never heard of you during his lifetime."

"No, monsieur, but he heard of me at the moment of his
death: it was I who sent to him, through the hands of the
valet de chambre of Anne of Austria, notice of the dangers
which threatened him; unfortunately, it came too late."

"Never mind, monsieur," said Buckingham. "I understand now,
that, having had the intention of rendering a service to the
father, you have come to claim the protection of the son."

"In the first place, my lord," replied D'Artagnan,
phlegmatically, "I claim the protection of no man. His
majesty Charles II., to whom I have had the honor of
rendering some services -- I may tell you, my lord, my life
has been passed in such occupations -- King Charles II.,
then, who wishes to honor me with some kindness, desires me
to be presented to her royal highness the Princess
Henrietta, his sister, to whom I shall, perhaps, have the
good fortune to be of service hereafter. Now, the king knew
that you at this moment were with her royal highness, and
sent me to you. There is no other mystery, I ask absolutely
nothing of you; and if you will not present me to her royal
highness, I shall be compelled to do without you, and
present myself."

"At least, sir," said Buckingham, determined to have the
last word, "you will not refuse me an explanation provoked
by yourself."

"I never refuse, my lord," said D'Artagnan.

"As you have had relations with my father, you must be
acquainted with some private details?"

"These relations are already far removed from us, my lord --
for you were not then born -- and for some unfortunate
diamond studs, which I received from his hands and carried
back to France, it is really not worth while awakening so
many remembrances."

"Ah! sir," said Buckingham, warmly, going up to D'Artagnan,
and holding out his hand to him, "it is you, then -- you
whom my father sought everywhere and who had a right to
expect so much from us."

"To expect, my lord, in truth, that is my forte; all my life
I have expected."

At this moment, the princess, who was tired of not seeing
the stranger approach her, arose and came towards them.

"At least, sir," said Buckingham, "you shall not wait for
the presentation you claim of me."

Then turning toward the princess and bowing: "Madam," said
the young man, "the king, your brother, desires me to have
the honor of presenting to your royal highness, Monsieur le
Chevalier d'Artagnan."

"In order that your royal highness may have, in case of
need, a firm support and a sure friend," added Parry.
D'Artagnan bowed.

"You have still something to say, Parry," replied Henrietta,
smiling upon D'Artagnan, while addressing the old servant.

"Yes, madam, the king desires you to preserve religiously in
your memory the name and merit of M. d'Artagnan, to whom his
majesty owes, he says, the recovery of his kingdom."
Buckingham, the princess, and Rochester looked at each
other.

"That," said D'Artagnan, "is another little secret, of
which, in all probability, I shall not boast to his
majesty's son, as I have done to you with respect to the
diamond studs."

"Madam," said Buckingham, "monsieur has just, for the second
time, recalled to my memory an event which excites my
curiosity to such a degree, that I shall venture to ask your
permission to take him to one side for a moment, to converse
in private."

"Do, my lord," said the princess, "but restore to the
sister, as quickly as possible, this friend so devoted to
the brother." And she took the arm of Rochester whilst
Buckingham took that of D'Artagnan.

"Oh! tell me, chevalier," said Buckingham, "all that affair
of the diamonds, which nobody knows in England, not even the
son of him who was the hero of it."

"My lord, one person alone had a right to relate all that
affair, as you call it, and that was your father; he thought
proper to be silent. I must beg you to allow me to be so
likewise." And D'Artagnan bowed like a man upon whom it was
evident no entreaties could prevail.

"Since it is so, sir," said Buckingham, "pardon my
indiscretion, I beg you; and if, at any time, I should go
into France ---- " and he turned round to take a last look
at the princess, who took but little notice of him, totally
occupied as she was, or appeared to be, with Rochester.
Buckingham sighed.

"Well?" said D'Artagnan.

"I was saying that if, any day, I were to go to France ----
"

"You will go, my lord," said D'Artagnan. "I shall answer for
that."

"And how so?"

"Oh, I have strange powers of prediction; if I do predict
anything I am seldom mistaken. If, then, you do come to
France?"

"Well, then, monsieur, you, of whom kings ask that valuable
friendship which restores crowns to them, I will venture to
beg of you a little of that great interest you took in my
father."

"My lord," replied D'Artagnan, "believe me, I shall deem
myself highly honored if, in France, you remember having
seen me here. And now permit ---- "

Then, turning towards the princess: "Madam," said he, "your
royal highness is a daughter of France; and in that quality
I hope to see you again in Paris. One of my happy days will
be that on which your royal highness shall give me any
command whatever, thus proving to me that you have not
forgotten the recommendations of your august brother." And
he bowed respectfully to the young princess, who gave him
her hand to kiss with a right royal grace.

"Ah! madam," said Buckingham, in a subdued voice, "what can
a man do to obtain a similar favor from your royal
highness?"

"Dame! my lord " replied Henrietta, "ask Monsieur
d'Artagnan; he will tell you."




CHAPTER 36

How D'Artagnan drew, as a Fairy would have done,
a Country-seat from a Deal Box



The king's words regarding the wounded pride of Monk had not
inspired D'Artagnan with a small portion of apprehension.
The lieutenant had had, all his life, the great art of
choosing his enemies; and when he had found them implacable
and invincible, it was when he had not been able, under any
pretense, to make them otherwise. But points of view change
greatly in the course of a life. It is a magic lantern, of
which the eye of man every year changes the aspects. It
results that from the last day of a year on which we saw
white, to the first day of the year on which we shall see
black, there is but the interval of a single night.

Now, D'Artagnan, when he left Calais with his ten scamps,
would have hesitated as little in attacking a Goliath, a
Nebuchadnezzar, or a Holofernes as he would in crossing
swords with a recruit or caviling with a landlady. Then he
resembled the sparrow-hawk which, when fasting, will attack
a ram. Hunger is blind. But D'Artagnan satisfied --
D'Artagnan rich -- D'Artagnan a conqueror -- D'Artagnan
proud of so difficult a triumph -- D'Artagnan had too much
to lose not to reckon, figure by figure, with probable
misfortune.

His thoughts were employed, therefore, all the way on the
road from his presentation, with one thing, and that was,
how he should conciliate a man like Monk, a man whom Charles
himself, kind as he was, conciliated with difficulty; for,
scarcely established, the protected might again stand in
need of the protector, and would, consequently, not refuse
him, such being the case, the petty satisfaction of
transporting M. d'Artagnan, or of confining him in one of
the Middlesex prisons, or drowning him a little on his
passage from Dover to Boulogne. Such sorts of satisfaction
kings are accustomed to render to viceroys without
disagreeable consequences.

It would not be at all necessary for the king to be active
in that contrepartie of the play in which Monk should take
his revenge. The part of the king would be confined to
simply pardoning the viceroy of Ireland all he should
undertake against D'Artagnan. Nothing more was necessary to
place the conscience of the Duke of Albemarle at rest than a
te absolvo said with a laugh, or the scrawl of "Charles the
King," traced at the foot of a parchment; and with these two
words pronounced, and these two words written, poor
D'Artagnan was forever crushed beneath the ruins of his
imagination.

And then, a thing sufficiently disquieting for a man with
such foresight as our musketeer, he found himself alone; and
even the friendship of Athos could not restore his
confidence. Certainly if the affair had only concerned a
free distribution of sword-thrusts, the musketeer would have
counted upon his companion; but in delicate dealings with a
king, when the perhaps of an unlucky chance should arise in
justification of Monk or of Charles of England, D'Artagnan
knew Athos well enough to be sure he would give the best
possible coloring to the loyalty of the survivor, and would
content himself with shedding floods of tears on the tomb of
the dead, supposing the dead to be his friend, and
afterwards composing his epitaph in the most pompous
superlatives.

"Decidedly," thought the Gascon; and this thought was the
result of the reflections which he had just whispered to
himself and which we have repeated aloud -- "decidedly, I
must be reconciled with M. Monk, and acquire a proof of his
perfect indifference for the past. If, and God forbid it
should be so! he is still sulky and reserved in the
expression of this sentiment, I shall give my money to Athos
to take away with him, and remain in England just long
enough to unmask him, then, as I have a quick eye and a
light foot, I shall notice the first hostile sign; to decamp
or conceal myself at the residence of my lord of Buckingham,
who seems a good sort of devil at the bottom, and to whom,
in return for his hospitality, I shall relate all that
history of the diamonds, which can now compromise nobody but
an old queen, who need not be ashamed, after being the wife
of a miserly creature like Mazarin, of having formerly been
the mistress of a handsome nobleman like Buckingham.
Mordioux! that is the thing, and this Monk shall not get the
better of me. Eh? and besides I have an idea!"

We know that, in general, D'Artagnan was not wanting in
ideas; and during this soliloquy, D'Artagnan buttoned his
vest up to the chin, and nothing excited his imagination
like this preparation for a combat of any kind, called
accinction by the Romans. He was quite heated when he
reached the mansion of the Duke of Albemarle. He was
introduced to the viceroy with a promptitude which proved
that he was considered as one of the household. Monk was in
his business-closet.

"My lord," said D'Artagnan, with that expression of
frankness which the Gascon knew so well how to assume, "my
lord, I have come to ask your grace's advice!"

Monk, as closely buttoned up morally as his antagonist was
physically, replied: "Ask, my friend;" and his countenance
presented an expression not less open than that of
D'Artagnan.

"My lord, in the first place, promise me secrecy and
indulgence."

"I promise you all you wish. What is the matter? Speak!"

"It is, my lord, that I am not quite pleased with the king."

"Indeed! And on what account, my dear lieutenant?"

"Because his majesty gives way sometimes to jest very
compromising for his servants; and jesting, my lord, is a
weapon that seriously wounds men of the sword, as we are."

Monk did all in his power not to betray his thought, but
D'Artagnan watched him with too close an attention not to
detect an almost imperceptible flush upon his face. "Well,
now, for my part," said he, with the most natural air
possible, "I am not an enemy of jesting, my dear Monsieur
d'Artagnan; my soldiers will tell you that even many times
in camp, I listened very indifferently, and with a certain
pleasure, to the satirical songs which the army of Lambert
passed into mine, and which, certainly, would have caused
the ears of a general more susceptible than I am to tingle."

"Oh, my lord," said D'Artagnan, "I know you are a complete
man; I know you have been, for a long time placed above
human miseries; but there are jests and jests of a certain
kind, which have the power of irritating me beyond
expression."

"May I inquire what kind, my friend?"

"Such as are directed against my friends or against people I
respect, my lord!"

Monk made a slight movement, which D'Artagnan perceived.
"Eh! and in what," asked Monk, "in what can the stroke of a
pin which scratches another tickle your skin? Answer me
that."

"My lord, I can explain it to you in one single sentence; it
concerns you."

Monk advanced a single step towards D'Artagnan. "Concerns
me?" said he.

"Yes, and this is what I cannot explain; but that arises,
perhaps, from my want of knowledge of his character. How can
the king have the heart to jest about a man who has rendered
him so many and such great services? How can one understand
that he should amuse himself in setting by the ears a lion
like you with a gnat like me?"

"I cannot conceive that in any way," said Monk.

"But so it is. The king, who owed me a reward, might have
rewarded me as a soldier, without contriving that history of
the ransom, which affects you, my lord."

"No," said Monk, laughing: "it does not affect me in any
way, I can assure you."

"Not as regards me, I can understand, you know me, my lord,
I am so discreet that the grave would appear a babbler
compared to me; but -- do you understand, my lord?"

"No," replied Monk, with persistent obstinacy.

"If another knew the secret which I know ---- "

"What secret?"

"Eh! my lord, why, that unfortunate secret of Newcastle."

"Oh! the million of M. le Comte de la Fere?"

"No, my lord, no; the enterprise made upon you grace's
person."

"It was well played, chevalier, that is all, and no more is
to be said about it: you are a soldier, both brave and
cunning, which proves that you unite the qualities of Fabius
and Hannibal. You employed your means, force and cunning:
there is nothing to be said against that: I ought to have
been on guard."

"Ah! yes; I know, my lord, and I expected nothing less from
your partiality; so that if it were only the abduction in
itself, Mordieux! that would be nothing; but there are ----
"

"What?"

"The circumstances of that abduction."

"What circumstances?"

"Oh! you know very well what I mean, my lord."

"No, curse me if I do."

"There is -- in truth, it is difficult to speak it."

"There is?"

"Well, there is that devil of a box!"

Monk colored visibly. "Well, I have forgotten it."

"Deal box," continued D'Artagnan, "with holes for the nose
and mouth. In truth, my lord, all the rest was well; but the
box, the box! that was really a coarse joke." Monk fidgeted
about in his chair. "And, notwithstanding my having done
that," resumed D'Artagnan, "I, a soldier of fortune, it was
quite simple, because by the side of that action, a little
inconsiderate I admit, which I committed, but which the
gravity of the case may excuse, I am circumspect and
reserved."

"Oh!" said Monk, "believe me, I know you well, Monsieur
d'Artagnan, and I appreciate you."

D'Artagnan never took his eyes off Monk; studying all which
passed in the mind of the general, as he prosecuted his
idea. "But it does not concern me," resumed he.

"Well, then, whom does it concern?" said Monk, who began to
grow a little impatient.

"It relates to the king, who will never restrain his
tongue."

"Well! and suppose he should say all he knows?" said Monk,
with a degree of hesitation.

"My lord," replied D'Artagnan, "do not dissemble, I implore
you, with a man who speaks so frankly as I do. You have a
right to feel your susceptibility excited, however benignant
it may be. What, the devil! it is not the place for a man
like you, a man who plays with crowns and scepters as a
Bohemian plays with his balls; it is not the place of a
serious man, I said, to be shut up in a box like some freak
of natural history; for you must understand it would make
all your enemies ready to burst with laughter, and you are
so great, so noble, so generous, that you must have many
enemies. This secret is enough to set half the human race
laughing, if you were represented in that box. It is not
decent to have the second personage in the kingdom laughed
at."

Monk was quite out of countenance at the idea of seeing
himself represented in his box. Ridicule, as D'Artagnan had
judiciously foreseen, acted upon him in a manner which
neither the chances of war, the aspirations of ambition, nor
the fear of death had been able to do.

"Good," thought the Gascon, "he is frightened: I am safe."

"Oh! as to the king," said Monk, "fear nothing, my dear
Monsieur d'Artagnan; the king will not jest with Monk, I
assure you!"

The momentary flash of his eye was noticed by D'Artagnan.
Monk lowered his tone immediately: "The king," continued he,
"is of too noble a nature, the king's heart is too high to
allow him to wish ill to those who do him good."

"Oh! certainly," cried D'Artagnan. "I am entirely of your
grace's opinion with regard to his heart, but not as to his
head -- it is good, but it is trifling."

"The king will not trifle with Monk, be assured."

"Then you are quite at ease, my lord?"

"On that side, at least! yes, perfectly."

"Oh! I understand you; you are at ease as far as the king is
concerned?"

"I have told you I was."

"But you are not so much so on my account?"

"I thought I had told you that I had faith in your loyalty
and discretion."

"No doubt, no doubt, but you must remember one thing ---- "

"What is that?"

"That I was not alone, that I had companions; and what
companions!"

"Oh! yes, I know them."

"And, unfortunately, my lord, they know you, too!"

"Well?"

"Well; they are yonder, at Boulogne, waiting for me."

"And you fear ---- "

"Yes, I fear that in my absence -- Parbleu! If I were near
them, I could answer for their silence."

"Was I not right in saying that the danger, if there was any
danger, would not come from his majesty, however disposed he
may be to jest, but from your companions, as you say? To be
laughed at by a king may be tolerable, but by the horse-boys
and scamps of the army! Damn it!"

"Yes, I understand, that would be unbearable, that is why,
my lord, I came to say, -- do you not think it would be
better for me to set out for France as soon as possible?"

"Certainly, if you think your presence ---- "

"Would impose silence upon these scoundrels? Oh! I am sure
of that, my lord."

"Your presence will not prevent the report from spreading,
if the tale has already transpired."

"Oh! it has not transpired, my lord, I will wager. At all
events, be assured I am determined upon one thing."

"What is that?"

"To blow out the brains of the first who shall have
propagated that report, and of the first who has heard it.
After which I shall return to England to seek an asylum, and
perhaps employment with your grace."

"Oh, come back! come back!"

"Unfortunately, my lord, I am acquainted with nobody here
but your grace, and if I should no longer find you, or if
you should have forgotten me in your greatness?"

"Listen to me, Monsieur d'Artagnan," replied Monk; "you are
a superior man, full of intelligence and courage; you
deserve all the good fortune this world can bring you; come
with me into Scotland, and, I swear to you, I shall arrange
for you a fate which all may envy."

"Oh! my lord, that is impossible. At present I have a sacred
duty to perform; I have to watch over your glory, I have to
prevent a low jester from tarnishing in the eyes of our
contemporaries -- who knows? in the eyes of posterity -- the
splendor of your name."

"Of posterity, Monsieur d'Artagnan?"

"Doubtless. It is necessary, as regards posterity, that all
the details of that history should remain a mystery; for,
admit that this unfortunate history of the deal box should
spread, and it should be asserted that you had not
re-established the king loyally, and of your own free will,
but in consequence of a compromise entered into at
Scheveningen between you two. It would be vain for me to
declare how the thing came about, for though I know I should
not be believed, it would be said that I had received my
part of the cake, and was eating it."

Monk knitted his brow. -- "Glory, honor, probity!" said he,
"you are but empty words."

"Mist!" replied D'Artagnan; "nothing but mist, through which
nobody can see clearly."

"Well, then, go to France, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan,"
said Monk; "go, and to render England more attractive and
agreeable to you, accept a remembrance of me.

"What now?" thought D'Artagnan.

"I have on the banks of the Clyde," continued Monk, "a
little house in a grove, cottage as it is called here. To
this house are attached a hundred acres of land. Accept it
as a souvenir."

"Oh my lord! ---- "

"Faith! you will be there in your own home, and that will be
the place of refuge you spoke of just now."

"For me to be obliged to your lordship to such an extent!
Really, your grace, I am ashamed."

"Not at all, not at all, monsieur," replied Monk, with an
arch smile; "it is I who shall be obliged to you. And,"
pressing the hand of the musketeer, "I shall go and draw up
the deed of gift," -- and he left the room.

D'Artagnan looked at him as he went out with something of a
pensive and even an agitated air.

"After all," said he, "he is a brave man. It is only a sad
reflection that it is from fear of me, and not affection
that he acts thus. Well, I shall endeavor that affection may
follow." Then, after an instant's deeper reflection, --
"Bah!" said he, "to what purpose? He is an Englishman." And
he in his turn went out, a little confused after the combat.

"So," said he, "I am a land-owner! But how the devil am I to
share the cottage with Planchet? Unless I give him the land,
and I take the chateau, or that he takes the house and I --
nonsense! M. Monk will never allow me to share a house he
has inhabited, with a grocer. He is too proud for that.
Besides, why should I say anything about it to him? It was
not with the money of the company I have acquired that
property, it was with my mother-wit alone; it is all mine,
then. So, now I will go and find Athos." And he directed his
steps towards the dwelling of the Comte de la Fere




CHAPTER 37

How D'Artagnan regulated the "Assets" of the
Company before he established its "Liabilities"



"Decidedly," said D'Artagnan to himself, "I have struck a
good vein. That star which shines once in the life of every
man, which shone for Job and Iris, the most unfortunate of
the Jews and the poorest of the Greeks, is come at last to
shine on me. I will commit no folly, I will take advantage
of it; it comes quite late enough to find me reasonable."

He supped that evening, in very good humor, with his friend
Athos; he said nothing to him about the expected donation,
but he could not forbear questioning his friend, while
eating, about country produce, sowing, and planting. Athos
replied complacently, as he always did. His idea was that
D'Artagnan wished to become a land-owner, only he could not
help regretting, more than once, the absence of the lively
humor and amusing sallies of the cheerful companion of
former days. In fact, D'Artagnan was so absorbed, that, with
his knife, he took advantage of the grease left at the
bottom of his plate, to trace ciphers and make additions of
surprising rotundity.

The order, or rather license, for their embarkation, arrived
at Athos's lodgings that evening. While this paper was
remitted to the comte, another messenger brought to
D'Artagnan a little bundle of parchments, adorned with all
the seals employed in setting off property deeds in England.
Athos surprised him turning over the leaves of these
different acts which establish the transmission of property.
The prudent Monk -- others would say the generous Monk --
had commuted the donation into a sale, and acknowledged the
receipt of the sum of fifteen thousand crowns as the price
of the property ceded. The messenger was gone. D'Artagnan
still continued reading, Athos watched him with a smile.
D'Artagnan, surprising one of those smiles over his
shoulder, put the bundle in its wrapper.

"I beg your pardon," said Athos.

"Oh! not at all, my friend," replied the lieutenant, "I
shall tell you ---- "

"No, don't tell me anything, I beg you; orders are things so
sacred, that to one's brother, one's father, the person
charged with such orders should never open his mouth. Thus
I, who speak to you, and love you more tenderly than
brother, father, or all the world ---- "

"Except your Raoul?"

"I shall love Raoul still better when he shall be a man, and
I shall have seen him develop himself in all the phases of
his character and his actions -- as I have seen you, my
friend."

"You said, then, that you had an order likewise, and that
you would not communicate it to me."

"Yes, my dear D'Artagnan."

The Gascon sighed. "There was a time," said he, "when you
would have placed that order open upon the table, saying,
`D'Artagnan, read this scrawl to Porthos, Aramis, and to
me.'"

"That is true. Oh! that was the time of youth, confidence,
the generous season when the blood commands, when it is
warmed by feeling!"

"Well! Athos, will you allow me to tell you?"

"Speak, my friend!"

"That delightful time, that generous season, that ruling by
warm blood, were all very fine things, no doubt; but I do
not regret them at all. It is absolutely like the period of
studies. I have constantly met with fools who would boast of
the days of pensums, ferules and crusts of dry bread. It is
singular, but I never loved all that; for my part, however
active and sober I might be (you know if I was so, Athos),
however simple I might appear in my clothes, I would not the
less have preferred the braveries and embroideries of
Porthos to my little perforated cassock, which gave passage
to the wind in winter and the sun in summer. I should
always, my friend, mistrust him who would pretend to prefer
evil to good. Now, in times past all went wrong with me, and
every month found a fresh hole in my cassock and in my skin,
a gold crown less in my poor purse; of that execrable time
of small beer and see-saw, I regret absolutely nothing,
nothing, nothing save our friendship; for within me I have a
heart, and it is a miracle that heart has not been dried up
by the wind of poverty which passed through the holes of my
cloak, or pierced by the swords of all shapes which passed
through the holes in my poor flesh."

"Do not regret our friendship," said Athos, "that will only
die with ourselves. Friendship is composed, above all
things, of memories and habits, and if you have just now
made a little satire upon mine, because I hesitate to tell
you the nature of my mission into France ---- "

"Who! I? -- Oh! heavens! if you knew, my dear friend, how
indifferent all the missions of the world will henceforth
become to me!" And he laid his hand upon the parchment in
his vest pocket.

Athos rose from the table and called the host in order to
pay the reckoning.

"Since I have known you, my friend," said D'Artagnan, "I
have never discharged the reckoning. Porthos often did,
Aramis sometimes, and you, you almost always drew out your
purse with the dessert. I am now rich and should like to try
if it is heroic to pay."

"Do so," said Athos; returning his purse to his pocket.

The two friends then directed their steps towards the port,
not, however, without D'Artagnan's frequently turning round
to watch the transportation of his dear crowns. Night had
just spread her thick veil over the yellow waters of the
Thames; they heard those noises of casks and pulleys, the
preliminaries of preparing to sail which had so many times
made the hearts of the musketeers beat when the dangers of
the sea were the least of those they were going to face.
This time they were to embark on board a large vessel which
awaited them at Gravesend, and Charles II., always delicate
in small matters, had sent one of his yachts, with twelve
men of his Scotch guard, to do honor to the ambassador he
was sending to France. At midnight the yacht had deposited
its passengers on board the vessel, and at eight o'clock in
the morning, the vessel landed the ambassador and his friend
on the wharf at Boulogne. Whilst the comte, with Grimaud,
was busy procuring horses to go straight to Paris,
D'Artagnan hastened to the hostelry where, according to his
orders, his little army was to wait for him. These gentlemen
were at breakfast upon oysters, fish, and spiced brandy,
when D'Artagnan appeared. They were all very gay, but not
one of them had yet exceeded the bounds of reason. A hurrah
of joy welcomed the general. "Here I am," said D'Artagnan,
"the campaign is ended. I am come to bring to each his
supplement of pay, as agreed upon." Their eyes sparkled. "I
will lay a wager there are not, at this moment, a hundred
crowns remaining in the purse of the richest among you."

"That is true," cried they in chorus.

"Gentlemen," said D'Artagnan, "then, this is the last order.
The treaty of commerce has been concluded thanks to our
coup-de-main which made us masters of the most skillful
financier of England, for now I am at liberty to confess to
you that the man we had to carry off was the treasurer of
General Monk."

This word treasurer produced a certain effect on his army.
D'Artagnan observed that the eyes of Menneville alone did
not evince perfect faith. "This treasurer," he continued, "I
conveyed to a neutral territory, Holland; I forced him to
sign the treaty; I have even reconducted him to Newcastle,
and as he was obliged to be satisfied with our proceedings
towards him -- the deal coffer being always carried without
jolting, and being lined softly, I asked for a gratification
for you. Here it is." He threw a respectable-looking purse
upon the cloth; and all involuntarily stretched out their
hands. "One moment, my lambs," said D'Artagnan; "if there
are profits, there are also charges."

"Oh! oh!" murmured they.

"We are about to find ourselves, my friends, in a position
that would not be tenable for people without brains. I speak
plainly: we are between the gallows and the Bastile."

"Oh! oh!" said the chorus.

"That is easily understood. It was necessary to explain to
General Monk the disappearance of his treasurer. I waited,
for that purpose, till the very unhopedfor moment of the
restoration of King Charles II., who is one of my friends."

The army exchanged a glance of satisfaction in reply to the
sufficiently proud look of D'Artagnan. "The king being
restored, I restored to Monk his man of business, a little
plucked, it is true, but, in short, I restored him. Now,
General Monk, when he pardoned me, for he has pardoned me,
could not help repeating these words to me, which I charge
every one of you to engrave deeply there, between the eyes,
under the vault of the cranium: -- `Monsieur, the joke has
been a good one, but I don't naturally like jokes; if ever a
word of what you have done' (you understand me, Menneville)
`escapes from your lips, or the lips of your companions, I
have, in my government of Scotland and Ireland, seven
hundred and forty-one wooden gibbets, of strong oak, clamped
with iron, and freshly greased every week. I will make a
present of one of these gibbets to each of you, and observe
well, M. d'Artagnan,' added he (observe it also, M.
Menneville), `I shall still have seven hundred and thirty
left for my private pleasure. And still further ---- '"

"Ah! ah!" said the auxiliaries, "is there more still?"

"A mere trifle. `Monsieur d'Artagnan, I send to the king of
France the treaty in question, with a request that he will
cast into the Bastile provisionally, and then send to me,
all who have taken part in this expedition; and that is a
prayer with which the king will certainly comply.'"

A cry of terror broke from all corners of the table.

"There! there! there," said D'Artagnan, "this brave M. Monk
has forgotten one thing, and that is he does not know the
name of any one of you, I alone know you, and it is not I,
you may well believe, who will betray you. Why should I? As
for you -- I cannot suppose you will be silly enough to
denounce yourselves, for then the king, to spare himself the
expense of feeding and lodging you, will send you off to
Scotland, where the seven hundred and forty-one gibbets are
to be found. That is all, messieurs; I have not another word
to add to what I have had the honor to tell you. I am sure
you have understood me perfectly well, have you not, M.
Menneville?"

"Perfectly," replied the latter.

"Now the crowns!" said D'Artagnan. "Shut the doors," he
cried, and opened the bag upon the table, from which rolled
several fine gold crowns. Every one made a movement towards
the floor.

"Gently!" cried D'Artagnan. "Let no one stoop, and then I
shall not be out in my reckoning." He found it all right,
gave fifty of those splendid crowns to each man, and
received as many benedictions as he bestowed pieces. "Now,"
said he, "if it were possible for you to reform a little, if
you could become good and honest citizens ---- "

"That is rather difficult," said one of the troop.

"What then, captain?" said another.

"Because I might be able to find you again, and, who knows
what other good fortune?" He made a sign to Menneville, who
listened to all he said with a composed air. "Menneville,"
said he, "come with me. Adieu my brave fellows! I need not
warn you to be discreet."

Menneville followed him, whilst the salutations of the
auxiliaries were mingled with the sweet sound of the money
clinking in their pockets.

"Menneville," said D'Artagnan, when they were once in the
street, "you were not my dupe; beware of being so. You did
not appear to me to have any fear of the gibbets of Monk, or
the Bastile of his majesty, King Louis XIV., but you will do
me the favor of being afraid of me. Then listen at the
smallest word that shall escape you, I will kill you as I
would a fowl. I have absolution from our holy father, the
pope, in my pocket."

"I assure you I know absolutely nothing, my dear M.
d'Artagnan, and that your words have all been to me so many
articles of faith."

"I was quite sure you were an intelligent fellow," said the
musketeer; "I have tried you for a length of time. These
fifty gold crowns which I give you above the rest will prove
the esteem I have for you. Take them."

"Thanks, Monsieur d'Artagnan," said Menneville.

"With that sum you can really become an honest man," replied
D'Artagnan, in the most serious tone possible. "It would be
disgraceful for a mind like yours, and a name you no longer
dare to bear, to sink forever under the rust of an evil
life. Become a gallant man, Menneville, and live for a year
upon those hundred gold crowns: it is a good provision;
twice the pay of a high officer. In a year come to me, and,
Mordioux! I will make something of you."

Menneville swore, as his comrades had sworn, that he would
be as silent as the grave. And yet some one must have
spoken; and as, certainly, it was not one of the nine
companions, and quite as certainly, it was not Menneville,
it must have been D'Artagnan, who, in his quality of a
Gascon, had his tongue very near to his lips. For, in short,
if it were not he, who could it be? And how can it be
explained that the secret of the deal coffer pierced with
holes should come to our knowledge, and in so complete a
fashion that we have, as has been seen, related the history
of it in all its most minute details; details which,
besides, throw a light as new as unexpected upon all that
portion of the history of England which has been left, up to
the present day, completely in darkness by the historian of
our neighbors?




CHAPTER 38

In which it is seen that the French Grocer
had already been established in the Seventeenth Century



His accounts once settled, and his recommendations made,
D'Artagnan thought of nothing but returning to Paris as soon
as possible. Athos, on his part, was anxious to reach home
and to rest a little. However whole the character and the
man may remain after the fatigues of a voyage, the traveler
perceives with pleasure, at the close of the day -- even
though the day has been a fine one -- that night is
approaching, and will bring a little sleep with it. So, from
Boulogne to Paris, jogging on, side by side, the two
friends, in some degree absorbed each in his individual
thoughts, conversed of nothing sufficiently interesting for
us to repeat to our readers. Each of them given up to his
personal reflections, and constructing his future after his
own fashion, was, above all, anxious to abridge the distance
by speed. Athos and D'Artagnan arrived at the gates of Paris
on the evening of the fourth day after leaving Boulogne.

"Where are you going, my friend?" asked Athos. "I shall
direct my course straight to my hotel."

"And I straight to my partner's."

"To Planchet's?"

"Yes; at the Pilon d'Or."

"Well, but shall we not meet again?"

"If you remain in Paris, yes, for I shall stay here."

"No: after having embraced Raoul, with whom I have appointed
a meeting at my hotel, I shall set out immediately for La
Fere."

"Well, adieu, then, dear and true friend."

"Au revoir! I should rather say, for why can you not come
and live with me at Blois? You are free, you are rich, I
shall purchase for you, if you like, a handsome estate in
the vicinity of Chiverny or of Bracieux. On the one side you
will have the finest woods in the world, which join those of
Chambord; on the other, admirable marshes. You who love
sporting, and who, whether you admit it or not, are a poet,
my dear friend, you will find pheasants, rail and teal,
without counting sunsets and excursions on the water, to
make you fancy yourself Nimrod and Apollo themselves. While
awaiting the purchase, you can live at La Fere, and we shall
go together to fly our hawks among the vines, as Louis XIII.
used to do. That is a quiet amusement for old fellows like
us."

D'Artagnan took the hands of Athos in his own. "Dear count,"
said he, "I shall say neither `Yes' nor `No.' Let me pass in
Paris the time necessary for the regulation of my affairs,
and accustom myself, by degrees, to the heavy and glittering
idea which is beating in my brain and dazzles me. I am rich,
you see, and from this moment until the time when I shall
have acquired the habit of being rich, I know myself, and I
shall be an insupportable animal. Now, I am not enough of a
fool to wish to appear to have lost my wits before a friend
like you, Athos. The cloak is handsome, the cloak is richly
gilded, but it is new, and does not seem to fit me."

Athos smiled. "So be it," said he. "But a propos of this
cloak, dear D'Artagnan, will you allow me to offer you a
little advice?"

"Yes, willingly."

"You will not be angry?"

"Proceed."

"When wealth comes to a man late in life or all at once,
that man, in order not to change, must most likely become a
miser -- that is to say, not spend much more money than he
had done before; or else become a prodigal, and contract so
many debts as to become poor again."

"Oh! but what you say looks very much like a sophism, my
dear philosophic friend."

"I do not think so. Will you become a miser?"

"No, pardieu! I was one already, having nothing. Let us
change."

"Then be prodigal."

"Still less, Mordioux! Debts terrify me. Creditors appear to
me, by anticipation like those devils who turn the damned
upon the gridirons, and as patience is not my dominant
virtue, I am always tempted to thrash those devils."

"You are the wisest man I know, and stand in no need of
advice from any one. Great fools must they be who think they
have anything to teach you. But are we not at the Rue Saint
Honore?"

"Yes, dear Athos."

"Look yonder, on the left, that small, long white house is
the hotel where I lodge. You may observe that it has but two
stories; I occupy the first; the other is let to an officer
whose duties oblige him to be absent eight or nine months in
the year, -- so I am in that house as in my own home,
without the expense."

"Oh! how well you manage, Athos! What order and what
liberality! They are what I wish to unite! But, of what use
trying! that comes from birth, and cannot be acquired."

"You are a flatterer! Well! adieu, dear friend. A propos,
remember me to Master Planchet; he was always a bright
fellow."

"And a man of heart, too, Athos. Adieu."

And they separated. During all this conversation, D'Artagnan
had not for a moment lost sight of a certain pack-horse, in
whose panniers, under some hay, were spread the sacoches
(messenger's bags) with the portmanteau. Nine o'clock was
striking at Saint-Merri. Planchet's helps were shutting up
his shop. D'Artagnan stopped the postilion who rode the
pack-horse, at the corner of the Rue des Lombards, under a
penthouse, and calling one of Planchet's boys, he desired
him not only to take care of the two horses, but to watch
the postilion; after which he entered the shop of the
grocer, who had just finished supper, and who, in his little
private room, was, with a degree of anxiety, consulting the
calendar, on which, every evening, he scratched out the day
that was past. At the moment when Planchet, according to his
daily custom, with the back of his pen, erased another day,
D'Artagnan kicked the door with his foot, and the blow made
his steel spur jingle. "Oh! good Lord!" cried Planchet. The
worthy grocer could say no more; he had just perceived his
partner. D'Artagnan entered with a bent back and a dull eye:
the Gascon had an idea with regard to Planchet.

"Good God!" thought the grocer, looking earnestly at the
traveler, "he looks sad!" The musketeer sat down.

"My dear Monsieur d'Artagnan!" said Planchet, with a
horrible palpitation of the heart. "Here you are! and your
health?"

"Tolerably good, Planchet, tolerably good!" said D'Artagnan,
with a profound sigh.

"You have not been wounded, I hope?"

"Phew!"

"Ah, I see," continued Planchet, more and more alarmed, "the
expedition has been a trying one?"

"Yes," said D'Artagnan. A shudder ran down Planchet's back.
"I should like to have something to drink," said the
musketeer, raising his head piteously.

Planchet ran to the cupboard, and poured out to D'Artagnan
some wine in a large glass. D'Artagnan examined the bottle.

"What wine is that?" asked he.

"Alas! that which you prefer, monsieur," said Planchet;
"that good old Anjou wine, which was one day nearly costing
us all so dear."

"Ah!" replied D'Artagnan, with a melancholy smile, "Ah! my
poor Planchet, ought I still to drink good wine?"

"Come! my dear master," said Planchet, making a superhuman
effort, whilst all his contracted muscles, his pallor, and
his trembling, betrayed the most acute anguish. "Come! I
have been a soldier and consequently have some courage; do
not make me linger, dear Monsieur d'Artagnan; our money is
lost, is it not?"

Before he answered, D'Artagnan took his time, and that
appeared an age to the poor grocer. Nevertheless he did
nothing but turn about on his chair.

"And if that were the case," said he, slowly, moving his
head up and down, "if that were the case, what would you
say, my dear friend?"

Planchet, from being pale, turned yellow. It might have been
thought he was going to swallow his tongue, so full became
his throat, so red were his eyes!

"Twenty thousand livres!" murmured he. "Twenty thousand
livres, and yet ---- "

D'Artagnan, with his neck elongated, his legs stretched out,
and his hands hanging listlessly, looked like a statue of
discouragement. Planchet drew up a sigh from the deepest
cavities of his breast.

"Well," said he, "I see how it is. Let us be men! It is all
over, is it not? The principal thing is, monsieur, that your
life is safe."

"Doubtless! doubtless! -- life is something -- but I am
ruined!"

"Cordieu! monsieur!" said Planchet, "if it is so, we must
not despair for that; you shall become a grocer with me; I
shall take you for my partner, we will share the profits,
and if there should be no more profits, well, why then we
shall share the almonds, raisins and prunes, and we will
nibble together the last quarter of Dutch cheese."

D'Artagnan could hold out no longer. "Mordioux!" cried he,
with great emotion, "thou art a brave fellow on my honor,
Planchet. You have not been playing a part, have you? You
have not seen the pack-horse with the bags under the shed
yonder?"

"What horse? What bags?" said Planchet, whose trembling
heart began to suggest that D'Artagnan was mad.

"Why, the English bags, Mordioux!" said D'Artagnan, all
radiant, quite transfigured.

"Ah! good God!" articulated Planchet, drawing back before
the dazzling fire of his looks.

"Imbecile!" cried D'Artagnan, "you think me mad! Mordioux!
On the contrary, never was my head more clear, or my heart
more joyous. To the bags, Planchet, to the bags!"

"But to what bags, good heavens!"

D'Artagnan pushed Planchet towards the window.

"Under the shed yonder, don't you see a horse?"

"Yes."

"Don't you see how his back is laden?"

"Yes, yes!"

"Don't you see your lad talking with the postilion?"

"Yes, yes, yes!"

"Well, you know the name of that lad, because he is your
own. Call him."

"Abdon! Abdon!" vociferated Planchet, from the window.

"Bring the horse!" shouted D'Artagnan.

"Bring the horse!" screamed Planchet.

"Now give ten crowns to the postilion," said D'Artagnan, in
the tone he would have employed in commanding a maneuver;
"two lads to bring up the two first bags, two to bring up
the two last, -- and move, Mordioux! be lively!"

Planchet rushed down the stairs, as if the devil had been at
his heels. A moment later the lads ascended the staircase,
bending beneath their burden. D'Artagnan sent them off to
their garrets, carefully closed the door, and addressing
Planchet, who, in his turn, looked a little wild, --

"Now, we are by ourselves," said he, and he spread upon the
floor a large cover, and emptied the first bag into it.
Planchet did the same with the second; then D'Artagnan, all
in a tremble, let out the precious bowels of the third with
a knife. When Planchet heard the provoking sound of the
silver and gold -- when he saw bubbling out of the bags the
shining crowns, which glittered like fish from the sweep-net
-- when he felt himself plunging his hands up to the elbow
in that still rising tide of yellow and white coins, a
giddiness seized him, and like a man struck by lightning, he
sank heavily down upon the enormous heap, which his weight
caused to roll away in all directions. Planchet, suffocated
with joy, had lost his senses. D'Artagnan threw a glass of
white wine in his face, which incontinently recalled him to
life.

"Ah! good heavens! good heavens! good heavens!" said
Planchet, wiping his mustache and beard.

At that time, as they do now, grocers wore the cavalier
mustache and the lansquenet beard, only the money baths,
already rare in those days, have become almost unknown now.

"Mordieux!" said D'Artagnan, "there are a hundred thousand
crowns for you, partner. Draw your share, if you please, and
I will draw mine."

"Oh! the lovely sum! Monsieur d'Artagnan, the lovely sum!"

"I confess that half an hour ago I regretted that I had to
give you so much, but I now no longer regret it; thou art a
brave grocer, Planchet. There, let us close our accounts,
for, as they say, short reckonings make long friends."

"Oh! rather, in the first place, tell me the whole history,"
said Planchet; "that must be better than the money."

"Ma foi!" said D'Artagnan, stroking his mustache, "I can't
say no, and if ever the historian turns to me for
information, he will be able to say he has not dipped his
bucket into a dry spring. Listen, then, Planchet, I will
tell you all about it."

"And I shall build piles of crowns," said Planchet. "Begin,
my dear master."

"Well, this is it," said D'Artagnan, drawing breath.

"And that is it," said Planchet, picking up his first
handful of crowns.




CHAPTER 39

Mazarin's Gaming Party



In a large chamber of the Palais Royal, hung with a dark
colored velvet, which threw into strong relief the gilded
frames of a great number of magnificent pictures, on the
evening of the arrival of the two Frenchmen, the whole court
was assembled before the alcove of M. le Cardinal de
Mazarin, who gave a card party to the king and queen.

A small screen separated three prepared tables. At one of
these tables the king and the two queens were seated. Louis
XIV., placed opposite to the young queen, his wife, smiled
upon her with an expression of real happiness. Anne of
Austria held the cards against the cardinal, and her
daughter-in-law assisted her in the game, when she was not
engaged in smiling at her husband. As for the cardinal, who
was lying on his bed with a weary and careworn face, his
cards were held by the Comtesse de Soissons, and he watched
them with an incessant look of interest and cupidity.

The cardinal's face had been painted by Bernouin; but the
rouge, which glowed only on his cheeks, threw into stronger
contrast the sickly pallor of his countenance and the
shining yellow of his brow. His eyes alone acquired a more
brilliant luster from this auxiliary, and upon those sick
man's eyes were, from time to time, turned the uneasy looks
of the king, the queen, and the courtiers. The fact is, that
the two eyes of the Signor Mazarin were the stars more or
less brilliant in which the France of the seventeenth
century read its destiny every evening and every morning.

Monseigneur neither won nor lost; he was, therefore neither
gay nor sad. It was a stagnation in which, full of pity for
him, Anne of Austria would not have willingly left him; but
in order to attract the attention of the sick man by some
brilliant stroke, she must have either won or lost. To win
would have been dangerous, because Mazarin would have
changed his indifference into an ugly grimace; to lose would
likewise have been dangerous, because she must have cheated,
and the infanta, who watched her game, would, doubtless,
have exclaimed against her partiality for Mazarin. Profiting
by this calm, the courtiers were chatting. When not in a bad
humor, M. de Mazarin was a very debonnaire prince, and he,
who prevented nobody from singing, provided they paid, was
not tyrant enough to prevent people from talking, provided
they made up their minds to lose.

They were therefore chatting. At the first table, the king's
younger brother, Philip, Duc d'Anjou, was admiring his
handsome face in the glass of a box. His favorite, the
Chevalier de Lorraine, leaning over the back of the prince's
chair, was listening, with secret envy, to the Comte de
Guiche, another of Philip's favorites, who was relating in
choice terms the various vicissitudes of fortune of the
royal adventurer Charles II. He told, as so many fabulous
events, all the history of his perigrinations in Scotland,
and his terrors when the enemy's party was so closely on his
track, of nights spent in trees, and days spent in hunger
and combats. By degrees, the fate of the unfortunate king
interested his auditors so greatly, that the play languished
even at the royal table, and the young king, with a pensive
look and downcast eye, followed, without appearing to give
any attention to it, the smallest details of this Odyssey,
very picturesquely related by the Comte de Guiche.

The Comtesse de Soissons interrupted the narrator: "Confess,
count, you are inventing."

"Madame, I am repeating like a parrot all the stories
related to me by different Englishmen. To my shame I am
compelled to say, I am as exact as a copy."

"Charles II. would have died before he could have endured
all that."

Louis XIV. raised his intelligent and proud head. "Madame,"
said he, in a grave tone, still partaking something of the
timid child, "monsieur le cardinal will tell you that during
my minority the affairs of France were in jeopardy, -- and
that if I had been older, and obliged to take sword in hand,
it would sometimes have been for the evening meal."

"Thanks to God," said the cardinal, who spoke for the first
time, "your majesty exaggerates, and your supper has always
been ready with that of your servants."

The king colored.

"Oh!" cried Philip, inconsiderately, from his place, and
without ceasing to admire himself, -- "I recollect once, at
Melun, the supper was laid for nobody, and that the king ate
two-thirds of a slice of bread, and abandoned to me the
other third."

The whole assembly, seeing Mazarin smile, began to laugh.
Courtiers flatter kings with the remembrance of past
distresses, as with the hopes of future good fortune.

"It is not to be denied that the crown of France has always
remained firm upon the heads of its kings," Anne of Austria
hastened to say, "and that it has fallen off of that of the
king of England; and when by chance that crown oscillated a
little, -- for there are throne-quakes as well as
earthquakes, -- every time, I say, that rebellion threatened
it, a good victory restored tranquillity."

"With a few gems added to the crown," said Mazarin.

The Comte de Guiche was silent: the king composed his
countenance, and Mazarin exchanged looks with Anne of
Austria, as if to thank her for her intervention.

"It is of no consequence," said Philip, smoothing his hair;
"my cousin Charles is not handsome, but he is very brave,
and fought like a landsknecht; and if he continues to fight
thus, no doubt he will finish by gaining a battle, like
Rocroy ---- "

"He has no soldiers," interrupted the Chevalier de Lorraine.

"The king of Holland, his ally, will give him some. I would
willingly have given him some if I had been king of France."

Louis XIV. blushed excessively. Mazarin affected to be more
attentive to his game than ever.

"By this time," resumed the Comte de Guiche, "the fortune of
this unhappy prince is decided. If he has been deceived by
Monk, he is ruined. Imprisonment, perhaps death, will finish
what exile, battles, and privations have commenced."

Mazarin's brow became clouded.

"Is it certain," said Louis XIV. "that his majesty Charles
II., has quitted the Hague?"

"Quite certain, your majesty," replied the young man; "my
father has received a letter containing all the details; it
is even known that the king has landed at Dover; some
fishermen saw him entering the port; the rest is still a
mystery."

"I should like to know the rest," said Philip, impetuously.
"You know, -- you, my brother."

Louis XIV. colored again. That was the third time within an
hour. "Ask my lord cardinal," replied he, in a tone which
made Mazarin, Anne of Austria, and everybody else open their
eyes.

"That means, my son," said Anne of Austria, laughing, "that
the king does not like affairs of state to be talked of out
of the council."

Philip received the reprimand with good grace, and bowed,
first smiling at his brother, and then his mother. But
Mazarin saw from the corner of his eye that a group was
about to be formed in the corner of the room, and that the
Duc d'Anjou, with the Comte de Guiche, and the Chevalier de
Lorraine, prevented from talking aloud, might say, in a
whisper, what it was not convenient should be said. He was
beginning, then, to dart at them glances full of mistrust
and uneasiness, inviting Anne of Austria to throw
perturbation in the midst of the unlawful assembly, when,
suddenly, Bernouin, entering from behind the tapestry of the
bedroom, whispered in the ear of Mazarin, "Monseigneur, an
envoy from his majesty, the king of England."

Mazarin could not help exhibiting a slight emotion, which
was perceived by the king. To avoid being indiscreet, rather
than to appear useless, Louis XIV. rose immediately, and
approaching his eminence, wished him good-night. All the
assembly had risen with a great noise of rolling of chairs
and tables being pushed away.

"Let everybody depart by degrees," said Mazarin in a whisper
to Louis XIV., "and be so good as to excuse me a few
minutes. I am going to dispatch an affair about which I wish
to converse with your majesty this very evening."

"And the queens?" asked Louis XIV.

"And M. le Duc d'Anjou," said his eminence.

At the same time he turned round in his ruelle, the curtains
of which, in falling, concealed the bed. The cardinal,
nevertheless, did not lose sight of the conspirators.

"M. le Comte de Guiche," said he, in a fretful voice, whilst
putting on, behind the curtain, his dressing-gown, with the
assistance of Bernouin.

"I am here, my lord," said the young man, as he approached.

"Take my cards, you are lucky. Win a little money for me of
these gentlemen."

"Yes, my lord."

The young man sat down at the table from which the king
withdrew to talk with the two queens. A serious game was
commenced between the comte and several rich courtiers. In
the meantime Philip was discussing the questions of dress
with the Chevalier de Lorraine, and they had ceased to hear
the rustling of the cardinal's silk robe from behind the
curtain. His eminence had followed Bernouin into the closet
adjoining the bedroom.




CHAPTER 40

An Affair of State



The cardinal, on passing into his cabinet, found the Comte
de la Fere, who was waiting for him, engaged in admiring a
very fine Raphael placed over a sideboard covered with
plate. His eminence came in softly, lightly, and silently as
a shadow, and surprised the countenance of the comte, as he
was accustomed to do, pretending to divine by the simple
expression of the face of his interlocutor what would be the
result of the conversation.

But this time Mazarin was foiled in his expectation: he read
nothing upon the face of Athos, not even the respect he was
accustomed to see on all faces. Athos was dressed in black,
with a simple lacing of silver. He wore the Holy Ghost, the
Garter, and the Golden Fleece, three orders of such
importance, that a king alone, or else a player, could wear
them at once.

Mazarin rummaged a long time in his somewhat troubled memory
to recall the name he ought to give to this icy figure, but
he did not succeed. "I am told," said he, at length, "you
have a message from England for me."

And he sat down, dismissing Bernouin, who, in his quality of
secretary, was getting his pen ready.

"On the part of his majesty, the king of England, yes, your
eminence."

"You speak very good French for an Englishman monsieur,"
said Mazarin, graciously, looking through his fingers at the
Holy Ghost, Garter, and Golden Fleece, but more particularly
at the face of the messenger.

"I am not an Englishman, but a Frenchman, monsieur le
cardinal," replied Athos.

"It is remarkable that the king of England should choose a
Frenchman for his ambassador; it is an excellent augury.
Your name, monsieur, if you please."

"Comte de la Fere," replied Athos, bowing more slightly than
the ceremonial and pride of the all-powerful minister
required.

Mazarin bent his shoulders, as if to say: --

"I do not know that name."

Athos did not alter his carriage.

"And you come, monsieur," continued Mazarin, "to tell me
---- "

"I come on the part of his majesty the king of Great Britain
to announce to the king of France" -- Mazarin frowned -- "to
announce to the king of France," continued Athos,
imperturbably, "the happy restoration of his majesty Charles
II. to the throne of his ancestors."

This shade did not escape his cunning eminence. Mazarin was
too much accustomed to mankind, not to see in the cold and
almost haughty politeness of Athos, an index of hostility,
which was not of the temperature of that hot-house called a
court.

"You have powers. I suppose?" asked Mazarin, in a short,
querulous tone.

"Yes, monseigneur." And the word "monseigneur" came so
painfully from the lips of Athos that it might be said it
skinned them.

Athos took from an embroidered velvet bag which he carried
under his doublet a dispatch. The cardinal held out his hand
for it. "Your pardon, monseigneur," said Athos. "My dispatch
is for the king."

"Since you are a Frenchman, monsieur, you ought to know the
position of a prime minister at the court of France."

"There was a time," replied Athos, "when I occupied myself
with the importance of prime ministers, but I have formed,
long ago, a resolution to treat no longer with any but the
king."

"Then, monsieur," said Mazarin, who began to be irritated,
"you will neither see the minister nor the king."

Mazarin rose. Athos replaced his dispatch in its bag, bowed
gravely, and made several steps towards the door. This
coolness exasperated Mazarin. "What strange diplomatic
proceedings are these!" cried he. "Have we returned to the
times when Cromwell sent us bullies in the guise of charges
d'affaires? You want nothing monsieur, but the steel cap on
your head, and a Bible at your girdle."

"Monsieur," said Athos, dryly, "I have never had, as you
have, the advantage of treating with Cromwell; and I have
only seen his charges d'affaires sword in hand, I am
therefore ignorant of how he treated with prime ministers.
As for the king of England, Charles II., I know that when he
writes to his majesty King Louis XIV., he does not write to
his eminence the Cardinal Mazarin. I see no diplomacy in
that distinction."

"Ah!" cried Mazarin, raising his attenuated hand and
striking his head, "I remember now!" Athos looked at him in
astonishment. "Yes, that is it!" said the cardinal,
continuing to look at his interlocutor; "yes, that is
certainly it. I know you now, monsieur. Ah! diavolo! I am no
longer astonished."

"In fact, I was astonished that, with your eminence's
excellent memory," replied Athos, smiling, "you had not
recognized me before."

"Always refractory and grumbling -- monsieur -- monsieur --
What do they call you? Stop -- a name of a river -- Potamos;
no -- the name of an island -- Naxos; no, per Giove! -- the
name of a mountain -- Athos! now I have it. Delighted to see
you again, and to be no longer at Rueil, where you and your
damned companions made me pay ransom. Fronde! still Fronde!
accursed Fronde! Oh, what grudges! Why, monsieur, have your
antipathies survived mine? If any one had cause to complain,
I think it could not be you, who got out of the affair not
only in a sound skin, but with the cordon of the Holy Ghost
around your neck."

"My lord cardinal," replied Athos, "permit me not to enter
into considerations of that kind. I have a mission to
fulfill. Will you facilitate the means of my fulfilling that
mission, or will you not?"

"I am astonished," said Mazarin, -- quite delighted at
having recovered his memory, and bristling with malice -- "I
am astonished, Monsieur -- Athos -- that a Frondeur like you
should have accepted a mission for the Mazarin, as used to
be said in the good old times ---- " And Mazarin began to
laugh, in spite of a painful cough, which cut short his
sentences, converting them into sobs.

"I have only accepted the mission near the king of France,
monsieur le cardinal," retorted the comte, though with less
asperity, for he thought he had sufficiently the advantage
to show himself moderate.

"And yet, Monsieur le Frondeur," said Mazarin gayly, "the
affair which you have taken in charge must, from the king
---- "

"With which I have been given in charge, monseigneur. I do
not run after affairs."

"Be it so. I say that this negotiation must pass through my
hands. Let us lose no precious time, then. Tell me the
conditions."

"I have had the honor of assuring your eminence that only
the letter of his majesty King Charles II. contains the
revelation of his wishes."

"Pooh! you are ridiculous with your obstinacy, Monsieur
Athos. It is plain you have kept company with the Puritans
yonder. As to your secret, I know it better than you do; and
you have done wrongly, perhaps, in not having shown some
respect for a very old and suffering man, who has labored
much during his life, and kept the field for his ideas as
bravely as you have for yours. You will not communicate your
letter to me? You will say nothing to me? Very well! Come
with me into my chamber; you shall speak to the king -- and
before the king. -- Now, then, one last word: who gave you
the Fleece? I remember you passed for having the Garter; but
as to the Fleece, I do not know ---- "

"Recently, my lord, Spain, on the occasion of the marriage
of his majesty Louis XIV., sent King Charles II. a brevet of
the Fleece in blank, Charles II. immediately transmitted it
to me, filling up the blank with my name."

Mazarin arose, and leaning on the arm of Bernouin, he
returned to his ruelle at the moment the name of M. le
Prince was being announced. The Prince de Conde, the first
prince of the blood, the conqueror of Rocroy, Lens and
Nordlingen, was, in fact, entering the apartment of
Monseigneur de Mazarin, followed by his gentlemen, and had
already saluted the king, when the prime minister raised his
curtain. Athos had time to see Raoul pressing the hand of
the Comte de Guiche, and send him a smile in return for his
respectful bow. He had time, likewise, to see the radiant
countenance of the cardinal, when he perceived before him,
upon the table, an enormous heap of gold, which the Comte de
Guiche had won in a run of luck, after his eminence had
confided his cards to him. So forgetting ambassador, embassy
and prince, his first thought was of the gold. "What!" cried
the old man -- "all that -- won?"

"Some fifty thousand crowns; yes, monseigneur!" replied the
Comte de Guiche, rising. "Must I give up my place to your
eminence, or shall I continue?"

"Give up! give up! you are mad. You would lose all you have
won. Peste!"

"My lord!" said the Prince de Conde, bowing.

"Good-evening, monsieur le prince," said the minister, in a
careless tone; "it is very kind of you to visit an old sick
friend."

"A friend!" murmured the Comte de la Fere, at witnessing
with stupor this monstrous alliance of words; -- "friends!
when the parties are Conde and Mazarin!"

Mazarin seemed to divine the thought of the Frondeur, for he
smiled upon him with triumph, and immediately, -- "Sire,"
said he to the king, "I have the honor of presenting to your
majesty, Monsieur le Comte de la Fere, ambassador from his
Britannic majesty. An affair of state, gentlemen," added he,
waving his hand to all who filled the chamber, and who, the
Prince de Conde at their head, all disappeared at the simple
gesture. Raoul, after a last look cast at the comte,
followed M. de Conde. Philip of Anjou and the queen appeared
to be consulting about departing.

"A family affair," said Mazarin, suddenly, detaining them in
their seats. "This gentleman is the bearer of a letter in
which King Charles II., completely restored to his throne,
demands an alliance between Monsieur, the brother of the
king, and Mademoiselle Henrietta, grand-daughter of Henry
IV. Will you remit your letter of credit to the king,
monsieur le comte?"

Athos remained for a minute stupefied. How could the
minister possibly know the contents of the letter which had
never been out of his keeping for a single instant?
Nevertheless, always master of himself, he held out the
dispatch to the young king, Louis XIV., who took it with a
blush. A solemn silence reigned in the cardinal's chamber.
It was only troubled by the dull sound of the gold, which
Mazarin with his yellow dry hand, piled up in a casket,
whilst the king was reading.




CHAPTER 41

The Recital



The maliciousness of the cardinal did not leave much for the
ambassador to say; nevertheless, the word "restoration" had
struck the king, who, addressing the comte, upon whom his
eyes had been fixed since his entrance, -- "Monsieur," said
he, "will you have the kindness to give us some details
concerning the affairs of England. You come from that
country, you are a Frenchman, and the orders which I see
glittering upon your person announce you to be a man of
merit as well as a man of quality."

"Monsieur," said the cardinal, turning towards the
queen-mother, "is an ancient servant of your majesty's,
Monsieur le Comte de la Fere."

Anne of Austria was as oblivious as a queen whose life had
been mingled with fine and stormy days. She looked at
Mazarin, whose evil smile promised her something
disagreeable; then she solicited from Athos, by another
look, an explanation.

"Monsieur," continued the cardinal, "was a Treville
musketeer, in the service of the late king. Monsieur is well
acquainted with England, whither he has made several voyages
at various periods; he is a subject of the highest merit.

These words made allusion to all the memories which Anne of
Austria trembled to evoke. England, that was her hatred of
Richelieu and her love for Buckingham; a Treville musketeer,
that was the whole Odyssey of the triumphs which had made
the heart of the young woman throb, and of the dangers which
had been so near overturning the throne of the young queen.
These words had much power, for they rendered mute and
attentive all the royal personages, who, with very various
sentiments, set about recomposing at the same time the
mysteries which the young had not seen, and which the old
had believed to be forever effaced.

"Speak, monsieur," said Louis XIV., the first to escape from
troubles, suspicions, and remembrances.

"Yes, speak," added Mazarin, to whom the little malicious
thrust directed against Anne of Austria had restored energy
and gayety.

"Sire," said the comte, "a sort of miracle has changed the
whole destiny of Charles II. That which men, till that time,
had been unable to do, God resolved to accomplish."

Mazarin coughed while tossing about in his bed.

"King Charles II.," continued Athos, "left the Hague neither
as a fugitive nor a conqueror, but as an absolute king, who,
after a distant voyage from his kingdom, returns amidst
universal benedictions."

"A great miracle, indeed," said Mazarin; "for, if the news
was true, King Charles II., who has just returned amidst
benedictions, went away amidst musket-shots."

The king remained impassible. Philip, younger and more
frivolous, could not repress a smile, which flattered
Mazarin as an applause of his pleasantry.

"It is plain," said the king, "there is a miracle; but God,
who does so much for kings, monsieur le comte, nevertheless
employs the hand of man to bring about the triumph of His
designs. To what men does Charles II. principally owe his
re-establishment?"

"Why," interrupted Mazarin, without any regard for the
king's pride -- "does not your majesty know that it is to M.
Monk?"

"I ought to know it," replied Louis XIV., resolutely; "and
yet I ask my lord ambassador the causes of the change in
this General Monk?"

"And your majesty touches precisely the question," replied
Athos, "for without the miracle of which I have had the
honor to speak, General Monk would probably have remained an
implacable enemy of Charles II. God willed that a strange,
bold, and ingenious idea should enter into the mind of a
certain man, whilst a devoted and courageous idea took
possession of the mind of another man. The combinations of
these two ideas brought about such a change in the position
of M. Monk, that, from an inveterate enemy, he became a
friend to the deposed king."

"These are exactly the details I asked for," said the king.
"Who and what are the two men of whom you speak?"

"Two Frenchmen, sire."

"Indeed! I am glad of that."

"And the two ideas," said Mazarin; -- "I am more curious
about ideas than about men, for my part."

"Yes," murmured the king.

"The second idea, the devoted, reasonable idea -- the least
important, sir -- was to go and dig up a million in gold,
buried by King Charles I. at Newcastle, and to purchase with
that gold the adherence of Monk."

"Oh, oh!" said Mazarin, reanimated by the word million. "But
Newcastle was at the time occupied by Monk."

"Yes, monsieur le cardinal, and that is why I venture to
call the idea courageous as well as devoted. It was
necessary, if Monk refused the offers of the negotiator, to
reinstate King Charles II. in possession of this million,
which was to be torn, as it were, from the loyalty and not
the royalism of General Monk. This was effected in spite of
many difficulties: the general proved to be loyal, and
allowed the money to be taken away."

"It seems to me," said the timid, thoughtful king, "that
Charles II. could not have known of this million whilst he
was in Paris."

"It seems to me," rejoined the cardinal, maliciously, "that
his majesty the king of Great Britain knew perfectly well of
this million, but that he preferred having two millions to
having one."

"Sire," said Athos, firmly, "the king of England, whilst in
France, was so poor that he had not even money to take the
post; so destitute of hope that he frequently thought of
dying. He was so entirely ignorant of the existence of the
million at Newcastle, that but for a gentleman -- one of
your majesty's subjects -- the moral depositary of the
million, who revealed the secret to King Charles II., that
prince would still be vegetating in the most cruel
forgetfulness."

"Let us pass on to the strange, bold and ingenious idea,"
interrupted Mazarin, whose sagacity foresaw a check. "What
was that idea?"

"This -- M. Monk formed the only obstacle to the
re-establishment of the fallen king. A Frenchman imagined
the idea of suppressing this obstacle."

"Oh! oh! but he is a scoundrel, that Frenchman," said
Mazarin, "and the idea is not so ingenious as to prevent its
author being tied up by the neck at the Place de Greve, by
decree of the parliament."

"Your eminence is mistaken," replied Athos, dryly; "I did
not say that the Frenchman in question had resolved to
assassinate M. Monk, but only to suppress him. The words of
the French language have a value which the gentlemen of
France know perfectly. Besides, this is an affair of war;
and when men serve kings against their enemies they are not
to be condemned by a parliament -- God is their judge. This
French gentleman, then, formed the idea of gaining
possession of the person of Monk, and he executed his plan."

The king became animated at the recital of great actions.
The king's younger brother struck the table with his hand,
exclaiming, "Ah! that is fine!"

"He carried off Monk?" said the king. "Why, Monk was in his
camp."

"And the gentleman was alone, sire."

"That is marvelous!" said Philip.

"Marvelous, indeed!" cried the king.

"Good! There are the two little lions unchained," murmured
the cardinal. And with an air of spite, which he did not
dissemble: "I am unacquainted with these details, will you
guarantee their authenticity, monsieur?"

"All the more easily, my lord cardinal, from having seen the
events."

"You have?"

"Yes, monseigneur."

The king had involuntarily drawn close to the count, the Duc
d'Anjou had turned sharply round, and pressed Athos on the
other side.

"What next? monsieur, what next?" cried they both at the
same time.

"Sire, M. Monk, being taken by the Frenchman, was brought to
King Charles II., at the Hague. The king gave back his
freedom to Monk, and the grateful general, in return, gave
Charles II. the throne of Great Britain, for which so many
valiant men had fought in vain."

Philip clapped his hands with enthusiasm; Louis XIV., more
reflective, turned towards the Comte de la Fere.

"Is this true," said he, "in all its details?"

"Absolutely true, sire."

"That one of my gentlemen knew the secret of the million,
and kept it?"

"Yes, sire."

"The name of that gentleman?"

"It was your humble servant," said Athos, simply, and
bowing.

A murmur of admiration made the heart of Athos swell with
pleasure. He had reason to be proud, at least. Mazarin,
himself, had raised his arms towards heaven.

"Monsieur," said the king, "I shall seek, and find means to
reward you." Athos made a movement. "Oh, not for your
honesty, to be paid for that would humiliate you, but I owe
you a reward for having participated in the restoration of
my brother, King Charles II."

"Certainly," said Mazarin.

"It is the triumph of a good cause which fills the whole
house of France with joy," said Anne of Austria.

"I continue," said Louis XIV. "Is it also true that a single
man penetrated to Monk, in his camp, and carried him off?"

"That man had ten auxiliaries, taken from a very inferior
rank."

"And nothing but them?"

"Nothing more."

"And he is named?"

"Monsieur d'Artagnan, formerly lieutenant of the musketeers
of your majesty."

Anne of Austria colored; Mazarin became yellow with shame;
Louis XIV. was deeply thoughtful, and a drop of moisture
fell from his pale brow. "What men!" murmured he. And,
involuntarily, he darted a glance at the minister which
would have terrified him, if Mazarin, at the moment, had not
concealed his head under his pillow.

"Monsieur," said the young Duc d'Anjou, placing his hand,
delicate and white as that of a woman, upon the arm of
Athos, "tell that brave man, I beg you, that Monsieur,
brother of the king, will to-morrow drink his health before
five hundred of the best gentlemen of France." And, on
finishing these words, the young man, perceiving that his
enthusiasm had deranged one of his ruffles, set to work to
put it to rights with the greatest care imaginable.

"Let us resume business, sire," interrupted Mazarin who
never was enthusiastic, and who wore no ruffles.

"Yes, monsieur," replied Louis XIV. "Pursue your
communication, monsieur le comte," added he, turning towards
Athos.

Athos immediately began and offered in due form the hand of
the Princess Henrietta Stuart to the young prince, the
king's brother. The conference lasted an hour; after which
the doors of the chamber were thrown open to the courtiers,
who resumed their places as if nothing had been kept from
them in the occupations of that evening. Athos then found
himself again with Raoul, and the father and son were able
to clasp each other's hands.




CHAPTER 42

In which Mazarin becomes Prodigal



Whilst Mazarin was endeavoring to recover from the serious
alarm he had just experienced, Athos and Raoul were
exchanging a few words in a corner of the apartment. "Well,
here you are at Paris, then, Raoul?" said the comte.

"Yes, monsieur, since the return of M. le Prince."

"I cannot converse freely with you here, because we are
observed; but I shall return home presently, and shall
expect you as soon as your duty permits."

Raoul bowed, and, at that moment, M. le Prince came up to
them. The prince had that clear and keen look which
distinguishes birds of prey of the noble species; his
physiognomy itself presented several distinct traits of this
resemblance. It is known that in the Prince de Conde, the
aquiline nose rose out sharply and incisively from a brow
slightly retreating, rather low than high, and according to
the railers of the court, -- a pitiless race even for
genius, -- constituted rather an eagle's beak than a human
nose, in the heir of the illustrious princes of the house of
Conde. This penetrating look, this imperious expression of
the whole countenance generally disturbed those to whom the
prince spoke, more than either majesty or regular beauty
could have done in the conqueror of Rocroy. Besides this,
the fire mounted so suddenly to his projecting eyes, that
with the prince every sort of animation resembled passion.
Now, on account of his rank, everybody at the court
respected M. le Prince, and many even, seeing only the man,
carried their respect as far as terror.

Louis de Conde then advanced towards the Comte de la Fere
and Raoul, with the marked intention of being saluted by the
one, and of speaking to the other. No man bowed with more
reserved grace than the Comte de la Fere. He disdained to
put into a salutation all the shades which a courtier
ordinarily borrows from the same color -- the desire to
please. Athos knew his own personal value, and bowed to the
prince like a man, correcting by something sympathetic and
undefinable that which might have appeared offensive to the
pride of the highest rank in the inflexibility of his
attitude. The prince was about to speak to Raoul. Athos
forestalled him. "If M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne," said he,
"were not one of the humble servants of your royal highness,
I would beg him to pronounce my name before you -- mon
prince."

"I have the honor to address Monsieur le Comte de la Fere,"
said Conde instantly.

"My protector," added Raoul, blushing.

"One of the most honorable men in the kingdom," continued
the prince; "one of the first gentlemen of France, and of
whom I have heard so much that I have frequently desired to
number him among my friends."

"An honour of which I should be unworthy," replied Athos,
"but for the respect and admiration I entertain for your
royal highness."

"Monsieur de Bragelonne," said the prince, "is a good
officer, and it is plainly seen that he has been to a good
school. Ah, monsieur le comte, in your time, generals had
soldiers!"

"That is true, my lord, but nowadays soldiers have
generals."

This compliment, which savored so little of flattery, gave a
thrill of joy to the man whom already Europe considered a
hero; and who might be thought to be satiated with praise.

"I regret very much," continued the prince, "that you should
have retired from the service, monsieur le comte, for it is
more than probable that the king will soon have a war with
Holland or England, and opportunities for distinguishing
himself would not be wanting for a man who, like you, knows
Great Britain as well as you do France."

"I believe I may say, monseigneur, that I have acted wisely
in retiring from the service," said Athos, smiling. "France
and Great Britain will henceforward live like two sisters,
if I can trust my presentiments."

"Your presentiments?"

"Stop, monseigneur, listen to what is being said yonder, at
the table of my lord the cardinal."

"Where they are playing?"

"Yes, my lord."

The cardinal had just raised himself on one elbow, and made
a sign to the king's brother, who went to him.

"My lord," said the cardinal, "pick up, if you please, all
those gold crowns." And he pointed to the enormous pile of
yellow and glittering pieces which the Comte de Guiche had
raised by degrees before him by a surprising run of luck at
play.

"For me?" cried the Duc d'Anjou.

"Those fifty thousand crowns; yes, monseigneur, they are
yours."

"Do you give them to me?"

"I have been playing on your account, monseigneur," replied
the cardinal, getting weaker and weaker, as if this effort
of giving money had exhausted all his physical and moral
faculties.

"Oh, good heavens!" exclaimed Philip, wild with joy, "what a
fortunate day!" And he himself, making a rake of his
fingers, drew a part of the sum into his pockets, which he
filled, and still full a third remained on the table.

"Chevalier," said Philip to his favorite, the Chevalier de
Lorraine, "come hither, chevalier." The favorite quickly
obeyed. "Pocket the rest," said the young prince.

This singular scene was considered by the persons present
only as a touching kind of family fete. The cardinal assumed
the airs of a father with the sons of France, and the two
young princes had grown up under his wing. No one then
imputed to pride, or even impertinence, as would be done
nowadays, this liberality on the part of the first minister.
The courtiers were satisfied with envying the prince. -- The
king turned away his head.

"I never had so much money before," said the young prince,
joyously, as he crossed the chamber with his favorite to go
to his carriage. "No, never! What a weight these crowns
are!"

"But why has monsieur le cardinal given all this money at
once?" asked M. le Prince of the Comte de la Fere. "He must
be very ill, the dear cardinal!"

"Yes, my lord, very ill; without doubt; he looks very ill,
as your royal highness may perceive."

"But surely he will die of it. A hundred and fifty thousand
crowns! Oh, it is incredible! But, comte tell me a reason
for it?"

"Patience, monseigneur, I beg of you. Here comes M. le Duc
d'Anjou, talking with the Chevalier de Lorraine; I should
not be surprised if they spared us the trouble of being
indiscreet. Listen to them."

In fact the chevalier said to the prince in a low voice, "My
lord, it is not natural for M. Mazarin to give you so much
money. Take care! you will let some of the pieces fall, my
lord. What design has the cardinal upon you to make him so
generous?"

"As I said," whispered Athos in the prince's ear; "that,
perhaps, is the best reply to your question."

"Tell me, my lord," repeated the chevalier impatiently, as
he was calculating, by weighing them in his pocket, the
quota of the sum which had fallen to his share by rebound.

"My dear chevalier, a wedding present."

"How a wedding present?"

"Eh! yes, I am going to be married," replied the Duc
d'Anjou, without perceiving, at the moment, he was passing
the prince and Athos, who both bowed respectfully.

The chevalier darted at the young duke a glance so strange,
and so malicious, that the Comte de la Fere quite started on
beholding it.

"You! you to be married!" repeated he; "oh! that's
impossible. You would not commit such a folly!"

"Bah! I don't do it myself; I am made to do it," replied the
Duc d'Anjou. "But come, quick! let us get rid of our money."
Thereupon he disappeared with his companion, laughing and
talking, whilst all heads were bowed on his passage.

"Then," whispered the prince to Athos, "that is the secret."

"It was not I that told you so, my lord."

"He is to marry the sister of Charles II.?"

"I believe so."

The prince reflected for a moment, and his eye shot forth
one of its not unfrequent flashes. "Humph!" said he slowly,
as if speaking to himself; "our swords are once more to be
hung on the wall -- for a long time!" and he sighed.

All that sigh contained of ambition silently stifled, of
extinguished illusions and disappointed hopes, Athos alone
divined, for he alone had heard that sigh. Immediately
after, the prince took leave and the king left the
apartment. Athos, by a sign made to Bragelonne, renewed the
desire he had expressed at the beginning of the scene. By
degrees the chamber was deserted, and Mazarin was left
alone, a prey to suffering which he could no longer
dissemble. "Bernouin! Bernouin!" cried he, in a broken
voice.

"What does monseigneur want?"

"Guenaud -- let Guenaud be sent for," said his eminence. "I
think I'm dying."

Bernouin, in great terror, rushed into the cabinet to give
the order, and the piqueur, who hastened to fetch the
physician, passed the king's carriage in the Rue Saint
Honore.




CHAPTER 43

Guenaud



The cardinal's order was pressing; Guenaud quickly obeyed
it. He found his patient stretched on his bed, his legs
swelled, his face livid, and his stomach collapsed. Mazarin
had a severe attack of gout. He suffered tortures with the
impatience of a man who has not been accustomed to
resistances. On seeing Guenaud: "Ah!" said he; "now I am
saved!"

Guenaud was a very learned and circumspect man, who stood in
no need of the critiques of Boileau to obtain a reputation.
When facing a disease, if it were personified in a king, he
treated the patient as a Turk treats a Moor. He did not,
therefore, reply to Mazarin as the minister expected: "Here
is the doctor; good-bye disease!" On the contrary, on
examining his patient, with a very serious air:

"Oh! oh!" said he.

"Eh! what! Guenaud! How you look at me!"

"I look as I should on seeing your complaint, my lord; it is
a very dangerous one."

"The gout -- oh! yes, the gout."

"With complications, my lord"

Mazarin raised himself upon his elbow, and, questioning by
look and gesture: "What do you mean by that? Am I worse than
I believe myself to be?"

"My lord," said Guenaud, seating himself beside the bed,
"your eminence has worked very hard during your life; your
eminence has suffered much."

"But I am not old, I fancy. The late M. de Richelieu was but
seventeen months younger than I am when he died, and died of
a mortal disease. I am young, Guenaud: remember, I am
scarcely fifty-two."

"Oh! my lord, you are much more than that. How long did the
Fronde last?"

"For what purpose do you put such a question to me?"

"For a medical calculation, monseigneur."

"Well, some ten years -- off and on."

"Very well, be kind enough to reckon every year of the
Fronde as three years -- that makes thirty; now twenty and
fifty-two makes seventy-two years. You are seventy-two, my
lord; and that is a great age."

Whilst saying this, he felt the pulse of his patient. This
pulse was full of such fatal indications, that the physician
continued, notwithstanding the interruptions of the patient:
"Put down the years of the Fronde at four each, and you have
lived eighty-two years."

"Are you speaking seriously, Guenaud?"

"Alas! yes, monseigneur."

"You take a roundabout way, then, to inform me that I am
very ill?"

"Ma foi! yes, my lord, and with a man of the mind and
courage of your eminence, it ought not to be necessary to
do."

The cardinal breathed with such difficulty that he inspired
pity even in a pitiless physician. "There are diseases and
diseases," resumed Mazarin. "From some of them people
escape."

"That is true, my lord."

"Is it not?" cried Mazarin, almost joyously; "for, in short,
what else would be the use of power, of strength of will?
What would the use of genius be -- your genius, Guenaud?
What would be the use of science and art, if the patient,
who disposes of all that, cannot be saved from peril?"

Guenaud was about to open his mouth, but Mazarin continued:

"Remember," said he, "I am the most confiding of your
patients; remember I obey you blindly, and that consequently
---- "

"I know all that," said Guenaud.

"I shall be cured, then?"

"Monseigneur, there is neither strength of will, nor power,
nor genius, nor science that can resist a disease which God
doubtless sends, or which He casts upon the earth at the
creation, with full power to destroy and kill mankind. When
the disease is mortal, it kills, and nothing can ---- "

"Is -- my -- disease -- mortal?" asked Mazarin.

"Yes, my lord."

His eminence sank down for a moment, like an unfortunate
wretch who is crushed by a falling column. But the spirit of
Mazarin was a strong one, or rather his mind was a firm one.
"Guenaud," said he, recovering from his first shock, "you
will permit me to appeal from your judgment. I will call
together the most learned men of Europe: I will consult
them. I will live, in short, by the virtue of I care not
what remedy."

"My lord must not suppose," said Guenaud, "that I have the
presumption to pronounce alone upon an existence so valuable
as yours. I have already assembled all the good physicians
and practitioners of France and Europe. There were twelve of
them."

"And they said ---- "

"They said that your eminence was suffering from a mortal
disease; I have the consultation signed in my portfolio. If
your eminence will please to see it, you will find the names
of all the incurable diseases we have met with. There is
first ---- "

"No, no!" cried Mazarin, pushing away the paper. "No, no,
Guenaud, I yield! I yield!" And a profound silence, during
which the cardinal resumed his senses and recovered his
strength, succeeded to the agitation of this scene. "There
is another thing," murmured Mazarin; "there are empirics and
charlatans. In my country, those whom physicians abandon run
the chance of a quack, who kills them ten times but saves
them a hundred times."

"Has not your eminence observed, that during the last month
I have changed my remedies ten times?"

"Yes. Well?"

"Well, I have spent fifty thousand crowns in purchasing the
secrets of all these fellows: the list is exhausted, and so
is my purse. You are not cured; and but for my art, you
would be dead."

"That ends it!" murmured the cardinal; "that ends it." And
he threw a melancholy look upon the riches which surrounded
him. "And must I quit all that?" sighed he. "I am dying,
Guenaud! I am dying!"

"Oh! not yet, my lord," said the physician.

Mazarin seized his hand. "In what time?" asked he, fixing
his two large eyes upon the impassible countenance of the
physician.

"My lord, we never tell that."

"To ordinary men, perhaps not; -- but to me -- to me, whose
every minute is worth a treasure. Tell me, Guenaud, tell
me!"

"No, no, my lord."

"I insist upon it, I tell you. Oh! give me a month and for
every one of those thirty days I will pay you a hundred
thousand crowns."

"My lord," replied Guenaud, in a firm voice, "it is God who
can give you days of grace, and not I. God only allows you a
fortnight."

The cardinal breathed a painful sigh, and sank back upon his
pillow, murmuring, "Thank you, Guenaud, thank you!"

The physician was about to depart; the dying man, raising
himself up: "Silence!" said he, with flaming eyes,
"silence!"

"My lord, I have known this secret two months; you see that
I have kept it faithfully."

"Go, Guenaud, I will take care of your fortunes, go and tell
Brienne to send me a clerk called M. Colbert. Go!"




CHAPTER 44

Colbert



Colbert was not far off. During the whole evening he had
remained in one of the corridors, chatting with Bernouin and
Brienne, and commenting, with the ordinary skill of people
of a court, upon the news which developed like air-bubbles
upon the water, on the surface of each event. It is
doubtless time to trace, in a few words, one of the most
interesting portraits of the age, and to trace it with as
much truth, perhaps, as contemporary painters have been able
to do. Colbert was a man in whom the historian and the
moralist have an equal right.

He was thirteen years older than Louis XIV., his future
master. Of middle height, rather lean than otherwise, he had
deep-set eyes, a mean appearance, his hair was coarse, black
and thin, which, say the biographers of his time, made him
take early to the skull-cap. A look of severity, or
harshness even, a sort of stiffness, which, with inferiors,
was pride, with superiors an affectation of superior virtue;
a surly cast of countenance upon all occasions, even when
looking at himself in a glass alone -- such is the exterior
of this personage. As to the moral part of his character,
the depth of his talent for accounts, and his ingenuity in
making sterility itself productive, were much boasted of.
Colbert had formed the idea of forcing governors of frontier
places to feed the garrisons without pay, with what they
drew from contributions. Such a valuable quality made
Mazarin think of replacing Joubert, his intendant, who had
recently died, by M. Colbert, who had such skill in nibbling
down allowances. Colbert by degrees crept into court,
notwithstanding his lowly birth, for he was the son of a man
who sold wine as his father had done, but who afterwards
sold cloth, and then silk stuffs. Colbert, destined for
trade, had been clerk in Lyons to a merchant, whom he had
quitted to come to Paris in the office of a Chatelet
procureur named Biterne. It was here he learned the art of
drawing up an account, and the much more valuable one of
complicating it.

This stiffness of manner in Colbert had been of great
service to him; it is so true that Fortune, when she has a
caprice, resembles those women of antiquity, who, when they
had a fancy, were disgusted by no physical or moral defects
in either men or things. Colbert, placed with Michel
Letellier, secretary of state in 1648, by his cousin
Colbert, Seigneur de Saint-Penange, who protected him,
received one day from the minister a commission for Cardinal
Mazarin. His eminence was then in the enjoyment of
flourishing health, and the bad years of the Fronde had not
yet counted triple and quadruple for him. He was at Sedan,
very much annoyed at a court intrigue in which Anne of
Austria seemed inclined to desert his cause.

Of this intrigue Letellier held the thread. He had just
received a letter from Anne of Austria, a letter very
valuable to him, and strongly compromising Mazarin; but, as
he already played the double part which served him so well,
and by which he always managed two enemies so as to draw
advantage from both, either by embroiling them more and more
or by reconciling them, Michel Letellier wished to send Anne
of Austria's letter to Mazarin, in order that he might be
acquainted with it, and consequently pleased with his having
so willingly rendered him a service. To send the letter was
an easy matter; to recover it again, after having
communicated it, that was the difficulty. Letellier cast his
eyes around him, and seeing the black and meager clerk with
the scowling brow, scribbling away in his office, he
preferred him to the best gendarme for the execution of this
design.

Colbert was commanded to set out for Sedan, with positive
orders to carry the letter to Mazarin, and bring it back to
Letellier. He listened to his orders with scrupulous
attention, required the instructions to be repeated twice,
and was particular in learning whether the bringing back was
as necessary as the communicating, and Letellier replied
sternly, "More necessary." Then he set out, traveled like a
courier, without any care for his body, and placed in the
hands of Mazarin, first a letter from Letellier, which
announced to the cardinal the sending of the precious
letter, and then that letter itself. Mazarin colored greatly
whilst reading Anne of Austria's letter, gave Colbert a
gracious smile and dismissed him.

"When shall I have the answer, monseigneur?"

"To-morrow."

"To-morrow morning?"

"Yes, monsieur."

The clerk turned upon his heel, after making his very best
bow. The next day he was at his post at seven o'clock.
Mazarin made him wait till ten. He remained patiently in the
ante-chamber; his turn having come, he entered; Mazarin gave
him a sealed packet. On the envelope of this packet were
these words: -- Monsieur Michel Letellier, etc. Colbert
looked at the packet with much attention; the cardinal put
on a pleasant countenance and pushed him towards the door.

"And the letter of the queen-mother, my lord?" asked
Colbert.

"It is with the rest, in the packet," said Mazarin.

"Oh! very well," replied Colbert, and placing his hat
between his knees, he began to unseal the packet.

Mazarin uttered a cry. "What are you doing?" said he,
angrily.

"I am unsealing the packet, my lord."

"You mistrust me, then, master pedant, do you? Did any one
ever see such impertinence?"

"Oh! my lord, do not be angry with me! It is certainly not
your eminence's word I place in doubt, God forbid!"

"What then?"

"It is the carefulness of your chancery, my lord. What is a
letter? A rag. May not a rag be forgotten? And look, my
lord, look if I was not right. Your clerks have forgotten
the rag; the letter is not in the packet."

"You are an insolent fellow, and you have not looked," cried
Mazarin, very angrily, "begone and wait my pleasure." Whilst
saying these words, with perfectly Italian subtlety he
snatched the packet from the hands of Colbert, and
re-entered his apartments.

But this anger could not last so long as not to be replaced
in time by reason. Mazarin, every morning, on opening his
closet door, found the figure of Colbert like a sentinel
behind the bench, and this disagreeable figure never failed
to ask him humbly, but with tenacity, for the queen-mother's
letter. Mazarin could hold out no longer, and was obliged to
give it up. He accompanied this restitution with a most
severe reprimand, during which Colbert contented himself
with examining, feeling, even smelling, as it were, the
paper, the characters, and the signature, neither more nor
less than if he had to deal with the greatest forger in the
kingdom. Mazarin behaved still more rudely to him, but
Colbert, still impassible, having obtained a certainty that
the letter was the true one, went off as if he had been
deaf. This conduct obtained for him afterwards the post of
Joubert; for Mazarin, instead of bearing malice, admired
him, and was desirous of attaching so much fidelity to
himself.

It may be judged by this single anecdote, what the character
of Colbert was. Events, developing themselves, by degrees
allowed all the powers of his mind to act freely. Colbert
was not long in insinuating himself into the good graces of
the cardinal: he became even indispensable to him. The clerk
was acquainted with all his accounts without the cardinal's
ever having spoken to him about them. This secret between
them was a powerful tie, and this was why, when about to
appear before the Master of another world, Mazarin was
desirous of taking good counsel in disposing of the wealth
he was so unwillingly obliged to leave in this world. After
the visit of Guenaud, he therefore sent for Colbert, desired
him to sit down. and said to him: "Let us converse, Monsieur
Colbert, and seriously, for I am very ill, and I may chance
to die."

"Man is mortal," replied Colbert.

"I have always remembered that, M. Colbert, and I have
worked with that end in view. You know that I have amassed a
little wealth."

"I know you have, monseigneur."

"At how much do you estimate, as near as you can, the amount
of this wealth, M. Colbert?"

"At forty millions, five hundred and sixty thousand, two
hundred livres, nine cents, eight farthings," replied
Colbert.

The cardinal heaved a deep sigh, and looked at Colbert with
wonder, but he allowed a smile to steal across his lips.

"Known money," added Colbert, in reply to that smile.

The cardinal gave quite a start in bed. "What do you mean by
that?" said he.

"I mean," said Colbert, "that besides those forty millions,
five hundred and sixty thousand, two hundred livres, nine
cents, eight farthings, there are thirteen millions that are
not known."

"Ouf!" sighed Mazarin, "what a man!"

At this moment the head of Bernouin appeared through the
embrasure of the door.

"What is it?" asked Mazarin, "and why do you disturb me?"

"The Theatin father, your eminence's director, was sent for
this evening; and he cannot come again to my lord till after
to-morrow."

Mazarin looked at Colbert, who rose and took his hat saying:
"I shall come again, my lord."

Mazarin hesitated. "No, no," said he; "I have as much
business to transact with you as with him. Besides, you are
my other confessor -- and what I have to say to one the
other may hear. Remain where you are, Colbert."

"But, my lord, if there be no secret of penitence, will the
director consent to my being here?"

"Do not trouble yourself about that; come into the ruelle."

"I can wait outside, monseigneur."

"No, no, it will do you good to hear the confession of a
rich man."

Colbert bowed and went into the ruelle.

"Introduce the Theatin father," said Mazarin, closing the
curtains.




CHAPTER 45

Confession of a Man of Wealth



The Theatin entered deliberately, without being too much
astonished at the noise and agitation which anxiety for the
cardinal's health had raised in his household. "Come in, my
reverend father," said Mazarin, after a last look at the
ruelle, "come in and console me."

"That is my duty, my lord," replied the Theatin.

"Begin by sitting down, and making yourself comfortable, for
I am going to begin with a general confession, you will
afterwards give me a good absolution, and I shall believe
myself more tranquil."

"My lord," said the father, "you are not so ill as to make a
general confession urgent -- and it will be very fatiguing
-- take care."

"You suspect then, that it may be long, father"

"How can I think it otherwise, when a man has lived so
completely as your eminence has done?"

"Ah! that is true! -- yes -- the recital may be long."

"The mercy of God is great," snuffled the Theatin.

"Stop," said Mazarin; "there I begin to terrify myself with
having allowed so many things to pass which the Lord might
reprove."

"Is not that always so?" said the Theatin naively, removing
further from the lamp his thin pointed face, like that of a
mole. "Sinners are so forgetful beforehand, and scrupulous
when it is too late."

"Sinners?" replied Mazarin. "Do you use that word
ironically, and to reproach me with all the genealogies I
have allowed to be made on my account -- I -- the son of a
fisherman, in fact?"*



*This is quite untranslatable -- it being a play upon the
words pecheur, a sinner, and pecheur, a fisherman. It is in
very bad taste. -- TRANS.



"Hum!" said the Theatin.

"That is a first sin, father; for I have allowed myself made
to descend from two old Roman consuls, S. Geganius Macerinus
1st, Macerinus 2d, and Proculus Macerinus 3d, of whom the
Chronicle of Haolander speaks. From Macerinus to Mazarin the
proximity was tempting. Macerinus, a diminutive, means
leanish, poorish, out of case. Oh! reverend father! Mazarini
may now be carried to the augmentative Maigre, thin as
Lazarus. Look! ' and he showed his fleshless arms.

"In your having been born of a family of fishermen I see
nothing injurious to you; for -- St. Peter was a fisherman;
and if you are a prince of the church, my lord, he was the
supreme head of it. Pass on, if you please."

"So much the more for my having threatened with the Bastile
a certain Bounet, a priest of Avignon, who wanted to publish
a genealogy of the Casa Mazarini much too marvelous."

"To be probable?" replied the Theatin.

"Oh! if I had acted up to his idea, father, that would have
been the vice of pride -- another sin."

"It was excess of wit, and a person is not to be reproached
with such sorts of abuses. Pass on, pass on!"

"I was all pride. Look you, father, I will endeavor to
divide that into capital sins."

"I like divisions, when well made."

"I am glad of that. You must know that in 1630 -- alas! that
is thirty-one years ago ---- "

"You were then twenty-nine years old, monseigneur."

"A hot-headed age. I was then something of a soldier, and I
threw myself at Casal into the arquebuscades, to show that I
rode on horseback as well as an officer. It is true, I
restored peace between the French and the Spaniards. That
redeems my sin a little."

"I see no sin in being able to ride well on horseback," said
the Theatin; "that is in perfect good taste, and does honor
to our gown. As a Christian, I approve of your having
prevented the effusion of blood; as a monk I am proud of the
bravery a monk has exhibited."

Mazarin bowed his head humbly. "Yes," said he, "but the
consequences?"

"What consequences?"

"Eh! that damned sin of pride has roots without end. From
the time that I threw myself in that manner between two
armies, that I had smelt powder and faced lines of soldiers,
I have held generals a little in contempt."

"Ah!" said the father.

"There is the evil; so that I have not found one endurable
since that time."

"The fact is," said the Theatin, "that the generals we have
had have not been remarkable."

"Oh!" cried Mazarin, "there was Monsieur le Prince. I have
tormented him thoroughly."

"He is not much to be pitied: he has acquired sufficient
glory, and sufficient wealth."

"That may be, for Monsieur le Prince; but M. Beaufort, for
example -- whom I held suffering so long in the dungeon of
Vincennes?"

"Ah! but he was a rebel, and the safety of the state
required that you should make a sacrifice. Pass on!"

"I believe I have exhausted pride. There is another sin
which I am afraid to qualify."

"I can qualify it myself. Tell it."

"A great sin, reverend father!"

"We shall judge, monseigneur."

"You cannot fail to have heard of certain relations which I
have had -- with her majesty the queen-mother; -- the
malevolent ---- "

"The malevolent, my lord, are fools. Was it not necessary
for the good of the state and the interests of the young
king, that you should live in good intelligence with the
queen? Pass on, pass on!"

"I assure you," said Mazarin, "you remove a terrible weight
from my breast."

"These are all trifles! -- look for something serious."

"I have had much ambition, father."

"That is the march of great minds and things, my lord."

"Even the longing for the tiara?"

"To be pope is to be the first of Christians. Why should you
not desire that?"

"It has been printed that, to gain that object, I had sold
Cambria to the Spaniards."

"You have, perhaps, yourself written pamphlets without
severely persecuting pamphleteers."

"Then, reverend father, I have truly a clean breast. I feel
nothing remaining but slight peccadilloes."

"What are they?"

"Play."

"That is rather worldly: but you were obliged by the duties
of greatness to keep a good house."

"I like to win."

"No player plays to lose."

"I cheated a little."

"You took your advantage. Pass on."

"Well! reverend father, I feel nothing else upon my
conscience. Give me absolution, and my soul will be able,
when God shall please to call it, to mount without obstacle
to the throne ---- "

The Theatin moved neither his arms nor his lips. "What are
you waiting for, father?" said Mazarin.

"I am waiting for the end."

"The end of what?"

"Of the confession, monsieur."

"But I have ended."

"Oh, no; your eminence is mistaken."

"Not that I know of."

"Search diligently."

"I have searched as well as possible."

"Then I shall assist your memory."

"Do."

The Theatin coughed several times. "You have said nothing of
avarice, another capital sin, nor of those millions," said
he.

"What millions, father?"

"Why, those you possess, my lord."

"Father, that money is mine, why should I speak to you about
that?"

"Because, see you, our opinions differ. You say that money
is yours, whilst I -- I believe it is rather the property of
others."

Mazarin lifted his cold hand to his brow, which was beaded
with perspiration. "How so?" stammered he.

"This way. Your excellency has gained much wealth -- in the
service of the king."

"Hum! much -- that is, not too much."

"Whatever it may be, whence came that wealth?

"From the state."

"The state, that is the king."

"But what do you conclude from that, father?" said Mazarin,
who began to tremble.

"I cannot conclude without seeing a list of the riches you
possess. Let us reckon a little, if you please. You have the
bishopric of Metz?"

"Yes."

"The abbeys of St. Clement, St. Arnould, and St. Vincent,
all at Metz?"

"Yes."

"You have the abbey of St. Denis, in France, a magnificent
property?"

"Yes, father."

"You have the abbey of Cluny, which is rich?"

"I have."

"That of St. Medard at Soissons, with a revenue of one
hundred thousand livres?"

"I cannot deny it."

"That of St. Victor, at Marseilles, -- one of the best in
the south?"

"Yes, father."

"A good million a year. With the emoluments of the
cardinalship and the ministry, I say too little when I say
two millions a year."

"Eh!"

"In ten years that is twenty millions, -- and twenty
millions put out at fifty per cent give, by progression,
twenty-three millions in ten years."

"How well you reckon for a Theatin!"

"Since your eminence placed our order in the convent we
occupy, near St. Germain des Pres, in 1641, I have kept the
accounts of the society."

"And mine likewise, apparently, father."

"One ought to know a little of everything, my lord."

"Very well. Conclude, at present."

"I conclude that your baggage is too heavy to allow you to
pass through the gates of Paradise."

"Shall I be damned?"

"If you do not make restitution, yes."

Mazarin uttered a piteous cry. "Restitution! -- but to whom,
good God?"

"To the owner of that money, -- to the king."

"But the king did not give it all to me."

"One moment, -- does not the king sign the ordonnances?"

Mazarin passed from sighs to groans. "Absolution!
absolution!" cried he.

"Impossible, my lord. Restitution! restitution!" replied the
Theatin.

"But you absolve me from all other sins, why not from that?"

"Because," replied the father, "to absolve you for that
motive would be a sin for which the king would never absolve
me, my lord."

Thereupon the confessor quitted his penitent with an air
full of compunction. He then went out in the same manner he
had entered.

"Oh, good God!" groaned the cardinal. "Come here, Colbert, I
am very, very ill indeed, my friend."




CHAPTER 46

The Donation



Colbert reappeared beneath the curtains.

"Have you heard?" said Mazarin.

"Alas! yes, my lord."

"Can he be right? Can all this money be badly acquired?"

"A Theatin, monseigneur, is a bad judge in matters of
finance," replied Colbert, coolly. "And yet it is very
possible that, according to his theological ideas, your
eminence has been, in a certain degree, in the wrong. People
generally find they have been so, -- when they die."

"In the first place, they commit the wrong of dying,
Colbert."

"That is true, my lord. Against whom, however, did the
Theatin make out that you had committed these wrongs?
Against the king?!"

Mazarin shrugged his shoulders. "As if I had not saved both
his state and his finances."

"That admits of no contradiction, my lord."

"Does it? Then I have received a merely legitimate salary,
in spite of the opinion of my confessor?"

"That is beyond doubt."

"And I might fairly keep for my own family, which is so
needy, a good fortune, -- the whole, even, of which I have
earned?"

"I see no impediment to that, monseigneur."

"I felt assured that in consulting you, Colbert, I should
have good advice," replied Mazarin, greatly delighted.

Colbert resumed his pedantic look. "My lord," interrupted
he, "I think it would be quite as well to examine whether
what the Theatin said is not a snare."

"Oh! no; a snare? What for? The Theatin is an honest man."

"He believed your eminence to be at death's door, because
your eminence consulted him. Did not I hear him say --
`Distinguish that which the king has given you from that
which you have given yourself.' Recollect, my lord, if he
did not say something a little like that to you? -- that is
quite a theatrical speech."

"That is possible."

"In which case, my lord, I should consider you as required
by the Theatin to ---- "

"To make restitution!" cried Mazarin, with great warmth.

"Eh! I do not say no."

"What, of all! You do not dream of such a thing! You speak
just as the confessor did."

"To make restitution of a part, -- that is to say, his
majesty's part; and that, monseigneur, may have its dangers.
Your eminence is too skillful a politician not to know that,
at this moment, the king does not possess a hundred and
fifty thousand livres clear in his coffers."

"That is not my affair," said Mazarin, triumphantly; "that
belongs to M. le Surintendant Fouquet, whose accounts I gave
you to verify some months ago."

Colbert bit his lips at the name of Fouquet. "His majesty,"
said he, between his teeth, "has no money but that which M.
Fouquet collects: your money, monseigneur, would afford him
a delicious banquet."

"Well, but I am not the superintendent of his majesty's
finances -- I have my purse -- surely I would do much for
his majesty's welfare -- some legacy -- but I cannot
disappoint my family."

"The legacy of a part would dishonor you and offend the
king. Leaving a part to his majesty is to avow that that
part has inspired you with doubts as to the lawfulness of
the means of acquisition."

"Monsieur Colbert!"

"I thought your eminence did me the honor to ask my advice?"

"Yes, but you are ignorant of the principal details of the
question."

"I am ignorant of nothing, my lord; during ten years, all
the columns of figures which are found in France have passed
in review before me, and if I have painfully nailed them
into my brain, they are there now so well riveted, that,
from the office of M. Letellier, who is sober, to the little
secret largesses of M. Fouquet, who is prodigal, I could
recite, figure by figure, all the money that is spent in
France from Marseilles to Cherbourg."

"Then, you would have me throw all my money into the coffers
of the king!" cried Mazarin, ironically; and from whom, at
the same time, the gout forced painful moans. "Surely the
king would reproach me with nothing, but he would laugh at
me, while squandering my millions, and with good reason."

"Your eminence has misunderstood me. I did not, the least in
the world, pretend that his majesty ought to spend your
money."

"You said so clearly, it seems to me, when you advised me to
give it to him."

"Ah," replied Colbert, "that is because your eminence,
absorbed as you are by your disease, entirely loses sight of
the character of Louis XIV."

"How so?"

"That character, if I may venture to express myself thus,
resembles that which my lord confessed just now to the
Theatin."

"Go on -- that is?"

"Pride! Pardon me, my lord, haughtiness, nobleness; kings
have no pride, that is a human passion."

"Pride, -- yes, you are right. Next?"

"Well, my lord, if I have divined rightly, your eminence has
but to give all your money to the king, and that
immediately."

"But for what?" said Mazarin, quite bewildered.

"Because the king will not accept of the whole."

"What, and he a young man, and devoured by ambition?"

"Just so."

"A young man who is anxious for my death ---- "

"My lord!"

"To inherit, yes, Colbert, yes; he is anxious for my death
in order to inherit. Triple fool that I am! I would prevent
him!"

"Exactly: if the donation were made in a certain form he
would refuse it."

"Well, but how?"

"That is plain enough. A young man who has yet done nothing
-- who burns to distinguish himself -- who burns to reign
alone, will never take anything ready built, he will
construct for himself. This prince, monseigneur, will never
be content with the Palais Royal, which M. de Richelieu left
him, nor with the Palais Mazarin, which you have had so
superbly constructed, nor with the Louvre, which his
ancestors inhabited; nor with St. Germain, where he was
born. All that does not proceed from himself, I predict, he
will disdain."

"And you will guarantee, that if I give my forty millions to
the king ---- "

"Saying certain things to him at the same time, I guarantee
he will refuse them."

"But those things -- what are they?"

"I will write them, if my lord will have the goodness to
dictate them."

"Well, but, after all, what advantage will that be to me?"

"An enormous one. Nobody will afterwards be able to accuse
your eminence of that unjust avarice with which pamphleteers
have reproached the most brilliant mind of the present age."

"You are right, Colbert, you are right; go, and seek the
king, on my part, and take him my will."

"Your donation, my lord."

"But, if he should accept it; if he should even think of
accepting it!"

"Then there would remain thirteen millions for your family,
and that is a good round sum."

"But then you would be either a fool or a traitor."

"And I am neither the one nor the other, my lord. You appear
to be much afraid that the king will accept; you have a deal
more reason to fear that he will not accept."

"But, see you, if he does not accept, I should like to
guarantee my thirteen reserved millions to him -- yes, I
will do so -- yes. But my pains are returning, I shall
faint. I am very, very ill, Colbert; I am very near my end!"

Colbert started. The cardinal was indeed very ill; large
drops of sweat flowed down upon his bed of agony, and the
frightful pallor of a face streaming with water was a
spectacle which the most hardened practitioner could not
have beheld without compassion. Colbert was, without doubt,
very much affected, for he quitted the chamber, calling
Bernouin to attend the dying man and went into the corridor.
There, walking about with a meditative expression, which
almost gave nobility to his vulgar head, his shoulders
thrown up, his neck stretched out, his lips half open, to
give vent to unconnected fragments of incoherent thoughts,
he lashed up his courage to the pitch of the undertaking
contemplated, whilst within ten paces of him, separated only
by a wall, his master was being stifled by anguish which
drew from him lamentable cries, thinking no more of the
treasures of the earth, or of the joys of Paradise, but much
of all the horrors of hell. Whilst burning-hot napkins,
physic, revulsives, and Guenaud, who was recalled, were
performing their functions with increased activity, Colbert,
holding his great head in both his hands, to compress within
it the fever of the projects engendered by the brain, was
meditating the tenor of the donation he would make Mazarin
write, at the first hour of respite his disease should
afford him. It would appear as if all the cries of the
cardinal, and all the attacks of death upon this
representative of the past, were stimulants for the genius
of this thinker with the bushy eyebrows, who was turning
already towards the rising sun of a regenerated society.
Colbert resumed his place at Mazarin's pillow at the first
interval of pain, and persuaded him to dictate a donation
thus conceived.



"About to appear before God, the Master of mankind, I beg
the king, who was my master on earth, to resume the wealth
which his bounty has bestowed upon me, and which my family
would be happy to see pass into such illustrious hands. The
particulars of my property will be found -- they are drawn
up -- at the first requisition of his majesty, or at the
last sigh of his most devoted servant,

Jules, Cardinal de Mazarin."



The cardinal sighed heavily as he signed this; Colbert
sealed the packet, and carried it immediately to the Louvre,
whither the king had returned.

He then went back to his own home, rubbing his hands with
the confidence of a workman who has done a good day's work.




CHAPTER 47

How Anne of Austria gave one Piece of Advice
to Louis XIV., and how M. Fouquet gave him another



The news of the extreme illness of the cardinal had already
spread, and attracted at least as much attention among the
people of the Louvre as the news of the marriage of
Monsieur, the king's brother, which had already been
announced as an official fact. Scarcely had Louis XIV.
returned home, with his thoughts fully occupied with the
various things he had seen and heard in the course of the
evening, when an usher announced that the same crowd of
courtiers who, in the morning, had thronged his lever,
presented themselves again at his coucher, a remarkable
piece of respect which, during the reign of the cardinal,
the court, not very discreet in its preferences, had
accorded to the minister, without caring about displeasing
the king.

But the minister had had, as we have said, an alarming
attack of gout, and the tide of flattery was mounting
towards the throne. Courtiers have a marvelous instinct in
scenting the turn of events; courtiers possess a supreme
kind of science; they are diplomatists in throwing light
upon the unraveling of complicated intrigues, captains in
divining the issue of battles, and physicians in curing the
sick. Louis XIV., to whom his mother had taught this axiom,
together with many others, understood at once that the
cardinal must be very ill.

Scarcely had Anne of Austria conducted the young queen to
her apartments and taken from her brow the head-dress of
ceremony, when she went to see her son in his cabinet,
where, alone, melancholy and depressed, he was indulging, as
if to exercise his will, in one of those terrible inward
passions -- king's passions -- which create events when they
break out, and with Louis XIV., thanks to his astonishing
command over himself, became such benign tempests, that his
most violent, his only passion, that which Saint Simon
mentions with astonishment, was that famous fit of anger
which he exhibited fifty years later, on the occasion of a
little concealment of the Duc de Maine's. and which had for
result a shower of blows inflicted with a cane upon the back
of a poor valet who had stolen a biscuit. The young king
then was, as we have seen, a prey to a double excitement;
and he said to himself as he looked in a glass, "O king! --
king by name, and not in fact; -- phantom, vain phantom art
thou! -- inert statue, which has no other power than that of
provoking salutations from courtiers, when wilt thou be able
to raise thy velvet arm, or clench thy silken hand? when
wilt thou be able to open, for any purpose but to sigh, or
smile, lips condemned to the motionless stupidity of the
marbles in thy gallery?"

Then, passing his hand over his brow, and feeling the want
of air, he approached a window, and looking down, saw below
some horsemen talking together, and groups of timid
observers. These horsemen were a fraction of the watch: the
groups were busy portions of the people, to whom a king is
always a curious thing, the same as a rhinoceros, a
crocodile, or a serpent. He struck his brow with his open
hand, crying, -- "King of France! what title! People of
France! what a heap of creatures! I have just returned to my
Louvre; my horses, just unharnessed, are still smoking, and
I have created interest enough to induce scarcely twenty
persons to look at me as I passed. Twenty! what do I say?
no; there were not twenty anxious to see the king of France.
There are not even ten archers to guard my place of
residence: archers, people, guards, all are at the Palais
Royal! Why, my good God! have not I, the king, the right to
ask of you all that?"

"Because," said a voice, replying to his, and which sounded
from the other side of the door of the cabinet, "because at
the Palais Royal lies all the gold, -- that is to say, all
the power of him who desires to reign."

Louis turned sharply round. The voice which had pronounced
these words was that of Anne of Austria. The king started,
and advanced towards her. "I hope," said he, "your majesty
has paid no attention to the vain declamations which the
solitude and disgust familiar to kings suggest to the
happiest dispositions?"

"I only paid attention to one thing, my son, and that was,
that you were complaining."

"Who! I? Not at all," said Louis XIV.; "no, in truth, you
err, madame."

"What were you doing, then?"

"I thought I was under the ferule of my professor, and
developing a subject of amplification."

"My son," replied Anne of Austria, shaking her head, "you
are wrong not to trust my word; you are wrong not to grant
me your confidence. A day will come, and perhaps quickly,
wherein you will have occasion to remember that axiom: --
`Gold is universal power; and they alone are kings who are
all-powerful.'"

"Your intention," continued the king, "was not, however, to
cast blame upon the rich men of this age, was it?

"No," said the queen, warmly; "no, sire; they who are rich
in this age, under your reign, are rich because you have
been willing they should be so, and I entertain against them
neither malice nor envy; they have, without doubt, served
your majesty sufficiently well for your majesty to have
permitted them to reward themselves. That is what I mean to
say by the words for which you reproach me."

"God forbid, madame, that I should ever reproach my mother
with anything!"

"Besides," continued Anne of Austria, "the Lord never gives
the goods of this world but for a season; the Lord -- as
correctives to honor and riches -- the Lord has placed
sufferings, sickness, and death; and no one," added she,
with a melancholy smile, which proved she made the
application of the funeral precept to herself, "no man can
take his wealth or greatness with him to the grave. It
results, therefore, that the young gather the abundant
harvest prepared for them by the old."

Louis listened with increased attention to the words which
Anne of Austria, no doubt, pronounced with a view to console
him. "Madame," said he, looking earnestly at his mother,
"one would almost say in truth that you had something else
to announce to me."

"I have absolutely nothing, my son; only you cannot have
failed to remark that his eminence the cardinal is very
ill."

Louis looked at his mother, expecting some emotion in her
voice, some sorrow in her countenance. The face of Anne of
Austria appeared a little changed, but that was from
sufferings of quite a personal character. Perhaps the
alteration was caused by the cancer which had begun to
consume her breast. "Yes, madame," said the king; "yes, M.
de Mazarin is very ill."

"And it would be a great loss to the kingdom if God were to
summon his eminence away. Is not that your opinion as well
as mine, my son?" said the queen.

"Yes, madame; yes, certainly, it would be a great loss for
the kingdom," said Louis, coloring; "but the peril does not
seem to me to be so great; besides, the cardinal is still
young." The king had scarcely ceased speaking when an usher
lifted the tapestry, and stood with a paper in his hand,
waiting for the king to speak to him.

"What have you there?" asked the king.

"A message from M. de Mazarin," replied the usher.

"Give it to me," said the king; and he took the paper. But
at the moment he was about to open it, there was a great
noise in the gallery, the ante-chamber, and the court.

"Ah, ah," said Louis XIV., who doubtless knew the meaning of
that triple noise. "How could I say there was but one king
in France! I was mistaken, there are two."

As he spoke or thought thus, the door opened, and the
superintendent of the finances, Fouquet, appeared before his
nominal master. It was he who made the noise in the
ante-chamber, it was his horses that made the noise in the
courtyard. In addition to all this, a loud murmur was heard
along his passage, which did not die away till some time
after he had passed. It was this murmur which Louis XIV.
regretted so deeply not hearing as he passed, and dying away
behind him.

"He is not precisely a king, as you fancy," said Anne of
Austria to her son; "he is only a man who is much too rich
-- that is all."

Whilst saying these words, a bitter feeling gave to these
words of the queen a most hateful expression; whereas the
brow of the king, calm and self-possessed, on the contrary,
was without the slightest wrinkle. He nodded, therefore,
familiarly to Fouquet, whilst he continued to unfold the
paper given to him by the usher. Fouquet perceived this
movement, and with a politeness at once easy and respectful,
advanced towards the queen, so as not to disturb the king.
Louis had opened the paper, and yet he did not read it. He
listened to Fouquet paying the most charming compliments to
the queen upon her hand and arm. Anne of Austria's frown
relaxed a little, she even almost smiled. Fouquet perceived
that the king, instead of reading, was looking at him; he
turned half round, therefore, and while continuing his
conversation with the queen, faced the king.

"You know, Monsieur Fouquet," said Louis, "how ill M.
Mazarin is?"

"Yes, sire, I know that," said Fouquet; "in fact, he is very
ill. I was at my country-house of Vaux when the news reached
me; and the affair seemed so pressing that I left at once."

"You left Vaux this evening, monsieur?"

"An hour and a half ago, yes, your majesty," said Fouquet,
consulting a watch, richly ornamented with diamonds.

"An hour and a half!" said the king, still able to restrain
his anger, but not to conceal his astonishment.

"I understand you, sire. Your majesty doubts my word, and
you have reason to do so, but I have really come in that
time, though it is wonderful! I received from England three
pairs of very fast horses, as I had been assured. They were
placed at distances of four leagues apart, and I tried them
this evening. They really brought me from Vaux to the Louvre
in an hour and a half, so your majesty sees I have not been
cheated." The queen-mother smiled with something like secret
envy. But Fouquet caught her thought. "Thus, madame," he
promptly said, "such horses are made for kings, not for
subjects; for kings ought never to yield to any one in
anything."

The king looked up.

"And yet," interrupted Anne of Austria, "you are not a king,
that I know of, M. Fouquet."

"Truly not, madame; therefore the horses only await the
orders of his majesty to enter the royal stables; and if I
allowed myself to try them, it was only for fear of offering
to the king anything that was not positively wonderful."

The king became quite red.

"You know, Monsieur Fouquet," said the queen, "that at the
court of France it is not the custom for a subject to offer
anything to his king."

Louis started.

"I hoped, madame," said Fouquet, much agitated, "that my
love for his majesty, my incessant desire to please him,
would serve to compensate the want of etiquette. It was not
so much a present that I permitted myself to offer, as the
tribute I paid."

"Thank you, Monsieur Fouquet," said the king politely, "and
I am gratified by your intention, for I love good horses;
but you know I am not very rich; you, who are my
superintendent of finances, know it better than any one
else. I am not able, then, however willing I may be, to
purchase such a valuable set of horses."

Fouquet darted a haughty glance at the queen-mother, who
appeared to triumph at the false position in which the
minister had placed himself, and replied: --

"Luxury is the virtue of kings, sire: it is luxury which
makes them resemble God: it is by luxury they are more than
other men. With luxury a king nourishes his subjects, and
honors them. Under the mild heat of this luxury of kings
springs the luxury of individuals, a source of riches for
the people. His majesty, by accepting the gift of these six
incomparable horses, would stimulate the pride of his own
breeders, of Limousin, Perche, and Normandy, and this
emulation would have been beneficial to all. But the king is
silent, and consequently I am condemned."

During this speech, Louis was, unconsciously, folding and
unfolding Mazarin's paper, upon which he had not cast his
eyes. At length he glanced upon it, and uttered a faint cry
at reading the first line.

"What is the matter, my son?" asked the queen, anxiously,
and going towards the king.

"From the cardinal," replied the king, continuing to read;
"yes, yes, it is really from him."

"Is he worse, then?"

"Read!" said the king, passing the parchment to his mother,
as if he thought that nothing less than reading would
convince Anne of Austria of a thing so astonishing as was
conveyed in that paper.

Anne of Austria read in turn, and as she read, her eyes
sparkled with a joy all the greater from her useless
endeavor to hide it, which attracted the attention of
Fouquet.

"Oh! a regularly drawn up deed of gift," said she.

"A gift?" repeated Fouquet.

"Yes," said the king, replying pointedly to the
superintendent of finances, "yes, at the point of death,
monsieur le cardinal makes me a donation of all his wealth."

"Forty millions," cried the queen. "Oh, my son! this is very
noble on the part of his eminence, and will silence all
malicious rumors; forty millions scraped together slowly,
coming back all in one heap to the treasury! It is the act
of a faithful subject and a good Christian." And having once
more cast her eyes over the act, she restored it to Louis
XIV., whom the announcement of the sum greatly agitated.
Fouquet had taken some steps backwards and remained silent.
The king looked at him, and held the paper out to him, in
turn. The superintendent only bestowed a haughty look of a
second upon it; then bowing, -- "Yes, sire," said he, "a
donation, I see."

"You must reply to it, my son," said Anne of Austria; "you
must reply to it, and immediately."

"But how, madame?"

"By a visit to the cardinal."

"Why, it is but an hour since I left his eminence," said the
king.

"Write, then, sire."

"Write!" said the young king, with evident repugnance.

"Well!" replied Anne of Austria, "it seems to me, my son,
that a man who has just made such a present has a good right
to expect to be thanked for it with some degree of
promptitude." Then turning towards Fouquet: "Is not that
likewise your opinion, monsieur?"

"That the present is worth the trouble? Yes madame," said
Fouquet, with a lofty air that did not escape the king.

"Accept, then, and thank him," insisted Anne of Austria.

"What says M. Fouquet?" asked Louis XIV.

"Does your majesty wish to know my opinion?"

"Yes."

"Thank him, sire ---- "

"Ah!" said the queen.

"But do not accept," continued Fouquet.

"And why not?" asked the queen.

"You have yourself said why, madame," replied Fouquet;
"because kings cannot and ought not to receive presents from
their subjects."

The king remained silent between these two contrary
opinions.

"But forty millions!" said Anne of Austria, in the same tone
as that in which, at a later period, poor Marie Antoinette
replied, "You will tell me as much!"

"I know," said Fouquet, laughing, "forty millions makes a
good round sum, -- such a sum as could almost tempt a royal
conscience."

"But monsieur," said Anne of Austria, "instead of persuading
the king not to receive this present, recall to his
majesty's mind, you, whose duty it is, that these forty
millions are a fortune to him."

"It is precisely, madame, because these forty millions would
be a fortune that I will say to the king, `Sire, if it be
not decent for a king to accept from a subject six horses,
worth twenty thousand livres, it would be disgraceful for
him to owe a fortune to another subject, more or less
scrupulous in the choice of the materials which contributed
to the building up of that fortune.'"

"It ill becomes you, monsieur, to give your king a lesson,"
said Anne of Austria; "better procure for him forty millions
to replace those you make him lose."

"The king shall have them whenever he wishes," said the
superintendent of finances, bowing.

"Yes, by oppressing the people," said the queen.

"And were they not oppressed, madame," replied Fouquet,
"when they were made to sweat the forty millions given by
this deed? Furthermore, his majesty has asked my opinion, I
have given it; if his majesty ask my concurrence, it will be
the same."

"Nonsense! accept, my son, accept," said Anne of Austria.
"You are above reports and interpretations."

"Refuse, sire," said Fouquet. "As long as a king lives, he
has no other measure but his conscience, -- no other judge
than his own desires; but when dead, he has posterity, which
applauds or accuses."

"Thank you, mother," replied Louis, bowing respectfully to
the queen. "Thank you, Monsieur Fouquet," said he,
dismissing the superintendent civilly.

"Do you accept?" asked Anne of Austria, once more.

"I shall consider of it," replied he, looking at Fouquet.




CHAPTER 48

Agony



The day that the deed of gift had been sent to the king, the
cardinal caused himself to be transported to Vincennes. The
king and the court followed him thither. The last flashes of
this torch still cast splendor enough around to absorb all
other lights in its rays. Besides, as it has been seen, the
faithful satellite of his minister, young Louis XIV.,
marched to the last minute in accordance with his
gravitation. The disease, as Guenaud had predicted, had
become worse; it was no longer an attack of gout, it was an
attack of death; then there was another thing which made
that agony more agonizing still, -- and that was the
agitation brought into his mind by the donation he had sent
to the king, and which, according to Colbert, the king ought
to send back unaccepted to the cardinal. The cardinal had,
as we have said, great faith in the predictions of his
secretary; but the sum was a large one, and whatever might
be the genius of Colbert, from time to time the cardinal
thought to himself that the Theatin also might possibly have
been mistaken, and that there was at least as much chance of
his not being damned, as there was of Louis XIV. sending
back his millions.

Besides, the longer the donation was in coming back, the
more Mazarin thought that forty millions were worth a little
risk, particularly of so hypothetic a thing as the soul.
Mazarin, in his character of cardinal and prime minister,
was almost an atheist, and quite a materialist. Every time
that the door opened, he turned sharply round towards that
door, expecting to see the return of his unfortunate
donation; then, deceived in his hope, he fell back again
with a sigh, and found his pains so much the greater for
having forgotten them for an instant.

Anne of Austria had also followed the cardinal; her heart,
though age had made it selfish, could not help evincing
towards the dying man a sorrow which she owed him as a wife,
according to some; and as a sovereign, according to others.
She had, in some sort, put on a mourning countenance
beforehand, and all the court wore it as she did.

Louis, in order not to show on his face what was passing at
the bottom of his heart, persisted in remaining in his own
apartments, where his nurse alone kept him company; the more
he saw the approach of the time when all constraint would be
at an end, the more humble and patient he was, falling back
upon himself, as all strong men do when they form great
designs, in order to gain more spring at the decisive
moment. Extreme unction had been administered to the
cardinal, who, faithful to his habits of dissimulation,
struggled against appearances, and even against reality,
receiving company in his bed, as if he only suffered from a
temporary complaint.

Guenaud, on his part, preserved profound secrecy; wearied
with visits and questions, he answered nothing but "his
eminence is still full of youth and strength, but God wills
that which He wills, and when He has decided that man is to
be laid low, he will be laid low." These words, which he
scattered with a sort of discretion, reserve, and
preference, were commented upon earnestly by two persons, --
the king and the cardinal. Mazarin, notwithstanding the
prophecy of Guenaud, still lured himself with a hope, or
rather played his part so well, that the most cunning, when
saying that he lured himself, proved that they were his
dupes.

Louis, absent from the cardinal for two days; Louis with his
eyes fixed upon that same donation which so constantly
preoccupied the cardinal; Louis did not exactly know how to
make out Mazarin's conduct. The son of Louis XIII.,
following the paternal traditions, had, up to that time,
been so little of a king that, whilst ardently desiring
royalty, he desired it with that terror which always
accompanies the unknown. Thus, having formed his resolution,
which, besides, he communicated to nobody, he determined to
have an interview with Mazarin. It was Anne of Austria, who,
constant in her attendance upon the cardinal, first heard
this proposition of the king's, and transmitted it to the
dying man, whom it greatly agitated. For what purpose could
Louis wish for an interview? Was it to return the deed, as
Colbert had said he would? Was it to keep it, after thanking
him, as Mazarin thought he would? Nevertheless, as the dying
man felt that the uncertainty increased his torments, he did
not hesitate an instant.

"His majesty will be welcome, -- yes, very welcome," cried
he, making a sign to Colbert, who was seated at the foot of
the bed, and which the latter understood perfectly.
"Madame," continued Mazarin, "will your majesty be good
enough to assure the king yourself of the truth of what I
have just said?"

Anne of Austria rose; she herself was anxious to have the
question of the forty millions settled -- the question which
seemed to lie heavy on the mind of every one. Anne of
Austria went out; Mazarin made a great effort, and, raising
himself up towards Colbert: "Well, Colbert," said he, "two
days have passed away -- two mortal days -- and, you see,
nothing has been returned from yonder."

"Patience, my lord," said Colbert.

"Are you mad, you wretch? You advise me to have patience!
Oh, in sad truth, Colbert, you are laughing at me. I am
dying, and you call out to me to wait!"

"My lord," said Colbert, with his habitual coolness, "it is
impossible that things should not come out as I have said.
His majesty is coming to see you, and no doubt he brings
back the deed himself."

"Do you think so? Well, I, on the contrary, am sure that his
majesty is coming to thank me."

At this moment Anne of Austria returned. On her way to the
apartments of her son she had met with a new empiric. This
was a powder which was said to have power to save the
cardinal; and she brought a portion of this powder with her.
But this was not what Mazarin expected; therefore he would
not even look at it, declaring that life was not worth the
pains that were taken to preserve it. But, whilst professing
this philosophical axiom, his long-confined secret escaped
him at last.

"That, madame," said he, "that is not the interesting part
of my situation. I made, two days ago, a little donation to
the king; up to this time, from delicacy, no doubt, his
majesty has not condescended to say anything about it; but
the time for explanation is come, and I implore your majesty
to tell me if the king has made up his mind on that matter."

Anne of Austria was about to reply, when Mazarin stopped
her.

"The truth, madame," said he -- "in the name of Heaven, the
truth! Do not flatter a dying man with a hope that may prove
vain." There he stopped, a look from Colbert telling him
that he was on a wrong tack.

"I know," said Anne of Austria, taking the cardinal's hand,
"I know that you have generously made, not a little
donation, as you modestly call it, but a magnificent gift. I
know how painful it would be to you if the king ---- "

Mazarin listened, dying as he was, as ten living men could
not have listened.

"If the king ---- " replied he.

"If the king," continued Anne of Austria, "should not freely
accept what you offer so nobly."

Mazarin allowed himself to sink back upon his pillow like
Pantaloon; that is to say, with all the despair of a man who
bows before the tempest; but he still preserved sufficient
strength and presence of mind to cast upon Colbert one of
those looks which are well worth ten sonnets, which is to
say, ten long poems.

"Should you not," added the queen, "have considered the
refusal of the king as a sort of insult?" Mazarin rolled his
head about upon his pillow, without articulating a syllable.
The queen was deceived, or feigned to be deceived, by this
demonstration.

"Therefore," resumed she, "I have circumvented him with good
counsels; and as certain minds, jealous, no doubt, of the
glory you are about to acquire by this generosity, have
endeavored to prove to the king that he ought not to accept
this donation, I have struggled in your favor, and so well
have I struggled, that you will not have, I hope, that
distress to undergo."

"Ah!" murmured Mazarin, with languishing eyes, "ah! that is
a service I shall never forget for a single minute of the
few hours I still have to live."

"I must admit," continued the queen, "that it was not
without trouble I rendered it to your eminence."

"Ah, peste! I believe that. Oh! oh!"

"Good God! what is the matter?"

"I am burning!"

"Do you suffer much?"

"As much as one of the damned."

Colbert would have liked to sink through the floor.

"So, then," resumed Mazarin, "your majesty thinks that the
king ---- "he stopped several seconds -- "that the king is
coming here to offer me some small thanks?"

"I think so," said the queen. Mazarin annihilated Colbert
with his last look.

At that moment the ushers announced that the king was in the
ante-chambers, which were filled with people. This
announcement produced a stir of which Colbert took advantage
to escape by the door of the ruelle. Anne of Austria arose,
and awaited her son, standing. Louis IV. appeared at the
threshold of the door, with his eyes fixed upon the dying
man, who did not even think it worth while to notice that
majesty from whom he thought he had nothing more to expect.
An usher placed an armchair close to the bed. Louis bowed to
his mother, then to the cardinal, and sat down. The queen
took a seat in her turn.

Then, as the king looked behind him, the usher understood
that look and made a sign to the courtiers who filled up the
doorway to go out, which they instantly did. Silence fell
upon the chamber with the velvet curtains. The king, still
very young, and very timid in the presence of him who had
been his master from his birth, still respected him much,
particularly now, in the supreme majesty of death. He did
not dare, therefore, to begin the conversation, feeling that
every word must have its weight not only upon things of this
world, but of the next. As to the cardinal, at that moment
he had but one thought -- his donation. It was not physical
pain which gave him that air of despondency, and that
lugubrious look; it was the expectation of the thanks that
were about to issue from the king's mouth, and cut off all
hope of restitution. Mazarin was the first to break the
silence. "Is your majesty come to make any stay at
Vincennes?" said he.

Louis made an affirmative sign with his head.

"That is a gracious favor," continued Mazarin, "granted to a
dying man, and which will render death less painful to him."

"I hope," replied the king, "I am come to visit, not a dying
man, but a sick man, susceptible of cure."

Mazarin replied by a movement of the head.

"Your majesty is very kind; but I know more than you on that
subject. The last visit, sire," said he, "the last visit."

"If it were so, monsieur le cardinal," said Louis, "I would
come a last time to ask the counsels of a guide to whom I
owe everything."

Anne of Austria was a woman; she could not restrain her
tears. Louis showed himself much affected, and Mazarin still
more than his two guests, but from very different motives.
Here the silence returned. The queen wiped her eyes, and the
king resumed his firmness.

"I was saying," continued the king, "that I owed much to
your eminence." The eyes of the cardinal devoured the king,
for he felt the great moment had come. "And," continued
Louis, "the principal object of my visit was to offer you
very sincere thanks for the last evidence of friendship you
have kindly sent me."

The cheeks of the cardinal became sunken, his lips partially
opened, and the most lamentable sigh he had ever uttered was
about to issue from his chest.

"Sire," said he, "I shall have despoiled my poor family; I
shall have ruined all who belong to me, which may be imputed
to me as an error; but, at least, it shall not be said of me
that I have refused to sacrifice everything to my king."

Anne of Austria's tears flowed afresh.

"My dear Monsieur Mazarin," said the king, in a more serious
tone than might have been expected from his youth, "you have
misunderstood me, apparently."

Mazarin raised himself upon his elbow.

"I have no purpose to despoil your dear family, nor to ruin
your servants. Oh, no, that must never be!"

"Humph!" thought Mazarin, "he is going to restore me some
scraps; let us get the largest piece we can."

"The king is going to be foolishly affected and play the
generous," thought the queen; "he must not be allowed to
impoverish himself; such an opportunity for getting a
fortune will never occur again."

"Sire," said the cardinal, aloud, "my family is very
numerous, and my nieces will be destitute when I am gone."

"Oh," interrupted the queen, eagerly, "have no uneasiness
with respect to your family, dear Monsieur Mazarin; we have
no friends dearer than your friends; your nieces shall be my
children, the sisters of his majesty; and if a favor be
distributed in France, it shall be to those you love."

"Smoke!" thought Mazarin, who knew better than any one the
faith that can be put in the promises of kings. Louis read
the dying man's thought in his face.

"Be comforted, my dear Monsieur Mazarin," said he, with a
half-smile, sad beneath its irony; "the Mesdemoiselles de
Mancini will lose, in losing you, their most precious good;
but they shall none the less be the richest heiresses of
France; and since you have been kind enough to give me their
dowry" -- the cardinal was panting -- "I restore it to
them," continued Louis, drawing from his breast and holding
towards the cardinal's bed the parchment which contained the
donation that, during two days, had kept alive such tempests
in the mind of Mazarin.

"What did I tell you, my lord?" murmured in the alcove a
voice which passed away like a breath.

"Your majesty returns my donation!" cried Mazarin, so
disturbed by joy as to forget his character of a benefactor.

"Your majesty rejects the forty millions!" cried Anne of
Austria, so stupefied as to forget her character of an
afflicted wife, or queen.

"Yes, my lord cardinal; yes, madame," replied Louis XIV.,
tearing the parchment which Mazarin had not yet ventured to
clutch; "yes, I annihilate this deed, which despoiled a
whole family. The wealth acquired by his eminence in my
service is his own wealth and not mine."

"But, sire, does your majesty reflect," said Anne of
Austria, "that you have not ten thousand crowns in your
coffers?"

"Madame, I have just performed my first royal action, and I
hope it will worthily inaugurate my reign."

"Ah! sire, you are right!" cried Mazarin; "that is truly
great -- that is truly generous which you have just done."
And he looked, one after the other, at the pieces of the act
spread over his bed, to assure himself that it was the
original and not a copy that had been torn. At length his
eyes fell upon the fragment which bore his signature, and
recognizing it, he sunk back on his bolster in a swoon. Anne
of Austria, without strength to conceal her regret, raised
her hands and eyes toward heaven.

"Oh! sire," cried Mazarin, "may you be blessed! My God! May
you be beloved by all my family. Per Baccho! If ever any of
those belonging to me should cause your displeasure, sire,
only frown, and I will rise from my tomb!"

This pantalonnade did not produce all the effect Mazarin had
counted upon. Louis had already passed to considerations of
a higher nature, and as to Anne of Austria, unable to bear,
without abandoning herself to the anger she felt burning
within her, the magnanimity of her son and the hypocrisy of
the cardinal, she arose and left the chamber, heedless of
thus betraying the extent of her grief. Mazarin saw all
this, and fearing that Louis XIV. might repent his decision,
in order to draw attention another way he began to cry out,
as, at a later period, Scapin was to cry out, in that
sublime piece of pleasantry with which the morose and
grumbling Boileau dared to reproach Moliere. His cries,
however, by degrees, became fainter; and when Anne of
Austria left the apartment, they ceased altogether.

"Monsieur le cardinal," said the king, "have you any
recommendations to make to me?"

"Sire," replied Mazarin, "you are already wisdom itself,
prudence personified; of your generosity I shall not venture
to speak; that which you have just done exceeds all that the
most generous men of antiquity or of modern times have ever
done."

The king received this praise coldly.

"So you confine yourself," said he, "to your thanks -- and
your experience, much more extensive than my wisdom, my
prudence, or my generosity, does not furnish you with a
single piece of friendly advice to guide my future."

Mazarin reflected for a moment. "You have just done much for
me, sire," said he, "that is, for my family."

"Say no more about that," said the king.

"Well!" continued Mazarin, "I shall give you something in
exchange for these forty millions you have refused so
royally."

Louis XIV. indicated by a movement that these flatteries
were displeasing to him. "I shall give you a piece of
advice," continued Mazarin; "yes, a piece of advice --
advice more precious than the forty millions."

"My lord cardinal!" interrupted Louis.

"Sire, listen to this advice."

"I am listening."

"Come nearer, sire, for I am weak! -- nearer, sire, nearer!"

The king bent over the dying man. "Sire," said Mazarin, in
so low a tone that the breath of his words arrived only like
a recommendation from the tomb in the attentive ears of the
king -- "Sire, never have a prime minister."

Louis drew back astonished. The advice was a confession -- a
treasure, in fact, was that sincere confession of Mazarin.
The legacy of the cardinal to the young king was composed of
six words only, but those six words, as Mazarin had said,
were worth forty millions. Louis remained for an instant
bewildered. As for Mazarin, he appeared only to have said
something quite natural. A little scratching was heard along
the curtains of the alcove. Mazarin understood: "Yes, yes!"
cried he warmly, "yes, sire, I recommend to you a wise man,
an honest man, and a clever man."

"Tell me his name, my lord."

"His name is yet almost unknown, sire; it is M. Colbert, my
attendant. Oh! try him," added Mazarin, in an earnest voice;
"all that he has predicted has come to pass, he has a safe
glance, he is never mistaken either in things or in men --
which is more surprising still. Sire, I owe you much, but I
think I acquit myself of all towards you in giving you M.
Colbert."

"So be it," said Louis, faintly, for, as Mazarin had said,
the name of Colbert was quite unknown to him, and he thought
the enthusiasm of the cardinal partook of the delirium of a
dying man. The cardinal sank back on his pillows.

"For the present, adieu, sire! adieu," murmured Mazarin. "I
am tired, and I have yet a rough journey to take before I
present myself to my new Master. Adieu, sire!"

The young king felt the tears rise to his eyes; he bent over
the dying man, already half a corpse, and then hastily
retired.




CHAPTER 49

The First Appearance of Colbert



The whole night was passed in anguish, common to the dying
man and to the king: the dying man expected his deliverance,
the king awaited his liberty. Louis did not go to bed. An
hour after leaving the chamber of the cardinal, he learned
that the dying man, recovering a little strength, had
insisted upon being dressed, adorned and painted, and seeing
the ambassadors. Like Augustus, he no doubt considered the
world a great stage, and was desirous of playing out the
last act of the comedy. Anne of Austria reappeared no more
in the cardinal's apartments; she had nothing more to do
there. Propriety was the pretext for her absence. On his
part, the cardinal did not ask for her: the advice the queen
had given her son rankled in his heart.

Towards midnight, while still painted, Mazarin's mortal
agony came on. He had revised his will, and as this will was
the exact expression of his wishes, and as he feared that
some interested influence might take advantage of his
weakness to make him change something in it, he had given
orders to Colbert, who walked up and down the corridor which
led to the cardinal's bed-chamber, like the most vigilant of
sentinels. The king, shut up in his own apartment,
dispatched his nurse every hour to Mazarin's chamber, with
orders to bring him back the exact bulletin of the
cardinal's state. After having heard that Mazarin was
dressed, painted, and had seen the ambassadors, Louis heard
that the prayers for the dying were being read for the
cardinal. At one o'clock in the morning, Guenaud had
administered the last remedy. This was a relic of the old
customs of that fencing time, which was about to disappear
to give place to another time, to believe that death could
be kept off by some good secret thrust. Mazarin, after
having taken the remedy, respired freely for nearly ten
minutes. He immediately gave orders that the news should be
spread everywhere of a fortunate crisis. The king, on
learning this, felt as if a cold sweat were passing over his
brow; -- he had had a glimpse of the light of liberty;
slavery appeared to him more dark and less acceptable than
ever. But the bulletin which followed entirely changed the
face of things. Mazarin could no longer breathe at all, and
could scarcely follow the prayers which the cure of
Saint-Nicholas-des-Champs recited near him. The king resumed
his agitated walk about his chamber, and consulted, as he
walked, several papers drawn from a casket of which he alone
had the key. A third time the nurse returned. M. de Mazarin
had just uttered a joke, and had ordered his "Flora," by
Titian, to be revarnished. At length, towards two o'clock in
the morning, the king could no longer resist his weariness:
he had not slept for twenty-four hours. Sleep, so powerful
at his age, overcame him for about an hour. But he did not
go to bed for that hour, he slept in a fauteuil. About four
o'clock his nurse awoke him by entering the room.

"Well?" asked the king.

"Well, my dear sire," said the nurse, clasping her hands
with an air of commiseration. "Well, he is dead!"

The king arose at a bound, as if a steel spring had been
applied to his legs. "Dead!" cried he.

"Alas! yes."

"Is it quite certain?"

"Yes."

"Official?"

"Yes."

"Has the news been made public?"

"Not yet."

"Who told you, then, that the cardinal was dead?"

"M. Colbert."

"M. Colbert?"

"Yes."

"And was he sure of what he said?"

"He came out of the chamber, and had held a glass for some
minutes before the cardinal's lips."

"Ah!" said the king. "And what is become of M. Colbert?"

"He has just left his eminence's chamber."

"Where is he?"

"He followed me."

"So that he is ---- "

"Sire, waiting at your door, till it shall be your good
pleasure to receive him."

Louis ran to the door, opened it himself, and perceived
Colbert standing waiting in the passage. The king started at
sight of this statue, all clothed in black. Colbert, bowing
with profound respect, advanced two steps towards his
majesty. Louis re-entered his chamber, making Colbert a sign
to follow. Colbert entered; Louis dismissed the nurse, who
closed the door as she went out. Colbert remained modestly
standing near that door.

"What do you come to announce to me, monsieur?" said Louis,
very much troubled at being thus surprised in his private
thoughts, which he could not completely conceal.

"That monsieur le cardinal has just expired, sire; and that
I bring your majesty his last adieu."

The king remained pensive for a minute; and during that
minute he looked attentively at Colbert; -- it was evident
that the cardinal's last words were in his mind. "Are you,
then, M. Colbert?" asked he.

"Yes, sire."

"His faithful servant, as his eminence himself told me?"

"Yes, sire."

"The depositary of many of his secrets?"

"Of all of them."

"The friends and servants of his eminence will be dear to
me, monsieur, and I shall take care that you are well placed
in my employment."

Colbert bowed.

"You are a financier, monsieur, I believe?"

"Yes, sire."

"And did monsieur le cardinal employ you in his
stewardship?"

"I had that honor, sire."

"You never did anything personally for my household, I
believe?"

"Pardon me, sire, it was I who had the honor of giving
monsieur le cardinal the idea of an economy which puts three
hundred thousand francs a year into your majesty's coffers."

"What economy was that, monsieur?" asked Louis XIV.

"Your majesty knows that the hundred Swiss have silver lace
on each side of their ribbons?"

"Doubtless."

"Well, sire, it was I who proposed that imitation silver
lace should be placed upon these ribbons, it could not be
detected, and a hundred thousand crowns serve to feed a
regiment during six months; and is the price of ten thousand
good muskets or the value of a vessel of ten guns, ready for
sea."

"That is true," said Louis XIV., considering more
attentively, "and, ma foi! that was a well placed economy;
besides, it was ridiculous for soldiers to wear the same
lace as noblemen."

"I am happy to be approved of by your majesty."

"Is that the only appointment you held about the cardinal?"
asked the king.

"It was I who was appointed to examine the accounts of the
superintendent, sire."

"Ah!" said Louis, who was about to dismiss Colbert, but whom
that word stopped; "ah! it was you whom his eminence had
charged to control M. Fouquet, was it? And the result of the
examination?"

"Is that there is a deficit, sire; but if your majesty will
permit me ---- "

"Speak, M. Colbert."

"I ought to give your majesty some explanations."

"Not at all, monsieur, it is you who have controlled these
accounts, give me the result."

"That is very easily done, sire; emptiness everywhere, money
nowhere."

"Beware, monsieur; you are roughly attacking the
administration of M. Fouquet, who, nevertheless, I have
heard say, is an able man."

Colbert colored, and then became pale, for he felt that from
that minute he entered upon a struggle with a man whose
power almost equaled the sway of him who had just died.
"Yes, sire, a very able man," repeated Colbert, bowing.

"But if M. Fouquet is an able man, and, in spite of that
ability, if money be wanting, whose fault is it?"

"I do not accuse, sire, I verify."

"That is well; make out your accounts, and present them to
me. There is a deficit, you say? A deficit may be temporary;
credit returns and funds are restored."

"No, sire."

"Upon this year, perhaps, I understand that; but upon next
year?"

"Next year is eaten as bare as the current year."

"But the year after, then?"

"Will be just like next year."

"What do you tell me, Monsieur Colbert?"

"I say there are four years engaged beforehand.

"They must have a loan, then."

"They must have three, sire."

"I will create offices to make them resign, and the salary
of the posts shall be paid into the treasury."

"Impossible, sire, for there have already been creations
upon creations of offices, the provisions of which are given
in blank, so that the purchasers enjoy them without filling
them. That is why your majesty cannot make them resign.
Further, upon each agreement M. Fouquet has made an
abatement of a third, so that the people have been
plundered, without your majesty profiting by it. Let your
majesty set down clearly your thought, and tell me what you
wish me to explain."

"You are right, clearness is what you wish, is it not?"

"Yes, sire, clearness. God is God above all things, because
He made light."

"Well, for example," resumed Louis XIV., "if today, the
cardinal being dead, and I being king, suppose I wanted
money?"

"Your majesty would not have any."

"Oh! that is strange, monsieur! How! my superintendent would
not find me any money?"

Colbert shook his large head.

"How is that?" said the king, "is the income of the state so
much in debt that there is no longer any revenue?"

"Yes, sire."

The king started. "Explain me that, M. Colbert," added he
with a frown. "If it be so, I will get together the
ordonnances to obtain a discharge from the holders, a
liquidation at a cheap rate."

"Impossible, for the ordonnances have been converted into
bills, which bills, for the convenience of return and
facility of transaction, are divided into so many parts that
the originals can no longer be recognized."

Louis, very much agitated, walked about, still frowning.
"But, if this is as you say, Monsieur Colbert," said he,
stopping all at once, "I shall be ruined before I begin to
reign."

"You are, in fact, sire," said the impassible caster-up of
figures.

"Well, but yet, monsieur, the money is somewhere?"

"Yes, sire, and even as a beginning, I bring your majesty a
note of funds which M. le Cardinal Mazarin was not willing
to set down in his testament, neither in any act whatever,
but which he confided to me."

"To you?"

"Yes, sire, with an injunction to remit it to your majesty."

"What! besides the forty millions of the testament?"

"Yes, sire."

"M. de Mazarin had still other funds?"

Colbert bowed.

"Why, that man was a gulf!" murmured the king. "M. de
Mazarin on one side, M. Fouquet on the other, -- more than a
hundred millions perhaps between them! No wonder my coffers
should be empty!" Colbert waited without stirring.

"And is the sum you bring me worth the trouble?" asked the
king.

"Yes, sire, it is a round sum."

"Amounting to how much?"

"To thirteen millions of livres, sire."

"Thirteen millions!" cried Louis, trembling with joy: "do
you say thirteen millions, Monsieur Colbert?"

"I said thirteen millions, yes, your majesty."

"Of which everybody is ignorant?"

"Of which everybody is ignorant."

"Which are in your hands?"

"In my hands, yes, sire."

"And which I can have?"

"Within two hours, sire."

"But where are they, then?"

"In the cellar of a house which the cardinal possessed in
the city, and which he was so kind as to leave me by a
particular clause of his will."

"You are acquainted with the cardinal's will, then?"

"I have a duplicate of it, signed by his hand."

"A duplicate?"

"Yes, sire, and here it is." Colbert drew the deed quietly
from his pocket and showed it to the king. The king read the
article relative to the donation of the house.

"But," said he, "there is no question here but of the house;
there is nothing said of the money."

"Your pardon, sire, it is in my conscience."

"And Monsieur Mazarin has intrusted it to you?"

"Why not, sire?"

"He! a man mistrustful of everybody?"

"He was not so of me, sire, as your majesty may perceive."

Louis fixed his eyes with admiration upon that vulgar but
expressive face. "You are an honest man, M. Colbert," said
the king.

"That is not a virtue, it is a duty," replied Colbert,
coolly.

"But," added Louis, "does not the money belong to the
family?"

"If this money belonged to the family it would be disposed
of in the testament, as the rest of his fortune is. If this
money belonged to the family, I, who drew up the deed of
donation in favor of your majesty, should have added the sum
of thirteen millions to that of forty millions which was
offered to you."

"How!" exclaimed Louis XIV., "was it you who drew up the
deed of donation?"

"Yes, sire."

"And yet the cardinal was attached to you?" added the king
ingenuously.

"I had assured his eminence you would by no means accept the
gift," said Colbert in that same quiet manner we have
described, and which, even in the common habits of life, had
something solemn in it.

Louis passed his hand over his brow. "Oh! how young I am,"
murmured he, "to have the command of men."

Colbert waited the end of this monologue. He saw Louis raise
his head. "At what hour shall I send the money to your
majesty?" asked he.

"To-night, at eleven o'clock; I desire that no one may know
that I possess this money."

Colbert made no more reply than if the thing had not been
said to him.

"Is the amount in ingots, or coined gold?"

"In coined gold, sire."

"That is well."

"Where shall I send it?"

"To the Louvre. Thank you, M. Colbert."

Colbert bowed and retired. "Thirteen millions!" exclaimed
Louis, as soon as he was alone. "This must be a dream!" Then
he allowed his head to sink between his hands, as if he were
really asleep. But at the end of a moment he arose, and
opening the window violently he bathed his burning brow in
the keen morning air, which brought to his senses the scent
of the trees, and the perfume of flowers. A splendid dawn
was gilding the horizon, and the first rays of the sun
bathed in flame the young king's brow. "This is the dawn of
my reign," murmured Louis XIV. "It's a presage sent by the
Almighty."




CHAPTER 50

The First Day of the Royalty of Louis XIV



In the morning, the news of the death of the cardinal was
spread through the castle, and thence speedily reached the
city. The ministers Fouquet, Lyonne, and Letellier entered
la salle des seances, to hold a council. The king sent for
them immediately. "Messieurs," said he, "as long as monsieur
le cardinal lived, I allowed him to govern my affairs; but
now I mean to govern them myself. You will give me your
advice when I ask it. You may go."

The ministers looked at each other with surprise. If they
concealed a smile it was with a great effort, for they knew
that the prince, brought up in absolute ignorance of
business, by this took upon himself a burden much too heavy
for his strength. Fouquet took leave of his colleagues upon
the stairs, saying: -- "Messieurs! there will be so much
less labor for us."

And he climbed gayly into his carriage. The others, a little
uneasy at the turn things had taken, went back to Paris
together. Towards ten o'clock the king repaired to the
apartment of his mother, with whom he had a long and private
conversation. After dinner, he got into his carriage, and
went straight to the Louvre. There he received much company,
and took a degree of pleasure in remarking the hesitation of
each, and the curiosity of all. Towards evening he ordered
the doors of the Louvre to be closed, with the exception of
one only, which opened on the quay. He placed on duty at
this point two hundred Swiss, who did not speak a word of
French, with orders to admit all who carried packages, but
no others; and by no means to allow any one to go out. At
eleven o'clock precisely, he heard the rolling of a heavy
carriage under the arch, then of another, then of a third;
after which the gate grated upon its hinges to be closed.
Soon after, somebody scratched with his nail at the door of
the cabinet. The king opened it himself, and beheld Colbert,
whose first word was this: -- "The money is in your
majesty's cellar."

The king then descended and went himself to see the barrels
of specie, in gold and silver, which, under the direction of
Colbert, four men had just rolled into a cellar of which the
king had given Colbert the key in the morning. This review
completed, Louis returned to his apartments, followed by
Colbert, who had not apparently warmed with one ray of
personal satisfaction.

"Monsieur," said the king, "what do you wish that I should
give you, as a recompense for this devotedness and probity?"

"Absolutely nothing, sire."

"How nothing? Not even an opportunity of serving me?"

"If your majesty were not to furnish me with that
opportunity, I should not the less serve you. It is
impossible for me not to be the best servant of the king."

"You shall be intendant of the finances, M. Colbert."

"But there is already a superintendent, sire."

"I know that."

"Sire, the superintendent of the finances is the most
powerful man in the kingdom."

"Ah!" cried Louis, coloring, "do you think so?"

"He will crush me in a week, sire. Your majesty gives me a
controle for which strength is indispensable. An intendant
under a superintendent, -- that is inferiority."

"You want support -- you do not reckon upon me?"

"I had the honor of telling your majesty that during the
lifetime of M. de Mazarin, M. Fouquet was the second man in
the kingdom; now M. de Mazarin is dead, M. Fouquet is become
the first."

"Monsieur, I agree to what you told me of all things up to
to-day; but to-morrow, please to remember, I shall no longer
suffer it."

"Then I shall be of no use to your majesty?"

"You are already, since you fear to compromise yourself in
serving me."

"I only fear to be placed so that I cannot serve your
majesty."

"What do you wish, then?"

"I wish your majesty to allow me assistance in the labors of
the office of intendant."

"The post would lose its value."

"It would gain in security."

"Choose your colleagues."

"Messieurs Breteuil, Marin, Harvard."

"To-morrow the ordonnance shall appear.

"Sire, I thank you."

"Is that all you ask?

"No, sire, one thing more."

"What is that?"

"Allow me to compose a chamber of justice."

"What would this chamber of justice do?"

"Try the farmers-general and contractors, who, during ten
years, have been robbing the state."

"Well, but what would you do with them?"

"Hang two or three, and that would make the rest disgorge."

"I cannot commence my reign with executions, Monsieur
Colbert."

"On the contrary, sire, you had better, in order not to have
to end with them."

The king made no reply. "Does your majesty consent?" said
Colbert.

"I will reflect upon it, monsieur."

"It will be too late when reflection may be made."

"Why?"

"Because you have to deal with people stronger than
ourselves, if they are warned."

"Compose that chamber of justice, monsieur."

"I will, sire."

"Is that all?"

"No, sire; there is still another important affair. What
rights does your majesty attach to this office of
intendant?"

"Well -- I do not know -- the customary ones."

"Sire, I desire that this office be invested with the right
of reading the correspondence with England."

"Impossible, monsieur, for that correspondence is kept from
the council; monsieur le cardinal himself carried it on."

"I thought your majesty had this morning declared that there
should no longer be a council?"

"Yes, I said so."

"Let your majesty then have the goodness to read all the
letters yourself, particularly those from England; I hold
strongly to this article."

"Monsieur, you shall have that correspondence, and render me
an account of it."

"Now, sire, what shall I do with respect to the finances?"

"Everything M. Fouquet has not done."

"That is all I ask of your majesty. Thanks, sire, I depart
in peace;" and at these words he took his leave. Louis
watched his departure. Colbert was not yet a hundred paces
from the Louvre when the king received a courier from
England. After having looked at and examined the envelope,
the king broke the seal precipitately, and found a letter
from Charles II. The following is what the English prince
wrote to his royal brother: --



"Your majesty must be rendered very uneasy by the illness of
M. le Cardinal Mazarin; but the excess of danger can only
prove of service to you. The cardinal is given over by his
physician. I thank you for the gracious reply you have made
to my communication touching the Princess Henrietta, my
sister, and, in a week, the princess and her court will set
out for Paris. It is gratifying to me to acknowledge the
fraternal friendship you have evinced towards me, and to
call you, more justly than ever, my brother. It is
gratifying to me, above everything, to prove to your majesty
how much I am interested in all that may please you. You are
having Belle-Isle-en-Mer secretly fortified. That is wrong.
We shall never be at war against each other. That measure
does not make me uneasy, it makes me sad. You are spending
useless millions, tell your ministers so; and rest assured
that I am well informed; render me the same service, my
brother, if occasion offers."



The king rang his bell violently, and his valet de chambre
appeared. "Monsieur Colbert is just gone; he cannot be far
off. Let him be called back!" exclaimed he.

The valet was about to execute the order, when the king
stopped him.

"No," said he, "no, I see the whole scheme of that man.
Belle-Isle belongs to M. Fouquet; Belle-Isle is being
fortified: that is a conspiracy on the part of M. Fouquet.
The discovery of that conspiracy is the ruin of the
superintendent, and that discovery is the result of the
correspondence with England: this is why Colbert wished to
have that correspondence. Oh! but I cannot place all my
dependence upon that man; he has a good head, but I must
have an arm!" Louis, all at once, uttered a joyful cry. "I
had," said he, "a lieutenant of musketeers!"

"Yes, sire -- Monsieur d'Artagnan."

"He quitted the service for a time."

"Yes, sire."

"Let him be found, and be here to-morrow the first thing in
the morning."

The valet de chambre bowed and went out.

"Thirteen millions in my cellar," said the king; "Colbert
carrying my purse and D'Artagnan my sword -- I am king."




CHAPTER 51

A Passion



The day of his arrival, on returning from the Palais Royal,
Athos, as we have seen, went straight to his hotel in the
Rue Saint-Honore. He there found the Vicomte de Bragelonne
waiting for him in his chamber, chatting with Grimaud. It
was not an easy thing to talk with this old servant. Two men
only possessed the secret, Athos and D'Artagnan. The first
succeeded, because Grimaud sought to make him speak himself;
D'Artagnan, on the contrary, because he knew how to make
Grimaud talk. Raoul was occupied in making him describe the
voyage to England, and Grimaud had related it in all its
details, with a limited number of gestures and eight words,
neither more nor less. He had, at first, indicated by an
undulating movement of his hand, that his master and he had
crossed the sea. "Upon some expedition?" Raoul had asked.

Grimaud by bending down his head had answered, "Yes."

"When monsieur le comte incurred much danger?" asked Raoul.

"Neither too much nor too little," was replied by a shrug of
the shoulders.

"But, still, what sort of danger?" insisted Raoul.

Grimaud pointed to the sword; he pointed to the fire and to
a musket that was hanging on the wall.

"Monsieur le comte had an enemy there, then?" cried Raoul.

"Monk," replied Grimaud.

"It is strange," continued Raoul, "that monsieur le comte
persists in considering me a novice, and not allowing me to
partake the honor and danger of his adventure."

Grimaud smiled. It was at this moment Athos came in. The
host was lighting him up the stairs, and Grimaud,
recognizing the step of his master, hastened to meet him,
which cut short the conversation. But Raoul was launched on
the sea of interrogatories, and did not stop. Taking both
hands of the comte, with warm, but respectful tenderness, --
"How is it, monsieur," said he, "that you have set out upon
a dangerous voyage without bidding me adieu, without
commanding the aid of my sword, of myself, who ought to be
your support, now I have the strength; whom you have brought
up like a man? Ah! monsieur, can you expose me to the cruel
trial of never seeing you again?"

"Who told you, Raoul," said the comte, placing his cloak and
hat in the hands of Grimaud, who had unbuckled his sword,
"who told you that my voyage was a dangerous one?"

"I," said Grimaud.

"And why did you do so?" said Athos, sternly.

Grimaud was embarrassed; Raoul came to his assistance, by
answering for him. "It is natural, monsieur that our good
Grimaud should tell me the truth in what concerns you. By
whom should you be loved and supported, if not by me?"

Athos did not reply. He made a friendly motion to Grimaud,
which sent him out of the room, he then seated himself in a
fauteuil, whilst Raoul remained standing before him.

"But is it true," continued Raoul, "that your voyage was an
expedition, and that steel and fire threatened you?"

"Say no more about that, vicomte," said Athos mildly. "I set
out hastily, it is true: but the service of King Charles II.
required a prompt departure. As to your anxiety, I thank you
for it, and I know that I can depend upon you. You have not
wanted for anything, vicomte, in my absence, have you?"

"No, monsieur, thank you."

"I left orders with Blaisois to pay you a hundred pistoles,
if you should stand in need of money."

"Monsieur, I have not seen Blaisois."

"You have been without money, then?"

"Monsieur, I had thirty pistoles left from the sale of the
horses I took in my last campaign, and M. le Prince had the
kindness to allow me to win two hundred pistoles at his
play-table three months ago."

"Do you play? I don't like that, Raoul."

"I never play, monsieur; it was M. le Prince who ordered me
to hold his cards at Chantilly -- one night when a courier
came to him from the king. I won, and M. le Prince commanded
me to take the stakes."

"Is that a practice in the household, Raoul?" asked Athos
with a frown.

"Yes, monsieur; every week M. le Prince affords, upon one
occasion or another, a similar advantage to one of his
gentlemen. There are fifty gentlemen in his highness's
household; it was my turn."

"Very well! You went into Spain, then?"

"Yes, monsieur, I made a very delightful and interesting
journey."

"You have been back a month, have you not?"

"Yes, monsieur."

"And in the course of that month?"

"In that month ---- "

"What have you done?"

"My duty, monsieur."

"Have you not been home, to La Fere?"

Raoul colored. Athos looked at him with a fixed but tranquil
expression.

"You would be wrong not to believe me," said Raoul. "I feel
that I colored, and in spite of myself. The question you did
me the honor to ask me is of a nature to raise in me much
emotion. I color, then, because I am agitated, not because I
meditate a falsehood."

"I know, Raoul, you never lie."

"No, monsieur."

"Besides, my young friend, you would be wrong; what I wanted
to say ---- "

"I know quite well, monsieur. You would ask me if I have not
been to Blois?"

"Exactly so."

"I have not been there; I have not even seen the person to
whom you allude."

Raoul's voice trembled as he pronounced these words. Athos,
a sovereign judge in all matters of delicacy, immediately
added, "Raoul, you answer with a painful feeling; you are
unhappy."

"Very, monsieur; you have forbidden me to go to Blois, or to
see Mademoiselle de la Valliere again." Here the young man
stopped. That dear name, so delightful to pronounce, made
his heart bleed, although so sweet upon his lips.

"And I have acted rightly, Raoul," Athos hastened to reply.
"I am neither an unjust nor a barbarous father; I respect
true love; but I look forward for you to a future -- an
immense future. A new reign is about to break upon us like a
fresh dawn. War calls upon a young king full of chivalric
spirit. What is wanting to assist this heroic ardor is a
battalion of young and free lieutenants who would rush to
the fight with enthusiasm and fall, crying: `Vive le Roi!'
instead of `Adieu, my dear wife.' You understand that,
Raoul. However brutal my reasoning may appear, I conjure
you, then, to believe me, and to turn away your thoughts
from those early days of youth in which you took up this
habit of love -- days of effeminate carelessness, which
soften the heart and render it incapable of consuming those
strong, bitter draughts called glory and adversity.
Therefore, Raoul, I repeat to you, you should see in my
counsel only the desire of being useful to you, only the
ambition of seeing you prosper. I believe you capable of
becoming a remarkable man. March alone, and you will march
better, and more quickly."

"You have commanded, monsieur," replied Raoul, "and I obey."

"Commanded!" cried Athos. "Is it thus you reply to me? I
have commanded you! Oh! you distort my words as you
misconceive my intentions. I do not command you; I request
you."

"No, monsieur, you have commanded," said Raoul,
persistently; "had you only requested me, your request is
even more effective than your order. I have not seen
Mademoiselle de la Valliere again."

"But you are unhappy! you are unhappy!" insisted Athos.

Raoul made no reply.

"I find you pale; I find you dull. The sentiment is strong,
then?"

"It is a passion," replied Raoul.

"No -- a habit."

"Monsieur, you know I have traveled much, that I have passed
two years far away from her. A habit would yield to an
absence of two years, I believe; whereas, on my return, I
loved, not more, that was impossible, but as much.
Mademoiselle de la Valliere is for me the one lady above all
others; but you are for me a god upon earth -- to you I
sacrifice everything."

"You are wrong," said Athos; "I have no longer any right
over you. Age has emancipated you; you no longer even stand
in need of my consent. Besides, I will not refuse my consent
after what you have told me. Marry Mademoiselle de la
Valliere, if you like."

Raoul was startled, but suddenly: "You are very kind,
monsieur," said he, "and your concession excites my warmest
gratitude, but I will not accept it."

"Then you now refuse?"

"Yes, monsieur."

"I will not oppose you in anything, Raoul."

"But you have at the bottom of your heart an idea against
this marriage: it is not your choice."

"That is true."

"That is sufficient to make me resist: I will wait."

"Beware, Raoul! What you are now saying is serious."

"I know it is, monsieur; as I said, I will wait."

"Until I die?" said Athos, much agitated.

"Oh! monsieur," cried Raoul, with tears in his eyes, "is it
possible that you should wound my heart thus? I have never
given you cause of complaint!"

"Dear boy, that is true," murmured Athos, pressing his lips
violently together to conceal the emotion of which he was no
longer master. "No, I will no longer afflict you; only I do
not comprehend what you mean by waiting. Will you wait till
you love no longer?"

"Ah! for that! -- no, monsieur. I will wait till you change
your opinion."

"I should wish to put the matter to a test, Raoul; I should
like to see if Mademoiselle de la Valliere will wait as you
do."

"I hope so, monsieur."

"But take care, Raoul! suppose she did not wait? Ah, you are
so young, so confiding, so loyal! Women are changeable."

"You have never spoken ill to me of women, monsieur; you
have never had to complain of them; why should you doubt of
Mademoiselle de la Valliere?"

"That is true," said Athos, casting down his eyes; "I have
never spoken ill to you of women; I have never had to
complain of them; Mademoiselle de la Valliere never gave
birth to a suspicion; but when we are looking forward, we
must go even to exceptions, even to improbabilities! If, I
say, Mademoiselle de la Valliere should not wait for you?"

"How, monsieur?"

"If she turned her eyes another way."

"If she looked favorably upon another, do you mean,
monsieur?" said Raoul, pale with agony.

"Exactly."

"Well, monsieur, I would kill him," said Raoul, simply, "and
all the men whom Mademoiselle de la Valliere should choose,
until one of them had killed me, or Mademoiselle de la
Valliere had restored me her heart."

Athos started. "I thought," resumed he, in an agitated
voice, "that you called me just now your god, your law in
this world."

"Oh!" said Raoul, trembling, "you would forbid me the duel?"

"Suppose I did forbid it, Raoul?"

"You would forbid me to hope, monsieur; consequently you
would not forbid me to die."

Athos raised his eyes toward the vicomte. He had pronounced
these words with the most melancholy inflection, accompanied
by the most melancholy look. "Enough,"said Athos, after a
long silence, "enough of this subject, upon which we both go
too far. Live as well as you are able, Raoul, perform your
duties, love Mademoiselle de; la Valliere; in a word, act
like a man, since you have attained the age of a man; only
do not forget that I love you tenderly, and that you profess
to love me."

"Ah! monsieur le comte!" cried Raoul, pressing the hand of
Athos to his heart.

"Enough, dear boy, leave me; I want rest. A propos, M.
d'Artagnan has returned from England with me; you owe him a
visit."

"I will pay it, monsieur, with great pleasure. I love
Monsieur d'Artagnan exceedingly."

"You are right in doing so; he is a worthy man and a brave
cavalier."

"Who loves you dearly."

"I am sure of that. Do you know his address?"

"At the Louvre, I suppose, or wherever the king is. Does he
not command the musketeers?"

"No; at present M. d'Artagnan is absent on leave; he is
resting for awhile. Do not, therefore, seek him at the posts
of his service. You will hear of him at the house of a
certain Planchet."

"His former lackey?"

"Exactly, turned grocer."

"I know; Rue des Lombards?"

"Somewhere thereabouts, or Rue des Arcis."

"I will find it, monsieur, -- I will find it."

"You will say a thousand kind things to him, on my part, and
ask him to come and dine with me before I set out for La
Fere."

"Yes, monsieur."

"Good-night, Raoul!"

"Monsieur, I see you wear an order I never saw you wear
before; accept my compliments!"

"The Fleece! that is true. A bauble, my boy, which no longer
amuses an old child like myself. Goodnight, Raoul!"




CHAPTER 52

D'Artagnan's Lesson



Raoul did not meet with D'Artagnan the next day, as he had
hoped. He only met with Planchet, whose joy was great at
seeing the young man again, and who contrived to pay him two
or three little soldierly compliments, savoring very little
of the grocer's shop. But as Raoul was returning the next
day from Vincennes, at the head of fifty dragoons confided
to him by Monsieur le Prince, he perceived, in La Place
Baudoyer, a man with his nose in the air, examining a house
as we examine a horse we have a fancy to buy. This man,
dressed in citizen costume buttoned up like a military
pourpoint, a very small hat on his head, but a long
shagreen-mounted sword by his side, turned his head as soon
as he heard the steps of the horses, and left off looking at
the house to look at the dragoons. It was simply M.
d'Artagnan; D'Artagnan on foot; D'Artagnan with his hands
behind him, passing a little review upon the dragoons, after
having reviewed the buildings. Not a man, not a tag, not a
horse's hoof escaped his inspection. Raoul rode at the side
of his troop; D'Artagnan perceived him the last. "Eh!" said
he, "Eh! Mordioux!"

"I was not mistaken!" cried Raoul, turning his horse towards
him.

"Mistaken -- no! Good-day to you," replied the ex-musketeer;
whilst Raoul eagerly pressed the hand of his old friend.
"Take care, Raoul," said D'Artagnan, "the second horse of
the fifth rank will lose a shoe before he gets to the Pont
Marie; he has only two nails left in his off fore-foot."

"Wait a minute, I will come back," said Raoul.

"Can you quit your detachment?"

"The cornet is there to take my place."

"Then you will come and dine with me?"

"Most willingly, Monsieur d'Artagnan."

"Be quick, then; leave your horse, or make them give me
one."

"I prefer coming back on foot with you."

Raoul hastened to give notice to the cornet, who took his
post; he then dismounted, gave his horse to one of the
dragoons, and with great delight seized the arm of M.
d'Artagnan, who had watched him during all these little
evolutions with the satisfaction of a connoisseur.

"What, do you come from Vincennes?" said he.

"Yes, monsieur le chevalier."

"And the cardinal?"

"Is very ill, it is even reported he is dead.'

"Are you on good terms with M. Fouquet?" asked D'Artagnan,
with a disdainful movement of the shoulders, proving that
the death of Mazarin did not affect him beyond measure.

"With M. Fouquet?" said Raoul " I do not know him."

"So much the worse! so much the worse! for a new king always
seeks to get good men in his employment."

"Oh! the king means no harm," replied the young man.

"I say nothing about the crown," cried D'Artagnan; "I am
speaking of the king -- the king, that is M. Fouquet, if the
cardinal is dead. You must contrive to stand well with M.
Fouquet, if you do not wish to molder away all your life as
I have moldered. It is true you have, fortunately, other
protectors."

"M. le Prince, for instance."

"Worn out! worn out!"

"M. le Comte de la Fere?"

"Athos! Oh! that's different; yes, Athos -- and if you have
any wish to make your way in England, you cannot apply to a
better person; I can even say, without too much vanity, that
I myself have some credit at the court of Charles II. There
is a king -- God speed him!"

"Ah!" cried Raoul, with the natural curiosity of well-born
young people, while listening to experience and courage.

"Yes, a king who amuses himself, it is true, but who has had
a sword in his hand, and can appreciate useful men. Athos is
on good terms with Charles II. Take service there, and leave
these scoundrels of contractors and farmers-general, who
steal as well with French hands as others have done with
Italian hands; leave the little snivelling king, who is
going to give us another reign of Francis II. Do you know
anything of history, Raoul?"

"Yes, monsieur le chevalier."

"Do you know, then, that Francis II. had always the
earache?"

"No, I did not know that."

"That Charles IV. had always the headache?"

"Indeed!"

"And Henry III. always the stomach-ache?"

Raoul began to laugh.

"Well, my dear friend, Louis XIV. always has the heartache;
it is deplorable to see a king sighing from morning till
night without saying once in course of the day,
ventre-saint-gris! corboeuf! or anything to rouse one."

"Was that the reason why you quitted the service, monsieur
le chevalier?"

"Yes."

"But you yourself, M. d'Artagnan, are throwing the handle
after the axe; you will not make a fortune."

"Who? I?" replied D'Artagnan, in a careless tone; "I am
settled -- I had some family property."

Raoul looked at him. The poverty of D'Artagnan was
proverbial. A Gascon, he exceeded in ill-luck all the
gasconnades of France and Navarre; Raoul had a hundred times
heard Job and D'Artagnan named together, as the twins
Romulus and Remus. D'Artagnan caught Raoul's look of
astonishment.

"And has not your father told you I have been in England?"

"Yes, monsieur le chevalier."

"And that I there met with a very lucky chance?"

"No, monsieur, I did not know that."

"Yes, a very worthy friend of mine, a great nobleman, the
viceroy of Scotland and Ireland, has endowed me with an
inheritance."

"An inheritance?"

"And a good one, too."

"Then you are rich?"

"Bah!"

"Receive my sincere congratulation."

"Thank you! Look, that is my house."

"Place de Greve?"

"Yes, don't you like this quarter?"

"On the contrary, the look-out over the water is pleasant.
Oh! what a pretty old house!"

"The sign Notre Dame; it is an old cabaret, which I have
transformed into a private house in two days."

"But the cabaret is still open?"

"Pardieu!"

"And where do you lodge, then?

"I? I lodge with Planchet."

"You said, just now, `This is my house.'"

"I said so, because, in fact, it is my house. I have bought
it."

"Ah!" said Raoul.

"At ten years' purchase, my dear Raoul; a superb affair, I
bought the house for thirty thousand livres; it has a garden
which opens to the Rue de la Mortillerie; the cabaret lets
for a thousand livres, with the first story; the garret, or
second floor, for five hundred livres."

"Indeed!"

"Yes, indeed."

"Five hundred livres for a garret? Why, it is not
habitable."

"Therefore no one inhabits it, only, you see this garret has
two windows which look out upon the Place."

"Yes, monsieur."

"Well, then, every time anybody is broken on the wheel or
hung, quartered, or burnt, these two windows let for twenty
pistoles."

"Oh!" said Raoul, with horror.

"It is disgusting, is it not?" said D'Artagnan.

"Oh!" repeated Raoul.

"It is disgusting, but so it is. These Parisian cockneys are
sometimes real anthropophagi. I cannot conceive how men,
Christians, can make such speculations."

"That is true."

"As for myself," continued D'Artagnan, "if I inhabited that
house, on days of execution I would shut it up to the very
keyholes; but I do not inhabit it."

"And you let the garret for five hundred livres?"

"To the ferocious cabaretier, who sub-lets it. I said, then,
fifteen hundred livres."

"The natural interest of money," said Raoul, -- "five per
cent."

"Exactly so. I then have left the side of the house at the
back, store-rooms, and cellars, inundated every winter, two
hundred livres; and the garden, which is very fine, well
planted, well shaded under the walls and the portal of
Saint-Gervais-Saint-Protais, thirteen hundred livres."

"Thirteen hundred livres! why, that is royal!"

"This is the whole history. I strongly suspect some canon of
the parish (these canons are all as rich as Croesus) -- I
suspect some canon of having hired the garden to take his
pleasure in. The tenant has given the name of M. Godard.
That is either a false name or a real name; if true, he is a
canon; if false, he is some unknown; but of what consequence
is it to me? he always pays in advance. I had also an idea
just now, when I met you, of buying a house in the Place
Baudoyer, the back premises of which join my garden, and
would make a magnificent property. Your dragoons interrupted
my calculations. But come, let us take the Rue de la
Vannerie: that will lead us straight to M. Planchet's."
D'Artagnan mended his pace, and conducted Raoul to
Planchet's dwelling, a chamber of which the grocer had given
up to his old master. Planchet was out, but the dinner was
ready. There was a remains of military regularity and
punctuality preserved in the grocer's household. D'Artagnan
returned to the subject of Raoul's future.

"Your father brings you up rather strictly?" said he.

"Justly, monsieur le chevalier."

"Oh, yes, I know Athos is just, but close, perhaps?"

"A royal hand, Monsieur d'Artagnan."

"Well, never want, my boy! If ever you stand in need of a
few pistoles, the old musketeer is at hand."

"My dear Monsieur d'Artagnan!"

"Do you play a little?"

"Never."

"Successful with the ladies, then? -- Oh, my little Aramis!
That, my dear friend, costs even more than play. It is true
we fight when we lose, that is a compensation. Bah! that
little sniveller, the king, makes winners give him his
revenge. What a reign! my poor Raoul, what a reign! When we
think that, in my time, the musketeers were besieged in
their houses like Hector and Priam in the city of Troy, and
the women wept, and then the walls laughed, and then five
hundred beggarly fellows clapped their hands, and cried,
`Kill! kill!' when not one musketeer was hurt. Mordioux! you
will never see anything like that."

"You are very hard upon the king, my dear Monsieur
d'Artagnan; and yet you scarcely know him."

"I! Listen, Raoul. Day by day, hour by hour, -- take note of
my words, -- I will predict what he will do. The cardinal
being dead, he will fret; very well, that is the least silly
thing he will do, particularly if he does not shed a tear."

"And then?"

"Why then he will get M. Fouquet to allow him a pension, and
will go and compose verses at Fontainebleau, upon some
Mancini or other, whose eyes the queen will scratch out. She
is a Spaniard, you see, -- this queen of ours, and she has,
for mother-in-law, Madame Anne of Austria. I know something
of the Spaniards of the house of Austria."

"And next?"

"Well, after having torn off the silver lace from the
uniforms of his Swiss, because lace is too expensive, he
will dismount the musketeers, because the oats and hay of a
horse cost five sols a day."

"Oh! do not say that."

"Of what consequence is it to me? I am no longer a
musketeer, am I? Let them be on horseback, let them be on
foot, let them carry a larding-pin, a spit, a sword, or
nothing -- what is it to me?"

"My dear Monsieur d'Artagnan, I beseech you speak no more
ill of the king. I am almost in his service, and my father
would be very angry with me for having heard, even from your
mouth, words injurious to his majesty."

"Your father, eh? He is a knight in every bad cause.
Pardieu! yes, your father is a brave man, a Caesar, it is
true -- but a man without perception."

"Now, my dear chevalier," exclaimed Raoul, laughing, "are
you going to speak ill of my father, of him you call the
great Athos. Truly you are in a bad vein to-day; riches
render you as sour as poverty renders other people."

"Pardieu! you are right. I am a rascal and in my dotage; I
am an unhappy wretch grown old; a tent-cord untwisted, a
pierced cuirass, a boot without a sole, a spur without a
rowel; -- but do me the pleasure to add one thing."

"What is that, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan?"

"Simply say: `Mazarin was a pitiful wretch.'"

"Perhaps he is dead."

"More the reason -- I say was; if I did not hope that he was
dead, I would entreat you to say: `Mazarin is a pitiful
wretch.' Come, say so, say so, for love of me."

"Well, I will."

"Say it!"

"Mazarin was a pitiful wretch," said Raoul, smiling at the
musketeer, who roared with laughter, as in his best days.

"A moment," said the latter; "you have spoken my first
proposition, here is the conclusion of it, -- repeat, Raoul,
repeat: `But I regret Mazarin.'"

"Chevalier!"

"You will not say it? Well, then, I will say it twice for
you."

"But you would regret Mazarin?"

And they were still laughing and discussing this profession
of principles, when one of the shop-boys entered. "A letter,
monsieur," said he, "for M. d'Artagnan."

"Thank you; give it me," cried the musketeer.

"The handwriting of monsieur le comte," said Raoul.

"Yes, yes." And D'Artagnan broke the seal.

"Dear friend," said Athos, "a person has just been here to
beg me to seek for you, on the part of the king."

"Seek me!" said D'Artagnan, letting the paper fall upon the
table. Raoul picked it up, and continued to read aloud: --

"Make haste. His majesty is very anxious to speak to you,
and expects you at the Louvre."

"Expects me?" again repeated the musketeer.

"He, he, he!" laughed Raoul.

"Oh, oh!" replied D'Artagnan. "What the devil can this
mean?"




CHAPTER 53

The King



The first moment of surprise over, D'Artagnan reperused
Athos's note. "It is strange," said he, "that the king
should send for me."

"Why so?" said Raoul; "do you not think, monsieur, that the
king must regret such a servant as you?"

"Oh, oh!" cried the officer, laughing with all his might;
"you are poking fun at me, Master Raoul. If the king had
regretted me, he would not have let me leave him. No, no; I
see in it something better, or worse, if you like."

"Worse! What can that be, monsieur le chevalier?"

"You are young, you are a boy, you are admirable. Oh, how I
should like to be as you are! To be but twenty-four, with an
unfurrowed brow, under which the brain is void of everything
but women, love, and good intentions. Oh, Raoul, as long as
you have not received the smiles of kings, the confidence of
queens; as long as you have not had two cardinals killed
under you, the one a tiger, the other a fox, as long as you
have not -- But what is the good of all this trifling? We
must part, Raoul."

"How you say the word! What a serious face!"

"Eh! but the occasion is worthy of it. Listen to me. I have
a very good recommendation to tender you."

"I am all attention, Monsieur d'Artagnan."

"You will go and inform your father of my departure."

"Your departure?"

"Pardieu! You will tell him that I am gone into England; and
that I am living in my little country-house."

"In England, you! -- And the king's orders?"

"You get more and more silly: do you imagine that I am going
to the Louvre, to place myself at the disposal of that
little crowned wolf-cub?"

"The king a wolf-cub? Why, monsieur le chevalier, you are
mad!"

"On the contrary, I never was so sane. You do not know what
he wants to do with me, this worthy son of Louis le Juste!
-- But, Mordioux! that is policy. He wishes to ensconce me
snugly in the Bastile -- purely and simply, look you!"

"What for?" cried Raoul, terrified at what he heard.

"On account of what I told him one day at Blois. I was warm;
he remembers it."

"You told him what?"

"That he was mean, cowardly, and silly."

"Good God!" cried Raoul, "is it possible that such words
should have issued from your mouth?"

"Perhaps I don't give the letter of my speech, but I give
the sense of it."

"But did not the king have you arrested immediately?"

"By whom? It was I who commanded the musketeers; he must
have commanded me to convey myself to prison; I would never
have consented: I would have resisted myself. And then I
went into England -- no more D'Artagnan. Now, the cardinal
is dead, or nearly so, they learn that I am in Paris, and
they lay their hands on me."

"The cardinal was your protector?"

"The cardinal knew me; he knew certain particularities of
me; I also knew some of his; we appreciated each other
mutually. And then, on rendering his soul to the devil, he
would recommend Anne of Austria to make me the inhabitant of
a safe place. Go then, and find your father, relate the fact
to him -- and adieu!"

"My dear Monsieur d'Artagnan," said Raoul, very much
agitated, after having looked out at the window, "you cannot
even fly!"

"Why not?"

"Because there is below an officer of the Swiss guards
waiting for you."

"Well!"

"Well, he will arrest you."

D'Artagnan broke into a Homeric laugh.

"Oh! I know very well that you will resist, that you will
fight, even; I know very well that you will prove the
conqueror; but that amounts to rebellion, and you are an
officer yourself, knowing what discipline is."

"Devil of a boy, how logical that is!" grumbled D'Artagnan.

"You approve of it. do you not?"

"Yes, instead of passing into the street, where that idiot
is waiting for me, I will slip quietly out at the back. I
have a horse in the stable, and a good one. I will ride him
to death; my means permit me to do so, and by killing one
horse after another, I shall arrive at Boulogne in eleven
hours; I know the road. Only tell your father one thing."

"What is that?"

"That is -- that the thing he knows about is placed at
Planchet's house, except a fifth, and that ---- "

"But, my dear M. d'Artagnan, rest assured that if you fly,
two things will be said of you."

"What are they, my dear friend?"

"The first, that you have been afraid."

"Ah! and who will dare to say that?"

"The king first."

"Well! but he will tell the truth, -- I am afraid."

"The second, that you knew yourself guilty."

"Guilty of what?"

"Why, of the crimes they wish to impute to you."

"That is true again. So, then, you advise me to go and get
myself made a prisoner in the Bastile?"

"M. le Comte de la Fere would advise you just as I do."

"Pardieu! I know he would," said D'Artagnan thoughtfully.
"You are right, I shall not escape. But if they cast me into
the Bastile?"

"We will get you out again," said Raoul, with a quiet, calm
air.

"Mordioux! You said that after a brave fashion, Raoul," said
D'Artagnan, seizing his hand, "that savors of Athos,
distinctly. Well, I will go, then. Do not forget my last
word."

"Except a fifth," said Raoul.

"Yes, you are a fine boy! and I wish you to add one thing to
that last word."

"Speak, chevalier!"

"It is that if you cannot get me out of the Bastile, and I
remain there -- oh! that will be so, and I shall be a
detestable prisoner; I, who have been a passable man, -- in
that case, I give three-fifths to you, and the fourth to
your father."

"Chevalier!"

"Mordioux! If you will have some masses said for me, you are
welcome."

That being said, D'Artagnan took his belt from the hook,
girded on his sword, took a hat the feather of which was
fresh, and held his hand out to Raoul, who threw himself
into his arms. When in the shop, he cast a quick glance at
the shop-lads, who looked upon the scene with a pride
mingled with some inquietude; then plunging his hands into a
chest of currants, he went straight to the officer who was
waiting for him at the door.

"Those features! Can it be you, Monsieur de Friedisch?"
cried D'Artagnan, gayly. "Eh! eh! what, do we arrest our
friends?"

"Arrest!" whispered the lads among themselves.

"Yes, it is I, Monsieur d'Artagnan! Good-day to you!" said
the Swiss, in his mountain patois.

"Must I give you up my sword? I warn you, that it is long
and heavy; you had better let me wear it to the Louvre: I
feel quite lost in the streets without a sword, and you
would be more at a loss than I should, with two."

"The king has given no orders about it," replied the Swiss,
"so keep your sword."

"Well, that is very polite on the part of the king. Let us
go, at once."

Monsieur Friedisch was not a talker, and D'Artagnan had too
many things to think about to say much. From Planchet's shop
to the Louvre was not far -- they arrived in ten minutes. It
was a dark night. M. de Friedisch wanted to enter by the
wicket. "No," said D'Artagnan, "you would lose time by that;
take the little staircase."

The Swiss did as D'Artagnan advised, and conducted him to
the vestibule of the king's cabinet. When arrived there, he
bowed to his prisoner, and, without saying anything,
returned to his post. D'Artagnan had not had time to ask why
his sword was not taken from him, when the door of the
cabinet opened, and a valet de chambre called "M.
D'Artagnan!" The musketeer assumed his parade carriage and
entered, with his large eyes wide open, his brow calm, his
mustache stiff. The king was seated at a table writing. He
did not disturb himself when the step of the musketeer
resounded on the floor; he did not even turn his head.
D'Artagnan advanced as far as the middle of the room, and
seeing that the king paid no attention to him, and
suspecting, besides, that this was nothing but affectation,
a sort of tormenting preamble to the explanation that was
preparing, he turned his back on the prince, and began to
examine the frescoes on the cornices, and the cracks in the
ceiling. This maneuver was accompanied by a little tacit
monologue. "Ah! you want to humble me, do you? -- you, whom
I have seen so young -- you, whom I have served as I would
my own child, -- you, whom I have served as I would a God --
that is to say, for nothing. Wait awhile! wait awhile! you
shall see what a man can do who has snuffed the air of the
fire of the Huguenots, under the beard of monsieur le
cardinal -- the true cardinal." At this moment Louis turned
round.

"Ah! are you there, Monsieur d'Artagnan?" said he.

D'Artagnan saw the movement and imitated it. "Yes, sire,"
said he.

"Very well; have the goodness to wait till I have cast this
up."

D'Artagnan made no reply; he only bowed. "That is polite
enough," thought he; "I have nothing to say."

Louis made a violent dash with his pen, and threw it angrily
away.

"Ah! go on, work yourself up!" thought the musketeer; "you
will put me at my ease. You shall find I did not empty the
bag, the other day, at Blois."

Louis rose from his seat, passed his hand over his brow,
then, stopping opposite to D'Artagnan, he looked at him with
an air at once imperious and kind. "What the devil does he
want with me? I wish he would begin!" thought the musketeer.

"Monsieur," said the king, "you know, without doubt, that
monsieur le cardinal is dead?"

"I suspected so, sire."

"You know that, consequently, I am master in my own
kingdom?"

"That is not a thing that dates from the death of monsieur
le cardinal, sire; a man is always master in his own house,
when he wishes to be so."

"Yes; but do you remember all you said to me at Blois?"

"Now we come to it," thought D'Artagnan, "I was not
deceived. Well, so much the better, it is a sign that my
scent is tolerably keen yet."

"You do not answer me," said Louis.

"Sire, I think I recollect."

"You only think?"

"It is so long ago."

"If you do not remember, I do. You said to me, -- listen
with attention."

"Ah! I shall listen with all my ears, sire; for it is very
likely the conversation will turn in a fashion very
interesting to me."

Louis once more looked at the musketeer, The latter smoothed
the feather of his hat, then his mustache, and waited
bravely. Louis XIV. continued: "You quitted my service,
monsieur, after having told me the whole truth?"

"Yes, sire."

"That is, after having declared to me all you thought to be
true, with regard to my mode of thinking and acting. That is
always a merit. You began by telling me that you had served
my family thirty years, and were fatigued."

"I said so; yes, sire."

"And you afterwards admitted that that fatigue was a
pretext, and that discontent was the real cause."

"I was discontented, in fact, but that discontent has never
betrayed itself, that I know of, and if, like a man of
heart, I have spoken out before your majesty, I have not
even thought of the matter, before anybody else."

"Do not excuse yourself, D'Artagnan, but continue to listen
to me. When making me the reproach that you were
discontented, you received in reply a promise: -- `Wait.' --
Is not that true?"

"Yes, sire, as true as what I told you."

"You answered me, `Hereafter! No, now, immediately.' Do not
excuse yourself, I tell you. It was natural, but you had no
charity for your poor prince, Monsieur d'Artagnan."

"Sire! charity for a king, on the part of a poor soldier!"

"You understand me very well; you knew that I stood in need
of it; you knew very well that I was not master; you knew
very well that my hope was in the future. Now, you answered
me when I spoke of that future, `My discharge, -- and that
directly.'"

"That is true," murmured D'Artagnan, biting his mustache.

"You did not flatter me when I was in distress," added
Louis.

"But," said D'Artagnan, raising his head nobly, "if I did
not flatter your majesty when poor, neither did I betray
you. I have shed my blood for nothing; I have watched like a
dog at a door, knowing full well that neither bread nor bone
would be thrown to me. I, although poor likewise, asked
nothing of your majesty but the discharge you speak of."

"I know you are a brave man, but I was a young man, and you
ought to have had some indulgence for me. What had you to
reproach the king with? -- that he left King Charles II.
without assistance? -- let us say further -- that he did not
marry Mademoiselle de Mancini?" When saying these words, the
king fixed upon the musketeer a searching look.

"Ah! ah!" thought the latter, "he is doing far more than
remembering, he divines. The devil!"

"Your sentence," continued Louis, "fell upon the king and
fell upon the man. But, Monsieur d'Artagnan, that weakness,
for you considered it a weakness?" -- D'Artagnan made no
reply -- "you reproached me also with regard to monsieur,
the defunct cardinal. Now, monsieur le cardinal, did he not
bring me up, did he not support me? -- elevating himself and
supporting himself at the same time, I admit; but the
benefit was discharged. As an ingrate or an egotist, would
you, then, have better loved or served me?"

"Sire!"

"We will say no more about it, monsieur; it would only
create in you too many regrets, and me too much pain."

D'Artagnan was not convinced. The young king, in adopting a
tone of hauteur with him, did not forward his purpose.

"You have since reflected?" resumed Louis.

"Upon what, sire?" asked D'Artagnan, politely.

"Why, upon all that I have said to you, monsieur."

"Yes, sire, no doubt ---- "

"And you have only waited for an opportunity of retracting
your words?"

"Sire!"

"You hesitate, it seems."

"I do not understand what your majesty did me the honor to
say to me."

Louis's brow became cloudy.

"Have the goodness to excuse me, sire; my understanding is
particularly thick; things do not penetrate it without
difficulty; but it is true, when once they get in, they
remain there."

"Yes, yes; you appear to have a memory."

"Almost as good a one as your majesty's."

"Then give me quickly one solution. My time is valuable.
What have you been doing since your discharge?"

"Making my fortune, sire."

"The expression is crude, Monsieur d'Artagnan."

"Your majesty takes it in bad part, certainly. I entertain
nothing but the profoundest respect for the king; and if I
have been impolite, which might be excused by my long
sojourn in camps and barracks, your majesty is too much
above me to be offended at a word that innocently escapes
from a soldier."

"In fact, I know you performed a brilliant action in
England, monsieur. I only regret that you have broken your
promise."

"I!" cried D'Artagnan.

"Doubtless. You engaged your word not to serve any other
prince on quitting my service. Now it was for King Charles
II. that you undertook the marvelous carrying off of M.
Monk."

"Pardon me, sire, it was for myself."

"And did you succeed?"

"Like the captains of the fifteenth century, coups-de-main
and adventures."

"What do you call succeeding? -- a fortune?"

"A hundred thousand crowns, sire, which I now possess --
that is, in one week three times as much money as I ever had
in fifty years."

"It is a handsome sum. But you are ambitious, I perceive."

"I, sire? The quarter of that would be a treasure; and I
swear to you I have no thought of augmenting it."

"What! you contemplate remaining idle?"

"Yes, sire."

"You mean to drop the sword?"

"That I have already done."

"Impossible, Monsieur d'Artagnan," said Louis, firmly.

"But, sire ---- "

"Well?"

"And why, sire?"

"Because it is my wish you should not!" said the young
prince, in a voice so stern and imperious that D'Artagnan
evinced surprise and even uneasiness.

"Will your majesty allow me one word of reply?" said he.

"Speak."

"I formed that resolution when I was poor and destitute."

"So be it. Go on."

"Now, when by my energy I have acquired a comfortable means
of subsistence, would your majesty despoil me of my liberty?
Your majesty would condemn me to the lowest, when I have
gained the highest?"

"Who gave you permission, monsieur to fathom my designs, or
to reckon with me?" replied Louis, in a voice almost angry;
"who told you what I shall do or what you will yourself do?"

"Sire," said the musketeer, quietly, "as far as I see,
freedom is not the order of the conversation, as it was on
the day we came to an explanation at Blois."

"No, monsieur; everything is changed."

"I tender your majesty my sincere compliments upon that, but
---- "

"But you don't believe it?"

"I am not a great statesman, and yet I have my eye upon
affairs; it seldom fails; now, I do not see exactly as your
majesty does, sire. The reign of Mazarin is over, but that
of the financiers is begun. They have the money; your
majesty will not often see much of it. To live under the paw
of these hungry wolves is hard for a man who reckoned upon
independence."

At this moment some one scratched at the door of the
cabinet; the king raised his head proudly. "Your pardon,
Monsieur d'Artagnan," said he; "it is M. Colbert, who comes
to make me a report. Come in M. Colbert."

D'Artagnan drew back. Colbert entered with papers in his
hand, and went up to the king. There can be little doubt
that the Gascon did not lose the opportunity of applying his
keen, quick glance to the new figure which presented itself.

"Is the inquiry made?"

"Yes, sire."

"And the opinion of the inquisitors?"

"Is that the accused merit confiscation and death."

"Ah! ah!" said the king, without changing countenance, and
casting an oblique look at D'Artagnan. "And your own
opinion, M. Colbert?" said he.

Colbert looked at D'Artagnan in his turn. That imposing
countenance checked the words upon his lips. Louis perceived
this. "Do not disturb yourself," said he; "it is M.
d'Artagnan, -- do you not know M. d'Artagnan again?"

These two men looked at each other -- D'Artagnan, with eyes
open and bright as the day -- Colbert, with his half closed,
and dim. The frank intrepidity of the one annoyed the other;
the circumspection of the financier disgusted the soldier.
"Ah! ah! this is the gentleman who made that brilliant
stroke in England," said Colbert. And he bowed slightly to
D'Artagnan.

"Ah! ah!" said the Gascon, "this is the gentleman who
clipped off the lace from the uniform of the Swiss! A
praiseworthy piece of economy."

The financier thought to pierce the musketeer; but the
musketeer ran the financier through.

"Monsieur d'Artagnan," resumed the king, who had not
remarked all the shades of which Mazarin would have missed
not one, "this concerns the farmers of the revenue who have
robbed me, whom I am hanging, and whose death-warrants I am
about to sign."

"Oh! oh!" said D'Artagnan, starting.

"What did you say?"

"Oh! nothing, sire. This is no business of mine."

The king had already taken up the pen, and was applying it
to the paper. "Sire," said Colbert in a subdued voice, "I
beg to warn your majesty, that if an example be necessary,
there will be difficulty in the execution of your orders."

"What do you say?" said Louis.

"You must not conceal from yourself," continued Colbert
quietly, "that attacking the farmers-general is attacking
the superintendence. The two unfortunate guilty men in
question are the particular friends of a powerful personage,
and the punishment, which otherwise might be comfortably
confined to the Chatelet will doubtless be a signal for
disturbances!"

Louis colored and turned towards D'Artagnan, who took a
slight bite at his mustache, not without a smile of pity for
the financier, and for the king who had to listen to him so
long. But Louis seized the pen, and with a movement so
rapid, that his hand shook, he affixed his signature at the
bottom of the two papers presented by Colbert, -- then
looking the latter in the face, -- "Monsieur Colbert'" said
he, "when you speak to me on business, exclude more
frequently the word difficulty from your reasonings and
opinions; as to the word impossibility, never pronounce it."

Colbert bowed, much humiliated at having to undergo such a
lesson before the musketeer; he was about to go out, but,
jealous to repair his check: "I forgot to announce to your
majesty," said he, "that the confiscations amount to the sum
of five millions of livres."

"That's pretty well!" thought D'Artagnan.

"Which makes in my coffers?" said the king.

"Eighteen millions of livres, sire," replied Colbert,
bowing.

"Mordioux!" growled D'Artagnan, "that's glorious!"

"Monsieur Colbert," added the king, "you will, if you
please, go through the gallery where M. Lyonne is waiting,
and will tell him to bring hither what he has drawn up -- by
my order."

"Directly, sire; if your majesty wants me no more this
evening?"

"No, monsieur: good-night!" And Colbert went out.

"Now, let us return to our affair, M. d'Artagnan," said the
king, as if nothing had happened. "You see that, with
respect to money, there is already a notable change."

"Something to the tune of from zero to eighteen millions,"
replied the musketeer, gayly. "Ah! that was what your
majesty wanted the day King Charles II. came to Blois. The
two states would not have been embroiled to-day; for I must
say, that there also I see another stumbling-block."

"Well, in the first place," replied Louis, "you are unjust,
monsieur; for, if Providence had made me able to give my
brother the million that day, you would not have quitted my
service, and, consequently, you would not have made your
fortune, as you told me just now you have done. But, in
addition to this, I have had another piece of good fortune;
and my difference with Great Britain need not alarm you."

A valet de chambre interrupted the king by announcing M.
Lyonne. "Come in, monsieur," said the king; "you are
punctual; that is like a good servant. Let us see your
letter to my brother Charles II."

D'Artagnan pricked up his ears. "A moment, monsieur," said
Louis, carelessly to the Gascon, "I must expedite to London
my consent to the marriage of my brother, M. le Duc d'Anjou,
with the Princess Henrietta Stuart."

"He is knocking me about, it seems," murmured D'Artagnan,
whilst the king signed the letter, and dismissed M. de
Lyonne, "but, ma foi! the more he knocks me about in this
manner, the better I like it."

The king followed M. de Lyonne with his eyes, till the door
was closed behind him; he even made three steps, as if he
would follow the minister, but, after these three steps,
stopping, pausing, and coming back to the musketeer, --
"Now, monsieur," said he, "let us hasten to terminate our
affair. You told me the other day, at Blois, that you were
not rich?"

"But I am now, sire."

"Yes, but that does not concern me; you have your own money,
not mine; that does not enter into my account."

"I do not well understand what your majesty means."

"Then, instead of leaving you to draw out words, speak,
spontaneously. Should you be satisfied with twenty thousand
livres a year as a fixed income?"

"But, sire," said D'Artagnan, opening his eyes to the
utmost.

"Would you be satisfied with four horses furnished and kept,
and with a supplement of funds such as you might require,
according to occasions and needs, or would you prefer a
fixed sum which would be, for example, forty thousand
livres? Answer."

"Sire, your majesty ---- "

"Yes, you are surprised; that is natural, and I expected it.
Answer me, come! or I shall think you have no longer that
rapidity of judgment I have so much admired in you."

"It is certain, sire, that twenty thousand livres a year
make a handsome sum; but ---- "

"No buts! Yes or no, is it an honorable indemnity?"

"Oh! very certainly."

"You will be satisfied with it? That is well. It will be
better to reckon the extra expenses separately; you can
arrange that with Colbert. Now let us pass to something more
important."

"But, sire, I told your majesty ---- "

"That you wanted rest, I know you did: only I replied that I
would not allow it -- I am master, I suppose?"

"Yes, sire."

"That is well. You were formerly in the way of becoming
captain of the musketeers?"

"Yes, sire."

"Well, here is your commission signed. I place it in this
drawer. The day on which you shall return from a certain
expedition which I have to confide to you, on that day you
may yourself take the commission from the drawer."
D'Artagnan still hesitated, and hung down his head. "Come,
monsieur," said the king, "one would believe, to look at
you, that you did not know that at the court of the most
Christian king, the captain-general of the musketeers takes
precedence of the marechals of France."

"Sire, I know he does.

"Then, am I to think you do put no faith in my word?"

"Oh! sire, never -- never dream of such a thing."

"I have wished to prove to you, that you, so good a servant,
had lost a good master; am I anything like the master that
will suit you?"

"I begin to think you are, sire."

"Then, monsieur, you will resume your functions. Your
company is quite disorganized since your departure and the
men go about drinking and rioting in the cabarets where they
fight, in spite of my edicts, and those of my father. You
will reorganize the service as soon as possible."

"Yes, sire."

"You will not again quit my person."

"Very well, sire,"

"You will march with me to the army, you will encamp round
my tent."

"Then, sire," said D'Artagnan, "if it is only to impose upon
me a service like that, your majesty need not give me twenty
thousand livres a year. I shall not earn them."

"I desire that you shall keep open house; I desire that you
should keep a liberal table; I desire that my captain of
musketeers should be a personage."

"And I," said D'Artagnan, bluntly; "I do not like easily
found money; I like money won! Your majesty gives me an idle
trade, which the first comer would perform for four thousand
livres."

Louis XIV. began to laugh. "You are a true Gascon, Monsieur
d'Artagnan; you will draw my heart's secret from me."

"Bah! has your majesty a secret, then?"

"Yes, monsieur."

"Well! then I accept the twenty thousand livres, for I will
keep that secret, and discretion is above all price, in
these times. Will your majesty speak now?"

"Boot yourself, Monsieur d'Artagnan, and to horse!"

"Directly, sire."

"Within two days."

"That is well, sire: for I have my affairs to settle before
I set out; particularly if it is likely there should be any
blows stirring."

"That may happen."

"We can receive them! But, sire, you have addressed yourself
to avarice, to ambition; you have addressed yourself to the
heart of M. d'Artagnan, but you have forgotten one thing."

"What is that?"

"You have said nothing to his vanity, when shall I be a
knight of the king's orders?"

"Does that interest you?"

"Why, yes, sire. My friend Athos is quite covered with
orders, and that dazzles me."

"You shall be a knight of my order a month after you have
taken your commission of captain."

"Ah! ah!" said the officer, thoughtfully, "after the
expedition."

"Precisely."

"Where is your majesty going to send me?"

"Are you"acquainted with Bretagne?"

"Have you any friends there?"

"In Bretagne? No, ma foi!"

"So much the better. Do you know anything about
fortifications?"

"I believe I do, sire," said D'Artagnan, smiling.

"That is to say you can readily distinguish a fortress from
a simple fortification, such as is allowed to chatelains or
vassals?"

"I distinguish a fort from a rampart as I distinguish a
cuirass from a raised pie-crust, sire. Is that sufficient?"

"Yes, monsieur. You will set out then."

"For Bretagne?"

"Yes."

"Alone?"

"Absolutely alone. That is to say, you must not even take a
lackey with you."

"May I ask your majesty for what reason?"

"Because, monsieur, it will be necessary to disguise
yourself sometimes, as the servant of a good family. Your
face is very well known in France, M. d'Artagnan."

"And then, sire?"

"And then you will travel slowly through Bretagne, and will
examine carefully the fortifications of that country."

"The coasts?"

"Yes, and the isles, commencing by Belle-Isle-en-Mer."

"Ah! which belongs to M. Fouquet!" said D'Artagnan, in a
serious tone, raising his intelligent eye to Louis XIV.

"I fancy you are right, monsieur, and that Belle-Isle does
belong to M. Fouquet, in fact."

"Then your majesty wishes me to ascertain if Belle-Isle is a
strong place?"

"Yes."

"If the fortifications of it are new or old?"

"Precisely."

"And if the vassals of M. Fouquet are sufficiently numerous
to form a garrison?"

"That is what I want to know; you have placed your finger on
the question."

"And if they are not fortifying, sire?"

"You will travel about Bretagne, listening and judging."

"Then I am a king's spy?" said D'Artagnan, bluntly, twisting
his mustache.

"No, monsieur."

"Your pardon, sire; I spy on your majesty's account."

"You start on a voyage of discovery, monsieur. Would you
march at the head of your musketeers, with your sword in
your hand, to observe any spot whatever, or an enemy's
position?"

At this word D'Artagnan started.

"Do you," continued the king, "imagine yourself to be a
spy?"

"No, no," said D'Artagnan, but pensively; "the thing changes
its face when one observes an enemy; one is but a soldier.
And if they are fortifying Belle-Isle?" added he, quickly.

"You will take an exact plan of the fortifications."

"Will they permit me to enter?"

"That does not concern me; that is your affair. Did you not
understand that I reserved for you a supplement of twenty
thousand livres per annum, if you wished it?"

"Yes, sire; but if they are not fortifying?"

"You will return quietly, without fatiguing your horse."

"Sire, I am ready."

"You will begin to-morrow by going to monsieur le
surintendant's to take the first quarter of the pension I
give you. Do you know M. Fouquet?"

"Very little, sire; but I beg your majesty to observe that I
don't think it immediately necessary that I should know
him."

"Your pardon, monsieur; for he will refuse you the money I
wish you to take; and it is that refusal I look for."

"Ah!" said D'Artagnan. "Then, sire?"

"The money being refused, you will go and seek it at M.
Colbert's. A propos, have you a good horse?"

"An excellent one, sire."

"How much did it cost you?"

"A hundred and fifty pistoles."

"I will buy it of you. Here is a note for two hundred
pistoles."

"But I want my horse for my journey, sire."

"Well!"

"Well, and you take mine from me."

"Not at all. On the contrary, I give it you. Only as it is
now mine and not yours, I am sure you will not spare it."

"Your majesty is in a hurry, then?"

"A great hurry."

"Then what compels me to wait two days?"

"Reasons known to myself."

"That's a different affair. The horse may make up the two
days, in the eight he has to travel; and then there is the
post."

"No, no, the post compromises, Monsieur d'Artagnan. Begone
and do not forget you are my servant."

"Sire, it is not my duty to forget it! At what hour
to-morrow shall I take my leave of your majesty?"

"Where do you lodge?"

"I must henceforward lodge at the Louvre."

"That must not be now -- keep your lodgings in the city: I
will pay for them. As to your departure, it must take place
at night; you must set out without being seen by any one,
or, if you are seen, it must not be known that you belong to
me. Keep your mouth shut, monsieur."

"Your majesty spoils all you have said by that single word."

"I asked you where you lodged, for I cannot always send to
M. le Comte de la Fere to seek you."

"I lodge with M. Planchet, a grocer, Rue des Lombards, at
the sign of the Pilon d'Or."

"Go out but little, show yourself less, and await my
orders."

"And yet, sire, I must go for the money."

"That is true, but when going to the superintendence, where
so many people are constantly going, you must mingle with
the crowd."

"I want the notes, sire, for the money."

"Here they are." The king signed them, and D'Artagnan looked
on, to assure himself of their regularity.

"Adieu! Monsieur d'Artagnan," added the king; "I think you
have perfectly understood me."

"I? I understand that your majesty sends me to
Belle-Isle-en-Mer, that is all."

"To learn?"

"To learn how M. Fouquet's works are going on; that is all."

"Very well: I admit you may be taken."

"And I do not admit it," replied the Gascon, boldly.

"I admit you may be killed," continued the king.

"That is not probable, sire."

"In the first case, you must not speak; in the second there
must be no papers found upon you."

D'Artagnan shrugged his shoulders without ceremony, and took
leave of the king, saying to himself: -- "The English shower
continues -- let us remain under the spout!"




CHAPTER 54

The Houses of M. Fouquet



Whilst D'Artagnan was returning to Planchet's house, his
head aching and bewildered with all that had happened to
him, there was passing a scene of quite a different
character, and which, nevertheless is not foreign to the
conversation our musketeer had just had with the king; only
this scene took place out of Paris, in a house possessed by
the superintendent Fouquet in the village of Saint-Mande.
The minister had just arrived at this country-house,
followed by his principal clerk, who carried an enormous
portfolio full of papers to be examined, and others waiting
for signature. As it might be about five o'clock in the
afternoon, the masters had dined: supper was being prepared
for twenty subaltern guests. The superintendent did not
stop: on alighting from his carriage, he, at the same bound,
sprang through the doorway, traversed the apartments and
gained his cabinet, where he declared he would shut himself
up to work, commanding that he should not be disturbed for
anything but an order from the king. As soon as this order
was given, Fouquet shut himself up, and two footmen were
placed as sentinels at his door. Then Fouquet pushed a bolt
which displaced a panel that walled up the entrance, and
prevented everything that passed in this apartment from
being either seen or heard. But, against all probability, it
was only for the sake of shutting himself up that Fouquet
shut himself up thus, for he went straight to a bureau,
seated himself at it, opened the portfolio, and began to
make a choice amongst the enormous mass of papers it
contained. It was not more than ten minutes after he had
entered, and taken all the precautions we have described,
when the repeated noise of several slight equal knocks
struck his ear, and appeared to fix his utmost attention.
Fouquet raised his head, turned his ear, and listened.

The strokes continued. Then the worker arose with a slight
movement of impatience and walked straight up to a glass
behind which the blows were struck by a hand, or by some
invisible mechanism. It was a large glass let into a panel.
Three other glasses, exactly similar to it, completed the
symmetry of the apartment. Nothing distinguished that one
from the others. Without doubt, these reiterated knocks were
a signal; for, at the moment Fouquet approached the glass
listening, the same noise was renewed, and in the same
measure. "Oh! oh!" murmured the intendent, with surprise,
"who is yonder? I did not expect anybody to-day." And,
without doubt, to respond to that signal, he pulled out a
gilded nail near the glass, and shook it thrice. Then
returning to his place, and seating himself again, "Ma foi!
let them wait," said he. And plunging again into the ocean
of papers unrolled before him, he appeared to think of
nothing now but work. In fact with incredible rapidity and
marvelous lucidity, Fouquet deciphered the largest papers
and most complicated writings, correcting them, annotating
them with a pen moved as if by a fever, and the work melting
under his hands, signatures, figures, references, became
multiplied as if ten clerks -- that is to say, a hundred
fingers and ten brains had performed the duties, instead of
the five fingers and single brain of this man. From time to
time, only, Fouquet, absorbed by his work, raised his head
to cast a furtive glance upon a clock placed before him. The
reason of this was, Fouquet set himself a task, and when
this task was once set, in one hour's work he, by himself,
did what another would not have accomplished in a day;
always certain, consequently, provided he was not disturbed,
of arriving at the close in the time his devouring activity
had fixed. But in the midst of his ardent labor, the soft
strokes upon the little bell placed behind the glass sounded
again, hasty, and, consequently, more urgent.

"The lady appears to be impatient," said Fouquet. "Humph! a
calm! That must be the comtesse; but, no, the comtesse is
gone to Rambouillet for three days. The presidente, then?
Oh! no, the presidente would not assume such grand airs; she
would ring very humbly, then she would wait my good
pleasure. The greatest certainty is, that I do not know who
it can be, but that I know who it cannot be. And since it is
not you, marquise, since it cannot be you, deuce take the
rest!" And he went on with his work in spite of the
reiterated appeals of the bell. At the end of a quarter of
an hour, however, impatience prevailed over Fouquet in his
turn: he might be said to consume, rather than to complete
the rest of his work; he thrust his papers into his
portfolio, and giving a glance at the mirror, whilst the
taps continued faster than ever: "Oh! oh!" said he, "whence
comes all this racket? What has happened, and who can the
Ariadne be who expects me so impatiently. Let us see!"

He then applied the tip of his finger to the nail parallel
to the one he had drawn. Immediately the glass moved like a
folding-door and discovered a secret closet, rather deep, in
which the superintendent disappeared as if going into a vast
box. When there, he touched another spring, which opened,
not a board, but a block of the wall, and he went out by
that opening, leaving the door to shut of itself. Then
Fouquet descended about a score of steps which sank,
winding, underground, and came to a long, subterranean
passage, lighted by imperceptible loopholes. The walls of
this vault were covered with slabs or tiles, and the floor
with carpeting. This passage was under the street itself,
which separated Fouquet's house from the Park of Vincennes.
At the end of the passage ascended a winding staircase
parallel with that by which Fouquet had entered. He mounted
these other stairs, entered by means of a spring placed in a
closet similar to that in his cabinet, and from this closet
an untenanted chamber furnished with the utmost elegance. As
soon as he entered, he examined carefully whether the glass
closed without leaving any trace, and, doubtless satisfied
with his observation, he opened by means of a small gold key
the triple fastenings of a door in front of him. This time
the door opened upon a handsome cabinet sumptuously
furnished, in which was seated upon cushions a lady of
surpassing beauty, who at the sound of the lock sprang
towards Fouquet. "Ah! good heavens!" cried the latter,
starting back with astonishment. "Madame la Marquise de
Belliere, you here?"

"Yes," murmured la marquise. "Yes; it is I, monsieur."

"Marquise! dear marquise!" added Fouquet, ready to prostrate
himself. "Ah! my God! how did you come here? And I, to keep
you waiting!"

"A long time, monsieur; yes, a very long time!"

"I am happy in thinking this waiting has appeared long to
you, marquise!"

"Oh! an eternity, monsieur; oh! I rang more than twenty
times. Did you not hear me?"

"Marquise, you are pale, you tremble."

"Did you not hear, then, that you were summoned?"

"Oh, yes; I heard plainly enough, madame; but I could not
come. After your rigors and your refusals, how could I dream
it was you? If I could have had any suspicion of the
happiness that awaited me, believe me, madame, I would have
quitted everything to fall at your feet, as I do at this
moment."

"Are we quite alone, monsieur?" asked the marquise, looking
round the room.

"Oh, yes, madame, I can assure you of that."

"Really?" said the marquise, in a melancholy tone.

"You sigh!" said Fouquet.

"What mysteries! what precautions!" said the marquise, with
a slight bitterness of expression; "and how evident it is
that you fear the least suspicion of your amours to escape."

"Would you prefer their being made public?"

"Oh, no; you act like a delicate man," said the marquise,
smiling.

"Come, dear marquise, punish me not with reproaches, I
implore you."

"Reproaches! Have I a right to make you any?"

"No, unfortunately, no; but tell me, you, who during a year
I have loved without return or hope ---- "

"You are mistaken -- without hope it is true, but not
without return."

"What! for me, of my love! there is but one proof, and that
proof I still want."

"I am here to bring it, monsieur."

Fouquet wished to clasp her in his arms, but she disengaged
herself with a gesture.

"You persist in deceiving yourself, monsieur, and never will
accept of me the only thing I am willing to give you --
devotion."

"Ah, then, you do not love me? Devotion is but a virtue,
love is a passion."

"Listen to me, I implore you: I should not have come hither
without a serious motive: you are well assured of that, are
you not?"

"The motive is of very little consequence, so that you are
but here -- so that I see you -- so that I speak to you!"

"You are right; the principal thing is that I am here
without any one having seen me, and that I can speak to
you." -- Fouquet sank on his knees before her. "Speak!
speak, madame!" said he, "I listen to you."

The marquise looked at Fouquet, on his knees at her feet,
and there was in the looks of the woman a strange mixture of
love and melancholy. "Oh!" at length murmured she, "would
that I were she who has the right of seeing you every
minute, of speaking to you every instant! would that I were
she who might watch over you, she who would have no need of
mysterious springs, to summon and cause to appear, like a
sylph, the man she loves, to look at him for an hour, and
then see him disappear in the darkness of a mystery, still
more strange at his going out than at his coming in. Oh!
that would be to live a happy woman!"

"Do you happen, marquise," said Fouquet, smiling, "to be
speaking of my wife?"

"Yes, certainly, of her I spoke."

"Well, you need not envy her lot, marquise; of all the women
with whom I have any relations, Madame Fouquet is the one I
see the least of, and who has the least intercourse with
me."

"At least, monsieur, she is not reduced to place, as I have
done, her hand upon the ornament of a glass to call you to
her; at least you do not reply to her by the mysterious,
alarming sound of a bell, the spring of which comes from I
don't know where; at least you have not forbidden her to
endeavor to discover the secret of these communications
under pain of breaking off forever your connections with
her, as you have forbidden all who have come here before me,
and all who will come after me."

"Dear marquise, how unjust you are, and how little do you
know what you are doing in thus exclaiming against mystery;
it is with mystery alone we can love without trouble; it is
with love without trouble alone that we can be happy. But
let us return to ourselves, to that devotion of which you
were speaking, or rather let me labor under a pleasing
delusion, and believe that this devotion is love."

"Just now," repeated the marquise, passing over her eyes a
hand that might have been a model for the graceful contours
of antiquity; "just now I was prepared to speak, my ideas
were clear and bold, now I am quite confused, quite
troubled; I fear I bring you bad news."

"If it is to that bad news I owe your presence, marquise,
welcome be even that bad news! or rather, marquise, since
you allow that I am not quite indifferent to you, let me
hear nothing of the bad news, but speak of yourself."

"No, no, on the contrary, demand it of me; require me to
tell it to you instantly, and not to allow myself to be
turned aside by any feeling whatever. Fouquet, my friend! it
is of immense importance!"

"You astonish me, marquise; I will even say you almost
frighten me. You, so serious, so collected; you who know the
world we live in so well. Is it, then important?"

"Oh! very important."

"In the first place, how did you come here?"

"You shall know that presently; but first to something of
more consequence."

"Speak, marquise, speak! I implore you, have pity on my
impatience."

"Do you know that Colbert is made intendant of the
finances?"

"Bah! Colbert, little Colbert."

"Yes, Colbert, little Colbert."

"Mazarin's factotum?"

"The same."

"Well! what do you see so terrific in that, dear marquise?
little Colbert is intendant; that is astonishing, I confess,
but is not terrific."

"Do you think the king has given, without a pressing motive,
such a place to one you call a little cuistre?"

"In the first place, is it positively true that the king has
given it to him?"

"It is so said."

"Ay, but who says so?"

"Everybody."

"Everybody, that's nobody; mention some one likely to be
well informed who says so."

"Madame Vanel."

"Ah! now you begin to frighten me in earnest," said Fouquet,
laughing; "if any one is well informed, or ought to be well
informed, it is the person you name."

"Do not speak ill of poor Marguerite, Monsieur Fouquet, for
she still loves you."

"Bah! indeed? That is scarcely credible. I thought little
Colbert, as you said just now, had passed over that love,
and left the impression upon it of a spot of ink or a stain
of grease."

"Fouquet! Fouquet! Is this the way you always treat the poor
creatures you desert?"

"Why, you surely are not going to undertake the defense of
Madame Vanel?"

"Yes, I will undertake it: for, I repeat, she loves you
still, and the proof is she saves you."

"But your interposition, marquise; that is very cunning on
her part. No angel could be more agreeable to me, or could
lead me more certainly to salvation. But, let me ask you do
you know Marguerite?"

"She was my convent friend."

"And you say that she has informed you that Monsieur Colbert
was named intendant?"

"Yes, she did."

"Well, enlighten me, marquise; granted Monsieur Colbert is
intendant -- so be it. In what can an intendant, that is to
say my subordinate, my clerk, give me umbrage or injure me,
even if he is Monsieur Colbert?"

"You do not reflect, monsieur, apparently," replied the
marquise.

"Upon what?"

"This: that Monsieur Colbert hates you."

"Hates me?" cried Fouquet. "Good heavens! marquise, whence
do you come? where can you live? Hates me! why all the world
hates me, he, of course as others do."

"He more than others."

"More than others -- let him."

"He is ambitious."

"Who is not, marquise?"

"'Yes, but with him ambition has no bounds."

"I am quite aware of that, since he made it a point to
succeed me with Madame Vanel."

"And obtained his end; look at that."

"Do you mean to say he has the presumption to hope to pass
from intendant to superintendent?"

"Have you not yourself already had the same fear?"

"Oh! oh!" said Fouquet, "to succeed with Madame Vanel is one
thing, to succeed me with the king is another. France is not
to be purchased so easily as the wife of a maitre des
comptes."

"Eh! monsieur, everything is to be bought; if not by gold,
by intrigue."

"Nobody knows to the contrary better than you, madame, you
to whom I have offered millions."

"Instead of millions, Fouquet, you should have offered me a
true, only and boundless love: I might have accepted that.
So you see, still, everything is to be bought, if not in one
way, by another."

"So, Colbert, in your opinion, is in a fair way of
bargaining for my place of superintendent. Make yourself
easy on that head, my dear marquise; he is not yet rich
enough to purchase it."

"But if he should rob you of it?"

"Ah! that is another thing. Unfortunately, before he can
reach me, that is to say, the body of the place, he must
destroy, must make a breach in the advanced works, and I am
devilishly well fortified, marquise."

"What you call your advanced works are your creatures, are
they not -- your friends?"

"Exactly so."

"And is M. d'Eymeris one of your creatures?"

"Yes, he is."

"Is M. Lyodot one of your friends?"

"Certainly."

"M. de Vanin?"

"M. de Vanin! ah! they may do what they like with him, but
---- "

"But ---- "

"But they must not touch the others!"

"Well, if you are anxious they should not touch MM.
d'Eymeris and Lyodot, it is time to look about you."

"Who threatens them?"

"Will you listen to me now?"

"Attentively, marquise."

"Without interrupting me?"

"Speak."

"Well, this morning Marguerite sent for me."

"And what did she want with you?"

"`I dare not see M. Fouquet myself,' said she."

"Bah! why should she think I would reproach her? Poor woman,
she vastly deceives herself."

"`See him yourself,' said she, `and tell him to beware of M.
Colbert.'"

"What! she warned me to beware of her lover?"

"I have told you she still loves you."

"Go on, marquise."

"`M. Colbert,' she added, `came to me two hours ago, to
inform me he was appointed intendant.'"

"I have already told you marquise, that M. Colbert would
only be the more in my power for that."

"Yes, but that is not all: Marguerite is intimate, as you
know, with Madame d'Eymeris and Madame Lyodot."

"I know it."

"Well, M. Colbert put many questions to her, relative to the
fortunes of those two gentlemen, and as to the devotion they
had for you."

"Oh, as to those two, I can answer for them; they must be
killed before they will cease to be mine."

"Then, as Madame Vanel was obliged to quit M. Colbert for an
instant to receive a visitor, and as M. Colbert is
industrious, scarcely was the new intendant left alone,
before he took a pencil from his pocket, and as there was
paper on the table, began to make notes."

"Notes concerning d'Eymeris and Lyodot?"

"Exactly."

"I should like to know what those notes were about."

"And that is just what I have brought you."

"Madame Vanel has taken Colbert's notes and sent them to
me?"

"No, but by a chance which resembles a miracle, she has a
duplicate of those notes."

"How could she get that?"

"Listen; I told you that Colbert found paper on the table."

"Yes."

"That he took a pencil from his pocket."

"Yes."

"And wrote upon that paper."

"Yes."

"Well, this pencil was a lead-pencil, consequently hard; so
it marked in black upon the first sheet, and in white upon
the second."

"Go on."

"Colbert, when tearing off the first sheet, took no notice
of the second."

"Well?"

"Well, on the second was to be read what had been written on
the first, Madame Vanel read it, and sent for me."

"Yes, yes."

"Then, when she was assured I was your devoted friend, she
gave me the paper, and told me the secret of this house."

"And this paper?" said Fouquet, in some degree of agitation.

"Here it is, monsieur -- read it," said the marquise.

Fouquet read:

"Names of the farmers of revenue to be condemned by the
Chamber of Justice: D'Eymeris, friend of M. F.; Lyodot,
friend of M. F.; De Vanin, indif."

"D'Eymeris and Lyodot!" cried Fouquet, reading the paper
eagerly again.

"Friends of M. F.," pointed the marquise with her finger.

"But what is the meaning of these words: `To be condemned by
the Chamber of Justice'?"

"Dame!" said the marquise, "that is clear enough, I think.
Besides, that is not all. Read on, read on;" and Fouquet
continued, ---"The two first to death, the third to be
dismissed, with MM. d'Hautemont and de la Vallette, who will
only have their property confiscated."

"Great God!" cried Fouquet, "to death, to death! Lyodot and
D'Eymeris. But even if the Chamber of Justice should condemn
them to death, the king will never ratify their
condemnation, and they cannot be executed without the king's
signature."

"The king has made M. Colbert intendant."

"Oh!" cried Fouquet, as if he caught a glimpse of the abyss
that yawned beneath his feet, "impossible! impossible! But
who passed a pencil over the marks made by Colbert?"

"I did. I was afraid the first would be effaced."

"Oh! I will know all."

"You will know nothing, monsieur; you despise your enemy too
much for that."

"Pardon me, my dear marquise; excuse me; yes, M. Colbert is
my enemy, I believe him to be so; yes, M. Colbert is a man
to be dreaded, I admit. But I! I have time, and as you are
here, as you have assured me of your devotion, as you have
allowed me to hope for your love, as we are alone ---- "

"I came here to save you, Monsieur Fouquet, and not to ruin
myself," said the marquise, rising -- "therefore, beware!
---- "

"Marquise, in truth you terrify yourself too much at least,
unless this terror is but a pretext ---- "

"He is very deep, very deep; this M. Colbert: beware!"

Fouquet, in his turn, drew himself up. "And I?" asked he.

"And you, you have only a noble heart. Beware! beware!"

"So?"

"I have done what was right, my friend, at the risk of my
reputation. Adieu!"

"Not adieu, au revoir!"

"Perhaps," said the marquise, giving her hand to Fouquet to
kiss, and walking towards the door with so firm a step, that
he did not dare to bar her passage. As to Fouquet, he
retook, with his head hanging down and a fixed cloud on his
brow, the path of the subterranean passage along which ran
the metal wires that communicated from one house to the
other, transmitting, through two glasses, the wishes and
signals of hidden correspondents.




CHAPTER 55

The Abbe Fouquet



Fouquet hastened back to his apartment by the subterranean
passage, and immediately closed the mirror with the spring.
He was scarcely in his closet, when he heard some one
knocking violently at the door, and a well-known voice
crying: -- "Open the door, monseigneur, I entreat you, open
the door!" Fouquet quickly restored a little order to
everything that might have revealed either his absence or
his agitation: he spread his papers over the desk, took up a
pen, and, to gain time, said, through the closed door, --
"Who is there?"

"What, monseigneur, do you not know me?" replied the voice.

"Yes, yes," said Fouquet to himself, "yes, my friend I know
you well enough." And then, aloud: "Is it not Gourville?"

"Why, yes, monseigneur."

Fouquet arose, cast a last look at one of his glasses, went
to the door, pushed back the bolt, and Gourville entered.
"Ah, monseigneur! monseigneur!" cried he, "what cruelty!"

"In what?"

"I have been a quarter of an hour imploring you to open the
door, and you would not even answer me."

"Once for all, you know that I will not be disturbed when I
am busy. Now, although I might make you an exception,
Gourville, I insist upon my orders being respected by
others."

"Monseigneur, at this moment, orders, doors, bolts, locks,
and walls, I could have broken, forced and overthrown!"

"Ah! ah! it relates to some great event, then?" asked
Fouquet.

"Oh! I assure you it does, monseigneur," replied Gourville.

"And what is this event?" said Fouquet, a little troubled by
the evident agitation of his most intimate confidant.

"There is a secret chamber of justice instituted,
monseigneur."

"I know there is, but do the members meet, Gourville?"

"They not only meet, but they have passed a sentence,
monseigneur."

"A sentence?" said the superintendent, with a shudder and
pallor he could not conceal. "A sentence! -- and on whom?"

"Two of your best friends."

"Lyodot and D'Eymeris, do you mean? But what sort of a
sentence?"

"Sentence of death."

"Passed? Oh! you must be mistaken, Gourville; that is
impossible."

"Here is a copy of the sentence which the king is to sign
to-day, if he has not already signed it."

Fouquet seized the paper eagerly, read it, and returned it
to Gourville. "The king will never sign that," said he.

Gourville shook his head.

"Monseigneur, M. Colbert is a bold councilor: do not be too
confident!"

"Monsieur Colbert again!" cried Fouquet. "How is it that
that name rises upon all occasions to torment my ears,
during the last two or three days? Thou make so trifling a
subject of too much importance, Gourville. Let M. Colbert
appear, I will face him; let him raise his head, I will
crush him; but you understand, there must be an outline upon
which my look may fall, there must be a surface upon which
my feet may be placed."

"Patience, monseigneur, for you do not know what Colbert is
-- study him quickly; it is with this dark financier as it
is with meteors, which the eye never sees completely before
their disastrous invasion; when we feel them we are dead."

"Oh! Gourville, this is going too far," replied Fouquet,
smiling; "allow me, my friend, not to be so easily
frightened; M. Colbert a meteor! Corbleu, we confront the
meteor. Let us see acts, and not words. What has he done?"

"He has ordered two gibbets of the executioner of Paris,"
answered Gourville.

Fouquet raised his head, and a flash gleamed from his eyes.
"Are you sure of what you say?" cried he.

"Here is the proof, monseigneur." And Gourville held out to
the superintendent a note communicated by a certain
secretary of the Hotel de Ville, who was one of Fouquet's
creatures.

"Yes, that is true," murmured the minister; "the scaffold
may be prepared, but the king has not signed; Gourville, the
king will not sign."

"I shall soon know," said Gourville.

"How?"

"If the king has signed, the gibbets will be sent this
evening to the Hotel de Ville, in order to be got up and
ready by to-morrow morning."

"Oh! no, no!" cried the superintendent once again; "you are
all deceived, and deceive me in my turn; Lyodot came to see
me only the day before yesterday; only three days ago I
received a present of some Syracuse wine from poor
D'Eymeris."

"What does that prove?" replied Gourville, "except that the
chamber of justice has been secretly assembled, has
deliberated in the absence of the accused, and that the
whole proceeding was complete when they were arrested."

"What! are they, then, arrested?"

"No doubt they are."

"But where, when, and how have they been arrested?"

"Lyodot, yesterday at daybreak; D'Eymeris, the day before
yesterday, in the evening, as he was returning from the
house of his mistress; their disappearance had disturbed
nobody; but at length M. Colbert all at once raised the
mask, and caused the affair to be published; it is being
cried by sound of trumpet, at this moment in Paris, and, in
truth, monseigneur, there is scarcely anybody but yourself
ignorant of the event."

Fouquet began to walk about his chamber with an uneasiness
that became more and more serious.

"What do you decide upon, monseigneur?" said Gourville.

"If it really were as you say, I would go to the king,"
cried Fouquet. "But as I go to the Louvre, I will pass by
the Hotel de Ville. We shall see if the sentence is signed."

"Incredulity! thou art the pest of all great minds," said
Gourville, shrugging his shoulders.

"Gourville!"

"Yes," continued he, "and incredulity! thou ruinest, as
contagion destroys the most robust health, that is to say,
in an instant."

"Let us go," cried Fouquet; "desire the door to be opened,
Gourville."

"Be cautious," said the latter, "the Abbe Fouquet is there."

"Ah! my brother," replied Fouquet, in a tone of annoyance,
"he is there, is he? he knows all the ill news, then, and is
rejoiced to bring it to me, as usual. The devil! if my
brother is there, my affairs are bad, Gourville; why did you
not tell me that sooner: I should have been the more readily
convinced."

"'Monseigneur calumniates him," said Gourville, laughing,
"if he is come, it is not with a bad intention."

"What, do you excuse him?" cried Fouquet; "a fellow without
a heart, without ideas; a devourer of wealth."

"He knows you are rich."

"And would ruin me."

"No, but he would like to have your purse. That is all."

"Enough! enough! A hundred thousand crowns per month, during
two years. Corbleu! it is I that pay, Gourville, and I know
my figures." Gourville laughed in a silent, sly manner.
"Yes, yes, you mean to say it is the king pays," said the
superintendent. "Ah, Gourville, that is a vile joke; this is
not the place."

"Monseigneur, do not be angry."

"Well, then, send away the Abbe Fouquet; I have not a sou."
Gourville made a step towards the door. "He has been a month
without seeing me," continued Fouquet, "why could he not be
two months?"

"Because he repents of living in bad company," said
Gourville, "and prefers you to all his bandits."

"Thanks for the preference! You make a strange advocate,
Gourville, to-day -- the advocate of the Abbe Fouquet!"

"Eh! but everything and every man has a good side -- their
useful side, monseigneur."

"The bandits whom the abbe keeps in pay and drink have their
useful side, have they? Prove that, if you please."

"Let the circumstance arise, monseigneur, and you will be
very glad to have these bandits under your hand."

"You advise me, then, to be reconciled to the abbe?" said
Fouquet, ironically.

"I advise you, monseigneur, not to quarrel with a hundred or
a hundred and twenty loose fellows, who, by putting their
rapiers end to end, would form a cordon of steel capable of
surrounding three thousand men."

Fouquet darted a searching glance at Gourville, and passing
before him, -- "That is all very well, let M. l'Abbe Fouquet
be introduced," said he to the footman. "You are right,
Gourville."

Two minutes after, the Abbe Fouquet appeared in the doorway,
with profound reverences. He was a man of from forty to
forty-five years of age, half churchman half soldier, -- a
spadassin, grafted upon an abbe; upon seeing that he had not
a sword by his side, you might be sure he had pistols.
Fouquet saluted him more as an elder brother than as a
minister.

"What can I do to serve you, monsieur l'abbe?" said he.

"Oh! oh! how coldly you speak to me, brother!"

"I speak like a man who is in a hurry, monsieur."

The abbe looked maliciously at Gourville, and anxiously at
Fouquet, and said, "I have three hundred pistoles to pay to
M. de Bregi this evening. A play debt, a sacred debt."

"What next?" said Fouquet bravely, for he comprehended that
the Abbe Fouquet would not have disturbed him for such a
want.

"A thousand to my butcher, who will supply no more meat."

"Next?"

"Twelve hundred to my tailor," continued the abbe; "the
fellow has made me take back seven suits of my people's,
which compromises my liveries, and my mistress talks of
replacing me by a farmer of the revenue, which would be a
humiliation for the church."

"What else?" said Fouquet.

"You will please to remark," said the abbe, humbly, "that I
have asked nothing for myself."

"That is delicate, monsieur," replied Fouquet; "so, as you
see, I wait."

"And I ask nothing, oh! no, -- it is not for want of need,
though, I assure you."

The minister reflected a minute. "Twelve hundred pistoles to
the tailor; that seems a great deal for clothes," said he.

"I maintain a hundred men," said the abbe, proudly; "that is
a charge, I believe."

"Why a hundred men?" said Fouquet. "Are you a Richelieu or a
Mazarin, to require a hundred men as a guard? What use do
you make of these men? -- speak."

"And do you ask me that?" cried the Abbe Fouquet; "ah! how
can you put such a question, -- why I maintain a hundred
men? Ah!"

"Why, yes, I do put that question to you. What have you to
do with a hundred men? -- answer."

"Ingrate!" continued the abbe, more and more affected.

"Explain yourself."

"Why, monsieur the superintendent, I only want one valet de
chambre, for my part, and even if I were alone, could help
myself very well; but you, you who have so many enemies -- a
hundred men are not enough for me to defend you with. A
hundred men! -- you ought to have ten thousand. I maintain,
then, these men in order that in public places, in
assemblies, no voice may be raised against you, and without
them, monsieur, you would be loaded with imprecations, you
would be torn to pieces, you would not last a week; no, not
a week, do you understand?"

"Ah! I did not know you were my champion to such an extent,
monsieur l'abbe."

"You doubt it!" cried the abbe. "Listen, then, to what
happened, no longer ago than yesterday, in the Rue de la
Hochette. A man was cheapening a fowl."

"Well, how could that injure me, abbe?"

"This way. The fowl was not fat. The purchaser refused to
give eighteen sous for it, saying that he could not afford
eighteen sous for the skin of a fowl from which M. Fouquet
had sucked all the fat."

"Go on."

"The joke caused a deal of laughter," continued the abbe;
"laughter at your expense, death to the devils! and the
canaille were delighted. The joker added, `Give me a fowl
fed by M. Colbert, if you like! and I will pay all you ask.'
And immediately there was a clapping of hands. A frightful
scandal! you understand; a scandal which forces a brother to
hide his face."

Fouquet colored. "And you veiled it?" said the
superintendent.

"No, for it so happened I had one of my men in the crowd; a
new recruit from the provinces, one M. Menneville, whom I
like very much. He made his way through the press, saying to
the joker: `Mille barbes! Monsieur the false joker, here's a
thrust for Colbert!' `And one for Fouquet,' replied the
joker. Upon which they drew in front of the cook's shop,
with a hedge of the curious round them, and five hundred as
curious at the windows."

"Well?" said Fouquet.

"Well, monsieur, my Menneville spitted the joker, to the
great astonishment of the spectators, and said to the cook:
-- `Take this goose, my friend, it is fatter than your
fowl.' That is the way, monsieur," ended the abbe,
triumphantly, "in which I spend my revenues; I maintain the
honor of the family, monsieur." Fouquet hung his head. "And
I have a hundred as good as he," continued the abbe.

"Very well," said Fouquet, "give the account to Gourville,
and remain here this evening."

"Shall we have supper?"

"Yes, there will be supper."

"But the chest is closed."

"Gourville will open it for you. Leave us, monsieur l'abbe,
leave us."

"Then we are friends?" said the abbe, with a bow.

Oh yes. friends. Come Gourville."

"Are you going out? You will not stay to supper, then?"

"I shall be back in an hour; rest easy, abbe." Then aside to
Gourville -- "Let them put to my English horses," said he,
"and direct the coachman to stop at the Hotel de Ville de
Paris."




CHAPTER 56

M. de la Fontaine's Wine



Carriages were already bringing the guests of Fouquet to
Saint-Mande; already the whole house was getting warm with
the preparations for supper, when the superintendent
launched his fleet horses upon the road to Paris, and going
by the quays, in order to meet fewer people on the way, soon
reached the Hotel de Ville. It wanted a quarter to eight.
Fouquet alighted at the corner of the Rue de Long-pont, and,
on foot, directed his course towards the Place de Greve,
accompanied by Gourville. At the turning of the Place they
saw a man dressed in black and violet, of dignified mien,
who was preparing to get into a hired carriage, and told the
coachman to stop at Vincennes. He had before him a large
hamper filled with bottles, which he had just purchased at
the cabaret with the sign of "L'Image-de-Notre-Dame."

"Eh, but! that is Vatel! my maitre d'hotel!" said Fouquet to
Gourville.

"Yes, monseigneur," replied the latter.

"What can he have been doing at the sign of
L'Image-de-Notre-Dame?"

"Buying wine, no doubt."

"What! buy wine for me, at a cabaret?" said Fouquet. "My
cellar, then, must be in a miserable condition!" and he
advanced towards the maitre d'hotel who was arranging his
bottles in the carriage with the most minute care.

"Hola! Vatel," said he, in the voice of a master.

"Take care, monseigneur!" said Gourville, "you will be
recognized."

"Very well! Of what consequence? -- Vatel!

The man dressed in black and violet turned round. He had a
good and mild countenance, without expression -- a
mathematician minus the pride. A certain fire sparkled in
the eyes of this personage, a rather sly smile played round
his lips; but the observer might soon have remarked that
this fire and this smile applied to nothing, enlightened
nothing. Vatel laughed like an absent man, and amused
himself like a child. At the sound of his master's voice he
turned round, exclaiming: "Oh! monseigneur!"

"Yes, it is I. What the devil are you doing here, Vatel?
Wine! You are buying wine at a cabaret in the Place de
Greve!"

"But, monseigneur," said Vatel, quietly, after having darted
a hostile glance at Gourville, "why am I interfered with
here? Is my cellar kept in bad order?"

"No, certes, Vatel, no, but ---- "

"But what?" replied Vatel. Gourville touched Fouquet's
elbow.

"Don't be angry, Vatel, I thought my cellar -- your cellar
-- sufficiently well stocked for us to be able to dispense
with recourse to the cellar of L'Image de-Notre-Dame."

"Eh, monsieur," said Vatel, shrinking from monseigneur to
monsieur with a degree of disdain: "your cellar is so well
stocked that when certain of your guests dine with you they
have nothing to drink."

Fouquet, in great surprise, looked at Gourville. "What do
you mean by that?"

"I mean that your butler had not wine for all tastes,
monsieur; and that M. de la Fontaine, M. Pellisson, and M.
Conrart, do not drink when they come to the house -- these
gentlemen do not like strong wine. What is to be done,
then?"

"Well, and therefore?"

"Well, then, I have found here a vin de Joigny, which they
like. I know they come once a week to drink at the
Image-de-Notre-Dame. That is the reason I am making this
provision."

Fouquet had no more to say; he was convinced. Vatel, on his
part, had much more to say, without doubt, and it was plain
he was getting warm. "It is just as if you would reproach
me, monseigneur, for going to the Rue Planche Milbray, to
fetch, myself, the cider M. Loret drinks when he comes to
dine at your house."

"Loret drinks cider at my house!" cried Fouquet, laughing.

"Certainly he does, monsieur, and that is the reason why he
dines there with pleasure."

"Vatel," cried Fouquet, pressing the hand of his maitre
d'hotel, "you are a man! I thank you, Vatel, for having
understood that at my house M. de la Fontaine, M. Conrart,
and M. Loret, are as great as dukes and peers, as great as
princes, greater than myself. Vatel, you are a good servant,
and I double your salary."

Vatel did not even thank his master, he merely shrugged his
shoulders a little, murmuring this superb sentiment: "To be
thanked for having done one's duty is humiliating."

"He is right," said Gourville, as he drew Fouquet's
attention, by a gesture, to another point. He showed him a
low-built tumbrel, drawn by two horses, upon which rocked
two strong gibbets, bound together, back to back, by chains,
whilst an archer, seated upon the cross-beam, suffered, as
well as he could, with his head cast down, the comments of a
hundred vagabonds, who guessed the destination of the
gibbets, and were escorting them to the Hotel de Ville.
Fouquet started. "It is decided, you see," said Gourville.

"But it is not done," replied Fouquet.

"Oh, do not flatter yourself, monseigneur; if they have thus
lulled your friendship and suspicions -- if things have gone
so far, you will be able to undo nothing."

"But I have not given my sanction."

"M. de Lyonne has ratified for you."

"I will go to the Louvre."

"Oh, no, you will not."

"Would you advise such baseness?" cried Fouquet, "would you
advise me to abandon my friends? would you advise me, whilst
able to fight, to throw the arms I hold in my hand to the
ground?"

"I do not advise you to do anything of the kind,
monseigneur. Are you in a position to quit the post of
superintendent at this moment?"

"No."

"Well, if the king wishes to displace you ---- "

"He will displace me absent as well as present."

"Yes, but you will not have insulted him."

"Yes, but I shall have been base; now I am not willing that
my friends should die; and they shall not die!"

"For that it is necessary you should go to the Louvre, is it
not?"

"Gourville!"

"Beware! once at the Louvre, you will be forced to defend
your friends openly, that is to say, to make a profession of
faith; or you will be forced to abandon them irrevocably."

"Never!"

"Pardon me, -- the king will propose the alternative to you,
rigorously, or else you will propose it to him yourself."

"That is true."

"That is the reason why conflict must be avoided. Let us
return to Saint-Mande, monseigneur."

"Gourville, I will not stir from this place, where the crime
is to be carried out, where my disgrace is to be
accomplished; I will not stir, I say, till I have found some
means of combating my enemies."

"Monseigneur," replied Gourville, "you would excite my pity,
if I did not know you for one of the great spirits of this
world. You possess a hundred and fifty millions, you are
equal to the king in position, and a hundred and fifty
millions his superior in money. M. Colbert has not even had
the wit to have the will of Mazarin accepted. Now, when a
man is the richest person in a kingdom, and will take the
trouble to spend the money, if things are done he does not
like it is because he is a poor man. Let us return to
Saint-Mande, I say."

"To consult with Pellisson? -- we will."

"So be it," said Fouquet, with angry eyes; -- "yes, to
Saint-Mande!" He got into his carriage again and Gourville
with him. Upon their road, at the end of the Faubourg
Saint-Antoine, they overtook the humble equipage of Vatel,
who was quietly conveying home his vin de Joigny. The black
horses, going at a swift pace, alarmed as they passed, the
timid hack of the maitre d'hotel, who, putting his head out
at the window, cried, in a fright, "Take care of my
bottles!"




CHAPTER 57

The Gallery of Saint-Mande



Fifty persons were waiting for the superintendent. He did
not even take the time to place himself in the hands of his
valet de chambre for a minute, but from the perron went
straight into the premier salon. There his friends were
assembled in full chat. The intendant was about to order
supper to be served, but, above all, the Abbe Fouquet
watched for the return of his brother, and was endeavoring
to do the honors of the house in his absence. Upon the
arrival of the superintendent, a murmur of joy and affection
was heard; Fouquet, full of affability, good humor, and
munificence, was beloved by his poets, his artists, and his
men of business. His brow, upon which his little court read,
as upon that of a god, all the movements of his soul, and
thence drew rules of conduct, -- his brow, upon which
affairs of state never impressed a wrinkle, was this evening
paler than usual, and more than one friendly eye remarked
that pallor. Fouquet placed himself at the head of the
table, and presided gayly during supper. He recounted
Vatel's expedition to La Fontaine, related the history of
Menneville and the skinny fowl to Pellisson, in such a
manner that all the table heard it. A tempest of laughter
and jokes ensued, which was only checked by a serious and
even sad gesture from Pellisson. The Abbe Fouquet, not being
able to comprehend why his brother should have led the
conversation in that direction, listened with all his ears,
and sought in the countenance of Gourville, or in that of
his brother, an explanation which nothing afforded him.
Pellisson took up the matter: -- "Did they mention M.
Colbert, then?" said he.

"Why not?" replied Fouquet; "if true, as it is said to be,
that the king has made him his intendant?" Scarcely had
Fouquet uttered these words, with a marked intention, than
an explosion broke forth among the guests.

"The miser!" said one.

"The mean, pitiful fellow!" said another.

"The hypocrite!" said a third.

Pellisson exchanged a meaning look with Fouquet.
"Messieurs," said he, "in truth we are abusing a man whom no
one knows: it is neither charitable nor reasonable; and here
is monsieur le surintendant, who, I am sure, agrees with
me."

"Entirely," replied Fouquet. "Let the fat fowls of M.
Colbert alone; our business to-day is with the faisans
truffes of M. Vatel." This speech stopped the dark cloud
which was beginning to throw its shade over the guests.
Gourville succeeded so well in animating the poets with the
vin de Joigny; the abbe, intelligent as a man who stands in
need of his host's money, so enlivened the financiers and
the men of the sword, that, amidst the vapors of this joy
and the noise of conversation, inquietudes disappeared
completely. The will of Cardinal Mazarin was the text of the
conversation at the second course and dessert; then Fouquet
ordered bowls of sweetmeats and fountains of liquors to be
carried into the salon adjoining the gallery. He led the way
thither conducting by the hand a lady, the queen, by his
preference, of the evening. The musicians then supped, and
the promenades in the gallery and the gardens commenced,
beneath a spring sky, mild and flower-scented. Pellisson
then approached the superintendent, and said: "Something
troubles monseigneur?"

"Greatly," replied the minister, "ask Gourville to tell you
what it is." Pellisson, on turning round, found La Fontaine
treading upon his heels. He was obliged to listen to a Latin
verse, which the poet had composed upon Vatel. La Fontaine
had, for an hour, been scanning this verse in all corners,
seeking some one to pour it out upon advantageously. He
thought he had caught Pellisson, but the latter escaped him;
he turned towards Sorel, who had, himself, just composed a
quatrain in honor of the supper, and the Amphytrion. La
Fontaine in vain endeavored to gain attention to his verses;
Sorel wanted to obtain a hearing for his quatrain. He was
obliged to retreat before M. le Comte de Chanost whose arm
Fouquet had just taken. L'Abbe Fouquet perceived that the
poet, absent-minded, as usual, was about to follow the two
talkers, and he interposed. La Fontaine seized upon him, and
recited his verses. The abbe, who was quite innocent of
Latin, nodded his head, in cadence, at every roll which La
Fontaine impressed upon his body, according to the
undulations of the dactyls and spondees. While this was
going on, behind the confiture-basins, Fouquet related the
event of the day to his son-in-law, M. de Chanost. "We will
send the idle and useless to look at the fireworks," said
Pellisson to Gourville, "whilst we converse here."

"So be it," said Gourville, addressing four words to Vatel.
The latter then led towards the gardens the major part of
the beaux, the ladies and the chatterers, whilst the men
walked in the gallery, lighted by three hundred wax-lights,
in the sight of all; the admirers of fireworks all ran away
towards the garden. Gourville approached Fouquet, and said:
"Monsieur, we are here."

"All!" said Fouquet.

"Yes, -- count." The superintendent counted; there were
eight persons. Pellisson and Gourville walked arm in arm, as
if conversing upon vague and frivolous subjects. Sorel and
two officers imitated them, in an opposite direction. The
Abbe Fouquet walked alone. Fouquet, with M. de Chanost,
walked as if entirely absorbed in the conversation of his
son-in-law. "Messieurs," said he, "let no one of you raise
his head as he walks, or appear to pay attention to me;
continue walking, we are alone, listen to me."

A perfect silence ensued, disturbed only by the distant
cries of the joyous guests, from the groves whence they
beheld the fireworks. It was a whimsical spectacle this, of
these men walking in groups, as if each one was occupied
about something, whilst lending attention really to only one
amongst them, who, himself, seemed to be speaking only to
his companion. "Messieurs," said Fouquet, "you have, without
doubt, remarked the absence of two of my friends this
evening, who were with us on Wednesday. For God's sake,
abbe, do not stop, -- it is not necessary to enable you to
listen; walk on, carrying your head in a natural way, and as
you have an excellent sight, place yourself at the window,
and if any one returns towards the gallery, give us notice
by coughing."

The abbe obeyed.

"I have not observed their absence," said Pellisson, who, at
this moment, was turning his back to Fouquet and walking the
other way.

"I do not see M. Lyodot," said Sorel, "who pays me my
pension."

"And I," said the abbe, at the window, "do not see M.
d'Eymeris, who owes me eleven hundred livres from our last
game at Brelan."

"Sorel," continued Fouquet, walking bent, and gloomily, "you
will never receive your pension any more from M. Lyodot; and
you, abbe, will never be paid your eleven hundred livres by
M. d'Eymeris, for both are doomed to die."

"To die!" exclaimed the whole assembly, arrested, in spite
of themselves, in the comedy they were playing, by that
terrible word.

"Recover yourselves, messieurs," said Fouquet, "for perhaps
we are watched -- I said: to die!"

"To die!" repeated Pellisson; "what, the men I saw six days
ago, full of health, gayety, and the spirit of the future!
What then is man, good God! that disease should thus bring
him down, all at once!"

"It is not a disease," said Fouquet.

"Then there is a remedy," said Sorel.

"No remedy. Messieurs de Lyodot and D'Eymeris are on the eve
of their last day."

"Of what are these gentlemen dying, then?" asked an officer.

"Ask of him who kills them," replied Fouquet.

"Who kills them? Are they being killed, then?" cried the
terrified chorus.

"They do better still; they are hanging them," murmured
Fouquet, in a sinister voice, which sounded like a funeral
knell in that rich gallery, splendid with pictures, flowers,
velvet, and gold. Involuntarily every one stopped; the abbe
quitted his window; the first fusees of the fireworks began
to mount above the trees. A prolonged cry from the gardens
attracted the superintendent to enjoy the spectacle. He drew
near to a window, and his friends placed themselves behind
him, attentive to his least wish. "Messieurs," said he, "M.
Colbert has caused to be arrested, tried and will execute my
two friends; what does it become me to do?"

"Mordieu!" exclaimed the abbe, the first one to speak, "run
M. Colbert through the body."

"Monseigneur," said Pellisson, "you must speak to his
majesty."

"The king, my dear Pellisson, himself signed the order for
the execution."

"Well!" said the Comte de Chanost, "the execution must not
take place, then; that is all."

"Impossible," said Gourville, "unless we could corrupt the
jailers."

"Or the governor," said Fouquet.

"This night the prisoners might be allowed to escape."

"Which of you will take charge of the transaction?"

"I," said the abbe, "will carry the money."

"And I," said Pellisson, "will be the bearer of the words."

"Words and money," said Fouquet, "five hundred thousand
livres to the governor of the conciergerie, that is
sufficient, nevertheless, it shall be a million, if
necessary."

"A million!" cried the abbe; "why, for less than half, I
would have half Paris sacked."

"There must be no disorder," said Pellisson. "The governor
being gained, the two prisoners escape; once clear of the
fangs of the law, they will call together the enemies of
Colbert, and prove to the king that his young justice, like
all other monstrosities, is not infallible."

"Go to Paris, then, Pellisson," said Fouquet, "and bring
hither the two victims; to-morrow we shall see."

Gourville gave Pellisson the five hundred thousand livres."
Take care the wind does not carry you away," said the abbe;
"what a responsibility. Peste! Let me help you a little."

"Silence!" said Fouquet, "somebody is coming. Ah! the
fireworks are producing a magical effect." At this moment a
shower of sparks fell rustling among the branches of the
neighboring trees. Pellisson and Gourville went out together
by the door of the gallery; Fouquet descended to the garden
with the five last plotters.




CHAPTER 58

Epicureans



As Fouquet was giving, or appearing to give, all his
attention to the brilliant illuminations, the languishing
music of the violins and hautboys, the sparkling sheaves of
the artificial fires, which, inflaming the heavens with
glowing reflections, marked behind the trees the dark
profile of the donjon of Vincennes; as, we say, the
superintendent was smiling on the ladies and the poets the
fete was every whit as gay as usual; and Vatel, whose
restless, even jealous look, earnestly consulted the aspect
of Fouquet, did not appear dissatisfied with the welcome
given to the ordering of the evening's entertainment. The
fireworks over, the company dispersed about the gardens and
beneath the marble porticoes with the delightful liberty
which reveals in the master of the house so much
forgetfulness of greatness, so much courteous hospitality,
so much magnificent carelessness. The poets wandered about,
arm in arm, through the groves; some reclined upon beds of
moss, to the great damage of velvet clothes and curled
heads, into which little dried leaves and blades of grass
insinuated themselves. The ladies, in small numbers,
listened to the songs of the singers and the verses of the
poets; others listened to the prose, spoken with much art,
by men who were neither actors nor poets, but to whom youth
and solitude gave an unaccustomed eloquence, which appeared
to them better than everything else in the world. "Why,"
said La Fontaine, "does not our master Epicurus descend into
the garden? Epicurus never abandoned his pupils, the master
is wrong."

"Monsieur," said Conrart, "you yourself are in the wrong
persisting in decorating yourself with the name of an
Epicurean; indeed, nothing here reminds me of the doctrine
of the philosopher of Gargetta."

"Bah!" said La Fontaine, "is it not written that Epicurus
purchased a large garden and lived in it tranquilly with his
friends?"

"That is true."

"Well, has not M. Fouquet purchased a large garden at
Saint-Mande, and do we not live here very tranquilly with
him and his friends?"

"Yes, without doubt; unfortunately it is neither the garden
nor the friends which constitute the resemblance. Now, what
likeness is there between the doctrine of Epicurus and that
of M. Fouquet?"

"This -- pleasure gives happiness."

"Next?"

"Well, I do not think we ought to consider ourselves
unfortunate, for my part, at least. A good repast -- vin de
Foigny, which they have the delicacy to go and fetch for me
from my favorite cabaret -- not one impertinence heard
during a supper an hour long, in spite of the presence of
ten millionaires and twenty poets."

"I stop you there. You mentioned vin de Foigny, and a good
repast, do you persist in that?"

"I persist, -- anteco, as they say at Port Royal."

"Then please to recollect that the great Epicurus lived, and
made his pupils live, upon bread, vegetables, and water."

"That is not certain," said La Fontaine; "and you appear to
me to be confounding Epicurus with Pythagoras, my dear
Conrart."

"Remember, likewise, that the ancient philosopher was rather
a bad friend of the gods and the magistrates."

"Oh! that is what I will not admit," replied La Fontaine.
"Epicurus was like M. Fouquet."

"Do not compare him to monsieur le surintendant," said
Conrart, in an agitated voice, "or you would accredit the
reports which are circulated concerning him and us."

"What reports?"

"That we are bad Frenchmen, lukewarm with regard to the
king, deaf to the law."

"I return, then, to my text," said La Fontaine. "Listen,
Conrart, this is the morality of Epicurus, whom, besides, I
consider, if I must tell you so, as a myth. Antiquity is
mostly mythical. Jupiter, if we give a little attention to
it, is life. Alcides is strength. The words are there to
bear me out; Zeus, that is, zen, to live. Alcides, that is,
alce, vigor. Well, Epicurus, that is mild watchfulness, that
is protection; now who watches better over the state, or who
protects individuals better than M. Fouquet does?"

"You talk etymology and not morality; I say that we modern
Epicureans are indifferent citizens."

"Oh!" cried La Fontaine, "if we become bad citizens, it is
not through following the maxims of our master. Listen to
one of his principal aphorisms."

"I -- will."

"Pray for good leaders."

"Well?"

"Well! what does M. Fouquet say to us every day? `When shall
we be governed?' Does he say so? Come, Conrart, be frank."

"He says so, that is true."

"Well, that is a doctrine of Epicurus."

"Yes; but that is a little seditious, observe."

"What! seditious to wish to be governed by good heads or
leaders?"

"Certainly, when those who govern are bad."

"Patience, I have a reply for all."

"Even for what I have just said to you?"

"Listen! would you submit to those who govern ill? Oh! it is
written: Cacos politeuousi. You grant me the text?"

"Pardieu! I think so. Do you know, you speak Greek as well
as AEsop did, my dear La Fontaine."

"Is there any wickedness in that, my dear Conrart?"

"God forbid I should say so."

"Then let us return to M. Fouquet. What did he repeat to us
all the day? Was it not this? `What a cuistre is that
Mazarin! what an ass! what a leech! We must, however, submit
to the fellow.' Now, Conrart, did he say so, or did he not?"

"I confess that he said it, and even perhaps too often."

"Like Epicurus, my friend, still like Epicurus; I repeat, we
are Epicureans, and that is very amusing."

"Yes, but I am afraid there will rise up, by the side of us,
a sect like that of Epictetus, you know him well; the
philosopher of Hieropolis, he who called bread luxury,
vegetables prodigality, and clear water drunkenness; he who,
being beaten by his master, said to him, grumbling a little
it is true, but without being angry, `I will lay a wager you
have broken my leg!' -- and who won his wager."

"He was a goose, that fellow Epictetus."

"Granted, but he might easily become the fashion by only
changing his name into that of Colbert."

"Bah!" replied La Fontaine, "that is impossible. Never will
you find Colbert in Epictetus."

"You are right, I shall find -- Coluber there, at the most."

"Ah! you are beaten, Conrart; you are reduced to a play upon
words. M. Arnaud pretends that I have no logic; I have more
than M. Nicolle."

"Yes," replied Conrart, "you have logic, but you are a
Jansenist."

This peroration was hailed with a boisterous shout of
laughter; by degrees the promenaders had been attracted by
the exclamations of the two disputants around the arbor
under which they were arguing. The discussion had been
religiously listened to, and Fouquet himself, scarcely able
to suppress his laughter, had given an example of
moderation. But with the denouement of the scene he threw
off all restraint, and laughed aloud. Everybody laughed as
he did, and the two philosophers were saluted with unanimous
felicitations. La Fontaine, however, was declared conqueror,
on account of his profound erudition and his irrefragable
logic. Conrart obtained the compensation due to an
unsuccessful combatant; he was praised for the loyalty of
his intentions, and the purity of his conscience.

At the moment when this jollity was manifesting itself by
the most lively demonstrations, when the ladies were
reproaching the two adversaries with not having admitted
women into the system of Epicurean happiness, Gourville was
seen hastening from the other end of the garden, approaching
Fouquet, and detaching him, by his presence alone, from the
group. The superintendent preserved on his face the smile
and character of carelessness; but scarcely was he out of
sight than he threw off the mask.

"Well!" said he, eagerly, "where is Pellisson! What is he
doing?"

"Pellisson has returned from Paris."

"Has he brought back the prisoners?"

"He has not even seen the concierge of the prison."

"What! did he not tell him he came from me?"

"He told him so, but the concierge sent him this reply: `If
any one came to me from M. Fouquet, he would have a letter
from M. Fouquet.'"

"Oh!" cried the latter, "if a letter is all he wants ---- "

"It is useless, monsieur!" said Pellisson, showing himself
at the corner of the little wood, "useless! Go yourself, and
speak in your own name."

"You are right. I will go in, as if to work; let the horses
remain harnessed, Pellisson. Entertain my friends,
Gourville."

"One last word of advice, monseigneur," replied the latter.

"Speak, Gourville."

"Do not go to the concierge save at the last minute; it is
brave, but it is not wise. Excuse me, Monsieur Pellisson, if
I am not of the same opinion as you; but take my advice,
monseigneur, send again a message to this concierge, -- he
is a worthy man, but do not carry it yourself."

"I will think of it," said Fouquet; "besides, we have all
the night before us."

"Do not reckon too much on time; were the hours we have
twice as many as they are, they would not be too much,"
replied Pellisson; "it is never a fault to arrive too soon."

"Adieu!" said the superintendent; "come with me, Pellisson.
Gourville, I commend my guests to your care." And he set
off. The Epicureans did not perceive that the head of the
school had left them; the violins continued playing all
night long.




CHAPTER 59

A Quarter of an Hour's Delay



Fouquet, on leaving his house for the second time that day,
felt himself less heavy and less disturbed than might have
been expected. He turned towards Pellisson, who was
meditating in the corner of the carriage some good arguments
against the violent proceedings of Colbert.

"My dear Pellisson," said Fouquet, "it is a great pity you
are not a woman."

"I think, on the contrary, it is very fortunate," replied
Pellisson, "for, monseigneur, I am excessively ugly."

"Pellisson! Pellisson!" said the superintendent, laughing:
"you repeat too often you are `ugly,' not to leave people to
believe that it gives you much pain."

"In fact it does, monseigneur, much pain; there is no man
more unfortunate than I: I was handsome, the smallpox
rendered me hideous; I am deprived of a great means of
attraction; now, I am your principal clerk or something of
that sort; I take great interest in your affairs, and if, at
this moment, I were a pretty woman, I could render you an
important service."

"What?"

"I would go and find the concierge of the Palais. I would
seduce him, for he is a gallant man, extravagantly partial
to women; then I would get away our two prisoners."

"I hope to be able to do so myself, although I am not a
pretty woman," replied Fouquet.

"Granted, monseigneur; but you are compromising yourself
very much."

"Oh!" cried Fouquet, suddenly, with one of those secret
transports which the generous blood of youth, or the
remembrance of some sweet emotion, infuses into the heart.
"Oh! I know a woman who will enact the personage we stand in
need of, with the lieutenant-governor of the conciergerie."

"And, on my part, I know fifty, monseigneur; fifty trumpets,
which will inform the universe of your generosity, of your
devotion to your friends, and, consequently, will ruin you
sooner or later in ruining themselves."

"I do not speak of such women, Pellisson, I speak of a noble
and beautiful creature who joins to the intelligence and wit
of her sex the valor and coolness of ours; I speak of a
woman, handsome enough to make the walls of a prison bow
down to salute her, discreet enough to let no one suspect by
whom she has been sent."

"A treasure!" said Pellisson, "you would make a famous
present to monsieur the governor of the conciergerie! Peste!
monseigneur, he might have his head cut off; but he would,
before dying, have had such happiness as no man had enjoyed
before him."

"And I add," said Fouquet, "that the concierge of the Palais
would not have his head cut off, for he would receive of me
my horses to effect his escape, and five hundred thousand
livres wherewith to live comfortably in England: I add, that
this lady, my friend, would give him nothing but the horses
and the money. Let us go and seek her, Pellisson."

The superintendent reached forth his hand towards the gold
and silken cord placed in the interior of his carriage, but
Pellisson stopped him. "Monseigneur," said he, "you are
going to lose as much time in seeking this lady as Columbus
took to discover the new world. Now, we have but two hours
in which we can possibly succeed; the concierge once gone to
bed, how shall we get at him without making a disturbance?
When daylight dawns, how can we conceal our proceedings? Go,
go yourself, monseigneur, and do not seek either woman or
angel to-night."

"But, my dear Pellisson, here we are before her door."

"What! before the angel's door?"

"Why, yes!"

"This is the hotel of Madame de Belliere!"

"Hush!"

"Ah! Good Lord!" exclaimed Pellisson.

"What have you to say against her?"

"Nothing, alas! and it is that which causes my despair.
Nothing, absolutely nothing. Why can I not, on the contrary,
say ill enough of her to prevent your going to her?"

But Fouquet had already given orders to stop, and the
carriage was motionless. "Prevent me!" cried Fouquet; "why,
no power on earth should prevent my going to pay my
compliments to Madame de Plessis-Belliere, besides, who
knows that we shall not stand in need of her!"

"No, monseigneur no!"

"But I do not wish you to wait for me, Pellisson," replied
Fouquet, sincerely courteous.

"The more reason I should, monseigneur; knowing that you are
keeping me waiting, you will, perhaps, stay a shorter time.
Take care! You see there is a carriage in the courtyard: she
has some one with her." Fouquet leant towards the steps of
the carriage. "One word more," cried Pellisson; "do not go
to this lady till you have been to the concierge, for
Heaven's sake!"

"Eh! five minutes, Pellisson," replied Fouquet, alighting at
the steps of the hotel, leaving Pellisson in the carriage,
in a very ill-humor. Fouquet ran upstairs, told his name to
the footman, which excited an eagerness and a respect that
showed the habit the mistress of the house had of honoring
that name in her family. "Monsieur le surintendant," cried
the marquise, advancing, very pale, to meet him; "what an
honor! what an unexpected pleasure!" said she. Then, in a
low voice, "Take care!" added the marquise, "Marguerite
Vanel is here!"

"Madame," replied Fouquet, rather agitated, "I came on
business. One single word, and quickly, if you please!" And
he entered the salon. Madame Vanel had risen, paler, more
livid, than Envy herself. Fouquet in vain addressed her,
with the most agreeable, most pacific salutation; she only
replied by a terrible glance darted at the marquise and
Fouquet. This keen glance of a jealous woman is a stiletto
which pierces every cuirass; Marguerite Vanel plunged it
straight into the hearts of the two confidants. She made a
courtesy to her friend, a more profound one to Fouquet, and
took leave, under pretense of having a number of visits to
make, without the marquise trying to prevent her, or
Fouquet, a prey to anxiety, thinking further about her. She
was scarcely out of the room, and Fouquet left alone with
the marquise, before he threw himself on his knees, without
saying a word. "I expected you," said the marquise, with a
tender sigh.

"Oh! no," cried he, "or you would have sent away that
woman."

"She has been here little more than half an hour, and I had
no expectation she would come this evening."

"You love me just a little, then, marquise?"

"That is not the question now; it is of your danger; how are
your affairs going on?"

"I am going this evening to get my friends out of the
prisons of the Palais."

"How will you do that?"

"By buying and bribing the governor."

"He is a friend of mine; can I assist you, without injuring
you?"

"Oh! marquise, it would be a signal service; but how can you
be employed without your being compromised? Now, never shall
my life, my power, or even my liberty, be purchased at the
expense of a single tear from your eyes, or of one frown of
pain upon your brow."

"Monseigneur, no more such words, they bewilder me; I have
been culpable in trying to serve you, without calculating
the extent of what I was doing. I love you in reality, as a
tender friend; and as a friend, I am grateful for your
delicate attentions -- but, alas! -- alas! you will never
find a mistress in me."

"Marquise!" cried Fouquet, in a tone of despair; "why not?"

"Because you are too much beloved," said the young woman, in
a low voice; "because you are too much beloved by too many
people -- because the splendor of glory and fortune wound my
eyes, whilst the darkness of sorrow attracts them; because,
in short, I, who have repulsed you in your proud
magnificence; I who scarcely looked at you in your splendor,
I came, like a mad woman, to throw myself, as it were, into
your arms, when I saw a misfortune hovering over your head.
You understand me now, monseigneur? Become happy again, that
I may remain chaste in heart and in thought; your misfortune
entails my ruin."

"Oh! madame," said Fouquet, with an emotion he had never
before felt; "were I to fall to the lowest degree of human
misery, and hear from your mouth that word which you now
refuse me, that day, madame, you will be mistaken in your
noble egotism; that day you will fancy you are consoling the
most unfortunate of men, and you will have said, I love you,
to the most illustrious, the most delighted, the most
triumphant of the happy beings of this world."

He was still at her feet, kissing her hand, when Pellisson
entered precipitately, crying, in very ill-humor,
"Monseigneur! madame! for Heaven's sake! excuse me.
Monseigneur, you have been here half an hour. Oh! do not
both look at me so reproachfully. Madame, pray who is that
lady who left your house soon after monseigneur came in?"

"Madame Vanel," said Fouquet.

"Ha!" cried Pellisson, "I was sure of that."

"Well! what then?"

"Why, she got into her carriage, looking deadly pale."

"What consequence is that to me?"

"Yes, but what she said to her coachman is of consequence to
you."

"Kind heaven!" cried the marquise, "what was that?"

"To M. Colbert's!" said Pellisson, in a hoarse voice.

"Bon Dieu! -- begone, begone, monseigneur!" replied the
marquise, pushing Fouquet out of the salon, whilst Pellisson
dragged him by the hand.

"Am I, then, indeed," said the superintendent, "become a
child, to be frightened by a shadow?"

"You are a giant," said the marquise, "whom a viper is
trying to bite in the heel."

Pellisson continued to drag Fouquet to the carriage. "To the
Palais at full speed!" cried Pellisson to the coachman. The
horses set off like lightning; no obstacle relaxed their
pace for an instant. Only, at the arcade Saint-Jean, as they
were coming out upon the Place de Greve, a long file of
horsemen, barring the narrow passage, stopped the carriage
of the superintendent. There was no means of forcing this
barrier; it was necessary to wait till the mounted archers
of the watch, for it was they who stopped the way, had
passed with the heavy carriage they were escorting, and
which ascended rapidly towards the Place Baudoyer. Fouquet
and Pellisson took no further account of this circumstance
beyond deploring the minute's delay they had thus to submit
to. They entered the habitation of the concierge du Palais
five minutes after. That officer was still walking about in
the front court. At the name of Fouquet, whispered in his
ear by Pellisson, the governor eagerly approached the
carriage, and, hat in his hand, was profuse in his
attentions. "What an honor for me, monseigneur," said he.

"One word, monsieur le gouverneur, will you take the trouble
to get into my carriage?" The officer placed himself
opposite Fouquet in the coach.

"Monsieur," said Fouquet, "I have a service to ask of you."

"Speak, monseigneur."

"A service that will be compromising for you, monsieur, but
which will assure to you forever my protection and my
friendship."

"Were it to cast myself into the fire for you, monseigneur,
I would do it."

"That is well," said Fouquet; "what I require is much more
simple."

"That being so, monseigneur, what is it?"

"To conduct me to the chamber of Messieurs Lyodot and
D'Eymeris."

"Will monseigneur have the kindness to say for what
purpose?"

"I will tell you in their presence, monsieur; at the same
time that I will give you ample means of palliating this
escape."

"Escape! Why, then, monseigneur does not know?"

"What?"

"That Messieurs Lyodot and D'Eymeris are no longer here."

"Since when?" cried Fouquet, in great agitation.

"About a quarter of an hour."

"Whither have they gone, then?"

"To Vincennes -- to the donjon."

"Who took them from here?"

"An order from the king."

"Oh! woe! woe!" exclaimed Fouquet, striking his forehead.
"Woe!" and without saying a single word more to the
governor, he threw himself back in his carriage, despair in
his heart, and death on his countenance.

"Well!" said Pellisson, with great anxiety.

"Our friends are lost. Colbert is conveying them to the
donjon. They crossed our very path under the arcade
Saint-Jean."

Pellisson, struck as by a thunderbolt, made no reply. With a
single reproach he would have killed his master. "Where is
monseigneur going?" said the footman.

"Hone -- to Paris. You, Pellisson, return to Saint-Mande,
and bring the Abbe Fouquet to me within an hour. Begone!"




CHAPTER 60

Plan of Battle



The night was already far advanced when the Abbe Fouquet
joined his brother. Gourville had accompanied him. These
three men, pale with dread of future events, resembled less
three powers of the day than three conspirators, united by
one single thought of violence. Fouquet walked for a long
time, with his eyes fixed upon the floor, striking his hands
one against the other. At length, taking courage, in the
midst of a deep sigh: "Abbe," said he, "you were speaking to
me only to-day of certain people you maintain."

"Yes, monsieur," replied the abbe.

"Tell me precisely who are these people." The abbe
hesitated.

"Come! no fear, I am not threatening; no romancing, for I am
not joking."

"Since you demand the truth, monseigneur, here it is: -- I
have a hundred and twenty friends or companions of pleasure,
who are sworn to me as the thief is to the gallows."

"And you think you can depend upon them?"

"Entirely."

"And you will not compromise yourself?"

"I will not even make my appearance."

"And are they men of resolution?"

"They would burn Paris, if I promised them they should not
be burnt in turn."

"The thing I ask of you, abbe," said Fouquet, wiping the
sweat which fell from his brow, "is to throw your hundred
and twenty men upon the people I will point out to you, at a
certain moment given -- is it possible?"

"It will not be the first time such a thing has happened to
them, monseigneur."

"That is well: but would these bandits attack an armed
force?"

"They are used to that."

"Then get your hundred and twenty men together, abbe."

"Directly. But where?"

"On the road to Vincennes, to-morrow, at two o'clock
precisely."

"To carry off Lyodot and D'Eymeris? There will be blows to
be got!"

"A number, no doubt; are you afraid?"

"Not for myself, but for you."

"Your men will know, then, what they have to do?"

"They are too intelligent not to guess it. Now, a minister
who gets up a riot against his king -- exposes himself ----
"

"Of what importance is that to you, I pray? Besides, if I
fall, you fall with me."

"It would then be more prudent, monsieur, not to stir in the
affair, and leave the king to take this little
satisfaction."

"Think well of this, abbe, Lyodot and D'Eymeris at Vincennes
are a prelude of ruin for my house. I repeat it -- I
arrested, you will be imprisoned -- I imprisoned, you will
be exiled."

"Monsieur, I am at your orders; have you any to give me?"

"What I told you -- I wish that, to-morrow, the two
financiers of whom they mean to make victims, whilst there
remain so many criminals unpunished, should be snatched from
the fury of my enemies. Take your measures accordingly. Is
it possible?"

"It is possible."

"Describe your plan."

"It is of rich simplicity. The ordinary guard at executions
consists of twelve archers."

"There will be a hundred to-morrow."

"I reckon so. I even say more -- there will be two hundred."

"Then your hundred and twenty men will not be enough."

"Pardon me. In every crowd composed of a hundred thousand
spectators, there are ten thousand bandits or cut-purses --
only they dare not take the initiative."

"Well?"

"There will then be, to-morrow, on the Place de Greve, which
I choose as my battle-field, ten thousand auxiliaries to my
hundred and twenty men. The attack commenced by the latter,
the others will finish it."

"That all appears feasible. But what will be done with
regard to the prisoners upon the Place de Greve?"

"This: they must be thrust into some house -- that will make
a siege necessary to get them out again. And stop! here is
another idea, more sublime still: certain houses have two
issues -- one upon the Place, and the other into the Rue de
la Mortellerie, or la Vennerie, or la Texeranderie. The
prisoners entering by one door will go out at another."

"Yes, but fix upon something positive."

"I am seeking to do so."

"And I," cried Fouquet, "I have found it. Listen to what has
occurred to me at this moment."

"I am listening."

Fouquet made a sign to Gourville, who appeared to
understand. "One of my friends lends me sometimes the keys
of a house which he rents, Rue Baudoyer, the spacious
gardens of which extend behind a certain house on the Place
de Greve."

"That is the place for us," said the abbe. "What house?"

"A cabaret, pretty well frequented, whose sign represents
the image of Notre Dame."

"I know it," said the abbe.

"This cabaret has windows opening upon the Place, a place of
exit into the court, which must abut upon the gardens of my
friend by a door of communication."

"Good!" said the abbe.

"Enter by the cabaret, take the prisoners in; defend the
door while you enable them to fly by the garden and the
Place Baudoyer."

"That is all plain. Monsieur, you would make an excellent
general, like monsieur le prince."

"Have you understood me?"

"Perfectly well."

"How much will it amount to, to make your bandits all drunk
with wine, and to satisfy them with gold?"

"Oh, monsieur, what an expression! Oh! monsieur, if they
heard you: some of them are very susceptible."

"I mean to say they must be brought no longer to know the
heavens from the earth; for I shall to-morrow contend with
the king; and when I fight I mean to conquer -- please to
understand."

"It shall be done, monsieur. Give me your other ideas."

"That is your business."

"Then give me your purse."

"Gourville, count a hundred thousand livres for the abbe."

"Good! and spare nothing, did you not say?"

"Nothing."

"That is well."

"Monseigneur," objected Gourville, "if this should be known,
we should lose our heads."

"Eh! Gourville," replied Fouquet, purple with anger, "you
excite my pity. Speak for yourself, if you please. My head
does not shake in that manner upon my shoulders. Now, abbe,
is everything arranged?"

"Everything."

"At two o'clock to-morrow."

"At twelve, because it will be necessary to prepare our
auxiliaries in a secret manner."

"That is true; do not spare the wine of the cabaretier."

"I will spare neither his wine nor his house," replied the
abbe, with a sneering laugh. "I have my plan, I tell you;
leave me to set it in operation, and you shall see."

"Where shall you be yourself?"

"Everywhere; nowhere."

"And how shall I receive information?"

"By a courier whose horse shall be kept in the very garden
of your friend. A propos, the name of your friend?"

Fouquet looked again at Gourville. The latter came to the
succor of his master, saying, "Accompanying monsieur l'abbe
for several reasons, only the house is easily to be known,
the `Image-de-Notre-Dame' in the front, a garden, the only
one in the quarter, behind."

"Good, good! I will go and give notice to my soldiers."

"Accompany him, Gourville," said Fouquet, "and count him
down the money. One moment, abbe -- one moment, Gourville --
what name will be given to this carrying off?"

"A very natural one, monsieur -- the Riot."

"The riot on account of what? For, if ever the people of
Paris are disposed to pay their court to the king, it is
when he hangs financiers."

"I will manage that," said the abbe.

"Yes; but you may manage it badly, and people will guess."

"Not at all, -- not at all. I have another idea."

"What is that?"

"My men shall cry out, `Colbert, vive Colbert!' and shall
throw themselves upon the prisoners as if they would tear
them in pieces, and shall force them from the gibbets, as
too mild a punishment."

"Ah! that is an idea," said Gourville. "Peste! monsieur
l'abbe, what an imagination you have!"

"Monsieur, we are worthy of our family," replied the abbe,
proudly.

"Strange fellow," murmured Fouquet. Then he added, "That is
ingenious. Carry it out, but shed no blood."

Gourville and the abbe set off together, with their heads
full of the meditated riot. The superintendent laid himself
down upon some cushions, half valiant with respect to the
sinister projects of the morrow, half dreaming of love.




CHAPTER 61

The Cabaret of the Image-de-Notre-Dame



At two o'clock the next day fifty thousand spectators had
taken their position upon the Place, around the two gibbets
which had been elevated between the Quai de la Greve and the
Quai Pelletier; one close to the other, with their backs to
the embankment of the river. In the morning also, all the
sworn criers of the good city of Paris had traversed the
quarters of the city, particularly the halles and the
faubourgs, announcing with their hoarse and indefatigable
voices, the great justice done by the king upon two
speculators, two thieves, devourers of the people. And these
people, whose interests were so warmly looked after, in
order not to fail in respect for their king quitted shops,
stalls, and ateliers to go and evince a little gratitude to
Louis XIV., absolutely like invited guests, who feared to
commit an impoliteness in not repairing to the house of him
who had invited them. According to the tenor of the
sentence, which the criers read aloud and incorrectly, two
farmers of the revenues, monopolists of money, dilapidators
of the royal provisions, extortioners, and forgers, were
about to undergo capital punishment on the Place de Greve,
with their names blazoned over their heads, according to
their sentence. As to those names, the sentence made no
mention of them. The curiosity of the Parisians was at its
height, and, as we have said, an immense crowd waited with
feverish impatience the hour fixed for the execution. The
news had already spread that the prisoners, transferred to
the Chateau of Vincennes, would be conducted from that
prison to the Place de Greve. Consequently, the faubourg and
the Rue Saint Antoine were crowded, for the population of
Paris in those days of great executions was divided into two
categories: those who came to see the condemned pass --
these were of timid and mild hearts, but philosophically
curious -- and those who wished to see the condemned die --
these had hearts that hungered for sensation. On this day M.
d'Artagnan received his last instructions from the king, and
made his adieus to his friends, the number of whom was, at
the moment, reduced to Planchet, traced the plan of his day,
as every busy man whose moments are counted ought to do
because he appreciates their importance.

"My departure is to be," said he, "at break of day, three
o'clock in the morning; I have then fifteen hours before me.
Take from them the six hours of sleep which are
indispensable for me -- six; one hour for repasts -- seven;
one hour for a farewell visit to Athos -- eight; two hours
for chance circumstances ---total, ten. There are then five
hours left. One hour to get my money, -- that is, to have
payment refused by M. Fouquet; another hour to go and
receive my money of M. Colbert, together with his questions
and grimaces; one hour to look over my clothes and arms, and
get my boots cleaned. I have still two hours left. Mordioux!
how rich I am!" And so saying, D'Artagnan felt a strange
joy, a joy of youth, a perfume of those great and happy
years of former times mount into his brain and intoxicate
him. "During these two hours I will go," said the musketeer,
"and take my quarter's rent of the Image-de-Notre-Dame. That
will be pleasant. Three hundred and seventy-five livres.
Mordioux! but that is astonishing! If the poor man who has
but one livre in his pocket, found a livre and twelve
deniers, that would be justice, that would be excellent; but
never does such a godsend fall to the lot of the poor man.
The rich man, on the contrary, makes himself revenues with
his money, which he does not even touch. Here are three
hundred and seventy-five livres which fall to me from
heaven. I will go then to the Image-de-Notre-Dame, and drink
a glass of Spanish wine with my tenant, which he cannot fail
to offer me. But order must be observed, Monsieur
d'Artagnan, order must be observed! Let us organize our
time, then, and distribute the employment of it! Art. 1st,
Athos; Art. 2d, the Image-de-Notre-Dame; Art. 3d, M.
Fouquet, Art. 4th, M. Colbert; Art. 5th, supper; Art. 6th,
clothes, boots, horse, portmanteau; Art. 7th and last,
sleep."

In consequence of this arrangement, D'Artagnan went straight
to the Comte de la Fere, to whom modestly and ingenuously he
related a part of his fortunate adventures. Athos had not
been without uneasiness on the subject of D'Artagnan's visit
to the king; but few words sufficed for an explanation of
that. Athos divined that Louis had charged D'Artagnan with
some important mission, and did not even make an effort to
draw the secret from him. He only recommended him to take
care of himself, and offered discreetly to accompany him if
that were desirable.

"But, my dear friend," said D'Artagnan, "I am going
nowhere."

"What! you come and bid me adieu, and are going nowhere?"

"Oh! yes, yes," replied D'Artagnan, coloring a little, "I am
going to make an acquisition."

"That is quite another thing. Then I change my formula.
Instead of `Do not get yourself killed,' I will say, -- `Do
not get yourself robbed.'"

"My friend, I will inform you if I set eyes on any property
that pleases me, and shall expect you will favor me with
your opinion."

"Yes, yes," said Athos, too delicate to permit himself even
the consolation of a smile. Raoul imitated the paternal
reserve. But D'Artagnan thought it would appear too
mysterious to leave his friends under a pretense, without
even telling them the route he was about to take.

"I have chosen Le Mans," said he to Athos. "Is it a good
country?"

"Excellent, my friend," replied the count, without making
him observe that Le Mans was in the same direction as La
Touraine, and that by waiting two days, at most, he might
travel with a friend. But D'Artagnan, more embarrassed than
the count, dug, at every explanation, deeper into the mud,
into which he sank by degrees. "I shall set out to-morrow at
daybreak," said he at last. "Till that time, will you come
with me, Raoul?"

"Yes, monsieur le chevalier," said the young man, "if
monsieur le comte does not want me."

"No, Raoul I am to have an audience to-day of Monsieur, the
king's brother; that is all I have to do."

Raoul asked Grimaud for his sword, which the old man brought
him immediately. "Now then," added D'Artagnan, opening his
arms to Athos, "adieu, my dear friend!" Athos held him in a
long embrace, and the musketeer, who knew his discretion so
well, murmured in his ear -- "An affair of state," to which
Athos only replied by a pressure of the hand, still more
significant. They then separated. Raoul took the arm of his
old friend, who led him along the Rue-Saint-Honore. "I am
conducting you to the abode of the god Plutus," said
D'Artagnan to the young man; "prepare yourself. The whole
day you will witness the piling up of crowns. Heavens! how I
am changed!"

"Oh! what numbers of people there are in the street!" said
Raoul.

"Is there a procession to-day?" asked D'Artagnan of a
passer-by.

"Monsieur, it is a hanging," replied the man.

"What! a hanging at the Greve?" said D'Artagnan.

"Yes, monsieur."

"The devil take the rogue who gets himself hung the day I
want to go and take my rent!" cried D'Artagnan. "Raoul, did
you ever see anybody hung?"

"Never, monsieur -- thank God!"

"Oh! how young that sounds! If you were on guard in the
trenches, as I was, and a spy! But, pardon me, Raoul, I am
doting -- you are quite right, it is a hideous sight to see
a person hung! At what hour do they hang them, monsieur, if
you please?"

"Monsieur," replied the stranger respectfully, delighted at
joining conversation with two men of the sword, "it will
take place about three o'clock."

"Aha! it is now only half-past one; let us step out, we
shall be there in time to touch my three hundred and
seventy-five livres, and get away before the arrival of the
malefactor."

"Malefactors, monsieur," continued the bourgeois; "there are
two of them."

"Monsieur, I return you many thanks," said D'Artagnan, who,
as he grew older, had become polite to a degree. Drawing
Raoul along, he directed his course rapidly in the direction
of La Greve. Without that great experience musketeers have
of a crowd, to which were joined an irresistible strength of
wrist, and an uncommon suppleness of shoulders, our two
travelers would not have arrived at their place of
destination. They followed the line of the Quai, which they
had gained on quitting the Rue Saint-Honore, where they left
Athos. D'Artagnan went first; his elbow, his wrist, his
shoulder formed three wedges which he knew how to insinuate
with skill into the groups, to make them split and separate
like firewood. He made use sometimes of the hilt of his
sword as an additional help: introducing it between ribs
that were too rebellious, making it take the part of a lever
or crowbar, to separate husband from wife, uncle from
nephew, and brother from brother. And all this was done so
naturally, and with such gracious smiles, that people must
have had ribs of bronze not to cry thank you when the wrist
made its play, or hearts of diamond not to be enchanted when
such a bland smile enlivened the lips of the musketeer.
Raoul, following his friend, cajoled the women who admired
his beauty, pushed back the men who felt the rigidity of his
muscles, and both opened, thanks to these maneuvers, the
compact and muddy tide of the populace. They arrived in
sight of the two gibbets, from which Raoul turned away his
eyes in disgust. As for D'Artagnan, he did not even see
them; his house with its gabled roof, its windows crowded
with the curious, attracted and even absorbed all the
attention he was capable of. He distinguished in the Place
and around the houses a good number of musketeers on leave,
who, some with women, others with friends, awaited the
crowning ceremony. What rejoiced him above all was to see
that his tenant, the cabaretier, was so busy he hardly knew
which way to turn. Three lads could not supply the drinkers.
They filled the shop, the chambers, and the court, even.
D'Artagnan called Raoul's attention to this concourse,
adding: "The fellow will have no excuse for not paying his
rent. Look at those drinkers, Raoul, one would say they were
jolly companions. Mordioux! why, there is no room anywhere!"
D'Artagnan, however, contrived to catch hold of the master
by the corner of his apron, and to make himself known to
him.

"Ah, monsieur le chevalier," said the cabaretier, half
distracted, "one minute if you please. I have here a hundred
mad devils turning my cellar upside down."

"The cellar, if you like, but not the money-box."

"Oh, monsieur, your thirty-seven and a half pistoles are all
counted out ready for you, upstairs in my chamber, but there
are in that chamber thirty customers, who are sucking the
staves of a little barrel of Oporto which I tapped for them
this very morning. Give me a minute, -- only a minute."

"So be it; so be it."

"I will go," said Raoul, in a low voice, to D'Artagnan;
"this hilarity is vile!"

"Monsieur," replied D'Artagnan, sternly, "you will please to
remain where you are. The soldier ought to familiarize
himself with all kinds of spectacles. There are in the eye,
when it is young, fibers which we must learn how to harden;
and we are not truly generous and good save from the moment
when the eye has become hardened, and the heart remains
tender. Besides, my little Raoul, would you leave me alone
here? That would be very wrong of you. Look, there is yonder
in the lower court a tree, and under the shade of that tree
we shall breathe more freely than in this hot atmosphere of
spilt wine."

From the spot on which they had placed themselves the two
new guests of the Image-de-Notre-Dame heard the
ever-increasing hubbub of the tide of people, and lost
neither a cry nor a gesture of the drinkers, at tables in
the cabaret, or disseminated in the chambers. If D'Artagnan
had wished to place himself as a vidette for an expedition,
he could not have succeeded better. The tree under which he
and Raoul were seated covered them with its already thick
foliage; it was a low, thick chestnut-tree, with inclined
branches, that cast their shade over a table so dilapidated
the drinkers had abandoned it. We said that from this post
D'Artagnan saw everything. He observed the goings and
comings of the waiters; the arrival of fresh drinkers; the
welcome, sometimes friendly, sometimes hostile, given to the
newcomers by others already installed. He observed all this
to amuse himself, for the thirty-seven and a half pistoles
were a long time coming. Raoul recalled his attention to it.
"Monsieur," said he, "you do not hurry your tenant, and the
condemned will soon be here. There will then be such a press
we shall not be able to get out."

"You are right," said the musketeer; "Hola! oh! somebody
there! Mordioux!" But it was in vain he cried and knocked
upon the wreck of the old table, which fell to pieces
beneath his fist; nobody came.

D'Artagnan was preparing to go and seek the cabaretier
himself, to force him to a definite explanation, when the
door of the court in which he was with Raoul, a door which
communicated with the garden situated at the back, opened,
and a man dressed as a cavalier, with his sword in the
sheath, but not at his belt, crossed the court without
closing the door; and having cast an oblique glance at
D'Artagnan and his companion, directed his course towards
the cabaret itself, looking about in all directions with his
eyes capable of piercing walls of consciences. "Humph!" said
D'Artagnan, "my tenants are communicating. That, no doubt,
now, is some amateur in hanging matters." At the same moment
the cries and disturbance in the upper chambers ceased.
Silence, under such circumstances, surprises more than a
twofold increase of noise. D'Artagnan wished to see what was
the cause of this sudden silence. He then perceived that
this man, dressed as a cavalier, had just entered the
principal chamber, and was haranguing the tipplers, who all
listened to him with the greatest attention. D'Artagnan
would perhaps have heard his speech but for the dominant
noise of the popular clamors, which made a formidable
accompaniment to the harangue of the orator. But it was soon
finished, and all the people the cabaret contained came out,
one after the other, in little groups, so that there only
remained six in the chamber; one of these six, the man with
the sword, took the cabaretier aside, engaging him in
discourse more or less serious, whilst the others lit a
great fire in the chimney-place -- a circumstance rendered
strange by the fine weather and the heat.

"It is very singular," said D'Artagnan to Raoul, "but I
think I know those faces yonder."

"Don't you think you can smell the smoke here?" said Raoul

"I rather think I can smell a conspiracy," replied
D'Artagnan.

He had not finished speaking, when four of these men came
down into the court, and without the appearance of any bad
design, mounted guard at the door of communication, casting,
at intervals, glances at D'Artagnan, which signified many
things.

"Mordioux!" said D'Artagnan, in a low voice, "there is
something going on. Are you curious, Raoul?"

"According to the subject, chevalier."

"Well, I am as curious as an old woman. Come a little more
in front; we shall get a better view of the place. I would
lay a wager that view will be something curious."

"But you know, monsieur le chevalier, that I am not willing
to become a passive and indifferent spectator of the death
of the two poor devils."

"And I, then -- do you think I am a savage? We will go in
again, when it is time to do so. Come along!" And they made
their way towards the front of the house, and placed
themselves near the window which, still more strangely than
the rest, remained unoccupied. The two last drinkers,
instead of looking out at this window, kept up the fire. On
seeing D'Artagnan and his friend enter: -- "Ah! ah! a
reinforcement," murmured they.

D'Artagnan jogged Raoul's elbow. "Yes, my braves, a
reinforcement," said he; "cordieu! there is a famous fire.
Whom are you going to cook?"

The two men uttered a shout of jovial laughter, and, instead
of answering, threw on more wood. D'Artagnan could not take
his eyes off them.

"I suppose," said one of the fire-makers, "they sent you to
tell us the time -- did not they?"

"Without doubt they have," said D'Artagnan, anxious to know
what was going on; "why should I be here else, if it were
not for that?"

"Then place yourself at the window, if you please, and
observe." D'Artagnan smiled in his mustache, made a sign to
Raoul, and placed himself at the window.




CHAPTER 62

Vive Colbert!



The spectacle which the Greve now presented was a frightful
one. The heads, leveled by the perspective, extended afar,
thick and agitated as the ears of corn in a vast plain. From
time to time a fresh report, or a distant rumor, made the
heads oscillate and thousands of eyes flash. Now and then
there were great movements. All those ears of corn bent, and
became waves more agitated than those of the ocean, which
rolled from the extremities to the center, and beat, like
the tides, against the hedge of archers who surrounded the
gibbets. Then the handles of the halberds were let fall upon
the heads and shoulders of the rash invaders; at times,
also, it was the steel as well as the wood, and, in that
case, a large empty circle was formed around the guard; a
space conquered upon the extremities, which underwent, in
their turn the oppression of the sudden movement, which
drove them against the parapets of the Seine. From the
window, that commanded a view of the whole Place, D'Artagnan
saw, with interior satisfaction, that such of the musketeers
and guards as found themselves involved in the crowd, were
able, with blows of their fists and the hilts of their
swords, to keep room. He even remarked that they had
succeeded, by that esprit de corps which doubles the
strength of the soldier, in getting together in one group to
the amount of about fifty men; and that, with the exception
of a dozen stragglers whom he still saw rolling here and
there, the nucleus was complete, and within reach of his
voice. But it was not the musketeers and guards only that
drew the attention of D'Artagnan. Around the gibbets, and
particularly at the entrances to the arcade of Saint Jean,
moved a noisy mass, a busy mass; daring faces, resolute
demeanors were to be seen here and there, mingled with silly
faces and indifferent demeanors; signals were exchanged,
hands given and taken. D'Artagnan remarked among the groups,
and those groups the most animated, the face of the cavalier
whom he had seen enter by the door of communication from his
garden, and who had gone upstairs to harangue the drinkers.
That man was organizing troops and giving orders.

"Mordioux!" said D'Artagnan to himself, "I was not deceived;
I know that man, -- it is Menneville. What the devil is he
doing here?"

A distant murmur, which became more distinct by degrees,
stopped this reflection, and drew his attention another way.
This murmur was occasioned by the arrival of the culprits; a
strong picket of archers preceded them, and appeared at the
angle of the arcade. The entire crowd now joined as if in
one cry; all the cries united formed one immense howl.
D'Artagnan saw Raoul was becoming pale, and he slapped him
roughly on the shoulder. The fire-keepers turned round on
hearing the great cry, and asked what was going on. "The
condemned are arrived," said D'Artagnan. "That's well,"
replied they, again replenishing the fire. D'Artagnan looked
at them with much uneasiness; it was evident that these men
who were making such a fire for no apparent purpose had some
strange intentions. The condemned appeared upon the Place.
They were walking, the executioner before them, whilst fifty
archers formed a hedge on their right and their left. Both
were dressed in black; they appeared pale, but firm. They
looked impatiently over the people's heads, standing on
tip-toe at every step. D'Artagnan remarked this. "Mordioux!"
cried he, "they are in a great hurry to get a sight of the
gibbet!" Raoul drew back, without, however, having the power
to leave the window. Terror even has its attractions.

"To the death! to the death!" cried fifty thousand voices.

"Yes; to the death!" howled a hundred frantic others, as if
the great mass had given them the reply.

"To the halter! to the halter!" cried the great whole; "Vive
le roi!"

"Well," said D'Artagnan, "this is droll; I should have
thought it was M. Colbert who had caused them to be hung."

There was, at this moment, a great rolling movement in the
crowd, which stopped for a moment the march of the
condemned. The people of a bold and resolute mien, whom
D'Artagnan had observed, by dint of pressing, pushing, and
lifting themselves up, had succeeded in almost touching the
hedge of archers. The cortege resumed its march. All at
once, to cries of "Vive Colbert!" those men, of whom
D'Artagnan never lost sight, fell upon the escort, which in
vain endeavored to stand against them. Behind these men was
the crowd. Then commenced, amidst a frightful tumult, as
frightful a confusion. This time there was something more
than cries of expectation or cries of joy, there were cries
of pain. Halberds struck men down, swords ran them through,
muskets were discharged at them. The confusion became then
so great that D'Artagnan could no longer distinguish
anything. Then, from this chaos, suddenly surged something
like a visible intention, like a will pronounced. The
condemned had been torn from the hands of the guards, and
were being dragged towards the house of
L'Image-de-Notre-Dame. Those who dragged them shouted, "Vive
Colbert!" The people hesitated, not knowing which they ought
to fall upon, the archers or the aggressors. What stopped
the people was, that those who cried "Vive Colbert!" began
to cry, at the same time, "No halter! no halter! to the
fire! to the fire! burn the thieves! burn the extortioners!"
This cry, shouted with an ensemble, obtained enthusiastic
success. The populace had come to witness an execution, and
here was an opportunity offered them of performing one
themselves. It was this that must be most agreeable to the
populace: therefore, they ranged, themselves immediately on
the party of the aggressors against the archers, crying with
the minority, which had become, thanks to them, the most
compact majority: "Yes, yes: to the fire with the thieves!
Vive Colbert!"

"Mordioux!" exclaimed D'Artagnan, "this begins to look
serious."

One of the men who remained near the chimney approached the
window, a firebrand in his hand. "Ah, ah!" said he, "it gets
warm." Then, turning to his companion: "There is the
signal," added he; and he immediately applied the burning
brand to the wainscoting. Now, this cabaret of the
Image-de-Notre-Dame was not a very newly-built house, and
therefore did not require much entreating to take fire. In a
second the boards began to crackle, and the flames arose
sparkling to the ceiling. A howling from without replied to
the shouts of the incendiaries. D'Artagnan, who had not seen
what passed, from being engaged at the window, felt, at the
same time, the smoke which choked him and the fire that
scorched him. "Hola!" cried he, turning round, "is the fire
here? Are you drunk or mad, my masters?"

The two men looked at each other with an air of
astonishment. "In what?" asked they of D'Artagnan; "was it
not a thing agreed upon?"

"A thing agreed upon that you should burn my house!"
vociferated D'Artagnan, snatching the brand from the hand of
the incendiary, and striking him with it across the face.
The second wanted to assist his comrade, but Raoul, seizing
him by the middle, threw him out of the window, whilst
D'Artagnan pushed his man down the stairs. Raoul, first
disengaged, tore the burning wainscoting down, and threw it
flaming into the chamber. At a glance D'Artagnan saw there
was nothing to be feared from the fire, and sprang to the
window. The disorder was at its height. The air was filled
with simultaneous cries of "To the fire!" "To the death!"
"To the halter!" "To the stake!" "Vive Colbert!" "Vive le
roi!" The group which had forced the culprits from the hands
of the archers had drawn close to the house, which appeared
to be the goal towards which they dragged them. Menneville
was at the head of this group, shouting louder than all the
others, "To the fire! to the fire! Vive Colbert!" D'Artagnan
began to comprehend what was meant. They wanted to burn the
condemned, and his house was to serve as a funeral pile.

"Halt, there!" cried he, sword in hand, and one foot upon
the window. "Menneville, what do you want to do?"

"Monsieur d'Artagnan," cried the latter; "give way, give
way!"

"To the fire! to the fire with the thieves! Vive Colbert!"

These cries exasperated D'Artagnan. "Mordioux!" said he.
"What! burn the poor devils who are only condemned to be
hung? that is infamous!"

Before the door, however, the mass of anxious spectators,
rolled back against the walls, had become more thick, and
closed up the way. Menneville and his men, who were dragging
along the culprits, were within ten paces of the door.

Menneville made a last effort. "Passage! passage!" cried he,
pistol in hand.

"Burn them! burn them!" repeated the crowd. "The
Image-de-Notre-Dame is on fire! Burn the thieves! burn the
monopolists in the Image-de-Notre-Dame!"

There now remained no doubt, it was plainly D'Artagnan's
house that was their object. D'Artagnan remembered the old
cry, always so effective from his mouth:

"A moi! mousquetaires!" shouted he, with the voice of a
giant, with one of those voices which dominate over cannon,
the sea, the tempest. "A moi! mousquetaires!" And suspending
himself by the arm from the balcony, he allowed himself to
drop amidst the crowd, which began to draw back from a house
that rained men. Raoul was on the ground as soon as he, both
sword in hand. All the musketeers on the Place heard that
challenging cry -- all turned round at that cry, and
recognized D'Artagnan. "To the captain, to the captain!"
cried they, in their turn. And the crowd opened before them
as though before the prow of a vessel. At that moment
D'Artagnan and Menneville found themselves face to face.
"Passage, passage!" cried Menneville, seeing that he was
within an arm's length of the door.

"No one passes here," said D'Artagnan.

"Take that, then!" said Menneville, firing his pistol,
almost within arm's length. But before the cock fell,
D'Artagnan had struck up Menneville's arm with the hilt of
his sword and passed the blade through his body.

"I told you plainly to keep yourself quiet," said D'Artagnan
to Menneville, who rolled at his feet.

"Passage! passage!" cried the companions of Menneville, at
first terrified, but soon recovering, when they found they
had only to do with two men. But those two men were
hundred-armed giants, the swords flew about in their hands
like the burning glaive of the archangel. They pierce with
its point, strike with the flat, cut with the edge, every
stroke brings down a man. "For the king!" cried D'Artagnan,
to every man he struck at, that is to say, to every man that
fell. This cry became the charging word for the musketeers,
who guided by it, joined D'Artagnan. During this time the
archers, recovering from the panic they had undergone,
charge the aggressors in the rear, and regular as mill
strokes, overturn or knock down all that oppose them. The
crowd, which sees swords gleaming, and drops of blood flying
in the air -- the crowd falls back and crushes itself. At
length cries for mercy and of despair resound; that is, the
farewell of the vanquished. The two condemned are again in
the hands of the archers. D'Artagnan approaches them, seeing
them pale and sinking: "Console yourselves, poor men," said
he, "you will not undergo the frightful torture with which
these wretches threatened you. The king has condemned you to
be hung: you shall only be hung. Go on, hang them, and it
will be over."

There is no longer anything going on at the
Image-de-Notre-Dame. The fire has been extinguished with two
tuns of wine in default of water. The conspirators have fled
by the garden. The archers were dragging the culprits to the
gibbets. From this moment the affair did not occupy much
time. The executioner, heedless about operating according to
the rules of art, made such haste that he dispatched the
condemned in a couple of minutes. In the meantime the people
gathered around D'Artagnan, -- they felicitated, they
cheered him. He wiped his brow, streaming with sweat, and
his sword, streaming with blood. He shrugged his shoulders
at seeing Menneville writhing at his feet in the last
convulsions. And, while Raoul turned away his eyes in
compassion, he pointed to the musketeers the gibbets laden
with their melancholy fruit. "Poor devils!" said he, "I hope
they died blessing me, for I saved them with great
difficulty." These words caught the ear of Menneville at the
moment when he himself was breathing his last sigh. A dark,
ironical smile flitted across his lips, he wished to reply,
but the effort hastened the snapping of the chord of life --
he expired.

"Oh! all this is very frightful!" murmured Raoul: "let us
begone, monsieur le chevalier."

"You are not wounded?" asked D'Artagnan.

"Not at all, thank you."

"That's well! Thou art a brave fellow, mordioux! The head of
the father, and the arm of Porthos. Ah! if he had been here,
good Porthos, you would have seen something worth looking
at." Then as if by way of remembrance --

"But where the devil can that brave Porthos be?" murmured
D'Artagnan.

"Come, chevalier, pray come away," urged Raoul.

"One minute, my friend, let me take my thirty-seven and a
half pistoles and I am at your service. The house is a good
property," added D'Artagnan, as he entered the
Image-de-Notre-Dame, "but decidedly, even if it were less
profitable, I should prefer its being in another quarter."




CHAPTER 63

How M. d'Eymeris's Diamond passed
into the Hands of M. D'Artagnan.



Whilst this violent, noisy, and bloody scene was passing on
the Greve, several men, barricaded behind the gate of
communication with the garden, replaced their swords in
their sheaths, assisted one among them to mount a ready
saddled horse which was waiting in the garden, and like a
flock of startled birds, fled in all directions, some
climbing the walls, others rushing out at the gates with all
the fury of a panic. He who mounted the horse, and gave him
the spur so sharply that the animal was near leaping the
wall, this cavalier, we say, crossed the Place Baudoyer,
passed like lightning before the crowd in the streets,
riding against, running over and knocking down all that came
in his way, and, ten minutes after, arrived at the gates of
the superintendent, more out of breath than his horse. The
Abbe Fouquet, at the clatter of the hoofs on the pavement,
appeared at a window of the court, and before even the
cavalier had set foot to the ground, "Well! Danecamp?" cried
he, leaning half out of the window.

"Well, it is all over," replied the cavalier.

"All over!" cried the abbe. "Then they are saved?"

"No, monsieur," replied the cavalier, "they are hung."

"Hung!" repeated the abbe, turning pale. A lateral door
suddenly opened, and Fouquet appeared in the chamber, pale,
distracted, with lips half opened, breathing a cry of grief
and anger. He stopped upon the threshold to listen to what
was addressed from the court to the window.

"Miserable wretches!" said the abbe. "you did not fight,
then?"

"Like lions."

"Say like cowards."

"Monsieur!"

"A hundred men accustomed to war, sword in hand, are worth
ten thousand archers in a surprise. Where is Menneville,
that boaster, that braggart, who was to come back either
dead or a conqueror?"

"Well, monsieur, he has kept his word. He is dead!"

"Dead! Who killed him?"

"A demon disguised as a man, a giant armed with ten flaming
swords -- a madman, who at one blow extinguished the fire,
put down the riot, and caused a hundred musketeers to rise
up out of the pavement of the Greve."

Fouquet raised his brow, streaming with sweat, murmuring,
"Oh! Lyodot and D'Eymeris! dead! dead! dead! and I
dishonored."

The abbe turned round, and perceiving his brother,
despairing and livid, "Come, come," said he, "it is a blow
of fate, monsieur; we must not lament thus. Our attempt has
failed, because God ---- "

"Be silent, abbe! be silent!" cried Fouquet; "your excuses
are blasphemies. Order that man up here, and let him relate
the details of this terrible event."

"But, brother ---- "

"Obey, monsieur!"

The abbe made a sign, and in half a minute the man's step
was heard upon the stairs. At the same time Gourville
appeared behind Fouquet, like the guardian angel of the
superintendent, pressing one finger on his lips to enjoin
observation even amidst the bursts of his grief. The
minister resumed all the serenity that human strength left
at the disposal of a heart half broken with sorrow. Danecamp
appeared. "Make your report," said Gourville.

"Monsieur," replied the messenger, "we received orders to
carry off the prisoners, and to cry `Vive Colbert!' whilst
carrying them off."

"To burn them alive, was it not, abbe?" interrupted
Gourville.

"Yes, yes, the order was given to Menneville. Menneville
knew what was to be done, and Menneville is dead."

This news appeared rather to reassure Gourville than to
sadden him.

"Yes, certainly to burn them alive," said the abbe, eagerly.

"Granted, monsieur, granted," said the man, looking into the
eyes and the faces of the two interlocutors, to ascertain
what there was profitable or disadvantageous to himself in
telling the truth.

"Now, proceed," said Gourville.

"The prisoners," cried Danecamp, "were brought to the Greve,
and the people, in a fury, insisted upon their being burnt
instead of being hung."

"And the people were right," said the abbe. "Go on."

"But," resumed the man, "at the moment the archers were
broken, at the moment the fire was set to one of the houses
of the Place destined to serve as a funeral-pile for the
guilty, this fury, this demon, this giant of whom I told
you, and who we had been informed, was the proprietor of the
house in question, aided by a young man who accompanied him,
threw out of the window those who kept up the fire, called
to his assistance the musketeers who were in the crowd,
leapt himself from the window of the first story into the
Place, and plied his sword so desperately that the victory
was restored to the archers, the prisoners were retaken, and
Menneville killed. When once recaptured, the condemned were
executed in three minutes." Fouquet, in spite of his
self-command, could not prevent a deep groan escaping him.

"And this man, the proprietor of the house, what is his
name?" said the abbe.

"I cannot tell you, not having even been able to get sight
of him; my post had been appointed in the garden, and I
remained at my post: only the affair was related to me as I
repeat it. I was ordered, when once the affair was at an
end, to come at best speed arid announce to you the manner
in which it finished. According to this order, I set out,
full gallop, and here I am."

"Very well, monsieur, we have nothing else to ask of you,"
said the abbe, more and more dejected, in proportion as the
moment approached for finding himself alone with his
brother.

"Have you been paid?" asked Gourville.

"Partly, monsieur," replied Danecamp.

"Here are twenty pistoles. Begone, monsieur, and never
forget to defend, as this time has been done, the true
interests of the king."

"Yes, monsieur," said the man, bowing and pocketing the
money. After which he went out. Scarcely had the door closed
after him when Fouquet, who had remained motionless,
advanced with a rapid step and stood between the abbe and
Gourville. Both of them at the same time opened their mouths
to speak to him. "No excuses," said he, "no recriminations
against anybody. If I had not been a false friend I should
not have confided to any one the care of delivering Lyodot
and D'Eymeris. I alone am guilty; to me alone are reproaches
and remorse due. Leave me, abbe."

"And yet, monsieur, you will not prevent me," replied the
latter, "from endeavoring to find out the miserable fellow
who has intervened to the advantage of M. Colbert in this so
well-arranged affair; for, if it is good policy to love our
friends dearly, I do not believe that is bad which consists
in obstinately pursuing our enemies."

"A truce to policy, abbe; begone, I beg of you, and do not
let me hear any more of you till I send for you; what we
most need is circumspection and silence. You have a terrible
example before you, gentlemen: no reprisals, I forbid them."

"There are no orders," grumbled the abbe, "which will
prevent me from avenging a family affront upon the guilty
person."

"And I," cried Fouquet, in that imperative tone to which one
feels there is nothing to reply, "if you entertain one
thought, one single thought, which is not the absolute
expression of my will, I will have you cast into the Bastile
two hours after that thought has manifested itself. Regulate
your conduct accordingly, abbe."

The abbe colored and bowed. Fouquet made a sign to Gourville
to follow him, and was already directing his steps towards
his cabinet, when the usher announced with a loud voice:
"Monsieur le Chevalier d'Artagnan."

"Who is he?" said Fouquet, negligently, to Gourville.

"An ex-lieutenant of his majesty's musketeers," replied
Gourville, in the same tone. Fouquet did not even take the
trouble to reflect, and resumed his walk. "I beg your
pardon, monseigneur!" said Gourville, "but I have
remembered, this brave man has quitted the king's service,
and probably comes to receive an installment of some pension
or other."

"Devil take him!" said Fouquet, "why does he choose his
opportunity so ill?"

"Permit me then, monseigneur, to announce your refusal to
him; for he is one of my acquaintance, and is a man whom, in
our present circumstances, it would be better to have as a
friend than an enemy."

"Answer him as you please," said Fouquet.

"Eh! good Lord!" said the abbe, still full of malice, like
an egotistical man; "tell him there is no money,
particularly for musketeers."

But scarcely had the abbe uttered this imprudent speech,
when the partly open door was thrown back, and D'Artagnan
appeared.

"Eh! Monsieur Fouquet," said he, "I was well aware there was
no money for musketeers here. Therefore I did not come to
obtain any, but to have it refused. That being done, receive
my thanks. I give you good-day, and will go and seek it at
M. Colbert's." And he went out, making an easy bow.

"Gourville," said Fouquet, "run after that man and bring him
back." Gourville obeyed, and overtook D'Artagnan on the
stairs.

D'Artagnan, hearing steps behind him, turned round and
perceived Gourville. "Mordioux! my dear monsieur," said he,
"these are sad lessons which you gentlemen of finance teach
us; I come to M. Fouquet to receive a sum accorded by his
majesty, and I am received like a mendicant who comes to ask
charity, or a thief who comes to steal a piece of plate."

"But you pronounced the name of M. Colbert, my dear M.
d'Artagnan; you said you were going to M. Colbert's?"

"I certainly am going there, were it only to ask
satisfaction of the people who try to burn houses, crying
`Vive Colbert!'"

Gourville pricked up his ears. "Oh, oh!" said he, "you
allude to what has just happened at the Greve?"

"Yes, certainly."

"And in what did that which has taken place concern you?"

"What! do you ask me whether it concerns me or does not
concern me, if M. Colbert pleases to make a funeral-pile of
my house?"

"So ho, your house -- was it your house they wanted to
burn?"

"Pardieu! was it!"

"Is the cabaret of the Image-de-Notre-Dame yours, then?"

"It has been this week."

"Well, then, are you the brave captain, are you the valiant
blade who dispersed those who wished to burn the condemned?"

"My dear Monsieur Gourville, put yourself in my place. I was
an agent of the public force and a landlord, too. As a
captain, it is my duty to have the orders of the king
accomplished. As a proprietor, it is to my interest my house
should not be burnt. I have at the same time attended to the
laws of interest and duty in replacing Messieurs Lyodot and
D'Eymeris in the hands of the archers."

"Then it was you who threw the man out of the window?"

"It was I, myself," replied D'Artagnan, modestly

"And you who killed Menneville?"

"I had that misfortune," said D'Artagnan, bowing like a man
who is being congratulated.

"It was you, then, in short, who caused the two condemned
persons to be hung?"

"Instead of being burnt, yes, monsieur, and I am proud of
it. I saved the poor devils from horrible tortures.
Understand, my dear Monsieur de Gourville, that they wanted
to burn them alive. It exceeds imagination!"

"Go, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan, go," said Gourville,
anxious to spare Fouquet the sight of the man who had just
caused him such profound grief.

"No," said Fouquet, who had heard all from the door of the
ante-chamber; "not so; on the contrary, Monsieur d'Artagnan,
come in."

D'Artagnan wiped from the hilt of his sword a last bloody
trace, which had escaped his notice, and returned. He then
found himself face to face with these three men, whose
countenances wore very different expressions. With the abbe
it was anger, with Gourville stupor, with Fouquet it was
dejection.

"I beg your pardon, monsieur le ministre," said D'Artagnan,
"but my time is short; I have to go to the office of the
intendant, to have an explanation with Monsieur Colbert, and
to receive my quarter's pension."

"But, monsieur," said Fouquet, "there is money here."
D'Artagnan looked at the superintendent with astonishment.
"You have been answered inconsiderately, monsieur, I know,
because I heard it," said the minister; "a man of your merit
ought to be known by everybody." D'Artagnan bowed. "Have you
an order?" added Fouquet.

"Yes, monsieur."

"Give it me, I will pay you myself; come with me." He made a
sign to Gourville and the abbe, who remained in the chamber
where they were. He led D'Artagnan into his cabinet. As soon
as the door was shut, -- "How much is due to you, monsieur?"

"Why, something like five thousand livres, monseigneur."

"For arrears of pay?"

"For a quarter's pay."

"A quarter consisting of five thousand livres!" said
Fouquet, fixing upon the musketeer a searching look. Does
the king, then, give you twenty thousand livres a year?"

"Yes, monseigneur, twenty thousand livres a year. Do you
think it is too much?"

"I?" cried Fouquet, and he smiled bitterly. "If I had any
knowledge of mankind, if I were -- instead of being a
frivolous, inconsequent, and vain spirit -- of a prudent and
reflective spirit; if, in a word, I had, as certain persons
have known how, regulated my life, you would not receive
twenty thousand livres a year, but a hundred thousand, and
you would not belong to the king, but to me."

D'Artagnan colored slightly. There is sometimes in the
manner in which a eulogium is given, in the voice, in the
affectionate tone, a poison so sweet, that the strongest
mind is intoxicated by it. The superintendent terminated his
speech by opening a drawer, and taking from it four rouleaux
which he placed before D'Artagnan. The Gascon opened one.
"Gold!" said he.

"It will be less burdensome, monsieur."

"But then, monsieur, these make twenty thousand livres."

"No doubt they do."

"But only five are due to me."

"I wish to spare you the trouble of coming four times to my
office."

"You overwhelm me, monsieur."

"I do only what I ought to do, monsieur le chevalier; and I
hope you will not bear me any malice on account of the rude
reception my brother gave you. He is of a sour, capricious
disposition."

"Monsieur," said D'Artagnan, "believe me, nothing would
grieve me more than an excuse from you."

"Therefore I will make no more, and will content myself with
asking you a favor."

"Oh, monsieur."

Fouquet drew from his finger a ring worth about a thousand
pistoles. "Monsieur," said he, "this stone was given me by a
friend of my childhood, by a man to whom you have rendered a
great service."

"A service -- I?" said the musketeer, "I have rendered a
service to one of your friends?"

"You cannot have forgotten it, monsieur, for it dates this
very day."

"And that friend's name was ---- "

"M. d'Eymeris."

"One of the condemned?"

"Yes, one of the victims. Well! Monsieur d'Artagnan, in
return for the service you have rendered him, I beg you to
accept this diamond. Do so for my sake."

"Monsieur! you ---- "

"Accept it, I say. To-day is with me a day of mourning;
hereafter you will, perhaps, learn why; to-day I have lost
one friend; well, I will try to get another."

"But, Monsieur Fouquet ---- "

"Adieu! Monsieur d'Artagnan, adieu!" cried Fouquet, with
much emotion; "or rather, au revoir." And the minister
quitted the cabinet, leaving in the hands of the musketeer
the ring and the twenty thousand livres.

"Oh!" said D'Artagnan, after a moment's dark reflection.
"How on earth am I to understand what this means? Mordioux!
I can understand this much, only: he is a gallant man! I
will go and explain matters to M. Colbert." And he went out.




CHAPTER 64

Of the Notable Difference D'Artagnan finds between
Monsieur the Intendant and Monsieur the Superintendent



M. Colbert resided in the Rue Neuve des Petits-Champs in a
house which had belonged to Beautru. D'Artagnan's legs
cleared the distance in a short quarter of an hour. When he
arrived at the residence of the new favorite, the court was
full of archers and police, who came to congratulate him, or
to excuse themselves according to whether he should choose
to praise or blame. The sentiment of flattery is instinctive
with people of abject condition; they have the sense of it,
as the wild animal has that of hearing and smell. These
people, or their leader, understood that there was a
pleasure to offer to M. Colbert, in rendering him an account
of the fashion in which his name had been pronounced during
the rash enterprise of the morning. D'Artagnan made his
appearance just as the chief of the watch was giving his
report. He stood close to the door, behind the archers. That
officer took Colbert on one side, in spite of his resistance
and the contraction of his bushy eyebrows. "In case," said
he, "you really desired, monsieur, that the people should do
justice on the two traitors, it would have been wise to warn
us of it; for, indeed, monsieur, in spite of our regret at
displeasing you, or thwarting your views, we had our orders
to execute."

"Triple fool!" replied Colbert, furiously shaking his hair,
thick and black as a mane, "what are you telling me? What!
that I could have had an idea of a riot! Are you mad or
drunk?"

"But, monsieur, they cried, `Vive Colbert!'" replied the
trembling watch.

"A handful of conspirators ---- "

"No, no; a mass of people."

"Ah! indeed," said Colbert, expanding. "A mass of people
cried, `Vive Colbert!' Are you certain of what you say,
monsieur?"

"We had nothing to do but open our ears, or rather to close
them, so terrible were the cries."

"And this was from the people, the real people?"

"Certainly, monsieur; only these real people beat us."

"Oh! very well," continued Colbert, thoughtfully. "Then you
suppose it was the people alone who wished to burn the
condemned?"

"Oh! yes, monsieur."

"That is quite another thing. You strongly resisted, then?"

"We had three of our men crushed to death, monsieur!"

"But you killed nobody yourselves?"

"Monsieur, a few of the rioters were left upon the square,
and one among them who was not a common man."

"Who was he?"

"A certain Menneville, upon whom the police have a long time
had an eye."

"Menneville!" cried Colbert, "what, he who killed Rue de la
Huchette, a worthy man who wanted a fat fowl?"

"Yes, monsieur; the same."

"And did this Menneville also cry, `Vive Colbert'?"

"Louder than all the rest, like a madman."

Colbert's brow grew dark and wrinkled. A kind of ambitious
glory which had lighted his face was extinguished, like the
light of glow-worms we crush beneath the grass. "Then you
say," resumed the deceived intendant, "that the initiative
came from the people? Menneville was my enemy, I would have
had him hung, and he knew it well. Menneville belonged to
the Abbe Fouquet -- the affair originated with Fouquet; does
not everybody know that the condemned were his friends from
childhood?"

"That is true," thought D'Artagnan, "and thus are all my
doubts cleared up. I repeat it, Monsieur Fouquet many be
called what they please, but he is a very gentlemanly man;"

"And," continued Colbert, "are you quite sure Menneville is
dead?"

D'Artagnan thought the time was come for him to make his
appearance. "Perfectly, monsieur;" replied he, advancing
suddenly.

"Oh! is that you, monsieur?" said Colbert.

"In person," replied the musketeer with his deliberate tone;
"it appears that you had in Menneville a pretty enemy."

"It was not I, monsieur, who had an enemy," replied Colbert;
"it was the king."

"Double brute!" thought D'Artagnan, "to think to play the
great man and the hypocrite with me. Well," continued he to
Colbert, "I am very happy to have rendered so good a service
to the king; will you take upon you to tell his majesty,
monsieur l'intendant?"

"What commission is this you give me, and what do you charge
me to tell his majesty, monsieur? Be precise, if you
please," said Colbert, in a sharp voice, tuned beforehand to
hostility.

"I give you no commission," replied D'Artagnan, with that
calmness which never abandons the banterer; "I thought it
would be easy for you to announce to his majesty that it was
I who, being there by chance, did justice upon Menneville
and restored things to order."

Colbert opened his eyes and interrogated the chief of the
watch with a look -- "Ah! it is very true," said the latter,
"that this gentleman saved us."

"Why did you not tell me monsieur, that you came to relate
me this?" said Colbert with envy, "everything is explained,
and more favorably for you than for anybody else."

"You are in error, monsieur l'intendant, I did not at all
come for the purpose of relating that to you."

"It is an exploit, nevertheless."

"Oh!" said the musketeer carelessly, "constant habit blunts
the mind."

"To what do I owe the honor of your visit, then?"

"Simply to this: the king ordered me to come to you."

"Ah!" said Colbert, recovering himself when he saw
D'Artagnan draw a paper from his pocket; "it is to demand
some money of me?"

"Precisely, monsieur.'

"Have the goodness to wait, if you please, monsieur, till I
have dispatched the report of the watch."

D'Artagnan turned upon his heel, insolently enough, and
finding himself face to face with Colbert, after his first
turn, he bowed to him as a harlequin would have done; then,
after a second evolution, he directed his steps towards the
door in quick time. Colbert was struck with this pointed
rudeness, to which he was not accustomed. In general, men of
the sword, when they came to his office, had such a want of
money, that though their feet seemed to take root in the
marble, they hardly lost their patience. Was D'Artagnan
going straight to the king? Would he go and describe his
rough reception, or recount his exploit? This was a matter
for grave consideration. At all events, the moment was badly
chosen to send D'Artagnan away, whether he came from the
king, or on his own account. The musketeer had rendered too
great a service, and that too recently, for it to be already
forgotten. Therefore Colbert thought it would be better to
shake off his arrogance and call D'Artagnan back. "Ho!
Monsieur d'Artagnan," cried Colbert, "what! are you leaving
me thus?"

D'Artagnan turned round: "Why not?" said he, quietly, "we
have no more to say to each other, have we?"

"You have, at least, money to receive, as you have an
order?"

"Who, I? Oh! not at all, my dear Monsieur Colbert."

"But, monsieur, you have an order. And, in the same manner
as you give a sword-thrust, when you are required, I, on my
part, pay when an order is presented to me. Present yours."

"It is useless, my dear Monsieur Colbert," said D'Artagnan,
who inwardly enjoyed this confusion in the ideas of Colbert;
"my order is paid."

"Paid, by whom?"

"By monsieur le surintendant."

Colbert grew pale.

"Explain yourself," said he, in a stifled voice -- "if you
are paid why do you show me that paper?"

"In consequence of the word of order of which you spoke to
me so ingeniously just now, dear M. Colbert; the king told
me to take a quarter of the pension he is pleased to make
me."

"Of me?" said Colbert.

"Not exactly. The king said to me: `Go to M. Fouquet; the
superintendent will, perhaps, have no money, then you will
go and draw it of M. Colbert.'"

The countenance of M. Colbert brightened for a moment; but
it was with his unfortunate physiognomy as with a stormy
sky, sometimes radiant, sometimes dark as night, according
as the lightning gleams or the cloud passes. "Eh! and was
there any money in the superintendent's coffers?" asked he.

"Why, yes, he could not be badly off for money," replied
D'Artagnan -- "it may be believed, since M. Fouquet, instead
of paying me a quarter or five thousand livres ---- "

"A quarter or five thousand livres!" cried Colbert, struck,
as Fouquet had been, with the generosity of the sum for a
soldier's pension, "why, that would be a pension of twenty
thousand livres?"

"Exactly, M. Colbert. Peste! you reckon like old Pythagoras;
yes, twenty thousand livres."

"Ten times the appointment of an intendant of the finances.
I beg to offer you my compliments," said Colbert, with a
vicious smile.

"Oh!" said D'Artagnan, "the king apologized for giving me so
little; but he promised to make it more hereafter, when he
should be rich; but I must be gone, having much to do ---- "

"So, then, notwithstanding the expectation of the king, the
superintendent paid you, did he?"

"In the same manner as, in opposition to the king's
expectation, you refused to pay me."

"I did not refuse, monsieur, I only begged you to wait. And
you say that M. Fouquet paid you your five thousand livres?"

"Yes, as you might have done; but he did even better than
that, M. Colbert."

"And what did he do?"

"He politely counted me down the sum-total, saying, that for
the king, his coffers were always full."

"The sum-total! M. Fouquet has given you twenty thousand
livres instead of five thousand?"

"Yes, monsieur."

"And what for?"

"In order to spare me three visits to the money-chest of the
superintendent, so that I have the twenty thousand livres in
my pocket in good new coin. You see, then, that I am able to
go away without standing in need of you, having come here
only for form's sake." And D'Artagnan slapped his hand upon
his pocket, with a laugh which disclosed to Colbert
thirty-two magnificent teeth, as white as teeth of
twenty-five years old and which seemed to say in their
language: "Serve up to us thirty-two little Colberts, and we
will chew them willingly." The serpent is as brave as the
lion, the hawk as courageous as the eagle, that cannot be
contested. It can only be said of animals that are decidedly
cowardly, and are so called, that they will be brave only
when they have to defend themselves. Colbert was not
frightened at the thirty-two teeth of D'Artagnan. He
recovered, and suddenly, -- "Monsieur," said he, "monsieur
le surintendant has done what he had no right to do."

"What do you mean by that?" replied D'Artagnan.

"I mean that your note -- will you let me see your note, if
you please?"

"Very willingly; here it is."

Colbert seized the paper with an eagerness which the
musketeer did not remark without uneasiness, and
particularly without a certain degree of regret at having
trusted him with it. "Well, monsieur, the royal order says
this: -- `At sight, I command that there be paid to M.
d'Artagnan the sum of five thousand livres, forming a
quarter of the pension I have made him.'"

"So, in fact, it is written," said D'Artagnan, affecting
calmness.

"Very well; the king only owed you five thousand livres; why
has more been given to you?"

"Because there was more; and M. Fouquet was willing to give
me more; that does not concern anybody."

"It is natural," said Colbert, with a proud ease, "that you
should be ignorant of the usages of state-finance; but,
monsieur, when you have a thousand livres to pay, what do
you do?"

"I never have a thousand livres to pay," replied D'Artagnan.

"Once more," said Colbert, irritated -- "once more, if you
had any sum to pay, would you not pay what you ought?"

"That only proves one thing," said D'Artagnan; "and that is,
that you have your particular customs in finance, and M.
Fouquet has his own."

"Mine, monsieur, are the correct ones."

"I do not say they are not."

"And you have accepted what was not due to you."

D'Artagnan's eyes flashed. "What is not due to me yet, you
meant to say, M. Colbert; for if I had received what was not
due to me at all, I should have committed a theft."

Colbert made no reply to this subtlety. "You then owe
fifteen thousand livres to the public chest," said he,
carried away by his jealous ardor.

"Then you must give me credit for them," replied D'Artagnan,
with his imperceptible irony.

"Not at all, monsieur."

"Well! what will you do, then? You will not take my rouleaux
from me, will you?"

"You must return them to my chest."

"I! Oh! Monsieur Colbert, don't reckon upon that."

"The king wants his money, monsieur."

"And I, monsieur, I want the king's money."

"That may be but you must return this."

"Not a sou. I have always understood that in matters of
comptabilite, as you call it, a good cashier never gives
back or takes back."

"Then, monsieur, we shall see what the king will say about
it. I will show him this note, which proves that M. Fouquet
not only pays what he does not owe, but that he does not
even take care of vouchers for the sums that he has paid."

"Ah! now I understand why you have taken that paper, M.
Colbert!"

Colbert did not perceive all that there was of a threatening
character in his name pronounced in a certain manner. "You
shall see hereafter what use I will make of it," said he,
holding up the paper in his fingers.

"Oh!" said D'Artagnan, snatching the paper from him with a
rapid movement; "I understand it perfectly well, M. Colbert;
I have no occasion to wait for that." And he crumpled up in
his pocket the paper he had so cleverly seized.

"Monsieur, monsieur!" cried Colbert, "this is violence!"

"Nonsense! You must not be particular about a soldier's
manners!" replied D'Artagnan. "I kiss your hands, my dear M.
Colbert." And he went out, laughing in the face of the
future minister.

"That man, now," muttered he, "was about to grow quite
friendly; it is a great pity I was obliged to cut his
company so soon."






CHAPTER 65

Philosophy of the Heart and Mind



For a man who had seen so many much more dangerous ones, the
position of D'Artagnan with respect to M. Colbert was only
comic. D'Artagnan, therefore, did not deny himself the
satisfaction of laughing at the expense of monsieur
l'intendant, from the Rue des Petits-Champs to the Rue des
Lombards. It was a great while since D'Artagnan had laughed
so long together. He was still laughing when Planchet
appeared, laughing likewise, at the door of his house; for
Planchet, since the return of his patron, since the entrance
of the English guineas, passed the greater part of his life
in doing what D'Artagnan had only done from Rue-Neuve des
Petits-Champs to the Rue des Lombards.

"You are home, then, my dear master?" said Planchet.

"No, my friend," replied the musketeer, "I am off and that
quickly. I will sup with you, go to bed, sleep five hours,
and at break of day leap into my saddle. Has my horse had an
extra feed?"

"Eh! my dear master," replied Planchet, "you know very well
that your horse is the jewel of the family; that my lads are
caressing it all day, and cramming it with sugar, nuts, and
biscuits. You ask me if he has had an extra feed of oats;
you should ask if he has not had enough to burst him."

"Very well, Planchet, that is all right. Now, then, I pass
to what concerns me -- my supper?"

"Ready. A smoking roast joint, white wine, crayfish and
fresh-gathered cherries. All ready, my master."

"You are a capital fellow, Planchet; come on, then, let us
sup, and I will go to bed."

During supper D'Artagnan observed that Planchet kept rubbing
his forehead, as if to facilitate the issue of some idea
closely pent within his brain. He looked with an air of
kindness at this worthy companion of former adventures and
misadventures, and, clinking glass against glass, "Come,
Planchet," said he, "let us see what it is that gives you so
much trouble to bring forth. Mordioux! Speak freely, and
quickly."

"Well, this is it," replied Planchet: "you appear to me to
be going on some expedition or other."

"I don't say that I am not."

"Then you have some new idea?"

"That is possible, too, Planchet."

"Then there will be fresh capital to be ventured? I will lay
down fifty thousand livres upon the idea you are about to
carry out." And so saying, Planchet rubbed his hands one
against the other with a rapidity evincing great delight.

"Planchet," said D'Artagnan, "there is but one misfortune in
it."

"And what is that?"

"That the idea is not mine. I can risk nothing upon it."

These words drew a deep sigh from the heart of Planchet.
That Avarice is an ardent counselor; she carries away her
man, as Satan did Jesus, to the mountain, and when once she
has shown to an unfortunate all the kingdoms of the earth,
she is able to repose herself, knowing full well that she
has left her companion, Envy, to gnaw his heart. Planchet
had tasted of riches easily acquired, and was never
afterwards likely to stop in his desires; but, as he had a
good heart in spite of his covetousness, as he adored
D'Artagnan, he could not refrain from making him a thousand
recommendations, each more affectionate than the others. He
would not have been sorry, nevertheless, to have caught a
little hint of the secret his master concealed so well;
tricks, turns, counsels and traps were all useless,
D'Artagnan let nothing confidential escape him. The evening
passed thus. After supper the portmanteau occupied
D'Artagnan, he took a turn to the stable, patted his horse,
and examined his shoes and legs, then, having counted over
his money, he went to bed, sleeping as if only twenty,
because he had neither inquietude nor remorse; he closed his
eyes five minutes after he had blown out his lamp. Many
events might, however, have kept him awake. Thought boiled
in his brain, conjectures abounded, and D'Artagnan was a
great drawer of horoscopes; but, with that imperturbable
phlegm which does more than genius for the fortune and
happiness of men of action, he put off reflection till the
next day, for fear, he said, not to be fresh when he wanted
to be so.

The day came. The Rue des Lombards had its share of the
caresses of Aurora with the rosy fingers, and D'Artagnan
arose like Aurora. He did not awaken anybody, he placed his
portmanteau under his arm, descended the stairs without
making one of them creak and without disturbing one of the
sonorous snorings in every story from the garret to the
cellar, then, having saddled his horse, shut the stable and
house doors, he set off, at a foot-pace, on his expedition
to Bretagne. He had done quite right not to trouble himself
with all the political and diplomatic affairs which
solicited his attention; for, in the morning, in freshness
and mild twilight, his ideas developed themselves in purity
and abundance. In the first place, he passed before the
house of Fouquet, and threw in a large gaping box the
fortunate order which, the evening before, he had had so
much trouble to recover from the hooked fingers of the
intendant. Placed in an envelope, and addressed to Fouquet,
it had not even been divined by Planchet, who in divination
was equal to Calchas or the Pythian Apollo. D'Artagnan thus
sent back the order to Fouquet, without compromising
himself, and without having thenceforward any reproaches to
make himself. When he had effected this proper restitution,
"Now," said he to himself, "let us inhale much maternal air,
much freedom from cares, much health, let us allow the horse
Zephyr, whose flanks puff as if he had to respire an
atmosphere to breathe, and let us be very ingenious in our
little calculations. It is time," said D'Artagnan, "to form
a plan of the campaign, and, according to the method of M.
Turenne, who has a large head full of all sorts of good
counsels, before the plan of the campaign it is advisable to
draw a striking portrait of the generals to whom we are
opposed. In the first place, M. Fouquet presents himself.
What is M. Fouquet? M. Fouquet," replied D'Artagnan to
himself, "is a handsome man, very much beloved by the women,
a generous man very much beloved by the poets; a man of wit,
much execrated by pretenders. Well, now I am neither woman,
poet, nor pretender: I neither love nor hate monsieur le
surintendant. I find myself, therefore, in the same position
in which M. de Turenne found himself when opposed to the
Prince de Conde at Jargeau, Gien and the Faubourg
Saint-Antoine. He did not execrate monsieur le prince, it is
true, but he obeyed the king. Monsieur le prince is an
agreeable man, but the king is king. Turenne heaved a deep
sigh, called Conde `My cousin,' and swept away his army. Now
what does the king wish? That does not concern me. Now, what
does M. Colbert wish? Oh, that's another thing. M. Colbert
wishes all that M. Fouquet does not wish. Then what does M.
Fouquet wish? Oh, that is serious. M. Fouquet wishes
precisely for all which the king wishes."

This monologue ended, D'Artagnan began to laugh, whilst
making his whip whistle in the air. He was already on the
high road, frightening the birds in the hedges, listening to
the livres chinking and dancing in his leather pocket, at
every step; and, let us confess it, every time that
D'Artagnan found himself in such conditions tenderness was
not his dominant vice. "Come," said he, "I cannot think the
expedition a very dangerous one; and it will fall out with
my voyage as with that piece M. Monk took me to see in
London, which was called, I think, `Much Ado about
Nothing.'"




CHAPTER 66

The Journey



It was perhaps the fiftieth time since the day on which we
open this history, that this man. with a heart of bronze and
muscles of steel, had left house and friends, everything, in
short, to go in search of fortune and death. The one -- that
is to say. death -- had constantly retreated before him, as
if afraid of him; the other -- that is to say, fortune --
for a month past only had really made an alliance with him.
Although he was not a great philosopher, after the fashion
of either Epicurus or Socrates, he was a powerful spirit,
having knowledge of life, and endowed with thought. No one
is as brave, as adventurous, or as skillful as D'Artagnan,
without being at the same time inclined to be a dreamer. He
had picked up, here and there, some scraps of M. de la
Rochefoucauld, worthy of being translated into Latin by MM.
de Port Royal, and he had made a collection, en passant, in
the society of Athos and Aramis, of many morsels of Seneca
and Cicero, translated by them, and applied to the uses of
common life. That contempt of riches which our Gascon had
observed as an article of faith during the thirty-five first
years of his life, had for a long time been considered by
him as the first article of the code of bravery. "Article
first," said he, "A man is brave because he has nothing. A
man has nothing because he despises riches." Therefore, with
these principles, which, as we have said had regulated the
thirty-five first years of his life, D'Artagnan was no
sooner possessed of riches, than he felt it necessary to ask
himself if, in spite of his riches, he were still brave. To
this, for any other but D'Artagnan, the events of the Place
de Greve might have served as a reply. Many consciences
would have been satisfied with them, but D'Artagnan was
brave enough to ask himself sincerely and conscientiously if
he were brave. Therefore to this: --

"But it appears to me that I drew promptly enough and cut
and thrust pretty freely on the Place de Greve to be
satisfied of my bravery," D'Artagnan had himself replied.
"Gently, captain, that is not an answer. I was brave that
day, because they were burning my house, and there are a
hundred, and even a thousand, to speak against one, that if
those gentlemen of the riots had not formed that unlucky
idea, their plan of attack would have succeeded, or, at
least, it would not have been I who would have opposed
myself to it. Now, what will be brought against me? I have
no house to be burnt in Bretagne; I have no treasure there
that can be taken from me. -- No; but I have my skin; that
precious skin of M. d'Artagnan, which to him is worth more
than all the houses and all the treasures of the world. That
skin to which I cling above everything, because it is,
everything considered, the binding of a body which encloses
a heart very warm and ready to fight, and, consequently, to
live. Then, I do desire to live; and, in reality, I live
much better, more completely, since I have become rich. Who
the devil ever said that money spoiled life! Upon my soul,
it is no such thing; on the contrary, it seems as if I
absorbed a double quantity of air and sun. Mordioux! what
will it be then, if I double that fortune, and if, instead
of the switch I now hold in my hand, I should ever carry the
baton of a marechal? Then I really don't know if there will
be, from that moment enough of air and sun for me. In fact,
this is not a dream, who the devil would oppose it, if the
king made me a marechal, as his father, King Louis XIII.,
made a duke and constable of Albert de Luynes? Am I not as
brave, and much more intelligent, than that imbecile De
Vitry? Ah! that's exactly what will prevent my advancement:
I have too much wit. Luckily, if there is any justice in
this world, fortune owes me many compensations. She owes me
certainly a recompense for all I did for Anne of Austria,
and an indemnification for all she has not done for me.
Then, at the present, I am very well with a king, and with a
king who has the appearance of determining to reign. May God
keep him in that illustrious road! For, if he is resolved to
reign he will want me; and if he wants me, he will give me
what he has promised me -- warmth and light; so that I
march, comparatively, now, as I marched formerly, -- from
nothing to everything. Only the nothing of to-day is the all
of former days; there has only this little change taken
place in my life. And now let us see! let us take the part
of the heart, as I just now was speaking of it. But in
truth, I only spoke of it from memory." And the Gascon
applied his hand to his breast, as if he were actually
seeking the place where his heart was.

"Ah! wretch!" murmured he, smiling with bitterness. "Ah!
poor mortal species! You hoped, for an instant, that you had
not a heart, and now you find you have one -- bad courtier
as thou art, -- and even one of the most seditious. You have
a heart which speaks to you in favor of M. Fouquet. And what
is M. Fouquet, when the king is in question? -- A
conspirator, a real conspirator, who did not even give
himself the trouble to conceal his being a conspirator;
therefore, what a weapon would you not have against him, if
his good grace and his intelligence had not made a scabbard
for that weapon. An armed revolt! -- for, in fact, M.
Fouquet has been guilty of an armed revolt. Thus, while the
king vaguely suspects M. Fouquet of rebellion, I know it --
I could prove that M. Fouquet had caused the shedding of the
blood of his majesty's subjects. Now, then, let us see?
Knowing all that, and holding my tongue, what further would
this heart wish in return for a kind action of M. Fouquet's,
for an advance of fifteen thousand livres, for a diamond
worth a thousand pistoles, for a smile in which there was as
much bitterness as kindness? -- I save his life."

"Now, then, I hope," continued the musketeer, "that this
imbecile of a heart is going to preserve silence, and so be
fairly quits with M. Fouquet. Now, then, the king becomes my
sun, and as my heart is quits with M. Fouquet, let him
beware who places himself between me and my sun! Forward,
for his majesty Louis XIV.! -- Forward!"

These reflections were the only impediments which were able
to retard the progress of D'Artagnan. These reflections once
made, he increased the speed of his horse. But, however
perfect his horse Zephyr might be, it could not hold out at
such a pace forever. The day after his departure from Paris,
he was left at Chartres, at the house of an old friend
D'Artagnan had met with in an hotelier of that city. From
that moment the musketeer travelled on post-horses. Thanks
to this mode of locomotion, he traversed the space
separating Chartres from Chateaubriand. In the last of these
two cities, far enough from the coast to prevent any one
guessing that D'Artagnan wished to reach the sea -- far
enough from Paris to prevent all suspicion of his being a
messenger from Louis XIV., whom D'Artagnan had called his
sun, without suspecting that he who was only at present a
rather poor star in the heaven of royalty, would, one day,
make that star his emblem; the messenger of Louis XIV., we
say, quitted the post and purchased a bidet of the meanest
appearance, -- one of those animals which an officer of
cavalry would never choose, for fear of being disgraced.
Excepting the color, this new acquisition recalled to the
mind of D'Artagnan the famous orange-colored horse, with
which, or rather upon which, he had made his first
appearance in the world. Truth to say, from the moment he
crossed this new steed, it was no longer D'Artagnan who was
travelling, -- it was a good man clothed in an iron-gray
justaucorps, brown haut-de-chausses, holding the medium
between a priest and a layman; that which brought him
nearest to the churchman was, that D'Artagnan had placed on
his head a calotte of threadbare velvet, and over the
calotte, a large black hat; no more sword, a stick, hung by
a cord to his wrist, but to which, he promised himself, as
an unexpected auxiliary, to join, upon occasion, a good
dagger, ten inches long, concealed under his cloak. The
bidet purchased at Chateaubriand completed the
metamorphosis; it was called, or rather D'Artagnan called
it, Furet (ferret).

"If I have changed Zephyr into Furet," said D'Artagnan, "I
must make some diminutive or other of my own name. So,
instead of D'Artagnan, I will be Agnan, short; that is a
concession which I naturally owe to my gray coat, my round
hat, and my rusty calotte."

Monsieur D'Artagnan traveled, then, pretty easily upon
Furet, who ambled like a true butter-woman's pad, and who,
with his amble, managed cheerfully about twelve leagues a
day, upon four spindle-shanks, of which the practiced eye of
D'Artagnan had appreciated the strength and safety beneath
the thick mass of hair which covered them. Jogging along,
the traveler took notes, studied the country, which he
traversed reserved and silent, ever seeking the most
plausible pretext for reaching Belle-Isle-en-Mer, and for
seeing everything without arousing suspicion. In this
manner, he was enabled to convince himself of the importance
the event assumed in proportion as he drew near to it. In
this remote country, in this ancient duchy of Bretagne,
which was not France at that period, and is not so even now,
the people knew nothing of the king of France. They not only
did not know him, but were unwilling to know him. One face
-- a single one -- floated visibly for them upon the
political current. Their ancient dukes no longer ruled them;
government was a void -- nothing more. In place of the
sovereign duke, the seigneurs of parishes reigned without
control; and, above these seigneurs, God, who has never been
forgotten in Bretagne. Among these suzerains of chateaux and
belfries, the most powerful, the richest, and the most
popular, was M. Fouquet, seigneur of Belle-Isle. Even in the
country, even within sight of that mysterious isle, legends
and traditions consecrate its wonders. Every one might not
penetrate it: the isle, of an extent of six leagues in
length, and six in breadth, was a seignorial property, which
the people had for a long time respected, covered as it was
with the name of Retz, so redoubtable in the country.
Shortly after the erection of this seignory into a
marquisate, Belle-Isle passed to M. Fouquet. The celebrity
of the isle did not date from yesterday; its name, or rather
its qualification, is traced back to the remotest antiquity.
The ancients called it Kalonese, from two Greek words,
signifying beautiful isle. Thus at a distance of eighteen
hundred years, it had borne, in another idiom, the same name
it still bears. There was, then, something in itself in this
property of M. Fouquet's, besides its position of six
leagues off the coast of France; a position which makes it a
sovereign in its maritime solitude, like a majestic ship
which disdains roads, and proudly casts anchor in mid-ocean.

D'Artagnan learnt all this without appearing the least in
the world astonished. He also learnt that the best way to
get intelligence was to go to La Roche-Bernard, a tolerably
important city at the mouth of the Vilaine. Perhaps there he
could embark; if not, crossing the salt marshes, he would
repair to Guerande-en-Croisic, to wait for an opportunity to
cross over to Belle-Isle. He had discovered, besides, since
his departure from Chateaubriand, that nothing would be
impossible for Furet under the impulsion of M. Agnan, and
nothing to M. Agnan through the initiative of Furet. He
prepared, then, to sup off a teal and a tourteau, in a hotel
of La Roche-Bernard, and ordered to be brought from the
cellar, to wash down these two Breton dishes, some cider,
which, the moment it touched his lips, he perceived to be
more Breton still.




CHAPTER 67

How D'Artagnan became acquainted with a Poet, who had
turned Printer for the sake of printing his own Verses



Before taking his place at table, D'Artagnan acquired, as
was his custom, all the information he could; but it is an
axiom of curiosity, that every man who wishes to question
well and fruitfully ought in the first place to lay himself
open to questions. D'Artagnan sought, then, with his usual
skill, a promising questioner in the hostelry of La
Roche-Bernard. At the moment, there were in the house, on
the first story, two travelers either preparing for supper,
or at supper itself. D'Artagnan had seen their nags in the
stable, and their equipages in the salle. One traveled with
a lackey, undoubtedly a person of consideration; -- two
Perche mares, sleek, sound beasts, were suitable means of
locomotion. The other, a little fellow, a traveler of meagre
appearance, wearing a dusty surtout, dirty linen, and boots
more worn by the pavement than the stirrup, had come from
Nantes with a cart drawn by a horse so like Furet in color,
that D'Artagnan might have gone a hundred miles without
finding a better match. This cart contained divers large
packets wrapped in pieces of old stuff.

"That traveler yonder," said D'Artagnan to himself, "is the
man for my money. He will do, he suits me; I ought to do for
and suit him; M. Agnan, with the gray doublet and the rusty
calotte, is not unworthy of supping with the gentleman of
the old boots and still older horse."

This said, D'Artagnan called the host, and desired him to
send his teal, tourteau, and cider up to the chamber of the
gentleman of modest exterior. He himself climbed, a plate in
his hand, the wooden staircase which led to the chamber, and
began to knock at the door.

"Come in!" said the unknown. D'Artagnan entered, with a
simper on his lips, his plate under his arm, his hat in one
hand, his candle in the other.

"Excuse me, monsieur," said he, "I am, as you are, a
traveler; I know no one in the hotel, and I have the bad
habit of losing my spirits when I eat alone, so that my
repast appears a bad one to me, and does not nourish me.
Your face, which I saw just now, when you came down to have
some oysters opened, -- your face pleased me much. Besides,
I have observed you have a horse just like mine, and that
the host, no doubt on account of that resemblance, has
placed them side by side in the stable, where they appear to
agree amazingly well together. I therefore, monsieur, do not
see any reason why the masters should be separated when the
horses are united. Accordingly, I am come to request the
pleasure of being admitted to your table. My name is Agnan,
at your service, monsieur, the unworthy steward of a rich
seigneur, who wishes to purchase some salt-mines in this
country, and sends me to examine his future acquisitions. In
truth, monsieur, I should be well pleased if my countenance
were as agreeable to you as yours is to me; for, upon my
honor, I am quite at your service."

The stranger, whom D'Artagnan saw for the first time -- for
before he had only caught a glimpse of him, -- the stranger
had black and brilliant eyes, a yellow complexion, a brow a
little wrinkled by the weight of fifty years, bonhomie in
his features collectively, but some cunning in his look.

"One would say," thought D'Artagnan, "that this merry fellow
has never exercised more than the upper part of his head,
his eyes, and his brain. He must be a man of science: his
mouth, nose, and chin signify absolutely nothing."

"Monsieur," replied the latter, with whose mind and person
we have been making so free, "you do me much honor; not that
I am ever ennuye, for I have," added he, smiling, "a company
which amuses me always; but never mind that, I am very happy
to receive you." But when saying this, the man with the worn
boots cast an uneasy look at his table, from which the
oysters had disappeared, and upon which there was nothing
left but a morsel of salt bacon.

"Monsieur," D'Artagnan hastened to say, "the host is
bringing me up a pretty piece of roasted poultry and a
superb tourteau." D'Artagnan had read in the look of his
companion, however rapid it disappeared, the fear of an
attack by a parasite: he divined justly. At this opening,
the features of the man of modest exterior relaxed; and, as
if he had watched the moment for his entrance, as D'Artagnan
spoke, the host appeared, bearing the announced dishes. The
tourteau and the teal were added to the morsel of broiled
bacon; D'Artagnan and his guest bowed, sat down opposite to
each other, and, like two brothers, shared the bacon and the
other dishes.

"Monsieur," said D'Artagnan, "you must confess that
association is a wonderful thing."

"How so?" replied the stranger, with his mouth full.

"Well, I will tell you," replied D'Artagnan.

The stranger gave a short truce to the movement of his jaws,
in order to hear the better.

"In the first place," continued D'Artagnan, "instead of one
candle, which each of us had, we have two."

"That is true!" said the stranger, struck with the extreme
lucidity of the observation.

"Then I see that you eat my tourteau in preference, whilst
I, in preference, eat your bacon."

"That is true again."

"And then, in addition to being better lighted and eating
what we prefer, I place the pleasure of your company."

"Truly, monsieur, you are very jovial," said the unknown,
cheerfully.

"Yes, monsieur; jovial, as all people are who carry nothing
on their minds, or, for that matter, in their heads. Oh! I
can see it is quite another sort of thing with you,"
continued D'Artagnan; "I can read in your eyes all sorts of
genius."

"Oh, monsieur!"

"Come, confess one thing."

"What is that?"

"That you are a learned man."

"Ma foi! monsieur."

"Hein?"

"Almost."

"Come, then!"

"I am an author."

"There!" cried D'Artagnan, clapping his hands, "I knew I
could not be deceived! It is a miracle!"

"Monsieur ---- "

"What, shall I have the honor of passing the evening in the
society of an author, of a celebrated author perhaps?"

"Oh!" said the unknown, blushing, "celebrated, monsieur,
celebrated is not the word."

"Modest!" cried D'Artagnan, transported, "he is modest!"
Then, turning towards the stranger, with a character of
blunt bonhomie: "But tell me at least the name of your
works, monsieur; for you will please to observe you have not
told me your name, and I have been forced to divine your
genius."

"My name is Jupenet, monsieur," said the author.

"A fine name! a grand name! upon my honor; and I do not know
why -- pardon me the mistake, if it be one -- but surely I
have heard that name somewhere."

"I have made verses," said the poet modestly.

"Ah! that is it, then, I have heard them read."

"A tragedy."

"I must have seen it played."

The poet blushed again, and said: "I do not think that can
be the case, for my verses have never been printed."

"Well, then, it must have been the tragedy which informed me
of your name."

"You are again mistaken, for MM. the comedians of the Hotel
de Bourgogne, would have nothing to do with it," said the
poet, with a smile, the receipt for which certain sorts of
pride alone knew the secret. D'Artagnan bit his lips. "Thus,
then, you see, monsieur," continued the poet, "you are in
error on my account, and that not being at all known to you,
you have never heard tell of me."

"Ah! that confounds me. That name, Jupenet, appears to me,
nevertheless, a fine name, and quite as worthy of being
known as those of MM. Corneille, or Rotrou, or Garnier. I
hope, monsieur, you will have the goodness to repeat to me a
part of your tragedy presently, by way of dessert, for
instance. That will be sugared roast meat, -- mordioux! Ah!
pardon me, monsieur, that was a little oath which escaped
me, because it is a habit with my lord and master. I
sometimes allow myself to usurp that little oath, as it
seems in pretty good taste. I take this liberty only in his
absence, please to observe, for you may understand that in
his presence -- but, in truth, monsieur, this cider is
abominable; do you not think so? And besides, the pot is of
such an irregular shape it will not stand on the table."

"Suppose we were to make it level?"

"To be sure; but with what?"

"With this knife."

"And the teal, with what shall we cut that up? Do you not,
by chance, mean to touch the teal?"

"Certainly."

"Well, then ---- "

"Wait."

And the poet rummaged in his pocket, and drew out a piece of
brass, oblong, quadrangular, about a line in thickness, and
an inch and a half in length. But scarcely had this little
piece of brass seen the light, than the poet appeared to
have committed an imprudence, and made a movement to put it
back again in his pocket. D'Artagnan perceived this, for he
was a man that nothing escaped. He stretched forth his hand
towards the piece of brass: "Humph! that which you hold in
your hand is pretty; will you allow me to look at it?"

"Certainly," said the poet, who appeared to have yielded too
soon to a first impulse. "Certainly, you may look at it: but
it will be in vain for you to look at it," added he, with a
satisfied air; "if I were not to tell you its use, you would
never guess it."

D'Artagnan had seized as an avowal the hesitation of the
poet, and his eagerness to conceal the piece of brass which
a first movement had induced him to take out of his pocket.
His attention, therefore, once awakened on this point, he
surrounded himself with a circumspection which gave him a
superiority on all occasions. Besides, whatever M. Jupenet
might say about it, by a simple inspection of the object, he
perfectly well knew what it was. It was a character in
printing.

"Can you guess, now, what this is?" continued the poet.

"No," said D'Artagnan, "no, ma foi!"

"Well, monsieur," said M. Jupenet, "this little piece of
metal is a printing letter."

"Bah!

"A capital."

"Stop, stop, stop;" said D'Artagnan, opening his eyes very
innocently.

"Yes, monsieur, a capital; the first letter of my name."

"And this is a letter, is it?"

"Yes, monsieur."

"Well, I will confess one thing to you.

"And what is that?"

"No, I will not, I was going to say something stupid."

"No, no," said Master Jupenet, with a patronizing air.

"Well then, I cannot comprehend, if that is a letter, how
you can make a word."

"A word?"

"Yes, a printed word."

"Oh, that's very easy."

"Let me see."

"Does it interest you?"

"Enormously."

"Well, I will explain the thing to you. Attend."

"I am attending."

"That is it."

"Good."

"Look attentively."

"I am looking." D'Artagnan, in fact, appeared absorbed in
observations. Jupenet drew from his pocket seven or eight
other pieces of brass smaller than the first.

"Ah, ah," said D'Artagnan.

"What!"

"You have, then, a whole printing-office in your pocket.
Peste! that is curious, indeed."

"Is it not?"

"Good God, what a number of things we learn by traveling."

"To your health!" said Jupenet, quite enchanted.

"To yours, mordioux, to yours. But -- an instant -- not in
this cider. It is an abominable drink, unworthy of a man who
quenches his thirst at the Hippocrene fountain -- is not it
so you call your fountain, you poets?"

"Yes, monsieur, our fountain is so called. That comes from
two Greek words -- hippos, which means a horse, and ---- "

"Monsieur," interrupted D'Artagnan, "you shall drink of a
liquor which comes from one single French word, and is none
the worse for that -- from the word grape; this cider gives
me the heartburn. Allow me to inquire of your host if there
is not a good bottle of Beaugency, or of the Ceran growth,
at the back of the large bins in his cellar."

The host, being sent for, immediately attended.

"Monsieur," interrupted the poet, "take care, we shall not
have time to drink the wine, unless we make great haste, for
I must take advantage of the tide to secure the boat."

"What boat?" asked D'Artagnan.

"Why the boat which sets out for Belle-Isle!"

"Ah -- for Belle-Isle," said the musketeer, "that is good."

"Bah! you will have plenty of time, monsieur," replied the
hotelier, uncorking the bottle, "the boat will not leave
this hour."

"But who will give me notice?" said the poet.

"Your fellow-traveler," replied the host.

"But I scarcely know him."

"When you hear him departing, it will be time for you to
go."

"Is he going to Belle-Isle, likewise, then?"

"The traveler who has a lackey?" asked D'Artagnan. "He is
some gentleman, no doubt?"

"I know nothing of him."

"What! -- know nothing of him?"

"No, all I know is, that he is drinking the same wine as
you."

"Peste! -- that is a great honor for us," said D'Artagnan,
filling his companion's glass, whilst the host went out.

"So," resumed the poet, returning to his dominant ideas,
"you never saw any printing done?"

"Never."

"Well, then, take the letters thus, which compose the word,
you see: A B; ma foi! here is an R, two E E, then a G." And
he assembled the letters with a swiftness and skill which
did not escape the eye of D'Artagnan.

"Abrege," said he, as he ended.

"Good!" said D'Artagnan; "here are plenty of letters got
together; but how are they kept so?" And he poured out a
second glass for the poet. M. Jupenet smiled like a man who
has an answer for everything; then he pulled out -- still
from his pocket -- a little metal ruler, composed of two
parts, like a carpenter's rule, against which he put
together, and in a line, the characters, holding them under
his left thumb.

"And what do you call that little metal ruler?" said
D'Artagnan, "for, I suppose, all these things have names."

"This is called a composing-stick," said Jupenet; "it is by
the aid of this stick that the lines are formed."

"Come, then, I was not mistaken in what I said; you have a
press in your pocket," said D'Artagnan, laughing with an air
of simplicity so stupid, that the poet was completely his
dupe.

"No," replied he; "but I am too lazy to write, and when I
have a verse in my head, I print it immediately. That is a
labor spared."

"Mordioux!" thought D'Artagnan to himself, "this must be
cleared up." And under a pretext, which did not embarrass
the musketeer, who was fertile in expedients, he left the
table, went downstairs, ran to the shed under which stood
the poet's little cart, poked the point of his poniard into
the stuff which enveloped one of the packages, which he
found full of types, like those which the poet had in his
pocket.

"Humph!" said D'Artagnan, "I do not yet know whether M.
Fouquet wishes to fortify Belle-Isle; but, at all events,
here are some spiritual munitions for the castle." Then,
enchanted with his rich discovery he ran upstairs again, and
resumed his place at the table.

D'Artagnan had learnt what he wished to know. He, however,
remained, none the less, face to face with his partner, to
the moment when they heard from the next room symptoms of a
person's being about to go out. The printer was immediately
on foot; he had given orders for his horse to be got ready.
His carriage was waiting at the door. The second traveler
got into his saddle, in the courtyard, with his lackey.
D'Artagnan followed Jupenet to the door; he embarked his
cart and horse on board the boat. As to the opulent
traveler, he did the same with his two horses and servant.
But all the wit D'Artagnan employed in endeavoring to find
out his name was lost -- he could learn nothing. Only he
took such notice of his countenance, that it was impressed
upon his mind forever. D'Artagnan had a great inclination to
embark with the two travelers, but an interest more powerful
than curiosity -- that of success -- repelled him from the
shore, and brought him back again to the hostelry. He
entered with a sigh and went to bed directly in order to be
ready early in the morning with fresh ideas and the sage
counsel of sufficing sleep.




CHAPTER 68

D'Artagnan continues his Investigations



At daybreak D'Artagnan saddled Furet, who had fared
sumptuously all night, devouring the remainder of the oats
and hay left by his companions. The musketeer sifted all he
possibly could out of the host, whom he found cunning,
mistrustful, and devoted, body and soul, to M. Fouquet. In
order not to awaken the suspicions of this man, he carried
on his fable of being a probable purchaser of some
salt-mines. To have embarked for Belle-Isle at Roche-Bernard
would have been to expose himself still further to comments
which had, perhaps, been already made, and would be carried
to the castle. Moreover, it was singular that this traveler
and his lackey should have remained a mystery to D'Artagnan,
in spite of all the questions addressed by him to the host,
who appeared to know him perfectly well. The musketeer then
made some inquiries concerning the salt-mines, and took the
road to the marshes, leaving the sea on his right, and
penetrating into that vast and desolate plain which
resembles a sea of mud, of which, here and there, a few
crests of salt silver the undulations. Furet walked
admirably, with his little nervous legs, along the foot-wide
causeways which separate the salt-mines. D'Artagnan, aware
of the consequences of a fall, which would result in a cold
bath, allowed him to go as he liked, contenting himself with
looking at, on the horizon, three rocks, that rose up like
lance-blades from the bosom of the plain, destitute of
verdure. Pirial, the bourgs of Batz and Le Croisic, exactly
resembling each other, attracted and suspended his
attention. If the traveler turned round, the better to make
his observations, he saw on the other side an horizon of
three other steeples, Guerande, Le Poulighen, and
Saint-Joachim, which, in their circumference, represented a
set of skittles, of which he and Furet were but the
wandering ball. Pirial was the first little port on his
right. He went thither, with the names of the principal
salters on his lips. At the moment he reached the little
port of Pirial, five large barges, laden with stone, were
leaving it. It appeared strange to D'Artagnan, that stones
should be leaving a country where none are found. He had
recourse to all the amenity of M. Agnan to learn from the
people of the port the cause of this singular arrangement.
An old fisherman replied to M. Agnan, that the stones very
certainly did not come from Pirial or the marshes.

"Where do they come from, then?" asked the musketeer.

"Monsieur, they come from Nantes and Painboeuf."

"Where are they going, then?"

"Monsieur, to Belle-Isle."

"Ah! ah!" said D'Artagnan, in the same tone he had assumed
to tell the printer that his character interested him; "are
they building at Belle-Isle, then?"

"Why, yes, monsieur, M. Fouquet has the walls of the castle
repaired every year."

"Is it in ruins, then?"

"It is old."

"Thank you."

"The fact is," said D'Artagnan to himself, "nothing is more
natural; every proprietor has a right to repair his own
property. It would be like telling me I was fortifying the
Image-de-Notre-Dame, when I was simply obliged to make
repairs. In good truth, I believe false reports have been
made to his majesty, and he is very likely to be in the
wrong."

"You must confess," continued he then, aloud, and addressing
the fisherman -- for his part of a suspicious man was
imposed upon him by the object even of his mission -- "you
must confess, my dear monsieur, that these stones travel in
a very curious fashion."

"How so?" said the fisherman

"They come from Nantes or Painboeuf by the Loire, do they
not?"

"With the tide."

"That is convenient, -- I don't say it is not, but why do
they not go straight from Saint-Nazaire to Belle-Isle?"

"Eh! because the chalands (barges) are fresh-water boats,
and take the sea badly," replied, the fisherman.

"That is not sufficient reason."

"Pardon me, monsieur, one may see that you have never been a
sailor, added the fisherman, not without a sort of disdain.

"Explain that to me, if you please, my good man. It appears
to me that to come from Painboeuf to Pirial, and go from
Pirial to Belle-Isle, is as if we went from Roche-Bernard to
Nantes, and from Nantes to Pirial."

"By water that would be the nearest way," replied the
fisherman imperturbably.

"But there is an elbow?"

The fisherman shook his head.

"The shortest road from one place to another is a straight
line," continued D'Artagnan.

"You forget the tide, monsieur."

"Well! take the tide."

"And the wind."

"Well, and the wind."

"Without doubt, the current of the Loire carries barks
almost as far as Croisic. If they want to lie by a little,
or to refresh the crew, they come to Pirial along the coast;
from Pirial they find another inverse current, which carries
them to the Isle-Dumal, two leagues and a half."

"Granted."

"There the current of the Vilaine throws them upon another
isle, the isle of Hoedic."

"I agree with that."

"Well, monsieur, from that isle to Belle-Isle the way is
quite straight. The sea broken both above and below, passes
like a canal -- like a mirror between the two isles; the
chalands glide along upon it like ducks upon the Loire;
that's how it is."

"It does not signify," said the obstinate M. Agnan; "it is a
long way round."

"Ah! yes; but M. Fouquet will have it so," replied, as
conclusive, the fisherman, taking off his woolen cap at the
enunciation of that respected name.

A look from D'Artagnan, a look as keen and piercing as a
sword-blade, found nothing in the heart of the old man but
simple confidence -- on his features, nothing but
satisfaction and indifference. He said, "M. Fouquet will
have it so," as he would have said, "God has willed it."

D'Artagnan had already advanced too far in this direction;
besides, the chalands being gone, there remained nothing at
Pirial but a single bark -- that of the old man, and it did
not look fit for sea without great preparation. D'Artagnan
therefore patted Furet, who as a new proof of his charming
character, resumed his march with his feet in the
salt-mines, and his nose to the dry wind, which bends the
furze and the broom of this country. They reached Croisic
about five o'clock.

If D'Artagnan had been a poet, it was a beautiful spectacle:
the immense strand of a league or more, the sea covers at
high tide, and which, at the reflux, appears gray and
desolate, strewed with polypi and seaweed, with pebbles
sparse and white, like bones in some vast old cemetery. But
the soldier, the politician, and the ambitious man, had no
longer the sweet consolation of looking towards heaven to
read there a hope or a warning. A red sky signifies nothing
to such people but wind and disturbance. White and fleecy
clouds upon the azure only say that the sea will be smooth
and peaceful. D'Artagnan found the sky blue, the breeze
embalmed with saline perfumes, and he said: "I will embark
with the first tide, if it be but in a nutshell."

At Croisic as at Pirial, he had remarked enormous heaps of
stone lying along the shore. These gigantic walls,
diminished every tide by the barges for Belle-Isle were, in
the eyes of the musketeer, the consequence and the proof of
what he had well divined at Pirial. Was it a wall that M.
Fouquet was constructing? Was it a fortification that he was
erecting? To ascertain that he must make fuller
observations. D'Artagnan put Furet into a stable; supped,
went to bed, and on the morrow took a walk upon the port or
rather upon the shingle. Le Croisic has a port of fifty
feet, it has a look-out which resembles an enormous brioche
(a kind of cake) elevated on a dish. The flat strand is the
dish. Hundreds of barrowsful of earth amalgamated with
pebbles, and rounded into cones, with sinuous. passages
between, are look-outs and brioches at the same time.

It is so now, and it was so two hundred years ago, only the
brioche was not so large, and probably there were to be seen
no trellises of lath around the brioche, which constitute an
ornament, planted like gardes-fous along the passages that
wind towards the little terrace. Upon the shingle lounged
three or four fishermen talking about sardines and shrimps.
D'Artagnan, with his eyes animated by rough gayety, and a
smile upon his lips, approached these fishermen.

"Any fishing going on to-day?" said he.

"Yes, monsieur," replied one of them, "we are only waiting
for the tide."

"Where do you fish, my friends?"

"Upon the coasts, monsieur."

"Which are the best coasts?"

"Ah, that is all according. The tour of the isles, for
example?"

"Yes, but they are a long way off, those isles, are they
not?"

"Not very; four leagues."

"Four leagues! That is a voyage."

The fisherman laughed in M. Agnan's face.

"Hear me, then," said the latter with an air of simple
stupidity; four leagues off you lose sight of land, do you
not?"

"Why, not always."

"Ah, it is a long way -- too long, or else I would have
asked you to take me aboard, and to show me what I have
never seen."

"What is that?"

"A live sea-fish."

"Monsieur comes from the province?" said a fisherman.

"Yes, I come from Paris."

The Breton shrugged his shoulders; then:

"Have you ever seen M. Fouquet in Paris?" asked he.

"Often," replied D'Artagnan.

"Often!" repeated the fishermen, closing their circle round
the Parisian. "Do you know him?"

"A little, he is the intimate friend of my master."

"Ah!" said the fisherman, in astonishment.

"And," said D'Artagnan, "I have seen all his chateaux of
Saint-Mande, of Vaux, and his hotel in Paris."

"Is that a fine place?"

"Superb."

"It is not so fine a place as Belle-Isle," said the
fisherman.

"Bah!" cried M. d'Artagnan, breaking into a laugh so loud
that he angered all his auditors.

"It is very plain that you have never seen Belle-Isle," said
the most curious of the fishermen. "Do you know that there
are six leagues of it, and that there are such trees on it
as cannot be equaled even at Nantes-sur-le-Fosse?"

"Trees in the sea!" cried D'Artagnan; "well, I should like
to see them."

"That can be easily done; we are fishing at the Isle de
Hoedic -- come with us. From that place you will see, as a
Paradise, the black trees of Belle-Isle against the sky; you
will see the white line of the castle, which cuts the
horizon of the sea like a blade."

"Oh," said D'Artagnan, "that must be very beautiful. But do
you know there are a hundred belfries at M. Fouquet's
chateau of Vaux?"

The Breton raised his head in profound admiration, but he
was not convinced. "A hundred belfries! Ah that may be, but
Belle-Isle is finer than that. Should you like to see
Belle-Isle?"

"Is that possible?" asked D'Artagnan.

"Yes, with permission of the governor."

"But I do not know the governor."

"As you know M. Fouquet, you can tell your name."

"Oh, my friends, I am not a gentleman."

"Everybody enters Belle-Isle," continued the fisherman in
his strong, pure language, "provided he means no harm to
Belle-Isle or its master."

A slight shudder crept over the body of the musketeer.

"That is true," thought he. Then recovering himself, "If I
were sure," said he, "not to be sea-sick."

"What, upon her?" said the fisherman, pointing with pride to
his pretty round-bottomed bark.

"Well, you almost persuade me," cried M. Agnan; "I will go
and see Belle-Isle, but they will not admit me."

"We shall enter, safe enough."

"You! What for?"

"Why, dame! to sell fish to the corsairs."

"Ha! Corsairs -- what do you mean?"

"Well, I mean that M. Fouquet is having two corsairs built
to chase the Dutch and the English, and we sell our fish to
the crews of those little vessels."

"Come, come!" said D'Artagnan to himself -- "better and
better. A printing-press, bastions, and corsairs! Well, M.
Fouquet is not an enemy to be despised, as I presumed to
fancy. He is worth the trouble of traveling to see him
nearer."

"We set out at half-past five," said the fisherman gravely.

"I am quite ready, and I will not leave you now." So
D'Artagnan saw the fishermen haul their barks to meet the
tide with a windlass. The sea rose, M. Agnan allowed himself
to be hoisted on board, not without sporting a little fear
and awkwardness, to the amusement of the young beach-urchins
who watched him with their large intelligent eyes. He laid
himself down upon a folded sail, not interfering with
anything whilst the bark prepared for sea; and, with its
large, square sail, it was fairly out within two hours. The
fishermen, who prosecuted their occupation as they
proceeded, did not perceive that their passenger had not
become pale, neither groaned nor suffered; that in spite of
that horrible tossing and rolling of the bark, to which no
hand imparted direction, the novice passenger had preserved
his presence of mind and his appetite. They fished, and
their fishing was sufficiently fortunate. To lines bated
with prawn, soles came, with numerous gambols, to bite. Two
nets had already been broken by the immense weight of
congers and haddocks; three sea-eels plowed the hold with
their slimy folds and their dying contortions. D'Artagnan
brought them good luck; they told him so. The soldier found
the occupation so pleasant, that he put his hand to the work
-- that is to say, to the lines -- and uttered roars of joy,
and mordioux enough to have astonished his musketeers
themselves every time that a shock given to his line by the
captured fish required the play of the muscles of his arm,
and the employment of his best dexterity. The party of
pleasure had made him forget his diplomatic mission. He was
struggling with a very large conger, and holding fast with
one hand to the side of the vessel, in order to seize with
the other the gaping jowl of his antagonist, when the master
said to him, "Take care they don't see you from Belle-Isle!"

These words produced the same effect upon D'Artagnan as the
hissing of the first bullet on a day of battle; he let go of
both line and conger, which, dragging each other, returned
again to the water. D'Artagnan perceived, within half a
league at most, the blue and marked profile of the rocks of
Belle-Isle, dominated by the majestic whiteness of the
castle. In the distance, the land with its forests and
verdant plains; cattle on the grass. This was what first
attracted the attention of the musketeer. The sun darted its
rays of gold upon the sea, raising a shining mist round this
enchanted isle. Little could be seen of it, owing to this
dazzling light, but the salient points; every shadow was
strongly marked, and cut with bands of darkness the luminous
fields and walls. "Eh! eh!" said D'Artagnan, at the aspect
of those masses of black rocks, "these are fortifications
which do not stand in need of any engineer to render a
landing difficult. How the devil can a landing be effected
on that isle which God has defended so completely?"

"This way," replied the patron of the bark, changing the
sail, and impressing upon the rudder a twist which turned
the boat in the direction of a pretty little port, quite
coquettish, round, and newly battlemented.

"What the devil do I see yonder?" said D'Artagnan.

"You see Leomaria," replied the fisherman.

"Well, but there?"

"That is Bragos."

"And further on?"

"Sanger, and then the palace."

"Mordioux! It is a world. Ah! there are some soldiers."

"There are seventeen hundred men in Belle-Isle, monsieur,"
replied the fisherman, proudly. "Do you know that the least
garrison is of twenty companies of infantry?"

"Mordioux!" cried D'Artagnan, stamping with his foot. "His
Majesty was right enough."

They landed.




CHAPTER 69

In which the Reader, no doubt, will be as astonished
as D'Artagnan was to meet an Old Acquaintance



There is always something in a landing, if it be only from
the smallest sea-boat -- a trouble and a confusion which do
not leave the mind the liberty of which it stands in need in
order to study at the first glance the new locality
presented to it. The movable bridges, the agitated sailors,
the noise of the water on the pebbles, the cries and
importunities of those who wait upon the shores, are
multiplied details of that sensation which is summed up in
one single result -- hesitation. It was not, then, till
after standing several minutes on the shore that D'Artagnan
saw upon the port, but more particularly in the interior of
the isle, an immense number of workmen in motion. At his
feet D'Artagnan recognized the five chalands laden with
rough stone he had seen leave the port of Pirial. The
smaller stones were transported to the shore by means of a
chain formed by twenty-five or thirty peasants. The large
stones were loaded on trollies which conveyed them in the
same direction as the others, that is to say, towards the
works of which D'Artagnan could as yet appreciate neither
the strength nor the extent. Everywhere was to be seen an
activity equal to that which Telemachus observed on his
landing at Salentum. D'Artagnan felt a strong inclination to
penetrate into the interior; but he could not, under the
penalty of exciting mistrust, exhibit too much curiosity. He
advanced then little by little, scarcely going beyond the
line formed by the fishermen on the beach, observing
everything, saying nothing, and meeting all suspicion that
might have been excited with a half-silly question or a
polite bow. And yet, whilst his companions carried on their
trade, giving or selling their fish to the workmen or the
inhabitants of the city, D'Artagnan had gained ground by
degrees, and, reassured by the little attention paid to him,
he began to cast an intelligent and confident look upon the
men and things that appeared before his eyes. And his very
first glance fell on certain movements of earth about which
the eye of a soldier could not be mistaken. At the two
extremities of the port, in order that their fires should
converge upon the great axis of the ellipsis formed by the
basin, in the first place, two batteries had been raised,
evidently destined to receive flank pieces, for D'Artagnan
saw the workmen finishing the platform and making ready the
demi-circumference in wood upon which the wheels of the
pieces might turn to embrace every direction over the
epaulement. By the side of each of these batteries other
workmen were strengthening gabions filled with earth, the
lining of another battery. The latter had embrasures, and
the overseer of the works called successively men who, with
cords, tied the saucissons and cut the lozenges and right
angles of turfs destined to retain the matting of the
embrasures. By the activity displayed in these works,
already so far advanced, they might be considered as
finished: they were not yet furnished with their cannons,
but the platforms had their gites and their madriers all
prepared; the earth, beaten carefully, was consolidated; and
supposing the artillery to be on the island, in less than
two or three days the port might be completely armed. That
which astonished D'Artagnan, when he turned his eyes from
the coast batteries to the fortifications of the city, was
to see that Belle-Isle was defended by an entirely new
system, of which he had often heard the Comte de la Fere
speak as a wonderful advance, but of which he had as yet
never seen the application. These fortifications belonged
neither to the Dutch method of Marollais, nor to the French
method of the Chevalier Antoine de Ville, but to the system
of Manesson Mallet, a skillful engineer, who about six or
eight years previously had quitted the service of Portugal
to enter that of France. The works had this peculiarity,
that instead of rising above the earth, as did the ancient
ramparts destined to defend a city from escalades, they, on
the contrary, sank into it; and what created the height of
the walls was the depth of the ditches. It did not take long
to make D'Artagnan perceive the superiority of such a
system, which gives no advantage to cannon. Besides, as the
fosses were lower than, or on a level with the sea, these
fosses could be instantly inundated by means of subterranean
sluices. Otherwise, the works were almost complete, and a
group of workmen, receiving orders from a man who appeared
to be conductor of the works, were occupied in placing the
last stones. A bridge of planks thrown over the fosses for
the greater convenience of the maneuvers connected with the
barrows, joined the interior to the exterior. With an air of
simple curiosity D'Artagnan asked if he might be permitted
to cross the bridge, and he was told that no order prevented
it. Consequently he crossed the bridge, and advanced towards
the group.

This group was superintended by the man whom D'Artagnan had
already remarked, and who appeared to be the
engineer-in-chief. A plan was lying open before him upon a
large stone forming a table, and at some paces from him a
crane was in action. This engineer, who by his evident
importance first attracted the attention of D'Artagnan, wore
a justaucorps, which, from its sumptuousness was scarcely in
harmony with the work he was employed in, that rather
necessitated the costume of a master-mason than of a noble.
He was a man of immense stature and great square shoulders,
and wore a hat covered with feathers. He gesticulated in the
most majestic manner, and appeared, for D'Artagnan only saw
his back, to be scolding the workmen for their idleness and
want of strength.

D'Artagnan continued to draw nearer. At that moment the man
with the feathers ceased to gesticulate, and, with his hands
placed upon his knees, was following, half-bent, the effort
of six workmen to raise a block of hewn stone to the top of
a piece of timber destined to support that stone, so that
the cord of the crane might be passed under it. The six men,
all on one side of the stone, united their efforts to raise
it to eight or ten inches from the ground, sweating and
blowing, whilst a seventh got ready against there should be
daylight enough beneath it to slide in the roller that was
to support it. But the stone had already twice escaped from
their hands before gaining a sufficient height for the
roller to be introduced. There can be no doubt that every
time the stone escaped them, they bounded quickly backwards,
to keep their feet from being crushed by the refalling
stone. Every time, the stone, abandoned by them, sunk deeper
into the damp earth, which rendered the operation more and
more difficult. A third effort was followed by no better
success, but with progressive discouragement. And yet, when
the six men were bent towards the stone, the man with the
feathers had himself, with a powerful voice, given the word
of command, "Ferme!" which regulates maneuvers of strength.
Then he drew himself up.

"Oh! oh!" said he, "what is all this about? Have I to do
with men of straw? Corne de boeuf! stand on one side, and
you shall see how this is to be done."

"Peste!" said D'Artagnan, "will he pretend to raise that
rock? that would be a sight worth looking at."

The workmen, as commanded by the engineer, drew back with
their ears down, and shaking their heads, with the exception
of the one who held the plank, who prepared to perform the
office. The man with the feathers went up to the stone,
stooped, slipped his hands under the face lying upon the
ground, stiffened his Herculean muscles, and without a
strain, with a slow motion, like that of a machine, he
lifted the end of the rock a foot from the ground. The
workman who held the plank profited by the space thus given
him, and slipped the roller under the stone.

"That's the way," said the giant, not letting the rock fall
again, but placing it upon its support.

"Mordioux!" cried D'Artagnan, "I know but one man capable of
such a feat of strength."

"Hein!" cried the colossus, turning round.

"Porthos!" murmured D'Artagnan, seized with stupor, "Porthos
at Belle-Isle!"

On his part, the man with the feathers fixed his eyes upon
the disguised lieutenant, and, in spite of his
metamorphosis, recognized him. "D'Artagnan!" cried he; and
the color mounted to his face. "Hush!" said he to
D'Artagnan.

"Hush!" in his turn, said the musketeer. In fact if Porthos
had just been discovered by D'Artagnan, D'Artagnan had just
been discovered by Porthos. The interest of the particular
secret of each struck them both at the same instant.
Nevertheless the first movement of the two men was to throw
their arms around each other. What they wished to conceal
from the bystanders, was not their friendship, but their
names. But, after the embrace, came reflection.

"What the devil brings Porthos to Belle-Isle, lifting
stones?" said D'Artagnan; only D'Artagnan uttered that
question in a low voice. Less strong in diplomacy than his
friend, Porthos thought aloud.

"How the devil did you come to Belle-Isle?" asked he of
D'Artagnan; "and what do you want to do here?" It was
necessary to reply without hesitation. To hesitate in his
answer to Porthos would have been a check, for which the
self-love of D'Artagnan would never have consoled itself.

"Pardieu! my friend, I am at Belle-Isle because you are."

"Ah, bah!" said Porthos, visibly stupefied with the
argument, and seeking to account for it to himself, with the
felicity of deduction we know to be peculiar to him.

"Without doubt," continued D'Artagnan, unwilling to give his
friend time to recollect himself, "I have been to see you at
Pierrefonds."

"Indeed!"

"Yes."

"And you did not find me there?"

"No, but I found Mouston."

"Is he well?"

"Peste!"

"Well, but Mouston did not tell you I was here."

"Why should he not Have I, perchance, deserved to lose his
confidence?"

"No, but he did not know it."

"Well; that is a reason at least that does not offend my
self-love."

"Then how did you manage to find me?"

"My dear friend, a great noble like you always leaves traces
behind him on his passage; and I should think but poorly of
myself, if I were not sharp enough to follow the traces of
my friends." This explanation, flattering as it was, did not
entirely satisfy Porthos.

"But I left no traces behind me, for I came here disguised,"
said Porthos.

"Ah! You came disguised did you?" said D'Artagnan.

"Yes."

"And how?"

"As a miller."

"And do you think a great noble, like you, Porthos, can
affect common manners so as to deceive people?"

"Well, I swear to you, my friend, that I played my part so
well that everybody was deceived."

"Indeed! so well, that I have not discovered and joined
you?"

"Yes; but how did you discover and join me?"

"Stop a bit. I was going to tell you how. Do you imagine
Mouston ---- "

"Ah! it was that fellow, Mouston," said Porthos, gathering
up those two triumphant arches which served him for
eyebrows.

"But stop, I tell you -- it was no fault of Mouston's
because he was ignorant of where you were."

"I know he was; and that is why I am in such haste to
understand ---- "

"Oh! how impatient you are, Porthos."

"When I do not comprehend, I am terrible."

"Well, you will understand. Aramis wrote to you at
Pierrefonds, did he not?"

"Yes."

"And he told you to come before the equinox."

"That is true."

"Well! that is it," said D'Artagnan, hoping that this reason
would mystify Porthos. Porthos appeared to give himself up
to a violent mental labor.

"Yes, yes," said he, "I understand. As Aramis told me to
come before the equinox, you have understood that that was
to join him. You then inquired where Aramis was, saying to
yourself, `Where Aramis is, there Porthos will be.' You have
learnt that Aramis was in Bretagne, and you said to
yourself, `Porthos is in Bretagne.'"

"Exactly. In good truth, Porthos I cannot tell why you have
not turned conjurer. So you understand that arriving at
Roche-Bernard, I heard of the splendid fortifications going
on at Belle-Isle. The account raised my curiosity, I
embarked in a fishing boat, without dreaming that you were
here: I came, and I saw a monstrous fine fellow lifting a
stone Ajax could not have stirred. I cried out, `Nobody but
the Baron de Bracieux could have performed such a feat of
strength.' You heard me, you turned round, you recognized
me, we embraced; and, ma foi! if you like, my dear friend,
we will embrace again."

"Ah! now all is explained," said Porthos; and he embraced
D'Artagnan with so much friendship as to deprive the
musketeer of his breath for five minutes.

"Why, you are stronger than ever," said D'Artagnan, "and
still, happily, in your arms." Porthos saluted D'Artagnan
with a gracious smile. During the five minutes D'Artagnan
was recovering his breath, he reflected that he had a very
difficult part to play. It was necessary that he always
should question and never reply. By the time his respiration
returned, he had fixed his plans for the campaign.




CHAPTER 70

Wherein the Ideas of D'Artagnan, at first
strangely clouded, begin to clear up a little



D'Artagnan immediately took the offensive. Now that I have
told you all, dear friend, or rather now you have guessed
all, tell me what you are doing here, covered with dust and
mud?"

Porthos wiped his brow, and looked around him with pride.
"Why, it appears," said he, "that you may see what I am
doing here."

"No doubt, no doubt, you lift great stones."

"Oh! to show these idle fellows what a man is," said
Porthos, with contempt. "But you understand ---- "

"Yes, that it is not your place to lift stones, although
there are many whose place it is, who cannot lift them as
you do. It was that which made me ask you, just now, What
are you doing here, baron?"

"I am studying topography, chevalier."

"You are studying topography?"

"Yes; but you -- what are you doing in that common dress?"

D'Artagnan perceived he had committed a fault in giving
expression to his astonishment. Porthos had taken advantage
of it, to retort with a question. "Why," said he, "you know
I am a bourgeois, in fact; my dress, then, has nothing
astonishing in it, since it conforms with my condition."

"Nonsense! you are a musketeer."

"You are wrong, my friend; I have given in my resignation."

"Bah!"

"Oh, mon Dieu! yes."

"And have you abandoned the service?"

"I have quitted it."

"You have abandoned the king?"

"Quite."

Porthos raised his arms towards heaven, like a man who has
heard extraordinary news. "Well, that does confound me,"
said he.

"It is nevertheless true."

"And what led you to form such a resolution?"

"The king displeased me. Mazarin had disgusted me for a long
time, as you know; so I threw my cassock to the nettles."

"But Mazarin is dead."

"I know that well enough, parbleu! Only, at the period of
his death, my resignation had been given in and accepted two
months. Then, feeling myself free, I set off for
Pierrefonds, to see my friend Porthos. I had heard talk of
the happy division you had made of your time, and I wished,
for a fortnight, to divide mine after your fashion."

"My friend, you know that it is not for a fortnight my house
is open to you; it is for a year -- for ten years -- for
life."

"Thank you, Porthos."

"Ah! but perhaps you want money -- do you?" said Porthos,
making something like fifty louis chink in his pocket. "In
that case, you know ---- "

"No, thank you, I am not in want of anything. I placed my
savings with Planchet, who pays me the interest of them."

"Your savings?"

"Yes, to be sure," said D'Artagnan: "why should I not put by
my savings, as well as another, Porthos?"

"Oh, there is no reason why; on the contrary, I always
suspected you -- that is to say, Aramis always suspected you
to have savings. For my own part, d'ye see, I take no
concern about the management of my household; but I presume
the savings of a musketeer must be small."

"No doubt, relative to yourself, Porthos, who are a
millionaire; but you shall judge. I had laid by twenty-five
thousand livres."

"That's pretty well," said Porthos, with an affable air.

"And," continued D'Artagnan, "on the twenty-eighth of last
month I added to it two hundred thousand livres more."

Porthos opened his large eyes, which eloquently demanded of
the musketeer, "Where the devil did you steal such a sum as
that, my dear friend?" "Two hundred thousand livres!" cried
he, at length.

"Yes; which, with the twenty-five I had, and twenty thousand
I have about me, complete the sum of two hundred and
forty-five thousand livres."

"But tell me, whence comes this fortune?"

"I will tell you all about it presently, dear friend; but as
you have, in the first place, many things to tell me
yourself, let us have my recital in its proper order."

"Bravo!" said Porthos, "then we are both rich. But what can
I have to relate to you?"

"You have to relate to me how Aramis came to be named ---- "

"Ah! bishop of Vannes."

"That's it " said D'Artagnan, "bishop of Vannes. Dear
Aramis! do you know how he succeeded so well?"

"Yes, yes; without reckoning that he does not mean to stop
there."

"What! do you mean he will not be contented with violet
stockings, and that he wants a red hat?"

"Hush! that is promised him."

"Bah! by the king?"

"By somebody more powerful than the king."

"Ah! the devil! Porthos: what incredible things you tell me,
my friend!"

"Why incredible? Is there not always somebody in France more
powerful than the king?"

"Oh, yes; in the time of King Louis XIII. it was Cardinal
Richelieu; in the time of the Regency it was Cardinal
Mazarin. In the time of Louis XIV. it is M. ---- "

"Go on."

"It is M. Fouquet."

"Jove! you have hit it the first time."

"So, then, I suppose it is M. Fouquet who has promised
Aramis the red hat?"

Porthos assumed an air of reserve. "Dear friend," said he,
"God preserve me from meddling with the affairs of others,
above all from revealing secrets it may be to their interest
to keep. When you see Aramis, he will tell you all he thinks
he ought to tell you."

"You are right, Porthos; and you are quite a padlock for
safety. But, to revert to yourself?"

"Yes," said Porthos.

"You said just now you came hither to study topography?"

"I did so."

"Tudieu! my friend, what fine things you will do!"

"How do you mean?"

"Why, these fortifications are admirable."

"Is that your opinion?"

"Decidedly it is. In truth, to anything but a regular siege,
Belle-Isle is absolutely impregnable."

Porthos rubbed his hands. "That is my opinion," said he.

"But who the devil has fortified this paltry little place in
this manner?"

Porthos drew himself up proudly: "Did not I tell you who?"

"No."

"Do you not suspect?"

"No; all I can say is that he is a man who has studied all
the systems, and who appears to me to have stopped at the
best."

"Hush!" said Porthos; "consider my modesty, my dear
D'Artagnan."

"In truth," replied the musketeer, "can it be you -- who --
oh!"

"Pray -- my dear friend ---- "

"You who have imagined, traced, and combined between these
bastions, these redans, these curtains, these half-moons;
and are preparing that covered way?"

"I beg you ---- "

"You who have built that lunette with its retiring angles
and its salient angles?"

"My friend ---- "

"You who have given that inclination to the openings of your
embrasures, by means of which you so effectively protect the
men who serve the guns?"

"Eh! mon Dieu! yes."

"Oh! Porthos, Porthos! I must bow down before you -- I must
admire you! But you have always concealed from us this
superb, this incomparable genius. I hope, my dear friend,
you will show me all this in detail."

"Nothing more easy. Here lies my original sketch, my plan."

"Show it me." Porthos led D'Artagnan towards the stone that
served him for a table, and upon which the plan was spread.
At the foot of the plan was written, in the formidable
writing of Porthos, writing of which we have already had
occasion to speak: --

"Instead of making use of the square or rectangle, as has
been done to this time, you will suppose your place inclosed
in a regular hexagon, this polygon having the advantage of
offering more angles than the quadrilateral one. Every side
of your hexagon, of which you will determine the length in
proportion to the dimensions taken upon the place, will be
divided into two parts and upon the middle point you will
elevate a perpendicular towards the center of the polygon,
which will equal in length the sixth part of the side. By
the extremities of each side of the polygon, you will trace
two diagonals, which will cut the perpendicular. These will
form the precise lines of your defense."

"The devil!" said D'Artagnan, stopping at this point of the
demonstration; "why, this is a complete system, Porthos."

"Entirely," said Porthos. "Continue."

"No; I have read enough of it; but, since it is you, my dear
Porthos, who direct the works, what need have you of setting
down your system so formally in writing?"

"Oh! my dear friend, death!"

"How! death?"

"Why, we are all mortal, are we not?"

"That is true," said D'Artagnan; "you have a reply for
everything, my friend." And he replaced the plan upon the
stone.

But however short the time he had the plan in his hands,
D'Artagnan had been able to distinguish, under the enormous
writing of Porthos, a much more delicate hand, which
reminded him of certain letters to Marie Michon, with which
he had been acquainted in his youth. Only the India-rubber
had passed and repassed so often over this writing that it
might have escaped a less practiced eye than that of our
musketeer.

"Bravo! my friend, bravo!" said D'Artagnan.

"And now you know all that you want to know, do you not?"
said Porthos, wheeling about.

"Mordioux! yes, only do me one last favor, dear friend!"

"Speak, I am master here."

"Do me the pleasure to tell me the name of that gentleman
who is walking yonder."

"Where, there?"

"Behind the soldiers."

"Followed by a lackey?"

"Exactly."

"In company with a mean sort of a fellow, dressed in black?"

"Yes, I mean him."

"That is M. Getard."

"And who is Getard, my friend?"

"He is the architect of the house."

"Of what house?"

"Of M. Fouquet's house."

"Ah! ah!" cried D'Artagnan, "you are of the household of M.
Fouquet, then, Porthos?"

"I! what do you mean by that?" said the topographer,
blushing to the top of his ears.

"Why, you say the house, when speaking of Belle-Isle, as if
you were speaking of the chateau of Pierrefonds."

Porthos bit his lips. "Belle-Isle, my friend," said he,
"belongs to M. Fouquet, does it not?"

"Yes, I believe so."

"As Pierrefonds belongs to me?"

"I told you I believed so; there are no two words to that."

"Did you ever see a man there who is accustomed to walk
about with a ruler in his hand?"

"No; but I might have seen him there, if he really walked
there."

"Well, that gentleman is M. Boulingrin."

"Who is M. Boulingrin?"

"Now, we are coming to it. If, when this gentleman is
walking with a ruler in his hand, any one should ask me, --
`Who is M. Boulingrin?' I should reply: `He is the architect
of the house.' Well! M. Getard is the Boulingrin of M.
Fouquet. But he has nothing to do with the fortifications,
which are my department alone; do you understand? mine,
absolutely mine."

"Ah! Porthos," cried D'Artagnan, letting his arms fall as a
conquered man gives up his sword; "ah! my friend, you are
not only a herculean topographer, you are, still further, a
dialectician of the first water."

"Is it not powerfully reasoned?" said Porthos: and he puffed
and blew like the conger which D'Artagnan had let slip from
his hand.

"And now," said D'Artagnan, "that shabby-looking man, who
accompanies M. Getard, is he also of the household of M.
Fouquet?"

"Oh! yes," said Porthos, with contempt; "it is one M.
Jupenet, or Juponet, a sort of poet."

"Who is come to establish himself here?"

"I believe so."

"I thought M. Fouquet had poets enough, yonder -- Scudery,
Loret, Pellisson, La Fontaine? If I must tell you the truth,
Porthos, that poet disgraces you."

"Eh! -- my friend; but what saves us is that he is not here
as a poet."

"As what, then, is he?"

"As printer. And you make me remember, I have a word to say
to the cuistre."

"Say it, then."

Porthos made a sign to Jupenet, who perfectly recollected
D'Artagnan, and did not care to come nearer; which naturally
produced another sign from Porthos. This was so imperative,
he was obliged to obey. As he approached, "Come hither!"
said Porthos. "You only landed yesterday and you have begun
your tricks already."

"How so, monsieur le baron?" asked Jupenet, trembling.

"Your press was groaning all night, monsieur," said Porthos,
"and you prevented my sleeping, corne de boeuf!"

"Monsieur ---- " objected Jupenet, timidly.

"You have nothing yet to print: therefore you have no
occasion to set your press going. What did you print last
night?"

"Monsieur, a light poem of my own composition."

"Light! no, no, monsieur; the press groaned pitifully
beneath it. Let it not happen again. Do you understand?"

"Yes, monsieur."

"You promise me?"

"I do, monsieur!"

"Very well; this time I pardon you. Adieu!"

"Well, now we have combed that fellow's head, let us
breakfast."

"Yes," replied D'Artagnan, "let us breakfast."

"Only," said Porthos, "I beg you to observe, my friend, that
we have only two hours for our repast."

"What would you have? We will try to make two hours suffice.
But why have you only two hours?"

"Because it is high tide at one o'clock, and, with the tide,
I am going to Vannes. But, as I shall return tomorrow, my
dear friend, you can stay here; you shall be master, I have
a good cook and a good cellar."

"No," interrupted D'Artagnan, "better than that."

"What?"

"You are going to Vannes, you say?"

"To a certainty."

"To see Aramis?"

"Yes."

"Well! I came from Paris on purpose to see Aramis."

"That's true."

"I will go with you then."

"Do; that's the thing."

"Only, I ought to have seen Aramis first, and you after. But
man proposes, and God disposes. I have begun with you, and
will finish with Aramis."

"Very well!"

"And in how many hours can you go from here to Vannes?"

"Oh! pardieu! in six hours. Three hours by sea to Sarzeau,
three hours by road from Sarzeau to Vannes."

"How convenient that is! Being so near to the bishopric; do
you often go to Vannes?"

"Yes; once a week. But, stop till I get my plan."

Porthos picked up his plan, folded it carefully, and
engulfed it in his large pocket.

"Good!" said D'Artagnan aside; "I think I now know the real
engineer who is fortifying Belle-Isle."

Two hours after, at high tide, Porthos and D'Artagnan set
out for Sarzeau.




CHAPTER 71

A Procession at Vannes



The passage from Belle-Isle to Sarzeau was made rapidly
enough, thanks to one of those little corsairs of which
D'Artagnan had been told during his voyage, and which,
shaped for fast sailing and destined for the chase, were
sheltered at that time in the roadstead of Loc-Maria, where
one of them, with a quarter of its war-crew, performed duty
between Belle-Isle and the continent. D'Artagnan had an
opportunity of convincing himself that Porthos, though
engineer and topographer, was not deeply versed in affairs
of state. His perfect ignorance, with any other, might have
passed for well-informed dissimulation. But D'Artagnan knew
too well all the folds and refolds of his Porthos, not to
find a secret if there were one there; like those regular,
minute old bachelors, who know how to find, with their eyes
shut, each book on the shelves of their library and each
piece of linen in their wardrobe. So if he had found
nothing, our cunning D'Artagnan, in rolling and unrolling
his Porthos, it was because, in truth, there was nothing to
be found.

"Be it so," said D'Artagnan, "I shall get to know more at
Vannes in half an hour than Porthos has discovered at
Belle-Isle in two months. Only, in order that I may know
something, it is important that Porthos should not make use
of the only stratagem I leave at his disposal. He must not
warn Aramis of my arrival." All the care of the musketeer
was then, for the moment, confined to the watching of
Porthos. And let us hasten to say, Porthos did not deserve
all this mistrust. Porthos thought of no evil. Perhaps, on
first seeing him, D'Artagnan had inspired him with a little
suspicion, but almost immediately D'Artagnan had reconquered
in that good and brave heart the place he had always
occupied, and not the least cloud darkened the large eye of
Porthos, fixed from time to time with tenderness on his
friend.

On landing, Porthos inquired if his horses were waiting, and
soon perceived them at the crossing of the road that winds
round Sarzeau, and which, without passing through that
little city, leads towards Vannes. These horses were two in
number, one for M. de Vallon, and one for his equerry; for
Porthos had an equerry since Mouston was only able to use a
carriage as a means of locomotion. D'Artagnan expected that
Porthos would propose to send forward his equerry upon one
horse to bring back another, and he -- D'Artagnan -- had
made up his mind to oppose this proposition. But nothing
D'Artagnan had expected happened. Porthos simply told the
equerry to dismount and await his return at Sarzeau, whilst
D'Artagnan would ride his horse; which was arranged.

"Eh! but you are quite a man of precaution, my dear
Porthos," said D'Artagnan to his friend, when he found
himself in the saddle, upon the equerry's horse.

"Yes, but this is a kindness on the part of Aramis. I have
not my stud here, and Aramis has placed his stables at my
disposal."

"Good horses for bishop's horses, mordioux!" said
D'Artagnan. "It is true, Aramis is a bishop of a peculiar
kind."

"He is a holy man!" replied Porthos, in a tone almost nasal,
and with his eyes raised towards heaven.

"Then he is much changed," said D'Artagnan; "you and I have
known him passably profane."

"Grace has touched him," said Porthos.

"Bravo," said D'Artagnan, "that redoubles my desire to see
my dear old friend." And he spurred his horse, which sprang
off into a more rapid pace.

"Peste!" said Porthos, "if we go on at this rate, we shall
only take one hour instead of two."

"To go how far, do you say, Porthos?"

"Four leagues and a half."

"That will be a good pace."

"I could have embarked you on the canal, but the devil take
rowers and boat-horses! The first are like tortoises; the
second like snails; and when a man is able to put a good
horse between his knees, that horse is better than rowers or
any other means."

"You are right; you above all, Porthos, who always look
magnificent on horseback."

"Rather heavy, my friend; I was weighed the other day."

"And what do you weigh?"

"Three hundred-weight!" said Porthos, proudly.

"Bravo!"

"So that you must perceive, I am forced to choose horses
whose loins are straight and wide, otherwise I break them
down in two hours."

"Yes, giant's horses you must have, must you not?"

"You are very polite, my friend," replied the engineer, with
affectionate majesty.

"As a case in point," replied D'Artagnan, "your horse seems
to sweat already."

"Dame! It is hot! Ah, ah! do you see Vannes now?"

"Yes, perfectly. It is a handsome city, apparently."

"Charming, according to Aramis, at least, but I think it
black; but black seems to be considered handsome by artists:
I am sorry for it."

"Why so, Porthos?"

"Because I have lately had my chateau of Pierrefonds which
was gray with age, plastered white."

"Humph!" said D'Artagnan, "and white is more cheerful."

"Yes, but it is less august, as Aramis tells me. Fortunately
there are dealers in black as well as white. I will have
Pierrefonds replastered in black; that's all there is about
it. If gray is handsome, you understand, my friend, black
must be superb."

"Dame!" said D'Artagnan, "that appears logical."

"Were you never at Vannes, D'Artagnan?"

"Never."

"Then you know nothing of the city?"

"Nothing."

"Well, look!" said Porthos, raising himself in his stirrups,
which made the fore-quarters of his horse bend sadly -- "do
you see that corner, in the sun, yonder?"

"Yes, I see it plainly."

"Well, that is the cathedral."

"Which is called?"

"Saint-Pierre. Now look again -- in the faubourg on the
left, do you see another cross?"

"Perfectly well."

"That is Saint-Paterne, the parish preferred by Aramis."

"Indeed!"

"Without doubt. Saint-Paterne, you see, passes for having
been the first bishop of Vannes. It is true that Aramis
pretends he was not. But he is so learned that that may be
only a paro -- a para ---"

"A paradox," said D'Artagnan.

"Precisely; thank you! my tongue trips, I am so hot."

"My friend," said D'Artagnan, "continue your interesting
description, I beg. What is that large white building with
many windows?"

"Oh! that is the college of the Jesuits. Pardieu! you have
an apt hand. Do you see, close to the college, a large house
with steeples, turrets, built in a handsome Gothic style, as
that fool, M. Getard, says?"

"Yes, that is plainly to be seen. Well?"

"Well, that is where Aramis resides."

"What! does he not reside at the episcopal palace?"

"No, that is in ruins. The palace likewise is in the city,
and Aramis prefers the faubourgs. That is why, as I told
you, he is partial to Saint-Paterne; Saint-Paterne is in the
faubourg. Besides, there are in this faubourg a mall, a
tennis-court, and a house of Dominicans. Look, that where
the handsome steeple rises to the heavens."

"Well?"

"Next, you see the faubourg is like a separate city, it has
its walls, its towers, its ditches; the quay is upon it
likewise, and the boats land at the quay. If our little
corsair did not draw eight feet of water, we could have come
full sail up to Aramis's windows."

"Porthos, Porthos," cried D'Artagnan, "you are a well of
knowledge, a spring of ingenious and profound reflections.
Porthos, you no longer surprise me, you confound me."

"Here we are," said Porthos, turning the conversation with
his usual modesty.

"And high time we were," thought D'Artagnan, "for Aramis's
horse is melting away like a steed of ice."

They entered almost at the same instant the faubourg; but
scarcely had they gone a hundred paces when they were
surprised to find the streets strewed with leaves and
flowers. Against the old walls of Vannes hung the oldest and
the strangest tapestries of France. From over balconies fell
long white sheets stuck all over with bouquets. The streets
were deserted; it was plain the entire population was
assembled on one point. The blinds were closed, and the
breeze penetrated into the houses under the hangings, which
cast long, black shades between their places of issue and
the walls. Suddenly, at the turning of a street, chants
struck the ears of the newly arrived travelers. A crowd in
holiday garb appeared through the vapors of incense which
mounted to the heavens in blue fleeces, and clouds of
rose-leaves fluttered as high as the first stories. Above
all heads were to be seen the cross and banners, the sacred
symbols of religion. Then, beneath these crosses and
banners, as if protected by them, walked a whole world of
young girls clothed in white, crowned with corn-flowers. At
the two sides of the street, inclosing the cortege, marched
the guards of the garrison, carrying bouquets in the barrels
of their muskets and on the points of their lances. This was
the procession.

Whilst D'Artagnan and Porthos were looking on with critical
glances, which disguised an extreme impatience to get
forward, a magnificent dais approached preceded by a hundred
Jesuits and a hundred Dominicans, and escorted by two
archdeacons, a treasurer, a penitent and twelve canons. A
singer with a thundering voice -- a man certainly picked out
from all the voices of France, as was the drum-major of the
imperial guard from all the giants of the empire -- escorted
by four other chanters, who appeared to be there only to
serve him as an accompaniment, made the air resound, and the
windows of the houses vibrate. Under the dais appeared a
pale and noble countenance with black eyes, black hair
streaked with threads of white, a delicate, compressed
mouth, a prominent and angular chin. His head, full of
graceful majesty, was covered with the episcopal mitre, a
headdress which gave it, in addition to the character of
sovereignty, that of asceticism and evangelic meditation.

"Aramis!" cried the musketeer, involuntarily, as this lofty
countenance passed before him. The prelate started at the
sound of the voice. He raised his large black eyes, with
their long lashes, and turned them without hesitation
towards the spot whence the exclamation proceeded. At a
glance, he saw Porthos and D'Artagnan close to him. On his
part, D'Artagnan, thanks to the keenness of his sight, had
seen all, seized all. The full portrait of the prelate had
entered his memory, never to leave it. One thing had
particularly struck D'Artagnan. On perceiving him, Aramis
had colored, then he had concentrated under his eyelids the
fire of the look of the master, and the indefinable
affection of the friend. It was evident that Aramis had
asked himself this question: -- "Why is D'Artagnan with
Porthos, and what does he want at Vannes?" Aramis
comprehended all that was passing in the mind of D'Artagnan,
on turning his look upon him again, and seeing that he had
not lowered his eyes. He knew the acuteness and intelligence
of his friend, he feared to let him divine the secret of his
blush and his astonishment. He was still the same Aramis,
always having a secret to conceal. Therefore, to put an end
to his look of an inquisitor which it was necessary to get
rid of at all events, as, at any price, a general
extinguishes a battery which annoys him, Aramis stretched
forth his beautiful white hand, upon which sparkled the
amethyst of the pastoral ring; he cut the air with sign of
the cross, and poured out his benediction upon his two
friends. Perhaps thoughtful and absent, D'Artagnan, impious
in spite of himself, might not have bent beneath this holy
benediction; but Porthos saw his distraction, and laying his
friendly hand upon the back of his companion, he crushed him
down towards the earth. D'Artagnan was forced to give way;
indeed, he was little short of being flat on the ground. In
the meantime Aramis had passed. D'Artagnan, like Antaeus,
had only touched the ground, and he turned towards Porthos,
almost angry. But there was no mistaking the intention of
the brave Hercules; it was a feeling of religious propriety
that had influenced him. Besides, speech with Porthos,
instead of disguising his thought, always completed it.

"It is very polite of him," said he, "to have given his
benediction to us alone. Decidedly, he is a holy man, and a
brave man." Less convinced than Porthos, D'Artagnan made no
reply.

"Observe, my friend," continued Porthos, "he has seen us;
and, instead of continuing to walk on at the simple pace of
the procession, as he did just now, -- see, what a hurry he
is in; do you see how the cortege is increasing its speed?
He is eager to join us and embrace us, is that dear Aramis."

"That is true," replied D'Artagnan, aloud. -- Then to
himself: -- "It is equally true he has seen me, the fox, and
will have time to prepare himself to receive me."

But the procession had passed; the road was free. D'Artagnan
and Porthos walked straight up to the episcopal palace,
which was surrounded by a numerous crowd anxious to see the
prelate return. D'Artagnan remarked that this crowd was
composed principally of citizens and military men. He
recognized in the nature of these partisans the address of
his friend. Aramis was not the man to seek for a useless
popularity. He cared very little for being beloved by people
who could be of no service to him. Women, children, and old
men, that is to say, the cortege of ordinary pastors, was
not the cortege for him.

Ten minutes after the two friends had passed the threshold
of the palace, Aramis returned like a triumphant conqueror;
the soldiers presented arms to him as to a superior; the
citizens bowed to him as to a friend and a patron, rather
than as a head of the Church. There was something in Aramis
resembling those Roman senators who had their doors always
surrounded by clients. At the foot of the prison, he had a
conference of half a minute with a Jesuit, who, in order to
speak to him more secretly, passed his head under the dais.
He then re-entered his palace; the doors closed slowly, and
the crowd melted away, whilst chants and prayers were still
resounding abroad. It was a magnificent day. Earthly
perfumes were mingled with the perfumes of the air and the
sea. The city breathed happiness, joy, and strength.
D'Artagnan felt something like the presence of an invisible
hand which had, all-powerfully, created this strength, this
joy, this happiness, and spread everywhere these perfumes.

"Oh! oh!" said he, "Porthos has got fat; but Aramis is grown
taller."




CHAPTER 72

The Grandeur of the Bishop of Vannes



Porthos and D'Artagnan had entered the bishop's residence by
a private door, as his personal friends. Of course, Porthos
served D'Artagnan as guide. The worthy baron comported
himself everywhere rather as if he were at home.
Nevertheless, whether it was a tacit acknowledgment of the
sanctity of the personage of Aramis and his character, or
the habit of respecting him who imposed upon him morally, a
worthy habit which had always made Porthos a model soldier
and an excellent companion; for all these reasons, say we,
Porthos preserved in the palace of His Greatness the Bishop
of Vannes a sort of reserve which D'Artagnan remarked at
once, in the attitude he took with respect to the valets and
officers. And yet this reserve did not go so far as to
prevent his asking questions. Porthos questioned. They
learned that His Greatness had just returned to his
apartment and was preparing to appear in familiar intimacy,
less majestic than he had appeared with his flock. After a
quarter of an hour, which D'Artagnan and Porthos passed in
looking mutually at each other with the white of their eyes,
and turning their thumbs in all the different evolutions
which go from north to south, a door of the chamber opened
and His Greatness appeared, dressed in the undress,
complete, of a prelate. Aramis carried his head high, like a
man accustomed to command: his violet robe was tucked up on
one side, and his white hand was on his hip. He had retained
the fine mustache, and the lengthened royale of the time of
Louis XIII. He exhaled, on entering, that delicate perfume
which, among elegant men and women of high fashion, never
changes, and appears to be incorporated in the person, of
whom it has become the natural emanation. In this case only,
the perfume had retained something of the religious
sublimity of incense. It no longer intoxicated, it
penetrated; it no longer inspired desire, it inspired
respect. Aramis, on entering the chamber did not hesitate an
instant; and without pronouncing one word, which, whatever
it might be, would have been cold on such an occasion, he
went straight up to the musketeer, so well disguised under
the costume of M. Agnan, and pressed him in his arms with a
tenderness which the most distrustful could not have
suspected of coldness or affectation.

D'Artagnan, on his part, embraced him with equal ardor.
Porthos pressed the delicate hand of Aramis in his immense
hands, and D'Artagnan remarked that His Greatness gave him
his left hand, probably from habit, seeing that Porthos
already ten times had been near injuring his fingers covered
with rings, by pounding his flesh in the vise of his fist.
Warned by the pain, Aramis was cautious, and only presented
flesh to be bruised, and not fingers to be crushed, against
gold or the angles of diamonds.

Between two embraces, Aramis looked D'Artagnan in the face,
offered him a chair, sitting down himself in the shade,
observing that the light fell full upon the face of his
interlocutor. This maneuver, familiar to diplomatists and
women, resembles much the advantage of the guard which,
according to their skill or habit, combatants endeavor to
take on the ground at a duel. D'Artagnan was not the dupe of
this maneuver, but he did not appear to perceive it. He felt
himself caught; but, precisely, because he was caught he
felt himself on the road to discovery, and it little
imported to him, old condottiere as he was, to be beaten in
appearance, provided he drew from his pretended defeat the
advantages of victory. Aramis began the conversation.

"Ah! dear friend! my good D'Artagnan," said he, "what an
excellent chance!"

"It is a chance, my reverend companion," said D'Artagnan,
"that I will call friendship. I seek you, as I always have
sought you, when I had any grand enterprise to propose to
you, or some hours of liberty to give you."

"Ah! indeed," said Aramis, without explosion, "you have been
seeking me?"

"Eh! yes, he has been seeking you, Aramis," said Porthos,
"and the proof is that he has unharbored me at Belle-Isle.
That is amiable, is it not?"

"Ah! yes," said Aramis, "at Belle-Isle! certainly!"

"Good!" said D'Artagnan; "there is my booby Porthos, without
thinking of it, has fired the first cannon of attack."

"At Belle-Isle!" said Aramis, "in that hole, in that desert!
That is kind, indeed!"

"And it was I who told him you were at Vannes," continued
Porthos, in the same tone.

D'Artagnan armed his mouth with a finesse almost ironical.

"Yes, I knew, but I was willing to see," replied he.

"To see what?"

"If our old friendship still held out, if, on seeing each
other, our hearts, hardened as they are by age, would still
let the old cry of joy escape, which salutes the coming of a
friend."

"Well, and you must have been satisfied," said Aramis.

"So, so."

"How is that?"

"Yes, Porthos said hush! and you ---- "

"Well! and I?"

"And you gave me your benediction."

"What would you have, my friend?" said Aramis, smiling;
"that is the most precious thing that a poor prelate, like
me, has to give."

"Indeed, my dear friend!"

"Doubtless."

"And yet they say at Paris that the bishopric of Vannes is
one of the best in France."

"Ah! you are now speaking of temporal wealth," said Aramis,
with a careless air.

"To be sure, I wish to speak of that; I hold by it, on my
part."

"In that case, let me speak of it," said Aramis, with a
smile.

"You own yourself to be one of the richest prelates in
France?"

"My friend, since you ask me to give you an account, I will
tell you that the bishopric of Vannes is worth about twenty
thousand livres a year, neither more nor less. It is a
diocese which contains a hundred and sixty parishes."

"That is very pretty," said D'Artagnan.

"It is superb!" said Porthos.

"And yet," resumed D'Artagnan, throwing his eyes over
Aramis, "you don't mean to bury yourself here forever?"

"Pardon me. Only I do not admit the word bury."

"But it seems to me, that at this distance from Paris a man
is buried, or nearly so."

"My friend, I am getting old," said Aramis; "the noise and
bustle of a city no longer suit me. At fifty-seven we ought
to seek calm and meditation. I have found them here. What is
there more beautiful, and stern at the same time, than this
old Armorica. I find here, dear D'Artagnan, all that is
opposite to what I formerly loved, and that is what must
happen at the end of life, which is opposite to the
beginning. A little of my odd pleasure of former times still
comes to salute me here, now and then, without diverting me
from the road of salvation. I am still of this world, and
yet every step that I take brings me nearer to God."

"Eloquent, wise and discreet; you are an accomplished
prelate, Aramis, and I offer you my congratulations."

"But," said Aramis, smiling, "you did not come here only for
the purpose of paying me compliments. Speak; what brings you
hither! May it be that, in some fashion or other, you want
me?"

"Thank God, no, my friend," said D'Artagnan, "it is nothing
of that kind. -- I am rich and free."

"Rich!" exclaimed Aramis.

"Yes, rich for me; not for you or Porthos, understand. I
have an income of about fifteen thousand livres.

Aramis looked at him suspiciously. He could not believe --
particularly on seeing his friend in such humble guise --
that he had made so fine a fortune. Then D'Artagnan, seeing
that the hour of explanations was come, related the history
of his English adventures. During the recital he saw, ten
times, the eyes of the prelate sparkle, and his slender
fingers work convulsively. As to Porthos, it was not
admiration he manifested for D'Artagnan; it was enthusiasm,
it was delirium. When D'Artagnan had finished, "Well!" said
Aramis.

"Well!" said D'Artagnan, "you see, then, I have in England
friends and property, in France a treasure. If your heart
tells you so, I offer them to you. That is what I came here
for."

However firm was his look, he could not this time support
the look of Aramis. He allowed, therefore, his eye to stray
upon Porthos -- like the sword which yields to too powerful
a pressure, and seeks another road.

"At all events," said the bishop, "you have assumed a
singular traveling costume, old friend."

"Frightful! I know it is. You may understand why I would not
travel as a cavalier or a noble; since I became rich, I am
miserly."

"And you say, then, you came to Belle-Isle?" said Aramis,
without transition.

"Yes," replied D'Artagnan; "I knew I should find you and
Porthos there."

"Find me!" cried Aramis. "Me! for the last year past I have
not once crossed the sea."

"Oh," said D'Artagnan, "I should never have supposed you
such a housekeeper."

"Ah, dear friend, I must tell you that I am no longer the
Aramis of former times. Riding on horseback is unpleasant to
me; the sea fatigues me. I am a poor, ailing priest, always
complaining, always grumbling, and inclined to the
austerities which appear to accord with old age, --
preliminary parlayings with death. I linger, my dear
D'Artagnan, I linger."

"Well, that is all the better, my friend, for we shall
probably be neighbors soon."

"Bah!" said Aramis with a degree of surprise he did not even
seek to dissemble. "You my neighbor!"

"Mordioux! yes."

"How so?"

"I am about to purchase some very profitable salt-mines,
which are situated between Pirial and Croisic. Imagine, my
friend, a clear profit of twelve per cent. Never any
deficiency, never any idle expenses; the ocean, faithful and
regular, brings every twelve hours its contingency to my
coffers. I am the first Parisian who has dreamt of such a
speculation. Do not say anything about it, I beg of you, and
in a short time we will communicate on the matter. I am to
have three leagues of country for thirty thousand livres."

Aramis darted a look at Porthos, as if to ask if all this
were true, if some snare were not concealed beneath this
outward indifference. But soon, as if ashamed of having
consulted this poor auxiliary, he collected all his forces
for a fresh assault and new defense. "I heard that you had
had some difference with the court but that you had come out
of it as you know how to get through everything, D'Artagnan,
with the honors of war."

"I!" said the musketeer, with a burst of laughter that did
not conceal his embarrassment, for, from these words, Aramis
was not unlikely to be acquainted with his last relations
with the king. "I! Oh, tell me all about that, pray,
Aramis?"

"Yes, it was related to me, a poor bishop, lost in the
middle of the Landes, that the king had taken you as the
confidant of his amours."

"With whom?"

"With Mademoiselle de Mancini."

D'Artagnan breathed freely again. "Ah! I don't say no to
that," replied he.

"It appears that the king took you one morning over the
bridge of Blois to talk with his lady-love."

"That's true," said D'Artagnan. "And you know that, do you?
Well, then, you must know that the same day I gave in my
resignation!"

"What, sincerely?"

"Nothing more so."

"It was after that, then, that you went to the Comte de la
Fere's?"

"Yes."

"Afterwards to me?"

"Yes."

"And then Porthos?"

"Yes."

"Was it in order to pay us a simple visit?"

"No, I did not know you were engaged, and I wished to take
you with me into England."

"Yes, I understand; and then you executed alone, wonderful
man as you are, what you wanted to propose to us all four. I
suspected you had something to do with that famous
restoration, when I learned that you had been seen at King
Charles's receptions, and that he appeared to treat you like
a friend, or rather like a person to whom he was under an
obligation."

"But how the devil did you learn all that?" asked
D'Artagnan, who began to fear that the investigation of
Aramis had extended further than he wished.

"Dear D'Artagnan," said the prelate, "my friendship
resembles, in a degree, the solicitude of that night watch
whom we have in the little tower of the mole, at the
extremity of the quay. That brave man, every night, lights a
lantern to direct the barks that come from sea. He is
concealed in his sentry-box, and the fishermen do not see
him; but he follows them with interest; he divines them; he
calls them; he attracts them into the way to the port. I
resemble this watcher: from time to time some news reaches
me, and recalls to my remembrance all those I loved. Then I
follow the friends of old days over the stormy ocean of the
world, I, a poor watcher, to whom God has kindly given the
shelter of a sentry-box."

"Well, what did I do when I came from England?"

"Ah! there," replied Aramis, "you get beyond my depth. I
know nothing of you since your return. D'Artagnan, my eyes
are dim. I regretted you did not think of me. I wept over
your forgetfulness. I was wrong. I see you again, and it is
a festival, a great festival, I assure you, solemnly! How is
Athos?"

"Very well, thank you."

"And our young pupil, Raoul?"

"He seems to have inherited the skill of his father, Athos,
and the strength of his tutor, Porthos."

"And on what occasion have you been able to judge of that?"

"Eh! mon Dieu! on the eve of my departure from Paris."

"Indeed! tell me all about it!"

"Yes; there was an execution at the Greve, and in
consequence of that execution, a riot. We happened by
accident, to be in the riot; and in this riot we were
obliged to have recourse to our swords. And he did wonders."

"Bah! what did he do?"

"Why, in the first place, he threw a man out of the window,
as he would have flung a sack full of flock."

"Come, that's pretty well," said Porthos.

"Then he drew, and cut and thrust away, as we fellows used
to do in the good old times."

"And what was the cause of this riot?" said Porthos.

D'Artagnan remarked upon the face of Aramis a complete
indifference to this question of Porthos. "Why," said he,
fixing his eyes upon Aramis, "on account of two farmers of
the revenues, friends of M. Fouquet, whom the king forced to
disgorge their plunder, and then hanged them."

A scarcely perceptible contraction of the prelate's brow
showed that he had heard D'Artagnan's reply.

"Oh, oh!" said Porthos; "and what were the names of these
friends of M. Fouquet?"

"MM. d'Eymeris and Lyodot," said D'Artagnan. "Do you know
those names, Aramis?"

"No," said the prelate, disdainfully; "they sound like the
names of financiers."

"Exactly; so they were."

"Oh! M. Fouquet allows his friends to be hanged, then," said
Porthos.

"And why not?" said Aramis. "Why, it seems to me ---- "

"If these culprits were hanged, it was by order of the king.
Now M. Fouquet, although superintendent of the finances, has
not, I believe, the right of life and death."

"That may be," said Porthos; "but in the place of M. Fouquet
---- "

Aramis was afraid Porthos was about to say something
awkward, so interrupted him. "Come, D'Artagnan," said he;
"this is quite enough about other people, let us talk a
little about you."

"Of me you know all that I can tell you. On the contrary let
me hear a little about you, Aramis."

"I have told you, my friend. There is nothing of Aramis left
in me."

"Nor of the Abbe d'Herblay even?"

"No, not even of him. You see a man whom Providence has
taken by the hand, whom he has conducted to a position that
he could never have dared even to hope for."

"Providence?" asked D'Artagnan.

"Yes."

"Well, that is strange! I was told it was M. Fouquet."

"Who told you that?" cried Aramis, without being able, with
all the power of his will, to prevent the color rising to
his cheeks.

"Ma foi! why, Bazin!"

"The fool!"

"I do not say he is a man of genius, it is true; but he told
me so; and after him, I repeat it to you."

"I have never seen M. Fouquet," replied Aramis with a look
as pure and calm as that of a virgin who has never told a
lie.

"Well, but if you had seen him and known him, there is no
harm in that," replied D'Artagnan. "M. Fouquet is a very
good sort of a man."

"Humph!"

"A great politician." Aramis made a gesture of indifference.

"An all-powerful minister."

"I only hold to the king and the pope."

"Dame! listen then," said D'Artagnan, in the most natural
tone imaginable. "I said that because everybody here swears
by M. Fouquet. The plain is M. Fouquet's; the salt-mines I
am about to buy are M. Fouquet's; the island in which
Porthos studies topography is M. Fouquet's; the galleys are
M. Fouquet's. I confess, then, that nothing would have
surprised me in your enfeoffment, or rather in that of your
diocese, to M. Fouquet. He is a different master from the
king, that is all; but quite as powerful as Louis."

"Thank God! I am not vassal to anybody; I belong to nobody,
and am entirely my own master," replied Aramis, who, during
this conversation, followed with his eye every gesture of
D'Artagnan, every glance of Porthos. But D'Artagnan was
impassible and Porthos motionless; the thrusts aimed so
skillfully were parried by an able adversary; not one hit
the mark. Nevertheless, both began to feel the fatigue of
such a contest and the announcement of supper was well
received by everybody. Supper changed the course of
conversation. Besides, they felt that, upon their guard as
each one had been, they could neither of them boast of
having the advantage. Porthos had understood nothing of what
had been meant. He had held himself motionless, because
Aramis had made him a sign not to stir. Supper for him, was
nothing but supper; but that was quite enough for Porthos.
The supper, then, went off very well. D'Artagnan was in high
spirits. Aramis exceeded himself in kind affability. Porthos
ate like old Pelops. Their talk was of war, finance, the
arts, and love. Aramis played astonishment at every word of
politics. D'Artagnan risked. This long series of surprises
increased the mistrust of D'Artagnan, as the eternal
indifference of D'Artagnan provoked the suspicions of
Aramis. At length D'Artagnan, designedly, uttered the name
of Colbert; he had reserved that stroke for the last.

"Who is this Colbert?" asked the bishop.

"Oh! come," said D'Artagnan to himself, "that is too strong!
We must be careful, mordioux! we must be careful."

And he then gave Aramis all the information respecting M.
Colbert he could desire. The supper, or rather, the
conversation, was prolonged till one o'clock in the morning
between D'Artagnan and Aramis. At ten o'clock precisely,
Porthos had fallen asleep in his chair and snored like an
organ. At midnight he woke up and they sent him to bed.
"Hum!" said he, "I was near falling asleep; but that was all
very interesting you were talking about."

At one o'clock Aramis conducted D'Artagnan to the chamber
destined for him, which was the best in the episcopal
residence. Two servants were placed at his command.
To-morrow, at eight o'clock," said he, taking leave of
D'Artagnan, "we will take, if agreeable to you, a ride on
horseback with Porthos."

"At eight o'clock!" said D'Artagnan, "so late?"

"You know that I require seven hours, sleep." said Aramis.

"That is true."

"Good-night, dear friend!" And he embraced the musketeer
cordially.

D'Artagnan allowed him to depart; then, as soon as the door
closed, "Good!" cried he, "at five o'clock I will be on
foot."

This determination being made, he went to bed and quietly
"put two and two together," as people say.




CHAPTER 73

In which Porthos begins to be sorry
for having come with D'Artagnan



Scarcely had D'Artagnan extinguished his taper, when Aramis,
who had watched through his curtains the last glimmer of
light in his friend's apartment, traversed the corridor on
tiptoe, and went to Porthos's room. The giant, who had been
in bed nearly an hour and a half, lay grandly stretched out
on the down bed. He was in that happy calm of the first
sleep, which, with Porthos, resisted the noise of bells or
the report of cannon; his head swam in that soft oscillation
which reminds us of the soothing movement of a ship. In a
moment Porthos would have begun to dream. The door of the
chamber opened softly under the delicate pressure of the
hand of Aramis. The bishop approached the sleeper. A thick
carpet deadened the sound of his steps, besides which
Porthos snored in a manner to drown all noise. He laid one
hand on his shoulder -- "Rouse," said he, "wake up, my dear
Porthos." The voice of Aramis was soft and kind, but it
conveyed more than a notice, -- it conveyed an order. His
hand was light, but it indicated a danger. Porthos heard the
voice and felt the hand of Aramis, even in the depth of his
sleep. He started up. "Who goes there?" cried he, in his
giant's voice.

"Hush! hush! It is I," said Aramis.

"You, my friend? And what the devil do you wake me for?"

"To tell you that you must set off directly."

"Set off?"

"Yes."

"Where for?"

"For Paris."

Porthos bounded up in his bed, and then sank back again,
fixing his great eyes in agitation upon Aramis.

"For Paris?"

"Yes."

"A hundred leagues?" said he.

"A hundred and four," replied the bishop.

"Oh! mon Dieu!" sighed Porthos, lying down again, like
children who contend with their bonne to gain an hour or two
more sleep.

"Thirty hours' riding," said Aramis, firmly. "You know there
are good relays."

Porthos pushed out one leg, allowing a groan to escape him.

"Come, come! my friend," insisted the prelate with a sort of
impatience.

Porthos drew the other leg out of the bed. "And is it
absolutely necessary that I should go, at once?"

"Urgently necessary."

Porthos got upon his feet, and began to shake both walls and
floors with his steps of a marble statue.

"Hush! hush! for the love of Heaven, my dear Porthos!" said
Aramis, "you will wake somebody."

"Ah! that's true," replied Porthos, in a voice of thunder,
"I forgot that; but be satisfied, I am on guard." And so
saying, he let fall a belt loaded with his sword and
pistols, and a purse, from which the crowns escaped with a
vibrating and prolonged noise. This noise made the blood of
Aramis boil, whilst it drew from Porthos a formidable burst
of laughter. "How droll that is!" said he, in the same
voice.

"Not so loud, Porthos, not so loud."

"True, true!" and he lowered his voice a half-note.

"I was going to say," continued Porthos, "that it is droll
that we are never so slow as when we are in a hurry, and
never make so much noise as when we wish to be silent."

"Yes, that is true, but let us give the proverb the lie,
Porthos; let us make haste, and hold our tongue."

"You see I am doing my best," said Porthos, putting on his
haut de chausses.

"Very well."

"This is something in haste?"

"It is more than that, it is serious, Porthos."

"Oh, oh!"

"D'Artagnan has questioned you, has he not?"

"Questioned me?"

"Yes, at Belle-Isle?"

"Not the least in the world."

"Are you sure of that, Porthos?"

"Parbleu!"

"It is impossible. Recollect yourself."

"He asked me what I was doing, and I told him studying
topography. I would have made use of another word which you
employed one day."

"`Castrametation'?"

"Yes, that's it, but I never could recollect it."

"All the better. What more did he ask you?"

"Who M. Getard was."

"Next?"

"Who M. Jupenet was."

"He did not happen to see our plan of fortifications, did
he?"

"Yes."

"The devil he did!"

"But don't be alarmed, I had rubbed out your writing with
India-rubber. It was impossible for him to suppose you had
given me any advice in those works."

"Ay, but our friend has phenomenally keen eyes."

"What are you afraid of?"

"I fear that everything is discovered, Porthos; the matter
is, then, to prevent a great misfortune. I have given orders
to my people to close all the gates and doors. D'Artagnan
will not be able to get out before daybreak. Your horse is
ready saddled; you will gain the first relay; by five
o'clock in the morning you will have traversed fifteen
leagues. Come!"

Aramis then assisted Porthos to dress, piece by piece, with
as much celerity as the most skillful valet de chambre could
have done. Porthos, half stupefied, let him do as he liked,
and confounded himself in excuses. When he was ready, Aramis
took him by the hand, and led him, making him place his foot
with precaution on every step of the stairs, preventing him
running against doorframes, turning him this way and that,
as if Aramis had been the giant, and Porthos the dwarf. Soul
set fire to and animated matter. A horse was waiting, ready
saddled, in the courtyard. Porthos mounted. Then Aramis
himself took the horse by the bridle, and led him over some
dung spread in the yard, with the evident intention of
suppressing noise. He, at the same time, held tight the
horse's nose, to prevent him neighing. When arrived at the
outward gate, drawing Porthos towards him, who was going off
without even asking him what for: "Now friend Porthos, now;
without drawing bridle, till you get to Paris," whispered he
in his ears; "eat on horseback, drink on horseback, sleep on
horseback, but lose not a minute."

"That's enough, I will not stop."

"This letter to M. Fouquet; cost what it may, he must have
it to-morrow before mid-day."

"He shall."

"And do not forget one thing, my friend."

"What is that?"

"That you are riding out on a hunt for your brevet of duc
and peer."

"Oh! oh!" said Porthos, with his eyes sparkling; "I will do
it in twenty-four hours, in that case."

"Try."

"Then let go the bridle -- and forward, Goliath!"

Aramis did let go, not the bridle, but the horse's nose.
Porthos released his hand, clapped spurs to his horse, which
set off at a gallop. As long as he could distinguish Porthos
through the darkness, Aramis followed him with his eyes:
when he was completely out of sight, he re-entered the yard.
Nothing had stirred in D'Artagnan's apartment. The valet
placed on watch at the door had neither seen any light, nor
heard any noise. Aramis closed his door carefully, sent the
lackey to bed, and quickly sought his own. D'Artagnan really
suspected nothing, therefore thought he had gained
everything, when he awoke in the morning, about halfpast
four. He ran to the window in his shirt. The window looked
out upon the court. Day was dawning. The court was deserted;
the fowls, even, had not left their roosts. Not a servant
appeared. Every door was closed.

"Good! all is still," said D'Artagnan to himself. "Never
mind: I am up first in the house. Let us dress; that will be
so much done." And D'Artagnan dressed himself. But, this
time, he endeavored not to give to the costume of M. Agnan
that bourgeoise and almost ecclesiastical rigidity he had
affected before; he managed, by drawing his belt tighter, by
buttoning his clothes in a different fashion, and by putting
on his hat a little on one side, to restore to his person a
little of that military character, the absence of which had
surprised Aramis. This being done, he made free, or affected
to make free with his host, and entered his chamber without
ceremony. Aramis was asleep or feigned to be so. A large
book lay open upon his night-desk, a wax-light was still
burning in its silver sconce. This was more than enough to
prove to D'Artagnan the quiescence of the prelate's night,
and the good intentions of his waking. The musketeer did to
the bishop precisely as the bishop had done to Porthos -- he
tapped him on the shoulder. Evidently Aramis pretended to
sleep; for, instead of waking suddenly, he who slept so
lightly required a repetition of the summons.

"Ah! ah! is that you?" said he, stretching his arms. "What
an agreeable surprise! Ma foi! Sleep had made me forget I
had the happiness to possess you. What o'clock is it?"

"I do not know," said D'Artagnan, a little embarrassed.
"Early, I believe. But, you know, that devil of a habit of
waking with the day sticks to me still."

"Do you wish that we should go out so soon?" asked Aramis.
"It appears to me to be very early."

"Just as you like."

"I thought we had agreed not to get on horseback before
eight."

"Possibly; but I had so great a wish to see you, that I said
to myself, the sooner the better."

"And my seven hours, sleep!" said Aramis: "Take care; I had
reckoned upon them, and what I lose of them I must make up."

"But it seems to me that, formerly, you were less of a
sleeper than that, dear friend; your blood was alive, and
you were never to be found in bed."

"And it is exactly on account of what you tell me that I am
so fond of being there now."

"Then you confess that it is not for the sake of sleeping
that you have put me off till eight o'clock."

"I have been afraid you would laugh at me, if I told you the
truth."

"Tell me, notwithstanding."

"Well, from six to eight, I am accustomed to perform my
devotions."

"Your devotions?"

"Yes."

"I did not believe a bishop's exercises were so severe."

"A bishop, my friend, must sacrifice more to appearance than
a simple cleric."

"Mordioux! Aramis, that is a word which reconciles me with
your greatness. To appearances! That is a musketeer's word,
in good truth! Vivent les apparences, Aramis!"

"Instead of felicitating me upon it, pardon me, D'Artagnan.
It is a very mundane word which I had allowed to escape me."

"Must I leave you, then?"

"I want time to collect my thoughts, my friend, and for my
usual prayers."

"Well, I leave you to them; but on account of that poor
pagan, D'Artagnan, abridge them for once, I beg; I thirst
for speech with you."

"Well, D'Artagnan, I promise you that within an hour and a
half ---- "

"An hour and a half of devotions! Eh! my friend, be as
reasonable with me as you can. Let me have the best bargain
possible."

Aramis began to laugh.

"Still agreeable, still young, still gay," said he. "You
have come into my diocese to set me quarrelling with grace."

"Bah!"

"And you know well that I was never able to resist your
seductions; you will cost me my salvation, D'Artagnan."

D'Artagnan bit his lips.

"Well," said he, "I will take the sin on my own head, favor
me with one simple Christian sign of the cross, favor me
with one pater, and we will part."

"Hush!" said Aramis, "we are already no longer alone, I hear
strangers coming up."

"Well, dismiss them."

"Impossible, I made an appointment with them yesterday; it
is the principal of the college of the Jesuits, and the
superior of the Dominicans."

"Your staff? Well, so be it."

"What are you going to do?"

"I will go and wake Porthos, and remain in his company till
you have finished the conference."

Aramis did not stir, his brow remained unbent, he betrayed
himself by no gesture or word; "Go," said he, as D'Artagnan
advanced to the door. "A propos, do you know where Porthos
sleeps?"

"No, but I will inquire."

"Take the corridor, and open the second door on the left."

"Thank you! au revoir." And D'Artagnan departed in the
direction pointed out by Aramis.

Ten minutes had not passed away when he came back. He found
Aramis seated between the superior of the Dominicans and the
principal of the college of the Jesuits, exactly in the same
situation as he had found him formerly in the auberge at
Crevecoeur. This company did not at all terrify the
musketeer.

"What is it?" said Aramis, quietly. "You have apparently
something to say to me, my friend."

"It is," replied D'Artagnan, fixing his eyes upon Aramis,
"it is that Porthos is not in his apartment."

"Indeed," said Aramis, calmly; "are you sure?"

"Pardieu! I came from his chamber."

"Where can he be, then?"

"That is what I am asking you."

"And have not you inquired?"

"Yes, I have."

"And what answer did you get?"

"That Porthos, often walking out in a morning, without
saying anything, had probably gone out."

"What did you do, then?"

"I went to the stables," replied D'Artagnan, carelessly.

"What to do?"

"To see if Porthos had departed on horseback."

"And?" interrogated the bishop.

"Well, there is a horse missing, stall No. 3, Goliath."

All this dialogue, it may be easily understood, was not
exempt from a certain affectation on the part of the
musketeer, and a perfect complaisance on the part of Aramis.

"Oh! I guess how it is," said Aramis, after having
considered for a moment, "Porthos is gone out to give us a
surprise."

"A surprise?"

"Yes, the canal which goes from Vannes to the sea abounds in
teal and snipes; that is Porthos's favorite sport, and he
will bring us back a dozen for breakfast."

"Do you think so?" said D'Artagnan.

"I am sure of it. Where else can he be? I would lay a wager
he took a gun with him."

"Well, that is possible," said D'Artagnan.

"Do one thing, my friend. Get on horseback, and join him."

"You are right," said D'Artagnan, "I will."

"Shall I go with you?"

"No, thank you; Porthos is a rather remarkable man: I will
inquire as I go along."

"Will you take an arquebuse?"

"Thank you."

"Order what horse you like to be saddled."

"The one I rode yesterday, on coming from Belle-Isle."

"So be it: use the horse as your own."

Aramis rang, and gave orders to have the horse M. d'Artagnan
had chosen, saddled.

D'Artagnan followed the servant charged with the execution
of this order. When arrived at the door, the servant drew on
one side to allow M. d'Artagnan to pass; and at that moment
he caught the eye of his master. A knitting of the brow gave
the intelligent spy to understand that all should be given
to D'Artagnan he wished. D'Artagnan got into the saddle, and
Aramis heard the steps of his horse on the pavement. An
instant after, the servant returned.

"Well?" asked the bishop.

"Monseigneur, he has followed the course of the canal, and
is going towards the sea," said the servant.

"Very well!" said Aramis.

In fact, D'Artagnan, dismissing all suspicion, hastened
towards the ocean, constantly hoping to see in the Landes,
or on the beach, the colossal profile of Porthos. He
persisted in fancying he could trace a horse's steps in
every puddle. Sometimes he imagined he heard the report of a
gun. This illusion lasted three hours; during two of which
he went forward in search of his friend -- in the last he
returned to the house.

"We must have crossed," said he, "and I shall find them
waiting for me at table."

D'Artagnan was mistaken. He no more found Porthos at the
palace than he had found him on the sea-shore. Aramis was
waiting for him at the top of the stairs, looking very much
concerned.

"Did my people not find you, my dear D'Artagnan?" cried he,
as soon as he caught sight of the musketeer.

"No; did you send any one after me?"

"I am deeply concerned, my friend, deeply, to have induced
you to make such a useless search, but, about seven o'clock,
the almoner of Saint-Paterne came here. He had met Du
Vallon, who was going away, and who being unwilling to
disturb anybody at the palace, had charged him to tell me
that, fearing M. Getard would play him some ill turn in his
absence, he was going to take advantage of the morning tide
to make a tour to Belle-Isle."

"But tell me, Goliath has not crossed the four leagues of
sea, I should think."

"There are full six," said Aramis.

"That makes it less probable still."

"Therefore, my friend," said Aramis, with one of his
blandest smiles, "Goliath is in the stable, well pleased, I
will answer for it, that Porthos is no longer on his back."
In fact, the horse had been brought back from the relay by
the direction of the prelate, from whom no detail escaped.
D'Artagnan appeared as well satisfied as possible with the
explanation. He entered upon a part of dissimulation which
agreed perfectly with the suspicions that arose more and
more strongly in his mind. He breakfasted between the Jesuit
and Aramis, having the Dominican in front of him, and
smiling particularly at the Dominican, whose jolly, fat face
pleased him much. The repast was long and sumptuous;
excellent Spanish wine, fine Morbihan oysters, exquisite
fish from the mouth of the Loire, enormous prawns from
Paimboeuf, and delicious game from the moors, constituted
the principal part of it. D'Artagnan ate much, and drank but
little. Aramis drank nothing, unless it was water. After the
repast, --

"You offered me an arquebuse," said D'Artagnan.

"I did."

"Lend it me, then."

"Are you going shooting?"

"Whilst waiting for Porthos, it is the best thing I can do,
I think."

"Take which you like from the trophy."

"Will you not come with me?"

"I would with great pleasure; but, alas! my friend, sporting
is forbidden to bishops."

"Ah!" said D'Artagnan, "I did not know that."

"Besides," continued Aramis, "I shall be busy till mid-day."

"I shall go alone, then?" said D'Artagnan.

"I am sorry to say you must; but come back to dinner."

"Pardieu! the eating at your house is too good to make me
think of not coming back." And thereupon D'Artagnan quitted
his host, bowed to the guests, and took his arquebuse; but
instead of shooting, went straight to the little port of
Vannes. He looked in vain to observe if anybody saw him; he
could discern neither thing nor person. He engaged a little
fishing boat for twenty-five livres, and set off at
half-past eleven, convinced that he had not been followed;
and that was true, he had not been followed; only a Jesuit
brother, placed in the top of the steeple of his church, had
not, since the morning, by the help of an excellent glass,
lost sight of one of his steps. At three-quarters past
eleven, Aramis was informed that D'Artagnan was sailing
towards Belle-Isle. The voyage was rapid; a good north
north-east wind drove him towards the isle. As he
approached, his eyes were constantly fixed upon the coast.
He looked to see if, upon the shore or upon the
fortifications the brilliant dress and vast stature of
Porthos should stand out against a slightly clouded sky; but
his search was vain. He landed without having seen anything;
and learnt from the first soldier interrogated by him, that
M. du Vallon had not yet returned from Vannes. Then, without
losing an instant, D'Artagnan ordered his little bark to put
its head towards Sarzeau. We know that the wind changes with
the different hours of the day. The breeze had veered from
the north north-east to the south-east: the wind, then, was
almost as good for the return to Sarzeau, as it had been for
the voyage to Belle-Isle. In three hours D'Artagnan had
touched the continent, two hours more sufficed for his ride
to Vannes. In spite of the rapidity of his passage, what
D'Artagnan endured of impatience and anger during that short
passage, the deck alone of the vessel, upon which he stamped
backwards and forwards for three hours, could testify. He
made but one bound from the quay whereon he landed to the
episcopal palace. He thought to terrify Aramis by the
promptitude of his return; he wished to reproach him with
his duplicity, and yet with reserve; but with sufficient
spirit, nevertheless, to make him feel all the consequences
of it, and force from him a part of his secret He hoped, in
short -- thanks to that heat of expression which is to
secrets what the charge with the bayonet is to redoubts --
to bring the mysterious Aramis to some manifestation or
other. But he found, in the vestibule of the palace, the
valet de chambre, who closed the passage, while smiling upon
him with a stupid air.

"Monseigneur?" cried D'Artagnan, endeavoring to put him
aside with his hand. Moved for an instant the valet resumed
his station.

"Monseigneur?" said he.

"Yes, to be sure; do you not know me, imbecile?"

"Yes, you are the Chevalier d'Artagnan."

"Then let me pass."

"It is of no use."

"Why of no use?"

"Because His Greatness is not at home."

"What! His Greatness is not at home? where is he then?"

"Gone."

"Gone?"

"Yes."

"Whither?"

"I don't know; but perhaps he tells monsieur le chevalier."

"And how? where? in what fashion?"

"In this letter, which he gave me for monsieur le
chevalier." And the valet de chambre drew a letter from his
pocket.

"Give it me, then, you rascal," said D'Artagnan, snatching
it from his hand. "Oh, yes," continued he, at the first
line, "yes, I understand; "and he read: --



"Dear Friend, -- An affair of the most urgent nature calls
me to a distant parish of my diocese. I hoped to see you
again before I set out; but I lose that hope in thinking
that you are going, no doubt, to remain two or three days at
Belle-Isle, with our dear Porthos. Amuse yourself as well as
you can; but do not attempt to hold out against him at
table. This is a counsel I might have given even to Athos,
in his most brilliant and best days. Adieu, dear friend;
believe that I regret greatly not having better, and for a
longer time, profited by your excellent company."



"Mordioux!" cried D'Artagnan. "I am tricked. Ah! blockhead,
brute, triple fool that I am! But those laugh best who laugh
last. Oh, duped, duped like a monkey, cheated with an empty
nutshell!" And with a hearty blow bestowed upon the nose of
the smirking valet de chambre, he made all haste out of the
episcopal palace. Furet, however good a trotter, was not
equal to present circumstances. D'Artagnan therefore took
the post, and chose a horse which he soon caused to
demonstrate, with good spurs and a light hand, that deer are
not the swiftest animals in nature.




CHAPTER 74

In which D'Artagnan makes all Speed,
Porthos snores, and Aramis counsels



From thirty to thirty-five hours after the events we have
just related, as M. Fouquet, according to his custom, having
interdicted his door, was working in the cabinet of his
house at Saint-Mande, with which we are already acquainted,
a carriage, drawn by four horses steaming with sweat,
entered the court at full gallop. This carriage was,
probably, expected, for three or four lackeys hastened to
the door, which they opened. Whilst M. Fouquet rose from his
bureau and ran to the window, a man got painfully out of the
carriage descending with difficulty the three steps of the
door, leaning upon the shoulders of the lackeys. He had
scarcely uttered his name, when the valet upon whom he was
not leaning sprang up the perron, and disappeared in the
vestibule. This man went to inform his master; but he had no
occasion to knock at the door: Fouquet was standing on the
threshold.

"Monseigneur, the Bishop of Vannes," said he.

"Very well!" replied his master.

Then, leaning over the banister of the staircase, of which
Aramis was beginning to ascend the first steps, --

"Ah, dear friend!" said he, "you, so soon!"

"Yes; I, myself, monsieur! but bruised, battered, as you
see."

"Oh! my poor friend," said Fouquet, presenting him his arm,
on which Aramis leant, whilst the servants drew back
respectfully.

"Bah!" replied Aramis, "it is nothing, since I am here; the
principal thing was that I should get here, and here I am."

"Speak quickly," said Fouquet, closing the door of the
cabinet behind Aramis and himself.

"Are we alone?"

"Yes, perfectly."

"No one observes us? -- no one can hear us?"

"Be satisfied; nobody."

"Is M. du Vallon arrived?"

"Yes."

"And you have received my letter?"

"Yes. The affair is serious, apparently, since it
necessitates your attendance in Paris, at a moment when your
presence was so urgent elsewhere."

"You are right, it could not be more serious."

"Thank you! thank you! What is it about? But, for God's
sake! before anything else, take time to breathe, dear
friend. You are so pale, you frighten me."

"I am really in great pain. But, for Heaven's sake, think
nothing about me. Did M. du Vallon tell you nothing, when he
delivered the letter to you?"

"No; I heard a great noise; I went to the window; I saw at
the foot of the perron, a sort of horseman of marble; I went
down, he held the letter out to me, and his horse fell down
dead."

"But he?"

"He fell with the horse; he was lifted, and carried to an
apartment. Having read the letter, I went up to him, in
hopes of obtaining more ample information; but he was
asleep, and, after such a fashion, that it was impossible to
wake him. I took pity on him; I gave orders that his boots
should be cut from off his legs, and that he should be left
quite undisturbed."

"So far well; now, this is the question in hand,
monseigneur. You have seen M. d'Artagnan in Paris, have you
not?"

"Certes, and think him a man of intelligence, and even a man
of heart; although he did bring about the death of our dear
friends, Lyodot and D'Eymeris."

"Alas! yes, I heard of that. At Tours I met the courier who
was bringing me the letter from Gourville, and the
dispatches from Pellisson. Have you seriously reflected on
that event, monsieur?"

"Yes."

"And in it you perceived a direct attack upon your
sovereignty?"

"And do you believe it to be so?"

"Oh, yes, I think so."

"Well, I must confess, that sad idea occurred to me
likewise."

"Do not blind yourself, monsieur, in the name of Heaven!
Listen attentively to me, -- I return to D'Artagnan."

"I am all attention."

"Under what circumstances did you see him?"

"He came here for money."

"With what kind of order?"

"With an order from the king."

"Direct?"

"Signed by his majesty."

"There, then! Well, D'Artagnan has been to Belle-Isle; he
was disguised; he came in the character of some sort of an
intendant, charged by his master to purchase salt-mines.
Now, D'Artagnan has no other master but the king: he came,
then, sent by the king. He saw Porthos."

"Who is Porthos?"

"I beg your pardon, I made a mistake. He saw M. du Vallon at
Belle-Isle; and he knows, as well as you and I do, that
Belle-Isle is fortified."

"And you think that the king sent him there?" said Fouquet,
pensively.

"I certainly do."

"And D'Artagnan, in the hands of the king, is a dangerous
instrument?"

"The most dangerous imaginable."

"Then I formed a correct opinion of him at the first
glance."

"How so?"

"I wished to attach him to myself."

"If you judged him to be the bravest, the most acute, and
the most adroit man in France, you judged correctly."

"He must be had then, at any price."

"D'Artagnan?"

"Is not that your opinion?"

"It may be my opinion, but you will never get him."

"Why?"

"Because we have allowed the time to go by. He was
dissatisfied with the court, we should have profited by
that; since that, he has passed into England; there he
powerfully assisted in the restoration, there he gained a
fortune, and, after all, he returned to the service of the
king. Well, if he has returned to the service of the king,
it is because he is well paid in that service."

"We will pay him even better, that is all."

"Oh! monsieur, excuse me; D'Artagnan has a high respect for
his word, and where that is once engaged he keeps it."

"What do you conclude, then?" said Fouquet, with great
inquietude.

"At present, the principal thing is to parry a dangerous
blow."

"And how is it to be parried?"

"Listen."

"But D'Artagnan will come and render an account to the king
of his mission."

"Oh, we have time enough to think about that."

"How so? You are much in advance of him, I presume?"

"Nearly ten hours."

"Well, in ten hours ---- "

Aramis shook his pale head. "Look at these clouds which flit
across the heavens; at these swallows which cut the air.
D'Artagnan moves more quickly than the clouds or the birds;
D'Artagnan is the wind which carries them."

"A strange man!"

"I tell you, he is superhuman, monsieur. He is of my own
age, and I have known him these five-and-thirty years."

"Well?"

"Well, listen to my calculation, monsieur. I sent M. du
Vallon off to you two hours after midnight. M. du Vallon was
eight hours in advance of me, when did M. du Vallon arrive?"

"About four hours ago."

"You see, then, that I gained four upon him; and yet Porthos
is a staunch horseman, and he has left on the road eight
dead horses, whose bodies I came to successively. I rode
post fifty leagues; but I have the gout, the gravel, and
what else I know not; so that fatigue kills me. I was
obliged to dismount at Tours; since that, rolling along in a
carriage, half dead, sometimes overturned, drawn upon the
sides, and sometimes on the back of the carriage, always
with four spirited horses at full gallop, I have arrived --
arrived, gaining four hours upon Porthos; but, see you,
D'Artagnan does not weigh three hundred-weight, as Porthos
does; D'Artagnan has not the gout and gravel, as I have; he
is not a horseman, he is a centaur. D'Artagnan, look you,
set out for Belle-Isle when I set out for Paris; and
D'Artagnan, notwithstanding my ten hours, advance,
D'Artagnan will arrive within two hours after me."

"But, then, accidents?"

"He never meets with accidents."

"Horses may fail him."

"He will run as fast as a horse."

"Good God! what a man!"

"Yes, he is a man whom I love and admire. I love him because
he is good, great, and loyal; I admire him because he
represents in my eyes the culminating point of human power;
but, whilst loving and admiring him, I fear him, and am on
my guard against him. Now then, I resume, monsieur; in two
hours D'Artagnan will be here; be beforehand with him. Go to
the Louvre, and see the king, before he sees D'Artagnan."

"What shall I say to the king?"

"Nothing; give him Belle-Isle."

"Oh! Monsieur d'Herblay! Monsieur d'Herblay," cried Fouquet,
"what projects crushed all at once!"

"After one project that has failed, there is always another
project that may lead to fortune; we should never despair.
Go, monsieur, and go at once."

"But that garrison, so carefully chosen, the king will
change it directly."

"That garrison, monsieur, was the king's when it entered
Belle-Isle; it is yours now; it is the same with all
garrisons after a fortnight's occupation. Let things go on,
monsieur. Do you see any inconvenience in having an army at
the end of a year, instead of two regiments? Do you not see
that your garrison of today will make you partisans at La
Rochelle, Nantes, Bordeaux, Toulouse -- in short, wherever
they may be sent to? Go to the king, monsieur; go; time
flies, and D'Artagnan, while we are losing time, is flying,
like an arrow, along the high-road."

"Monsieur d'Herblay, you know that each word from you is a
germ which fructifies in my thoughts. I will go to the
Louvre."

"Instantly, will you not?"

"I only ask time to change my dress."

"Remember that D'Artagnan has no need to pass through
Saint-Mande; but will go straight to the Louvre; that is
cutting off an hour from the advantage that yet remains to
us."

"D'Artagnan may have everything except my English horses. I
shall be at the Louvre in twenty-five minutes." And, without
losing a second, Fouquet gave orders for his departure.

Aramis had only time to say to him, "Return as quickly as
you go; for I shall await you impatiently."

Five minutes after, the superintendent was flying along the
road to Paris. During this time Aramis desired to be shown
the chamber in which Porthos was sleeping. At the door of
Fouquet's cabinet he was folded in the arms of Pellisson,
who had just heard of his arrival, and had left his office
to see him. Aramis received, with that friendly dignity
which he knew so well how to assume, these caresses,
respectful as earnest; but all at once stopping on the
landing-place, "What is that I hear up yonder?"

There was, in fact, a hoarse, growling kind of noise, like
the roar of a hungry tiger, or an impatient lion. "Oh, that
is nothing," said Pellisson, smiling.

"Well; but ---- "

"It is M. du Vallon snoring."

"Ah! true," said Aramis. "I had forgotten. No one but he is
capable of making such a noise. Allow me, Pellisson, to
inquire if he wants anything."

"And you will permit me to accompany you?"

"Oh, certainly;" and both entered the chamber. Porthos was
stretched upon the bed; his face was violet rather than red;
his eyes were swelled; his mouth was wide open. The roaring
which escaped from the deep cavities of his chest made the
glass of the windows vibrate. To those developed and clearly
defined muscles starting from his face, to his hair matted
with sweat, to the energetic heaving of his chin and
shoulders, it was impossible to refuse a certain degree of
admiration. Strength carried to this point is semi-divine.
The Herculean legs and feet of Porthos had, by swelling,
burst his stockings; all the strength of his huge body was
converted into the rigidity of stone. Porthos moved no more
than does the giant of granite which reclines upon the
plains of Agrigentum. According to Pellisson's orders, his
boots had been cut off, for no human power could have pulled
them off. Four lackeys had tried in vain, pulling at them as
they would have pulled capstans; and yet all this did not
awaken him. They had hacked off his boots in fragments, and
his legs had fallen back upon the bed. They then cut off the
rest of his clothes, carried him to a bath, in which they
let him soak a considerable time. They then put on him clean
linen, and placed him in a well-warmed bed -- the whole with
efforts and pains which might have roused a dead man, but
which did not make Porthos open an eye, or interrupt for a
second the formidable diapason of his snoring. Aramis wished
on his part, with his nervous nature, armed with
extraordinary courage, to outbrave fatigue, and employ
himself with Gourville and Pellisson, but he fainted in the
chair in which he had persisted sitting. He was carried into
the adjoining room, where the repose of bed soon soothed his
failing brain.




CHAPTER 75

In which Monsieur Fouquet acts



In the meantime Fouquet was hastening to the Louvre, at the
best speed of his English horses. The king was at work with
Colbert. All at once the king became thoughtful. The two
sentences of death he had signed on mounting his throne
sometimes recurred to his memory; they were two black spots
which he saw with his eyes open; two spots of blood which he
saw when his eyes were closed. "Monsieur," said he, rather
sharply, to the intendant; "it sometimes seems to me that
those two men you made me condemn were not very great
culprits."

"Sire, they were picked out from the herd of the farmers of
the financiers, which wanted decimating."

"Picked out by whom?"

"By necessity, sire," replied Colbert, coldly.

"Necessity! -- a great word," murmured the young king.

"A great goddess, sire."

"They were devoted friends of the superintendent, were they
not?"

"Yes, sire; friends who would have given up their lives for
Monsieur Fouquet."

"They have given them, monsieur," said the king.

"That is true; -- but uselessly, by good luck, -- which was
not their intention."

"How much money had these men fraudulently obtained?"

"Ten millions, perhaps; of which six have been confiscated."

"And is that money in my coffers?" said the king with a
certain air of repugnance.

"It is there, sire; but this confiscation, whilst
threatening M. Fouquet, has not touched him."

"You conclude, then, M. Colbert ---- "

"That if M. Fouquet has raised against your majesty a troop
of factious rioters to extricate his friends from
punishment, he will raise an army when he has in turn to
extricate himself from punishment."

The king darted at his confidant one of those looks which
resemble the livid fire of a flash of lightning, one of
those looks which illuminate the darkness of the basest
consciences. "I am astonished," said he, "that, thinking
such things of M. Fouquet, you did not come to give me your
counsels thereupon."

"Counsels upon what, sire?"

"Tell me, in the first place, clearly and precisely, what
you think, M. Colbert."

"Upon what subject, sire?"

"Upon the conduct of M. Fouquet."

"I think, sire, that M. Fouquet, not satisfied with
attracting all the money to himself, as M. Mazarin did, and
by that means depriving your majesty of one part of your
power, still wishes to attract to himself all the friends of
easy life and pleasure -- of what idlers call poetry, and
politicians, corruption. I, think that, by holding the
subjects of your majesty in pay, he trespasses upon the
royal prerogative, and cannot, if this continues so, be long
in placing your majesty among the weak and the obscure."

"How would you qualify all these projects, M. Colbert?"

"The projects of M. Fouquet, sire?"

"Yes."

"They are called crimes of lese majeste."

"And what is done to criminals guilty of lese majeste?"

"They are arrested, tried, and punished."

"You are quite sure that M. Fouquet has conceived the idea
of the crime you impute to him?"

"I can say more, sire, there is even a commencement of the
execution of it."

"Well, then, I return to that which I was saying, M.
Colbert."

"And you were saying, sire?"

"Give me counsel."

"Pardon me, sire, but in the first place, I have something
to add."

"Say -- what?"

"An evident, palpable, material proof of treason."

"And what is that?"

"I have just learnt that M. Fouquet is fortifying
Belle-Isle."

"Ah, indeed!"

"Yes, sire."

"Are you sure?"

"Perfectly. Do you know, sire, what soldiers there are in
Belle-Isle?"

"No, ma foi! Do you?"

"I am ignorant, likewise, sire; I should therefore propose
to your majesty to send somebody to Belle-Isle?"

"Who?"

"Me, for instance."

"And what would you do at Belle-Isle?"

"Inform myself whether, after the example of the ancient
feudal lords, M. Fouquet was battlementing his walls."

"And with what purpose could he do that?"

"With the purpose of defending himself some day against his
king."

"But, if it be thus, M. Colbert," said Louis, "we must
immediately do as you say; M. Fouquet must be arrested."

"That is impossible."

"I thought I had already told you, monsieur, that I
suppressed that word in my service."

"The service of your majesty cannot prevent M. Fouquet from
being surintendant-general."

"Well?"

"That, in consequence of holding that post, he has for him
all the parliament, as he has all the army by his largesses,
literature by his favors, and the noblesse by his presents."

"That is to say, then, that I can do nothing against M.
Fouquet?"

"Absolutely nothing, -- at least at present, sire."

"You are a sterile counselor, M. Colbert."

"Oh, no, sire; for I will not confine myself to pointing out
the peril to your majesty."

"Come, then, where shall we begin to undermine this
Colossus; let us see;" and his majesty began to laugh
bitterly.

"He has grown great by money; kill him by money, sire."

"If I were to deprive him of his charge?"

"A bad means, sire."

"The good -- the good, then?"

"Ruin him, sire, that is the way.

"But how?"

"Occasions will not be wanting, take advantage of all
occasions."

"Point them out to me."

"Here is one at once. His royal highness Monsieur is about
to be married; his nuptials must be magnificent. That is a
good occasion for your majesty to demand a million of M.
Fouquet. M. Fouquet, who pays twenty thousand livres down
when he need not pay more than five thousand, will easily
find that million when your majesty demands it."

"That is all very well; I will demand it," said Louis.

"If your majesty will sign the ordonnance I will have the
money got together myself." And Colbert pushed a paper
before the king, and presented a pen to him.

At that moment the usher opened the door and announced
monsieur le surintendant. Louis turned pale. Colbert let the
pen fall, and drew back from the king, over whom he extended
his black wings like an evil spirit. The superintendent made
his entrance like a man of the court, to whom a single
glance was sufficient to make him appreciate the situation.
That situation was not very encouraging for Fouquet,
whatever might be his consciousness of strength. The small
black eye of Colbert, dilated by envy, and the limpid eye of
Louis XIV., inflamed by anger, signalled some pressing
danger. Courtiers are, with regard to court rumors, like old
soldiers, who distinguish through the blasts of wind and
bluster of leaves the sound of the distant steps of an armed
troop. They can, after having listened, tell pretty nearly
how many men are marching, how many arms resound, how many
cannons roll. Fouquet had then only to interrogate the
silence which his arrival had produced; he found it big with
menacing revelations. The king allowed him time enough to
advance as far as the middle of the chamber. His adolescent
modesty commanded this forbearance of the moment. Fouquet
boldly seized the opportunity.

"Sire," said he, "I was impatient to see your majesty."

"What for?" asked Louis.

"To announce some good news to you."

Colbert, minus grandeur of person, less largeness of heart,
resembled Fouquet in many points. He had the same
penetration, the same knowledge of men; moreover, that great
power of self-compression which gives to hypocrites time to
reflect, and gather themselves up to take a spring. He
guessed that Fouquet was going to meet the blow he was about
to deal him. His eyes glittered ominously.

"What news?" asked the king. Fouquet placed a roll of papers
on the table.

"Let your majesty have the goodness to cast your eyes over
this work," said he. The king slowly unfolded the paper.

"Plans?" said he.

"Yes, sire."

"And what are these plans?"

"A new fortification, sire."

"Ah, ah!" said the king, "you amuse yourself with tactics
and strategies, then, M. Fouquet?"

"I occupy myself with everything that may be useful to the
reign of your majesty," replied Fouquet.

"Beautiful descriptions!" said the king, looking at the
design.

"Your majesty comprehends, without doubt," said Fouquet,
bending over the paper; "here is the circle of the walls,
here are the forts, there the advanced works."

"And what do I see here, monsieur?"

"The sea."

"The sea all round?"

"Yes, sire."

"And what is, then, the name of this place of which you show
me the plan?"

"Sire, it is Belle-Isle-en-Mer," replied Fouquet with
simplicity.

At this word, at this name, Colbert made so marked a
movement, that the king turned round to enforce the
necessity for reserve. Fouquet did not appear to be the
least in the world concerned by the movement of Colbert, or
the king's signal.

"Monsieur," continued Louis, "you have then fortified
Belle-Isle?"

"Yes, sire; and I have brought the plan and the accounts to
your majesty," replied Fouquet, "I have expended sixteen
hundred thousand livres in this operation."

"What to do?" replied Louis, coldly, having taken the
initiative from a malicious look of the intendant.

"For an aim very easy to seize," replied, Fouquet. "Your
majesty was on cool terms with Great Britain."

"Yes; but since the restoration of King Charles II. I have
formed an alliance with him."

"A month since, sire, your majesty has truly said; but it is
more than six months since the fortifications of Belle-Isle
were begun."

"Then they have become useless."

"Sire, fortifications are never useless. I fortified
Belle-Isle against MM. Monk and Lambert and all those London
citizens who were playing at soldiers. Belle-Isle will be
ready fortified against the Dutch, against whom either
England or your majesty cannot fail to make war."

The king was again silent, and looked askant at Colbert.
"Belle-Isle, I believe," added Louis, "is yours, M.
Fouquet?"

"No, sire."

"Whose then?"

"Your majesty's."

Colbert was seized with as much terror as if a gulf had
opened beneath his feet. Louis started with admiration,
either at the genius or the devotion of Fouquet.

"Explain yourself, monsieur," said he.

"Nothing more easy, sire; Belle-Isle is one of my estates; I
have fortified it at my own expense. But as nothing in the
world can oppose a subject making an humble present to his
king, I offer your majesty the proprietorship of the estate,
of which you will leave me the usufruct. Belle-Isle, as a
place of war, ought to be occupied by the king. Your majesty
will be able, henceforth, to keep a safe garrison there."

Colbert felt almost sinking down upon the floor. To keep
himself from falling, he was obliged to hold by the columns
of the wainscoting.

"This is a piece of great skill in the art of war that you
have exhibited here, monsieur," said Louis.

"Sire, the initiative did not come from me," replied
Fouquet: "many others have inspired me with it. The plans
themselves have been made by one of the most distinguished
engineers."

"His name?"

"M. du Vallon."

"M. du Vallon?" resumed Louis, "I do not know him. It is
much to be lamented, M. Colbert," continued he, "that I do
not know the names of the men of talent who do honor to my
reign." And while saying these words he turned towards
Colbert. The latter felt himself crushed, the sweat flowed
from his brow, no word presented itself to his lips, he
suffered an inexpressible martyrdom. "You will recollect
that name," added Louis XIV.

Colbert bowed, but was paler than his ruffles of Flemish
lace. Fouquet continued:

"The masonries are of Roman concrete; the architects
amalgamated it for me after the best accounts of antiquity."

"And the cannon?" asked Louis.

"Oh! sire, that concerns your majesty; it did not become me
to place cannon in my own house, unless your majesty had
told me it was yours."

Louis began to float, undetermined between the hatred which
this so powerful man inspired him with, and the pity he felt
for the other, so cast down, who seemed to him the
counterfeit of the former. But the consciousness of his
kingly duty prevailed over the feelings of the man, and he
stretched out his finger to the paper.

"It must have cost you a great deal of money to carry these
plans into execution," said he.

"I believe I had the honor of telling your majesty the
amount."

"Repeat it if you please, I have forgotten it."

"Sixteen hundred thousand livres."

"Sixteen hundred thousand livres! you are enormously rich,
monsieur."

"It is your majesty who is rich, since Belle-Isle is yours."

"Yes, thank you; but however rich I may be, M. Fouquet ----
" The king stopped.

"Well, sire?" asked the superintendent.

"I foresee the moment when I shall want money."

"You, sire? And at what moment, then?"

"To-morrow, for example."

"Will your majesty do me the honor to explain yourself?"

"My brother is going to marry the English Princess."

"Well, sire?"

"Well, I ought to give the bride a reception worthy of the
granddaughter of Henry IV."

"That is but just, sire."

"Then I shall want money."

"No doubt."

"I shall want ---- " Louis hesitated. The sum he was going
to demand was the same that he had been obliged to refuse
Charles II. He turned towards Colbert, that he might give
the blow.

"I shall want, to-morrow ---- " repeated he, looking at
Colbert.

"A million," said the latter, bluntly; delighted to take his
revenge.

Fouquet turned his back upon the intendant to listen to the
king. He did not turn round, but waited till the king
repeated, or rather murmured, "A million."

"Oh! sire," replied Fouquet disdainfully, "a million! What
will your majesty do with a million?"

"It appears to me, nevertheless ---- " said Louis XIV.

"That is not more than is spent at the nuptials of one of
the most petty princes of Germany."

"Monsieur!"

"Your majesty must have two millions at least. The horses
alone would run away with five hundred thousand livres. I
shall have the honor of sending your majesty sixteen hundred
thousand livres this evening."

"How," said the king, "sixteen hundred thousand livres?"

"Look, sire," replied Fouquet, without even turning towards
Colbert, "I know that wants four hundred thousand livres of
the two millions. But this monsieur of l'intendance"
(pointing over his shoulder to Colbert who, if possible,
became paler, behind him) "has in his coffers nine hundred
thousand livres of mine."

The king turned round to look at Colbert.

"But ---- " said the latter.

"Monsieur," continued Fouquet, still speaking indirectly to
Colbert, "monsieur has received a week ago sixteen hundred
thousand livres; he has paid a hundred thousand livres to
the guards, sixty-four thousand livres to the hospitals,
twenty-five thousand to the Swiss, a hundred and thirty
thousand for provisions, a thousand for arms, ten thousand
for accidental expenses; I do not err, then, in reckoning
upon nine hundred thousand livres that are left." Then
turning towards Colbert, like a disdainful head of office
towards his inferior, "Take care, monsieur," said he, "that
those nine hundred thousand livres be remitted to his
majesty this evening, in gold."

"But," said the king, "that will make two millions five
hundred thousand livres."

"Sire, the five hundred thousand livres over will serve as
pocket money for his Royal Highness. You understand,
Monsieur Colbert, this evening before eight o'clock."

And with these words, bowing respectfully to the king, the
superintendent made his exit backwards, without honoring
with a single look the envious man, whose head he had just
half shaved.

Colbert tore his ruffles to pieces in his rage, and bit his
lips till they bled.

Fouquet had not passed the door of the cabinet, when an
usher pushing by him, exclaimed: "A courier from Bretagne
for his majesty."

"M. d'Herblay was right," murmured Fouquet, pulling out his
watch; "an hour and fifty-five minutes. It was quite true."




CHAPTER 76

In which D'Artagnan finishes by at length
placing his Hand upon his Captain's Commission



The reader guesses beforehand whom the usher preceded in
announcing the courier from Bretagne. This messenger was
easily recognized. It was D'Artagnan, his clothes dusty, his
face inflamed, his hair dripping with sweat, his legs stiff;
he lifted his feet painfully at every step, on which
resounded the clink of his blood-stained spurs. He perceived
in the doorway he was passing through, the superintendent
coming out. Fouquet bowed with a smile to him who, an hour
before, was bringing him ruin and death. D'Artagnan found in
his goodness of heart, and in his inexhaustible vigor of
body, enough presence of mind to remember the kind reception
of this man; he bowed then, also, much more from benevolence
and compassion, than from respect. He felt upon his lips the
word which had so many times been repeated to the Duc de
Guise: "Fly." But to pronounce that word would have been to
betray his cause; to speak that word in the cabinet of the
king, and before an usher, would have been to ruin himself
gratuitously, and could save nobody. D'Artagnan then
contented himself with bowing to Fouquet and entered. At
this moment the king floated between the joy the last words
of Fouquet had given him, and his pleasure at the return of
D'Artagnan. Without being a courtier, D'Artagnan had a
glance as sure and as rapid as if he had been one. He read,
on his entrance, devouring humiliation on the countenance of
Colbert. He even heard the king say these words to him; --

"Ah! Monsieur Colbert, you have then nine hundred thousand
livres at the intendance?" Colbert, suffocated, bowed, but
made no reply. All this scene entered into the mind of
D'Artagnan, by the eyes and ears, at once.

The first word of Louis to his musketeer, as if he wished it
to contrast with what he was saying at the moment, was a
kind "good day." His second was to send away Colbert. The
latter left the king's cabinet, pallid and tottering, whilst
D'Artagnan twisted up the ends of his mustache.

"I love to see one of my servants in this disorder," said
the king, admiring the martial stains upon the clothes of
his envoy.

"I thought, sire, my presence at the Louvre was sufficiently
urgent to excuse my presenting myself thus before you."

"You bring me great news, then, monsieur?"

"Sire, the thing is this, in two words: Belle-Isle is
fortified, admirably fortified; Belle-Isle has a double
enciete, a citadel, two detached forts; its ports contain
three corsairs; and the side batteries only await their
cannon."

"I know all that, monsieur," replied the king.

"What! your majesty knows all that?" replied the musketeer,
stupefied.

"I have the plan of the fortifications of Belle-Isle," said
the king.

"Your majesty has the plan?"

"Here it is."

"It is really correct, sire: I saw a similar one on the
spot."

D'Artagnan's brow became clouded.

"Ah! I understand all. Your majesty did not trust to me
alone, but sent some other person," said he in a reproachful
tone.

"Of what importance is the manner, monsieur, in which I have
learnt what I know, so that I know it?"

"Sire, sire," said the musketeer, without seeking even to
conceal his dissatisfaction; "but I must be permitted to say
to your majesty, that it is not worth while to make me use
such speed, to risk twenty times the breaking of my neck, to
salute me on my arrival with such intelligence. Sire, when
people are not trusted, or are deemed insufficient, they
should scarcely be employed." And D'Artagnan, with a
movement perfectly military, stamped with his foot, and left
upon the floor dust stained with blood. The king looked at
him, inwardly enjoying his first triumph.

"Monsieur," said he, at the expiration of a minute, "not
only is Belle-Isle known to me, but, still further,
Belle-Isle is mine."

"That is well! that is well, sire, I ask but one thing
more," replied D'Artagnan. -- "My discharge."

"What! your discharge?"

"Without doubt I am too proud to eat the bread of the king
without earning it, or rather by gaining it badly. -- My
discharge, sire!"

"Oh, oh!"

"I ask for my discharge, or I will take it."

"You are angry, monsieur?"

"I have reason, mordioux! Thirty-two hours in the saddle, I
ride night and day, I perform prodigies of speed, I arrive
stiff as the corpse of a man who has been hung -- and
another arrives before me! Come, sire, I am a fool! -- My
discharge, sire!"

"Monsieur d'Artagnan," said Louis, leaning his white hand
upon the dusty arm of the musketeer, "what I tell you will
not at all affect that which I promised you. A king's word
given must be kept." And the king going straight to his
table, opened a drawer, and took out a folded paper. "Here
is your commission of captain of musketeers; you have won
it, Monsieur d'Artagnan."

D'Artagnan opened the paper eagerly, and scanned it twice.
He could scarcely believe his eyes.

"And this commission is given you," continued the king, "not
only on account of your journey to Belle-Isle, but,
moreover, for your brave intervention at the Place de Greve.
There, likewise, you served me valiantly."

"Ah, ah!" said D'Artagnan, without his self-command being
able to prevent a blush from mounting to his eyes -- "you
know that also, sire?"

"Yes, I know it."

The king possessed a piercing glance and an infallible
judgment, when it was his object to read men's minds. "You
have something to say," said he to the musketeer, "something
to say which you do not say. Come, speak freely, monsieur;
you know that I told you, once for all, that you are to be
always quite frank with me."

"Well, sire! what I have to say is this, that I would prefer
being made captain of musketeers for having charged a
battery at the head of my company, or taken a city, than for
causing two wretches to be hung."

"Is this quite true you tell me?"

"And why should your majesty suspect me of dissimulation, I
ask?"

"Because I know you well, monsieur; you cannot repent of
having drawn your sword for me."

"Well, in that your majesty is deceived, and greatly; yes, I
do repent of having drawn my sword on account of the results
that action produced; the poor men who were hung, sire, were
neither your enemies nor mine; and they could not defend
themselves."

The king preserved silence for a moment. "And your
companion, M. d'Artagnan, does he partake of your
repentance?"

"My companion?"

"Yes, you were not alone, I have been told."

"Alone, where?"

"At the Place de Greve."

"No, sire, no," said D'Artagnan, blushing at the idea that
the king might have a suspicion that he, D'Artagnan, had
wished to engross to himself all the glory that belonged to
Raoul; "no, mordioux! and as your majesty says, I had a
companion, and a good companion, too."

"A young man?"

"Yes, sire; a young man. Oh! your majesty must accept my
compliments, you are as well informed of things out of doors
as things within. It is M. Colbert who makes all these fine
reports to the king."

"M. Colbert has said nothing but good of you, M. d'Artagnan,
and he would have met with a bad reception if he had come to
tell me anything else."

"That is fortunate!"

"But he also said much good of that young man."

"And with justice," said the musketeer.

"In short, it appears that this young man is a fire-eater,"
said Louis, in order to sharpen the sentiment which he
mistook for envy.

"A fire-eater! Yes, sire," repeated D'Artagnan, delighted on
his part to direct the king's attention to Raoul.

"Do you not know his name?"

"Well, I think ---- "

"You know him then?"

"I have known him nearly five-and-twenty years, sire."

"Why, he is scarcely twenty-five years old!" cried the king.

"Well, sire! I have known him ever since he was born, that
is all."

"Do you affirm that?"

"Sire," said D'Artagnan, "your majesty questions me with a
mistrust in which I recognize another character than your
own. M. Colbert, who has so well informed you, has he not
forgotten to tell you that this young man is the son of my
most intimate friend?"

"The Vicomte de Bragelonne?"

"Certainly, sire. The father of the Vicomte de Bragelonne is
M. le Comte de la Fere, who so powerfully assisted in the
restoration of king Charles II. Bragelonne comes of a
valiant race, sire."

"Then he is the son of that nobleman who came to me, or
rather to M. Mazarin, on the part of King Charles II., to
offer me his alliance?"

"Exactly, sire."

"And the Comte de la Fere is a great soldier, say you?"

"Sire, he is a man who has drawn his sword more times for
the king, your father, than there are, at present, months in
the happy life of your majesty."

It was Louis XIV. who now bit his lip.

"That is well, M. d'Artagnan, very well! And M. le Comte de
la Fere is your friend, say you?"

"For about forty years; yes, sire. Your majesty may see that
I do not speak to you of yesterday."

"Should you be glad to see this young man, M. d'Artagnan?"

"Delighted, sire."

The king touched his bell, and an usher appeared. "Call M.
de Bragelonne," said the king.

"Ah! ah! he is here?" said D'Artagnan.

"He is on guard to-day, at the Louvre, with the company of
the gentlemen of monsieur le prince."

The king had scarcely ceased speaking, when Raoul presented
himself, and, on seeing D'Artagnan, smiled on him with that
charming smile which is only found upon the lips of youth.

"Come, come," said D'Artagnan, familiarly, to Raoul, "the
king will allow you to embrace me; only tell his majesty you
thank him."

Raoul bowed so gracefully, that Louis, to whom all superior
qualities were pleasing when they did not overshadow his
own, admired his beauty, strength and modesty.

"Monsieur," said the king, addressing Raoul, "I have asked
monsieur le prince to be kind enough to give you up to me; I
have received his reply, and you belong to me from this
morning. Monsieur le prince was a good master, but I hope
you will not lose by the exchange."

"Yes, yes, Raoul, be satisfied; the king has some good in
him," said D'Artagnan, who had fathomed the character of
Louis, and who played with his self-love, within certain
limits; always observing, be it understood, the proprieties
and flattering, even when he appeared to be bantering.

"Sire," said Bragelonne, with a voice soft and musical, and
with the natural and easy elocution he inherited from his
father, "sire, it is not from to-day that I belong to your
majesty."

"Oh! no, I know," said the king, "you mean your enterprise
of the Greve. That day, you were truly mine, monsieur."

"Sire, it is not of that day I would speak; it would not
become me to refer to so paltry a service in the presence of
such a man as M. d'Artagnan. I would speak of a circumstance
which created an epoch in my life, and which consecrated me,
from the age of sixteen, to the devoted service of your
majesty."

"Ah! ah!" said the king, "what was that circumstance? Tell
me, monsieur."

"This is it, sire. -- When I was setting out on my first
campaign, that is to say, to join the army of monsieur le
prince, M. le Comte de la Fere came to conduct me as far as
Saint-Denis, where the remains of King Louis XIII. wait,
upon the lowest steps of the funeral basilique, a successor,
whom God will not send him, I hope, for many years. Then he
made me swear upon the ashes of our masters, to serve
royalty, represented by you -- incarnate in you, sire -- to
serve it in word, in thought, and in action. I swore, and
God and the dead were witnesses to my oath. During ten
years, sire, I have not so often as I desired had occasion
to keep it. I am a soldier of your majesty, and nothing
else; and, on calling me nearer to you, I do not change my
master, I only change my garrison."

Raoul was silent, and bowed. Louis still listened after he
had done speaking.

"Mordioux!" cried D'Artagnan, "that was well spoken! was it
not, your majesty? A good race! a noble race!"

"Yes," murmured the agitated king, without, however, daring
to manifest his emotion, for it had no other cause than
contact with a nature intrinsically noble. "Yes, monsieur,
you say truly: -- wherever you were, you were the king's.
But in changing your garrison, believe me you will find an
advancement of which you are worthy."

Raoul saw that this ended what the king had to say to him.
And with the perfect tact which characterized his refined
nature, he bowed and retired.

"Is there anything else, monsieur, of which you have to
inform me?" said the king, when he found himself again alone
with D'Artagnan.

"Yes, sire, and I kept that news for the last, for it is
sad, and will clothe European royalty in mourning."

"What do you tell me?"

"Sire, in passing through Blois, a word, a sad word, echoed
from the palace, struck my ear."

"In truth, you terrify me, M. d'Artagnan."

"Sire, this word was pronounced to me by a piqueur, who wore
crape on his arm."

"My uncle, Gaston of Orleans, perhaps."

"Sire, he has rendered his last sigh."

"And I was not warned of it!" cried the king, whose royal
susceptibility saw an insult in the absence of this
intelligence.

"Oh! do not be angry, sire," said D'Artagnan; "neither the
couriers of Paris, nor the couriers of the whole world, can
travel with your servant; the courier from Blois will not be
here these two hours, and he rides well, I assure you,
seeing that I only passed him on the thither side of
Orleans."

"My uncle Gaston," murmured Louis, pressing his hand to his
brow, and comprising in those three words all that his
memory recalled of that symbol of opposing sentiments.

"Eh! yes, sire, it is thus," said D'Artagnan,
philosophically replying to the royal thought, "it is thus
the past flies away."

"That is true, monsieur, that is true; but there remains for
us, thank God! the future; and we will try to make it not
too dark."

"I feel confidence in your majesty on that head," said
D'Artagnan, bowing, "and now ---- "

"You are right, monsieur; I had forgotten the hundred
leagues you have just ridden. Go, monsieur, take care of one
of the best of soldiers, and when you have reposed a little,
come and place yourself at my disposal."

"Sire, absent or present, I am always yours."

D'Artagnan bowed and retired. Then, as if he had only come
from Fontainebleau, he quickly traversed the Louvre to
rejoin Bragelonne.




CHAPTER 77

A Lover and his Mistress



Whilst the wax-lights were burning in the castle of Blois,
around the inanimate body of Gaston of Orleans, that last
representative of the past; whilst the bourgeois of the city
were thinking out his epitaph, which was far from being a
panegyric; whilst madame the dowager, no longer remembering
that in her young days she had loved that senseless corpse
to such a degree as to fly the paternal palace for his sake,
was making, within twenty paces of the funeral apartment,
her little calculations of interest and her little
sacrifices of pride; other interests and other prides were
in agitation in all the parts of the castle into which a
living soul could penetrate. Neither the lugubrious sounds
of the bells, nor the voices of the chanters, nor the
splendor of the waxlights through the windows, nor the
preparations for the funeral, had power to divert the
attention of two persons, placed at a window of the interior
court ---a window that we are acquainted with, and which
lighted a chamber forming part of what were called the
little apartments. For the rest, a joyous beam of the sun,
for the sun appeared to care little for the loss France had
just suffered; a sunbeam, we say, descended upon them,
drawing perfumes from the neighboring flowers, and animating
the walls themselves. These two persons, so occupied, not by
the death of the duke, but by the conversation which was the
consequence of that death, were a young woman and a young
man. The latter personage, a man of from twenty-five to
twenty-six years of age, with a mien sometimes lively and
sometimes dull, making good use of two large eyes, shaded
with long eye-lashes, was short of stature and swart of
skin; he smiled with an enormous, but well-furnished mouth,
and his pointed chin, which appeared to enjoy a mobility
nature does not ordinarily grant to that portion of the
countenance, leant from time to time very lovingly towards
his interlocutrix, who, we must say did not always draw back
so rapidly as strict propriety had a right to require. The
young girl -- we know her, for we have already seen her, at
that very same window by the light of that same sun -- the
young girl presented a singular mixture of shyness and
reflection; she was charming when she laughed, beautiful
when she became serious; but, let us hasten to say, she was
more frequently charming than beautiful. These two appeared
to have attained the culminating point of a discussion --
half-bantering, half-serious.

"Now, Monsieur Malicorne," said the young girl, "does it, at
length, please you that we should talk reasonably?"

"You believe that that is very easy, Mademoiselle Aure,"
replied the young man. "To do what we like, when we can only
do what we are able ---- "

"Good! there he is bewildered in his phrases."

"Who, I?"

"Yes, you quit that lawyer's logic, my dear."

"Another impossibility. Clerk I am, Mademoiselle de
Montalais."

"Demoiselle I am, Monsieur Malicorne."

"Alas, I know it well, and you overwhelm me by your rank; so
I will say no more to you."

"Well, no, I don't overwhelm you; say what you have to tell
me -- say- it, I insist upon it."

Well, I obey you."

"That is truly fortunate."

"Monsieur is dead."

"Ah, peste! there's news! And where do you come from, to be
able to tell us that?"

"I come from Orleans, mademoiselle."

"And is that all the news you bring?"

"Ah, no; I am come to tell you that Madame Henrietta of
England is coming to marry the king's brother."

"Indeed, Malicorne, you are insupportable with your news of
the last century. Now, mind, if you persist in this bad
habit of laughing at people, I will have you turned out."

"Oh!"

"Yes; for really you exasperate me."

"There, there. Patience, mademoiselle."

"You want to make yourself of consequence; I know well
enough why. Go!"

"Tell me, and I will answer you frankly, yes, if the thing
be true."

"You know that I am anxious to have that commission of lady
of honor, which I have been foolish enough to ask of you,
and you do not use your credit."

"Who, I?" Malicorne cast down his eyes, joined his hands,
and assumed his sullen air. "And what credit can the poor
clerk of a procurer have, pray?"

"Your father has not twenty thousand livres a year for
nothing, M. Malicorne."

"A provincial fortune, Mademoiselle de Montalais."

"Your father is not in the secrets of monsieur le prince for
nothing."

"An advantage which is confined to lending monseigneur
money."

"In a word, you are not the most cunning young fellow in the
province for nothing."

"You flatter me "

"Who, I?"

"Yes, you."

"How so?"

"Since I maintain that I have no credit, and you maintain I
have."

"Well, then, -- my commission?"

"Well, -- your commission?"

"Shall I have it, or shall I not?"

"You shall have it."

"Ay, but when?"

"When you like."

"Where is it, then?"

"In my pocket."

"How -- in your pocket?"

"Yes."

And, with a smile, Malicorne drew from his pocket a letter,
upon which mademoiselle seized as a prey, and which she read
eagerly. As she read, her face brightened.

"Malicorne," cried she, after having read it, "in truth, you
are a good lad."

"What for, mademoiselle?"

"Because you might have been paid for this commission, and
you have not." And she burst into a loud laugh, thinking to
put the clerk out of countenance; but Malicorne sustained
the attack bravely.

"I do not understand you," said he. It was now Montalais who
was disconcerted in her turn. "I have declared my sentiments
to you," continued Malicorne. "You have told me three times,
laughing all the while, that you did not love me; you have
embraced me once without laughing, and that is all I want."

"All?" said the proud and coquettish Montalais, in a tone
through which wounded pride was visible.

"Absolutely all, mademoiselle," replied Malicorne.

"Ah!" -- And this monosyllable indicated as much anger as
the young man might have expected gratitude. He shook his
head quietly.

"Listen, Montalais," said he, without heeding whether that
familiarity pleased his mistress or not; "let us not dispute
about it."

"And why not?"

"Because during the year which I have known you, you might
have had me turned out of doors twenty times if I did not
please you."

"Indeed; and on what account should I have had you turned
out?"

"Because I had been sufficiently impertinent for that."

"Oh, that, -- yes, that's true."

"You see plainly that you are forced to avow it," said
Malicorne.

"Monsieur Malicorne!"

"Don't let us be angry; if you have retained me, then it has
not been without cause."

"It is not, at least, because I love you," cried Montalais.

"Granted. I will even say that, at this moment, I am certain
that you hate me."

"Oh, you have never spoken so truly."

"Well, on my part I detest you."

"Ah! I take the act."

"Take it. You find me brutal and foolish; on my part I find
you have a harsh voice, and your face is too often distorted
with anger. At this moment you would allow yourself to be
thrown out of that window rather than allow me to kiss the
tip of your finger; I would precipitate myself from the top
of the balcony rather than touch the hem of your robe. But,
in five minutes, you will love me, and I shall adore you.
Oh, it is just so."

"I doubt it."

"And I swear it."

"Coxcomb!"

"And then, that is not the true reason. You stand in need of
me, Aure, and I of you. When it pleases you to be gay, I
make you laugh; when it suits me to be loving, I look at
you. I have given you a commission of lady of honor which
you wished for; you will give me, presently, something I
wish for."

"I will?"

"Yes, you will; but, at this moment, my dear Aure, I declare
to you that I wish for absolutely nothing, so be at ease."

"You are a frightful man, Malicorne; I was going to rejoice
at getting this commission, and thus you quench my joy."

"Good; there is no time lost, -- you will rejoice when I am
gone."

"Go, then; and after ---- "

"So be it; but in the first place, a piece of advice."

"What is it?"

"Resume your good-humor, -- you are ugly when you pout."

"Coarse!"

"Come, let us tell the truth to each other, while we are
about it."

"Oh, Malicorne! Bad-hearted man!"

"Oh, Montalais! Ungrateful girl!"

The young man leant with his elbow upon the window-frame;
Montalais took a book and opened it. Malicorne stood up,
brushed his hat with his sleeve; smoothed down his black
doublet, -- Montalais, though pretending to read, looked at
him out of the corner of her eye.

"Good!" cried she, furious, "he has assumed his respectful
air -- and he will pout for a week."

"A fortnight, mademoiselle," said Malicorne, bowing.

Montalais lifted up her little doubled fist. "Monster!" said
she; "oh! that I were a man!"

"What would you do to me?"

"I would strangle you."

"Ah! very well, then," said Malicorne; "I believe I begin to
desire something."

"And what do you desire, Monsieur Demon? That I should lose
my soul from anger?"

Malicorne was rolling his hat respectfully between his
fingers; but, all at once, he let fall his hat, seized the
young girl by the shoulders, pulled her towards him and
sealed her mouth with two lips that were very warm, for a
man pretending to so much indifference. Aure would have
cried out, but the cry was stifled in the kiss. Nervous and,
apparently, angry, the young girl pushed Malicorne against
the wall.

"Good!" said Malicorne, philosophically, "that's enough for
six weeks. Adieu, mademoiselle, accept my very humble
salutation." And he made three steps towards the door.

"Well! no, -- you shall not go!" cried, Montalais, stamping
with her little foot. "Stay where you are! I order you!"

"You order me?"

"Yes; am I not mistress?"

"Of my heart and soul, without doubt."

"A pretty property! ma foi! The soul is silly and the heart
dry."

"Beware, Montalais, I know you," said Malicorne; "you are
going to fall in love with your humble servant."

"Well, yes!" said she, hanging round his neck with childish
indolence, rather than with loving abandonment. "Well, yes!
for I must thank you at least."

"And for what?"

"For the commission, is it not my whole future?"

"And mine."

Montalais looked at him.

"It is frightful," said she, "that one can never guess
whether you are speaking seriously or not."

"I cannot speak more seriously. I was going to Paris, -- you
are going there, -- we are going there."

"And so it was for that motive only you have served me,
selfish fellow!"

"What would you have me say, Aure? I cannot live without
you."

"Well! in truth, it is just so with me; you are,
nevertheless, it must be confessed, a very bad-hearted young
man."

"Aure, my dear Aure, take care! if you take to calling names
again, you know the effect they produce upon me, and I shall
adore you." And so saying, Malicorne drew the young girl a
second time towards him. But at that instant a step
resounded on the staircase. The young people were so close,
that they would have been surprised in the arms of each
other, if Montalais had not violently pushed Malicorne, with
his back against the door, just then opening. A loud cry,
followed by angry reproaches, immediately resounded. It was
Madame de Saint-Remy who uttered the cry and the angry
words. The unlucky Malicorne almost crushed her between the
wall and the door she was coming in at.

"It is again that good-for-nothing!" cried the old lady.
"Always here!"

"Ah, madame!" replied Malicorne, in a respectful tone; "it
is eight long days since I was here."




CHAPTER 78

In which we at length see the true Heroine of this History appear



Behind Madame de Saint-Remy stood Mademoiselle de la
Valliere. She heard the explosion of maternal anger, and as
she divined the cause of it, she entered the chamber
trembling, and perceived the unlucky Malicorne, whose woeful
countenance might have softened or set laughing whoever
observed it coolly. He had promptly intrenched himself
behind a large chair, as if to avoid the first attacks of
Madame de Saint-Remy; he had no hopes of prevailing with
words, for she spoke louder than he, and without stopping;
but he reckoned upon the eloquence of his gestures. The old
lady would neither listen to nor see anything; Malicorne had
long been one of her antipathies. But her anger was too
great not to overflow from Malicorne on his accomplice.
Montalais had her turn.

"And you, mademoiselle; you may be certain I shall inform
madame of what is going on in the apartment of one of her
ladies of honor!"

"Oh, dear mother!" cried Mademoiselle de la Valliere, "for
mercy's sake, spare ---- "

"Hold your tongue, mademoiselle, and do not uselessly
trouble yourself to intercede for unworthy people; that a
young maid of honor like you should be subjected to a bad
example is, certes, a misfortune great enough; but that you
should sanction it by your indulgence is what I will not
allow."

"But in truth," said Montalais, rebelling again, "I do not
know under what pretense you treat me thus. I am doing no
harm, I suppose?"

"And that great good-for-nothing, mademoiselle," resumed
Madame de Saint-Remy, pointing to Malicorne, "is he here to
do any good, I ask you?"

"He is neither here for good nor harm, madame; he comes to
see me, that is all."

"It is all very well! all very well!" said the old lady.
"Her royal highness shall be informed of it, and she will
judge."

"At all events, I do not see why," replied Montalais, "it
should be forbidden M. Malicorne to have intentions towards
me, if his intentions are honorable."

"Honorable intentions with such a face!" cried Madame de
Saint-Remy.

"I thank you in the name of my face, madame," said
Malicorne.

"Come, my daughter, come," continued Madame de Saint-Remy;
"we will go and inform madame that at the very moment she is
weeping for her husband, at the moment when we are all
weeping for a master in this old castle of Blois, the abode
of grief, there are people who amuse themselves with
flirtations!"

"Oh!" cried both the accused, with one voice.

"A maid of honor! a maid of honor!" cried the old lady,
lifting her hands towards heaven.

"Well! it is there you are mistaken, madame," said
Montalais, highly exasperated; "I am no longer a maid of
honor, of madame's at least."

"Have you given in your resignation, mademoiselle? That is
well! I cannot but applaud such a determination, and I do
applaud it."

"I do not give in my resignation, madame; I take another
service, -- that is all."

"In the bourgeoisie or in the robe?" asked Madame de
Saint-Remy, disdainfully.

"Please to learn, madame, that I am not a girl to serve
either bourgeoises or robines, and that instead of the
miserable court at which you vegetate, I am going to reside
in a court almost royal."

"Ha, ha! a royal court," said Madame de Saint-Remy, forcing
a laugh; "a royal court! What think you of that, my
daughter?"

And she turned round towards Mademoiselle de la Valliere,
whom she would by main force have dragged away from
Montalais, and who, instead of obeying the impulse of Madame
de Saint-Remy, looked first at her mother and then at
Montalais with her beautiful conciliatory eyes.

"I did not say a royal court, madame," replied Montalais;
"because Madame Henrietta of England, who is about to become
the wife of S. A. R. Monsieur, is not a queen. I said almost
royal, and I spoke correctly, since she will be
sister-in-law to the king."

A thunderbolt falling upon the castle of Blois would not
have astonished Madame de Saint-Remy more than the last
sentence of Montalais.

"What do you say? of Son Altesse Royale Madame Henrietta?"
stammered out the old lady.

"I say I am going to belong to her household, as maid of
honor, that is what I say."

"As maid of honor!" cried, at the same time, Madame de
Saint-Remy with despair, and Mademoiselle de la Valliere
with delight.

"Yes, madame, as maid of honor."

The old lady's head sank down as if the blow had been too
severe for her. But, almost immediately recovering herself,
she launched a last projectile at her adversary.

"Oh! oh!" said she, "I have heard of many of these sorts of
promises beforehand, which often lead people to flatter
themselves with wild hopes, and at the last moment, when the
time comes to keep the promises, and have the hopes
realized, they are surprised to see the great credit upon
which they reckoned vanish like smoke."

"Oh! madame, the credit of my protector is incontestable and
his promises are as good as deeds."

"And would it be indiscreet to ask you the name of this
powerful protector?"

"Oh! mon Dieu! no! it is that gentleman there," said
Montalais, pointing to Malicorne, who, during this scene,
had preserved the most imperturbable coolness, and the most
comic dignity.

"Monsieur!" cried Madame de Saint-Remy, with an explosion of
hilarity, "monsieur is your protector! Is the man whose
credit is so powerful, and whose promises are as good as
deeds, Monsieur Malicorne?"

Malicorne bowed.

As to Montalais, as her sole reply, she drew the brevet from
her pocket, and showed it to the old lady.

"Here is the brevet," said she.

At once all was over. As soon as she had cast a rapid glance
over this fortunate brevet, the good lady clasped her hands,
an unspeakable expression of envy and despair contracted her
countenance, and she was obliged to sit down to avoid
fainting. Montalais was not malicious enough to rejoice
extravagantly at her victory, or to overwhelm the conquered
enemy, particularly when that enemy was the mother of her
friend; she used then, but did not abuse, her triumph.
Malicorne was less generous; he assumed noble poses in his
fauteuil, and stretched himself out with a familiarity
which, two hours earlier, would have drawn upon him threats
of a caning.

"Maid of honor to the young madame!" repeated Madame de
Saint-Remy, still but half convinced.

"Yes, madame, and through the protection of M. Malicorne,
moreover."

"It is incredible!" repeated the old lady: "is it not
incredible, Louise?" But Louise did not reply; she was
sitting, thoughtful, almost sad; passing one hand over her
beautiful brow she sighed heavily.

"Well, but, monsieur," said Madame de Saint-Remy, all at
once, "how did you manage to obtain this post?"

"I asked for it, madame."

"Of whom?"

"One of my friends."

"And have you friends sufficiently powerful at court to give
you such proofs of their credit?"

"It appears so."

"And may one ask the name of these friends?"

"I did not say I had many friends, madame, I said I had one
friend."

And that friend is called?"

"Peste! madame, you go too far! When one has a friend as
powerful as mine, we do not publish his name in that
fashion, in open day, in order that he may be stolen from
us."

"You are right, monsieur, to be silent as to that name; for
I think it would be pretty difficult for you to tell it."

"At all events," said Montalais, "if the friend does not
exist, the brevet does, and that cuts short the question."

"Then, I conceive," said Madame de Saint-Remy, with the
gracious smile of the cat who is going to scratch, "when I
found monsieur here just now ---- "

"Well?"

"He brought you the brevet."

"Exactly, madame, you have guessed rightly."

"Well, then, nothing can be more moral or proper."

"I think so, madame."

"And I have been wrong, as it appears, in reproaching you,
mademoiselle."

"Very wrong, madame; but I am so accustomed to your
reproaches, that I pardon you these."

"In that case, let us begone, Louise; we have nothing to do
but to retire. Well!"

"Madame!" said La Valliere, starting, "did you speak?"

"You do not appear to be listening, my child."

"No, madame, I was thinking."

"About what?"

"A thousand things."

"You bear me no ill-will, at least, Louise?" cried
Montalais, pressing her hand.

"And why should I, my dear Aure?" replied the girl in a
voice soft as a flute.

"Dame!" resumed Madame de Saint-Remy; "if she did bear you a
little ill-will, poor girl, she could not be much blamed."

"And why should she bear me ill-will, good gracious?"

"It appears to me that she is of as good a family, and as
pretty as you."

"Mother! mother!" cried Louise.

"Prettier a hundred times, madame -- not of a better family;
but that does not tell me why Louise should bear me
ill-will"

"Do you think it will be very amusing for her to be buried
alive at Blois, when you are going to shine at Paris?"

"But, madame, it is not I who prevent Louise following me
thither; on the contrary, I should certainly be most happy
if she came there."

"But it appears that M. Malicorne, who is all-powerful at
court ---- "

"Ah! so much the worse, madame," said Malicorne, "every one
for himself in this poor world."

"Malicorne! Malicorne!" said Montalais. Then stooping
towards the young man: --

"Occupy Madame de Saint-Remy, either in disputing with her,
or making it up with her; I must speak to Louise." And, at
the same time, a soft pressure of the hand recompensed
Malicorne for his future obedience. Malicorne went grumbling
towards Madame de Saint-Remy, whilst Montalais said to her
friend, throwing one arm around her neck: --

"What is the matter? Tell me. Is it true that you would not
love me if I were to shine, as your mother says?"

"Oh, no!" said the young girl, with difficulty restraining
her tears; "on the contrary, I rejoice at your good
fortune."

"Rejoice! why, one would say you are ready to cry!"

"Do people never weep except from envy?"

"Oh! yes, I understand; I am going to Paris, and that word
Paris recalls to your mind a certain cavalier ---- "

"Aure!"

"A certain cavalier who formerly lived near Blois, and who
now resides at Paris."

"In truth, I know not what ails me, but I feel stifled."

"Weep, then, weep, as you cannot give me a smile!"

Louise raised her sweet face, which the tears, rolling down
one after the other, illumined like diamonds.

"Come, confess," said Montalais.

"What shall I confess?"

"What makes you weep; people don't weep without cause. I am
your friend; whatever you would wish me to do, I will do.
Malicorne is more powerful than you would think. Do you wish
to go to Paris?"

"Alas!" sighed Louise.

"Do you wish to come to Paris?"

"To remain here alone, in this old castle, I who have
enjoyed the delightful habit of listening to your songs, of
pressing your hand, of running about the park with you. Oh!
how I shall be ennuyee! how quickly I shall die!"

"Do you wish to come to Paris?"

Louise breathed another sigh.

"You do not answer me."

"What would you that I should reply?"

"Yes or no; that is not very difficult I think."

"Oh! you are very fortunate, Montalais!"

"That is to say you would like to be in my place."

Louise was silent.

"Little obstinate thing!" said Montalais; "did ever any one
keep her secrets from her friend thus? But confess that you
would like to come to Paris, confess that you are dying with
the wish to see Raoul again?"

"I cannot confess that."

"Then you are wrong."

"In what way?"

"Because ---- do you see this brevet?"

"To be sure I do."

"Well, I would have got you a similar one."

"By whose means?"

"Malicorne's."

"Aure, are you telling the truth? Is that possible?"

"Malicorne is there; and what he has done for me, he surely
can do for you."

Malicorne had heard his name pronounced twice; he was
delighted at having an opportunity of coming to a conclusion
with Madame de Saint-Remy, and he turned round: --

"What is the question, mademoiselle?"

"Come hither, Malicorne," said Montalais, with an imperious
gesture. Malicorne obeyed.

"A brevet like this," said Montalais.

"How so?"

"A brevet like this; that is plain enough.

"But ---- "

"I want one -- I must have one!"

"Oh! oh! you must have one!"

"Yes."

"It is impossible, is it not, M. Malicorne?" said Louise,
with her sweet, soft voice.

"If it is for you, mademoiselle ---- "

"For me. Yes, Monsieur Malicorne, it would be for me."

"And if Mademoiselle de Montalais asks it at the same time
---- "

"Mademoiselle de Montalais does not ask it, she requires
it."

"Well! we will endeavor to obey you, mademoiselle."

"And you will have her named?"

"We will try."

"No evasive answers. Louise de la Valliere shall be maid of
honor to Madame Henrietta within a week."

"How you talk!"

"Within a week, or else ---- "

"Well! or else?"

"You may take back your brevet, Monsieur Malicorne; I will
not leave my friend."

"Dear Montalais!"

"That is right. Keep your brevet, Mademoiselle de la
Valliere shall be a maid of honor."

"Is that true?"

"Quite true."

"I may then hope to go to Paris?"

"Depend upon it."

"Oh! Monsieur Malicorne, what joy!" cried Louise, clapping
her hands, and bounding with pleasure.

"Little dissembler!" said Montalais, "try again to make me
believe you are not in love with Raoul."

Louise blushed like a rose in June, but instead of replying,
she ran and embraced her mother. "Madame," said she, "do you
know that M. Malicorne is going to have me appointed maid of
honor?"

"M. Malicorne is a prince in disguise," replied the old
lady, "he is all-powerful, seemingly."

"Should you also like to be maid of honor?" asked Malicorne
of Madame de Saint-Remy. "Whilst I am about it, I might as
well get everybody appointed."

And upon that he went away, leaving the poor lady quite
disconcerted.

"Humph!" murmured Malicorne as he descended the stairs, --
"Humph! there goes another note of a thousand livres! but I
must get through as well as I can; my friend Manicamp does
nothing for nothing."




CHAPTER 79

Malicorne and Manicamp



The introduction of these two new personages into this
history and that mysterious affinity of names and
sentiments, merit some attention on the part of both
historian and reader. We will then enter into some details
concerning Messieurs Malicorne and Manicamp. Malicorne we
know, had made the journey to Orleans in search of the
brevet destined for Mademoiselle de Montalais, the arrival
of which had produced such a strong feeling at the castle of
Blois. At that moment, M. de Manicamp was at Orleans. A
singular person was this M. de Manicamp; a very intelligent
young fellow, always poor, always needy, although he dipped
his hand freely into the purse of M. le Comte de Guiche, one
of the best furnished purses of the period. M. le Comte de
Guiche had had, as the companion of his boyhood, this De
Manicamp, a poor gentleman, vassal-born, of the house of
Grammont. M. de Manicamp, with his tact and talent, had
created himself a revenue in the opulent family of the
celebrated marechal. From his infancy he had, with
calculation beyond his age, lent his name and complaisance
to the follies of the Comte de Guiche. If his noble
companion had stolen some fruit destined for Madame la
Marechale, if he had broken a mirror, or put out a dog's
eye, Manicamp declared himself guilty of the crime
committed, and received the punishment, which was not made
the milder for falling on the innocent. But this was the way
this system of abnegation was paid for: instead of wearing
such mean habiliments as his paternal fortunes entitled him
to, he was able to appear brilliant, superb, like a young
noble of fifty thousand livres a year. It was not that he
was mean in character or humble in spirit; no, he was a
philosopher, or rather he had the indifference, the apathy,
the obstinacy which banish from man every sentiment of the
supernatural. His sole ambition was to spend money. But, in
this respect, the worthy M. de Manicamp was a gulf. Three or
four times every year he drained the Comte de Guiche, and
when the Comte de Guiche was thoroughly drained, when he had
turned out his pockets and his purse before him, when he
declared that it would be at least a fortnight before
paternal munificence would refill those pockets and that
purse, Manicamp lost all his energy, he went to bed,
remained there, ate nothing and sold his handsome clothes,
under the pretense that, remaining in bed, he did not want
them. During this prostration of mind and strength, the
purse of the Comte de Guiche was getting full again, and
when once filled, overflowed into that of De Manicamp, who
bought new clothes, dressed himself again, and recommenced
the same life he had followed before. The mania of selling
his new clothes for a quarter of what they were worth had
rendered our hero sufficiently celebrated in Orleans, a city
where, in general, we should be puzzled to say why he came
to pass his days of penitence. Provincial debauches,
petits-maitres of six hundred livres a year, shared the
fragments of his opulence.

Among the admirers of these splendid toilettes, our friend
Malicorne was conspicuous; he was the son of a syndic of the
city, of whom M. de Conde, always needy as a De Conde, often
borrowed money at enormous interest. M. Malicorne kept the
paternal money-chest; that is to say, that in those times of
easy morals, he had made for himself, by following the
example of his father, and lending at high interest for
short terms, a revenue of eighteen hundred livres, without
reckoning six hundred livres furnished by the generosity of
the syndic, so that Malicorne was the king of the gay youth
of Orleans, having two thousand four hundred livres to
scatter, squander, and waste on follies of every kind. But,
quite contrary to Manicamp, Malicorne was terribly
ambitious. He loved from ambition; he spent money out of
ambition; and he would have ruined himself for ambition.
Malicorne had determined to rise, at whatever price it might
cost, and for this, at whatever price it did cost, he had
given himself a mistress and a friend. The mistress,
Mademoiselle de Montalais, was cruel as regarded love; but
she was of a noble family, and that was sufficient for
Malicorne. The friend had little or no friendship, but he
was the favorite of the Comte de Guiche, himself the friend
of Monsieur, the king's brother, and that was sufficient for
Malicorne. Only, in the chapter of charges, Mademoiselle de
Montalais cost per annum: -- ribbons, gloves, and sweets, a
thousand livres. De Manicamp cost -- money lent, never
returned -- from twelve to fifteen hundred livres per annum.
So that there was nothing left for Malicorne. Ah! yes, we
are mistaken; there was left the paternal strong box. He
employed a mode of proceeding, upon which he preserved the
most profound secrecy, and which consisted in advancing to
himself from the coffers of the syndic, half a dozen year's
profits, that is to say, fifteen thousand livres, swearing
to himself -- observe, quite to himself -- to repay this
deficiency as soon as an opportunity should present itself.

The opportunity was expected to be the concession of a good
post in the household of Monsieur, when that household would
be established at the period of his marriage. This juncture
had arrived, and the household was about to be established.
A good post in the family of a prince of the blood, when it
is given by the credit, and on the recommendation of a
friend, like the Comte de Guiche, is worth at least twelve
thousand livres per annum; and by the means which M.
Malicorne had taken to make his revenues fructify, twelve
thousand livres might rise to twenty thousand. Then, when
once an incumbent of this post, he would marry Mademoiselle
de Montalais. Mademoiselle de Montalais, of a half noble
family, not only would be dowered, but would ennoble
Malicorne. But, in order that Mademoiselle de Montalais, who
had not a large patrimonial fortune, although an only
daughter, should be suitably dowered, it was necessary that
she should belong to some great princess, as prodigal as the
dowager Madame was covetous. And in order that the wife
should not be of one party whilst the husband belonged to
the other, a situation which presents serious
inconveniences, particularly with characters like those of
the future consorts -- Malicorne had imagined the idea of
making the central point of union the household of Monsieur,
the king's brother. Mademoiselle de Montalais would be maid
of honor to Madame. M. Malicorne would be officer to
Monsieur.

It is plain the plan was formed by a clear head; it is
plain, also, that it had been bravely executed. Malicorne
had asked Manicamp to ask a brevet of maid of honor of the
Comte de Guiche; and the Comte de Guiche had asked this
brevet of Monsieur, who had signed it without hesitation.
The constructive plan of Malicorne -- for we may well
suppose that the combinations of a mind as active as his
were not confined to the present, but extended to the future
-- the constructive plan of Malicorne, we say, was this: --
To obtain entrance into the household of Madame Henrietta
for a woman devoted to himself, who was intelligent, young,
handsome, and intriguing; to learn, by means of this woman,
all the feminine secrets of the young household, whilst he,
Malicorne, and his friend Manicamp, should, between them,
know all the male secrets of the young community. It was by
these means that a rapid and splendid fortune might be
acquired at one and the same time. Malicorne was a vile
name; he who bore it had too much wit to conceal this truth
from himself; but an estate might be purchased; and
Malicorne of some place, or even De Malicorne itself, for
short, would ring more nobly on the ear.

It was not improbable that a most aristocratic origin might
be hunted up by the heralds for this name of Malicorne;
might it not come from some estate where a bull with mortal
horns had caused some great misfortune, and baptized the
soil with the blood it had spilt? Certes, this plan
presented itself bristling with difficulties: but the
greatest of all was Mademoiselle de Montalais herself.
Capricious, variable, close, giddy, free, prudish, a virgin
armed with claws, Erigone stained with grapes, she sometimes
overturned, with a single dash of her white fingers, or with
a single puff from her laughing lips, the edifice which had
exhausted Malicorne's patience for a month.

Love apart, Malicorne was happy; but this love, which he
could not help feeling, he had the strength to conceal with
care; persuaded that at the lest relaxing of the ties by
which he had bound his Protean female, the demon would
overthrow him and laugh at him. He humbled his mistress by
disdaining her. Burning with desire, when she advanced to
tempt him, he had the art to appear ice, persuaded that if
he opened his arms, she would run away laughing at him. On
her side, Montalais believed she did not love Malicorne;
whilst, on the contrary, in reality she did. Malicorne
repeated to her so often his protestation of indifference,
that she finished sometimes, by believing him; and then she
believed she detested Malicorne. If she tried to bring him
back by coquetry, Malicorne played the coquette better than
she could. But what made Montalais hold to Malicorne in an
indissoluble fashion, was that Malicorne always came cram
full of fresh news from the court and the city; Malicorne
always brought to Blois a fashion, a secret, or a perfume;
that Malicorne never asked for a meeting, but, on the
contrary, required to be supplicated to receive the favors
he burned to obtain. On her side Montalais was no miser with
stories. By her means Malicorne learnt all that passed at
Blois, in the family of the dowager Madame; and he related
to Manicamp tales that made him ready to die with laughing,
which the latter, out of idleness, took ready-made to M. de
Guiche, who carried them to Monsieur.

Such, in two words, was the woof of petty interests and
petty conspiracies which united Blois with Orleans and
Orleans with Paris; and which was about to bring into the
last named city, where she was to produce so great a
revolution, the poor little La Valliere, who was far from
suspecting, as she returned joyfully, leaning on the arm of
her mother, for what a strange future she was reserved. As
to the good man, Malicorne -- we speak of the syndic of
Orleans -- he did not see more clearly into the present than
others did into the future; and had no suspicion as he
walked, every day, between three and five o'clock, after his
dinner, upon the Place Sainte-Catherine, in his gray coat,
cut after the fashion of Louis XIII. and his cloth shoes
with great knots of ribbon, that it was he who was paying
for all those bursts of laughter, all those stolen kisses,
all those whisperings, all those little keepsakes, and all
those bubble projects which formed a chain of forty-five
leagues in length, from the palais of Blois to the
Palais-Royal.




CHAPTER 80

Manicamp and Malicorne



Malicorne, then, left Blois, as we have said, and went to
find his friend Manicamp, then in temporary retreat in the
city of Orleans. It was just at the moment when that young
nobleman was employed in selling the last decent clothing he
had left. He had, a fortnight before extorted from the Comte
de Guiche a hundred pistoles, all he had, to assist in
equipping him properly to go and meet Madame, on her arrival
at Havre. He had drawn from Malicorne, three days before,
fifty pistoles, the price of the brevet obtained for
Montalais. He had then no expectation of anything else,
having exhausted all his resources, with the exception of
selling a handsome suit of cloth and satin, embroidered and
laced with gold, which had been the admiration of the court.
But to be able to sell this suit, the last he had left -- as
we have been forced to confess to the reader -- Manicamp had
been obliged to take to his bed. No more fire, no more
pocket-money, no more walking-money, nothing but sleep to
take the place of repasts, companies and balls. It has been
said -- "he who sleeps, dines;" but it has never been
affirmed -- he who sleeps, plays -- or he who sleeps,
dances. Manicamp, reduced to this extremity of neither
playing nor dancing, for a week at least, was, consequently,
very sad; he was expecting a usurer, and saw Malicorne
enter. A cry of distress escaped him.

"Eh! what!" said he, in a tone which nothing can describe,
"is that you again, dear friend?"

"Humph! you are very polite!" said Malicorne.

"Ay, but look you, I was expecting money, and, instead of
money, I see you."

"And suppose I brought you some money?"

"Oh! that would be quite another thing. You are very
welcome, my dear friend!"

And he held out his hand, not for the hand of Malicorne, but
for the purse. Malicorne pretended to be mistaken, and gave
him his hand.

"And the money?" said Manicamp.

"My dear friend, if you wish to have it, earn it."

"What must be done for it?"

"Earn it, parbleu!"

"And after what fashion?"

"Oh! that is rather trying, I warn you."

"The devil!"

"You must get out of bed, and go immediately to M. le Comte
de Guiche."

"I get out!" said Manicamp, stretching himself in his bed,
complacently, "oh, no, thank you!"

"You have sold all your clothes?"

"No, I have one suit left, the handsomest even, but I expect
a purchaser."

"And the chausses?"

"Well, if you look, you will see them on that chair."

"Very well! since you have some chausses and a pourpoint
left, put your legs into the first and your back into the
other; have a horse saddled, and set off."

"Not I."

"And why not?"

"Mordieu! don't you know, then, that M. de Guiche is at
Etampes?"

"No, I thought he was at Paris. You will then only have
fifteen leagues to go, instead of thirty."

"You are a wonderfully clever fellow! If I were to ride
fifteen leagues in these clothes, they would never be fit to
put on again; and, instead of selling them for thirty
pistoles, I should be obliged to take fifteen."

"Sell them for what you like, but I must have a second
commission of maid of honor."

"Good! for whom? Is Montalais doubled then?"

"Vile fellow! -- It is you who are doubled. You swallow up
two fortunes -- mine, and that of M. le Comte de Guiche."

"You should say, that of M. le Comte de Guiche and yours."

"That is true; honor where it is due; but I return to my
brevet."

"And you are wrong."

"Prove me that."

"My friend, there will only be twelve maids of honor for
madame, I have already obtained for you what twelve hundred
women are trying for, and for that I was forced to employ
all my diplomacy."

"Oh! yes, I know you have been quite heroic, my dear
friend."

"We know what we are about," said Manicamp.

"To whom do you tell that? When I am king, I promise you one
thing."

"What? To call yourself Malicorne the first?"

"No; to make you superintendent of my finances; but that is
not the question now."

"Unfortunately."

"The present affair is to procure for me a second place of
maid of honor."

"My friend, if you were to promise me the price of heaven, I
would decline to disturb myself at this moment." Malicorne
chinked the money in his pocket.

"There are twenty pistoles here," said Malicorne.

"And what would you do with twenty pistoles, mon Dieu!"

"Well!" said Malicorne, a little angrily, "suppose I were to
add them to the five hundred you already owe me?"

"You are right," replied Manicamp, stretching out his hand
again, "and from that point of view I can accept them. Give
them to me."

"An instant, what the devil! it is not only holding out your
hand that will do; if I give you the twenty pistoles, shall
I have my brevet?"

"To be sure you shall."

"Soon?"

"To-day."

"Oh! take care! Monsieur de Manicamp; you undertake much,
and I do not ask that. Thirty leagues in a day is too much,
you would kill yourself."

"I think nothing impossible when obliging a friend."

"You are quite heroic."

"Where are the twenty pistoles?"

"Here they are," said Malicorne, showing them.

"That's well."

"Yes, but my dear M. Manicamp, you would consume them in
post-horses alone!"

"No, no, make yourself easy on that score."

"Pardon me. Why, it is fifteen leagues from this place to
Etampes?"

"Fourteen."

"Well! fourteen be it; fourteen leagues makes seven posts;
at twenty sous the post, seven livres; seven livres the
courier, fourteen; as many for coming back, twenty-eight! as
much for bed and supper, that makes sixty livres this
complaisance would cost."

Manicamp stretched himself like a serpent in his bed, and
fixing his two great eyes upon Malicorne, "You are right,"
said he; "I could not return before to-morrow;" and he took
the twenty pistoles.

"Now, then, be off!"

"Well, as I cannot be back before to-morrow. we have time."

"Time for what?"

"Time to play."

"What do you wish to play with?

"Your twenty pistoles, pardieu!"

"No; you always win."

"I will wager them, then."

"Against what?"

"Against twenty others."

"And what shall be the object of the wager?"

"This. We have said it was fourteen leagues to Etampes?"

"Yes."

"And fourteen leagues back?

"Doubtless."

"Well; for these twenty-eight leagues you cannot allow less
than fourteen hours?"

"That is agreed."

"One hour to find the Comte de Guiche.

"Go on."

"And an hour to persuade him to write a letter to Monsieur."

"Just so."

"Sixteen hours in all?"

"You reckon as well as M. Colbert."

"It is now twelve o'clock."

"Half-past."

"Hein! -- you have a handsome watch!"

"What were you saying?" said Malicorne, putting his watch
quickly back into his fob.

"Ah! true; I was offering to lay you twenty pistoles against
these you have lent me, that you will have the Comte de
Guiche's letter in ---- "

"How soon?"

"In eight hours."

"Have you a winged horse, then?"

"That is no matter. Will you bet?"

"I shall have the comte's letter in eight hours?"

"Yes."

"In hand?"

"In hand."

"Well, be it so; I lay," said Malicorne, curious to know how
this seller of clothes would get through.

"Is it agreed?"

"It is."

"Pass me the pen, ink, and paper.

"Here they are."

"Thank you."

Manicamp raised himself with a sigh, and leaning on his left
elbow, in his best hand, traced the following lines: --



"Good for an order for a place of maid of honor to Madame,
which M. le Comte de Guiche will take upon him to obtain at
sight.

"De Manicamp."



This painful task accomplished, he laid himself down in bed
again.

"Well!" asked Malicorne, "what does this mean?"

"That means that if you are in a hurry to have the letter
from the Comte de Guiche for Monsieur, I have won my wager."

"How the devil is that?"

"That is transparent enough, I think; you take that paper."

"Well?"

"And you set out instead of me."

"Ah!"

"You put your horses to their best speed."

"Good!"

"In six hours you will be at Etampes; in seven hours you
have the letter from the comte, and I shall have won my
wager without stirring from my bed, which suits me and you
too, at the same time, I am very sure."

"Decidedly, Manicamp, you are a great man."

"Hein! I know that."

"I am to start then for Etampes?"

"Directly."

"I am to go to the Comte de Guiche with this order?"

"He will give you a similar one for Monsieur."

"Monsieur will approve?"

"Instantly."

"And I shall have my brevet?"

"You will."

"Ah!"

"Well, I hope I behave genteely?"

"Adorably."

"Thank you."

"You do as you please, then, with the Comte de Guiche,
Malicorne?"

"Except making money of him -- everything?"

"Diable! the exception is annoying; but then, if instead of
asking him for money, you were to ask ---- "

"What?"

"Something important."

"What do you call important?"

"Well! suppose one of your friends asked you to render him a
service?"

"I would not render it to him."

"Selfish fellow!"

"Or at least I would ask him what service he would render me
in exchange."

"Ah! that, perhaps, is fair. Well, that friend speaks to
you."

"What, you, Malicorne?"

"Yes; I."

"Ah! ah! you are rich, then?"

"I have still fifty pistoles left."

"Exactly the sum I want. Where are those fifty pistoles?"

"Here," said Malicorne, slapping his pocket.

"Then speak, my friend; what do you want?"

Malicorne took up the pen, ink, and paper again, and
presented them all to Manicamp. "Write!" said he.

"Dictate!"

"An order for a place in the household of Monsieur."

"Oh!" said Manicamp, laying down the pen, "a place in the
household of Monsieur for fifty pistoles?"

"You mistook me, my friend; you did not hear plainly."

"What did you say, then?"

"I said five hundred."

"And the five hundred?"

"Here they are."

Manicamp devoured the rouleau with his eyes; but this time
Malicorne held it at a distance.

"Eh! what do you say to that? Five hundred pistoles."

"I say it is for nothing, my friend," said Manicamp, taking
up the pen again, "and you exhaust my credit. Dictate."

Malicorne continued:

"Which my friend the Comte de Guiche will obtain for my
friend Malicorne."

"That's it," said Manicamp.

"Pardon me, you have forgotten to sign."

"Ah! that is true. The five hundred pistoles?"

"Here are two hundred and fifty of them."

"And the other two hundred and fifty?"

"When I am in possession of my place."

Manicamp made a face.

"In that case give me the recommendation back again."

"What to do?"

"To add two words to it."

"Two words?"

"Yes, two words only."

"What are they?"

"In haste."

Malicorne returned the recommendation; Manicamp added the
words.

"Good," said Malicorne, taking back the paper.

Manicamp began to count out the pistoles.

"There want twenty," said he.

"How so?"

"The twenty I have won."

"In what way?"

"By laying that you would have the letter from the Comte de
Guiche in eight hours."

"Ah! that's fair," and he gave him the twenty pistoles.

Manicamp began to scoop up his gold by handfuls, and pour it
in cascades upon his bed.

"This second place," murmured Malicorne, whilst drying his
paper, "which, at the first glance appears to cost me more
than the first, but ---- " He stopped, took up the pen in
his turn, and wrote to Montalais: --



"Mademoiselle, -- Announce to your friend that her
commission will not be long before it arrives; I am setting
out to get it signed: that will be twenty-eight leagues I
shall have gone for the love of you."



Then with his sardonic smile, taking up the interrupted
sentence: -- "This place," said he, "at the first glance,
appears to cost more than the first; but -- the benefit will
be, I hope, in proportion with the expense, and Mademoiselle
de la Valliere will bring me back more than Mademoiselle de
Montalais, or else, -- or else my name is not Malicorne.
Farewell, Manicamp," and he left the room.




CHAPTER 81

The Courtyard of the Hotel Grammont



On Malicorne's arrival at Orleans, he was informed that the
Comte de Guiche had just set out for Paris. Malicorne rested
himself for a couple of hours, and then prepared to continue
his journey. He reached Paris during the night, and alighted
at a small hotel, where, in his previous journeys to the
capital, he had been accustomed to put up, and at eight
o'clock the next morning presented himself at the Hotel
Grammont. Malicorne arrived just in time, for the Comte de
Guiche was on the point of taking leave of Monsieur before
setting out for Havre, where the principal members of the
French nobility had gone to await Madame's arrival from
England. Malicorne pronounced the name of Manicamp and was
immediately admitted. He found the Comte de Guiche in the
courtyard of the Hotel Grammont, inspecting his horses,
which his trainers and equerries were passing in review
before him. The count, in the presence of his tradespeople
and of his servants, was engaged in praising or blaming, as
the case seemed to deserve, the appointments, horses, and
harness that were being submitted to him; when, in the midst
of this important occupation, the name of Manicamp was
announced.

"Manicamp!" he exclaimed, "let him enter by all means." And
he advanced a few steps toward the door.

Malicorne slipped through the half-open door, and looking at
the Comte de Guiche, who was surprised to see a face he did
not recognize, instead of the one he expected, said:
"Forgive me, monsieur le comte, but I believe a mistake has
been made. M. Manicamp himself was announced to you, instead
of which it is only an envoy from him."

"Ah!" exclaimed De Guiche, coldly, "and what do you bring
me?"

"A letter, monsieur le comte." Malicorne handed him the
first document, and narrowly watched the count's face, who,
as he read it began to laugh.

"What!" he exclaimed, "another maid of honor? Are all the
maids of honor in France, then, under his protection?"

Malicorne bowed. "Why does he not come himself?" he
inquired.

"He is confined to his bed."

"The deuce! he has no money then, I suppose," said De
Guiche, shrugging his shoulders. "What does he do with his
money?"

Malicorne made a movement, to indicate that upon this
subject he was as ignorant as the count himself. "Why does
he not make use of his credit, then?" continued De Guiche.

"With regard to that, I think ---- "

"What?"

"That Manicamp has credit with no one but yourself, monsieur
le comte!"

"He will not be at Havre, then?" Whereupon Malicorne made
another movement.

"But every one will be there."

"I trust, monsieur le comte, that he will not neglect so
excellent an opportunity."

"He should be at Paris by this time."

"He will take the direct road perhaps to make up for lost
time."

"Where is he now?"

"At Orleans."

"Monsieur," said De Guiche, "you seem to me a man of very
good taste."

Malicorne was wearing some of Manicamp's old-new clothes. He
bowed in return, saying, "You do me a very great honor,
monsieur le comte."

"Whom have I the pleasure of addressing?"

"My name is Malicorne, monsieur."

"M. de Malicorne, what do you think of these
pistol-holsters?"

Malicorne was a man of great readiness, and immediately
understood the position of affairs. Besides, the "de" which
had been prefixed to his name, raised him to the rank of the
person with whom he was conversing. He looked at the
holsters with the air of a connoisseur and said, without
hesitation: "Somewhat heavy, monsieur."

"You see," said De Guiche to the saddler, "this gentleman,
who understands these matters well, thinks the holsters
heavy, a complaint I had already made." The saddler was full
of excuses.

"What do you think," asked De Guiche, "of this horse, which
I have just purchased?"

"To look at it, it seems perfect, monsieur le comte; but I
must mount it before I give you my opinion."

"Do so, M. de Malicorne, and ride him round the court two or
three times."

The courtyard of the hotel was so arranged, that whenever
there was any occasion for it, it could be used as a
riding-school. Malicorne, with perfect ease, arranged the
bridle and snaffle-reins, placed his left hand on the
horse's mane, and, with his foot in the stirrup, raised
himself and seated himself in the saddle. At first, he made
the horse walk the whole circuit of the court-yard at a
foot-pace; next at a trot; lastly at a gallop. He then drew
up close to the count, dismounted, and threw the bridle to a
groom standing by. "Well," said the count, "what do you
think of it, M. de Malicorne?"

"This horse, monsieur le comte, is of the Mecklenburg breed.
In looking whether the bit suited his mouth, I saw that he
was rising seven, the very age when the training of a horse
intended for a charger should commence. The forehand is
light. A horse which holds its head high, it is said, never
tires his rider's hand. The withers are rather low. The
drooping of the hindquarters would almost make me doubt the
purity of its German breed, and I think there is English
blood in him. He stands well on his legs, but he trots high,
and may cut himself, which requires attention to be paid to
his shoeing. He is tractable; and as I made him turn round
and change his feet, I found him quick and ready in doing
so."

"Well said, M. de Malicorne," exclaimed the comte; "you are
a judge of horses, I perceive;" then, turning towards him
again, he continued, "You are most becomingly dressed, M. de
Malicorne. That is not a provincial cut, I presume. Such a
style of dress is not to be met with at Tours or Orleans."

"No, monsieur le comte; my clothes were made at Paris."

"There is no doubt about that. But let us resume our own
affair. Manicamp wishes for the appointment of a second maid
of honor."

"You perceive what he has written, monsieur le comte."

"For whom was the first appointment?"

Malicorne felt the color rise in his face as he answered
hurriedly.

"A charming maid of honor, Mademoiselle de Montalais."

"Ah, ah! you are acquainted with her?"

"We are affianced, or nearly so."

"That is quite another thing, then; a thousand compliments,"
exclaimed De Guiche, upon whose lips a courtier's jest was
already fitting, but to whom the word "affianced," addressed
by Malicorne with respect to Mademoiselle de Montalais,
recalled the respect due to women.

"And for whom is the second appointment destined?" asked De
Guiche, "is it for anyone to whom Manicamp may happen to be
affianced? In that case I pity her, poor girl! for she will
have a sad fellow for a husband."

"No, monsieur le comte, the second appointment is for
Mademoiselle de la Baume le Blanc de la Valliere."

"Unknown," said De Guiche.

"Unknown? yes, monsieur," said Malicorne, smiling in his
turn.

"Very good. I will speak to Monsieur about it. By the by,
she is of gentle birth?"

"She belongs to a very good family and is maid of honor to
Madame."

"That's well. Will you accompany me to Monsieur?"

"Most certainly, if I may be permitted the honor."

"Have you your carriage?"

"No; I came here on horseback."

"Dressed as you are?"

"No, monsieur; I posted from Orleans, and I changed my
traveling suit for the one I have on, in order to present
myself to you."

"True, you already told me you had come from Orleans;"
saying which he crumpled Manicamp's letter in his hand, and
thrust it in his pocket.

"I beg your pardon," said Malicorne, timidly; "but I do not
think you have read all."

"Not read all, do you say?"

"No, there were two letters in the same envelope."

"Oh! are you sure?"

"Quite sure."

"Let us look, then," said the count, as he opened the letter
again.

"Ah! you are right," he said, opening the paper which he had
not yet read.

"I suspected it," he continued -- "another application for
an appointment under Monsieur. This Manicamp is a regular
vampire: -- he is carrying on a trade in it."

"No, monsieur le comte, he wishes to make a present of it."

"To whom?"

"To myself, monsieur."

"Why did you not say so at once, my dear M. Mauvaisecorne?"

"Malicorne, monsieur le comte."

"Forgive me; it is the Latin that bothers me -- that
terrible mine of etymologies. Why the deuce are young men of
family taught Latin? Mala and mauvaise -- you understand it
is the same thing. You will forgive me, I trust, M. de
Malicorne."

"Your kindness affects me much, monsieur: but it is a reason
why I should make you acquainted with one circumstance
without any delay."

"What is it?"

"That I was not born a gentleman. I am not without courage,
and not altogether deficient in ability; but my name is
Malicorne simply."

"You appear to me, monsieur!" exclaimed the count, looking
at the astute face of his companion, "to be a most agreeable
man. Your face pleases me, M. Malicorne, and you must
possess some indisputably excellent qualities to have
pleased that egotistical Manicamp. Be candid, and tell me
whether you are not some saint descended upon the earth."

"Why so?"

"For the simple reason that he makes you a present of
anything. Did you not say that he intended to make you a
present of some appointment in the king's house

"I beg your pardon, count; but, if I succeed in obtaining
the appointment, you, and not he, will have bestowed it on
me."

"Besides, he will not have given it to you for nothing, I
suppose. Stay, I have it; -- there is a Malicorne at
Orleans, who lends money to the prince."

"I think that must be my father, monsieur."

"Ah! the prince has the father, and that terrible dragon of
a Manicamp has the son. Take care, monsieur, I know him. He
will fleece you completely."

"The only difference is, that I lend without interest," said
Malicorne, smiling.

"I was correct in saying you were either a saint or very
much resembled one. M. Malicorne, you shall have the post
you want, or I will forfeit my name."

"Ah! monsieur le comte, what a debt of gratitude shall I not
owe you?" said Malicorne, transported.

"Let us go to the prince, my dear M. Malicorne." And De
Guiche proceeded toward the door, desiring Malicorne to
follow him. At the very moment they were about to cross the
threshold, a young man appeared on the other side. He was
from twenty-four to twenty-five years of age, of pale
complexion, bright eyes and brown hair and eyebrows.

"Good-day," he said, suddenly, almost pushing De Guiche back
into the courtyard again.

"Is that you, De Wardes? -- What! and booted, spurred, and
whip in hand, too?"

"The most befitting costume for a man about to set off for
Havre. There will be no one left in Paris tomorrow." And
hereupon he saluted Malicorne with great ceremony, whose
handsome dress gave him the appearance of a prince.

"M. Malicorne," said De Guiche to his friend. De Wardes
bowed.

"M. de Wardes," said Guiche to Malicorne, who bowed in
return. "By the by, De Wardes," continued De Guiche, "you
who are so well acquainted with these matters, can you tell
us, probably, what appointments are still vacant at the
court; or rather in the prince's household?"

"In the prince's household," said De Wardes, looking up with
an air of consideration, "let me see -- the appointment of
the master of the horse is vacant, I believe."

"Oh," said Malicorne, "there is no question of such a post
as that, monsieur; my ambition is not nearly so exalted."

De Wardes had a more penetrating observation than De Guiche,
and fathomed Malicorne immediately. "The fact is," he said,
looking at him from head to foot, "a man must be either a
duke or a peer to fill that post."

"All I solicit," said Malicorne, "is a very humble
appointment; I am of little importance, and I do not rank
myself above my position."

"M. Malicorne, whom you see here," said De Guiche to De
Wardes, "is a very excellent fellow, whose only misfortune
is that of not being of gentle birth. As far as I am
concerned, you know, I attach little value to those who have
but gentle birth to boast of."

"Assuredly," said De Wardes; "but will you allow me to
remark, my dear count, that, without rank of some sort, one
can hardly hope to belong to his royal highness's
household?"

"You are right," said the count, "court etiquette is
absolute. The devil! -- we never so much as gave it a
thought."

"Alas! a sad misfortune for me, monsieur le comte," said
Malicorne, changing color.

"Yet not without remedy, I hope," returned De Guiche.

"The remedy is found easily enough," exclaimed De Wardes;
"you can be created a gentleman. His Eminence, the Cardinal
Mazarin, did nothing else from morning till night"

"Hush, hush, De Wardes," said the count; "no jests of that
kind; it ill becomes us to turn such matters into ridicule.
Letters of nobility, it is true, are purchasable; but that
is a sufficient misfortune without the nobles themselves
laughing at it."

"Upon my word, De Guiche, you're quite a Puritan, as the
English say."

At this moment the Vicomte de Bragelonne was announced by
one of the servants in the courtyard, in precisely the same
manner as he would have done in a room.

"Come here, my dear Raoul. What! you, too, booted and
spurred? You are setting off, then?"

Bragelonne approached the group of young men, and saluted
them with that quiet and serious manner peculiar to him. His
salutation was principally addressed to De Wardes, with whom
he was unacquainted, and whose features, on his perceiving
Raoul, had assumed a strange sternness of expression. "I
have come, De Guiche," he said, "to ask your companionship.
We set off for Havre, I presume."

"This is admirable -- delightful. We shall have a most
enjoyable journey. M. Malicorne, M. Bragelonne -- ah! M. de
Wardes, let me present you." The young men saluted each
other in a restrained manner. Their very natures seemed,
from the beginning, disposed to take exception to each
other. De Wardes was pliant, subtle, full of dissimulation;
Raoul was calm, grave, and upright. "Decide between us --
between De Wardes and myself, Raoul."

"Upon what subject?"

"Upon the subject of noble birth."

"Who can be better informed on that subject than a De
Grammont?"

"No compliments; it is your opinion I ask."

"At least, inform me of the subject under discussion."

"De Wardes asserts that the distribution of titles is
abused; I, on the contrary, maintain that a title is useless
to the man on whom it is bestowed."

"And you are correct," said Bragelonne, quietly.

"But, monsieur le vicomte," interrupted De Wardes, with a
kind of obstinacy, "I affirm that it is I who am correct."

"What was your opinion, monsieur?"

"I was saying that everything is done in France at the
present moment to humiliate men of family."

"And by whom?"

"By the king himself. He surrounds himself with people who
cannot show four quarterings."

"Nonsense," said De Guiche, "where could you possibly have
seen that, De Wardes?"

"One example will suffice," he returned, directing his look
fully upon Raoul.

"State it then."

"Do you know who has just been nominated captain-general of
the musketeers? -- an appointment more valuable than a
peerage; for it gives precedence over all the marechals of
France."

Raoul's color mounted in his face; for he saw the object De
Wardes had in view. "No; who has been appointed? In any case
it must have been very recently, for the appointment was
vacant eight days ago; a proof of which is, that the king
refused Monsieur, who solicited the post for one of his
proteges."

"Well, the king refused it to Monsieur's protege, in order
to bestow it upon the Chevalier d'Artagnan, a younger
brother of some Gascon family, who has been trailing his
sword in the ante-chambers during the last thirty years."

"Forgive me if I interrupt you," said Raoul, darting a
glance full of severity at De Wardes; "but you give me the
impression of being unacquainted with the gentleman of whom
you are speaking."

"I not acquainted with M. d'Artagnan? Can you tell me,
monsieur, who does not know him?"

"Those who do know him, monsieur," replied Raoul with still
greater calmness and sternness of manner, "are in the habit
of saying, that if he is not as good a gentleman as the king
-- which is not his fault -- he is the equal of all the
kings of the earth in courage and loyalty. Such is my
opinion, monsieur, and I thank heaven I have known M.
d'Artagnan from my birth."

De Wardes was about to reply, when De Guiche interrupted
him.




CHAPTER 82

The Portrait of Madame



The discussion was becoming full of bitterness. De Guiche
perfectly understood the whole matter for there was in
Bragelonne's face a look instinctively hostile, while in
that of De Wardes there was something like a determination
to offend. Without inquiring into the different feelings
which actuated his two friends, De Guiche resolved to ward
off the blow which he felt was on the point of being dealt
by one of them, and perhaps by both. "Gentlemen," he said,
"we must take our leave of each other, I must pay a visit to
Monsieur. You, De Wardes, will accompany me to the Louvre,
and you Raoul, will remain here master of the house; and as
all that is done here is under your advice, you will bestow
the last glance upon my preparations for departure."

Raoul, with the air of one who neither seeks nor fears a
quarrel, bowed his head in token of assent, and seated
himself upon a bench in the sun. "That is well," said De
Guiche, "remain where you are, Raoul, and tell them to show
you the two horses I have just purchased; you will give me
your opinion, for I only bought them on condition that you
ratified the purchase. By the by, I have to beg your pardon
for having omitted to inquire after the Comte de la Fere."
While pronouncing these latter words, he closely observed De
Wardes, in order to perceive what effect the name of Raoul's
father would produce upon him. "I thank you," answered the
young man, "the count is very well." A gleam of deep hatred
passed into De Wardes' eyes. De Guiche, who appeared not to
notice the foreboding expression, went up to Raoul, and
grasping him by the hand, said, -- "It is agreed, then,
Bragelonne, is it not, that you will rejoin us in the
courtyard of the Palais-Royal?" He then signed to De Wardes
to follow him who had been engaged in balancing himself
first on one foot, then on the other. "We are going," said
he, "come, M. Malicorne." This name made Raoul start; for it
seemed that he had already heard it pronounced before, but
he could not remember on what occasion. While trying to
recall it half-dreamily, yet half-irritated at his
conversation with De Wardes, the three young men set out on
their way towards the Palais-Royal, where Monsieur was
residing. Malicorne learned two things; the first, that the
young men had something to say to each other, and the
second, that he ought not to walk in the same line with
them; and therefore he walked behind. "Are you mad?" said De
Guiche to his companion, as soon as they had left the Hotel
de Grammont; "you attack M. d'Artagnan, and that, too,
before Raoul."

"Well," said De Wardes, "what then?"

"What do you mean by `what then?'"

"Certainly, is there any prohibition against attacking M.
d'Artagnan?"

"But you know very well that M. d'Artagnan was one of those
celebrated and terrible four men who were called the
musketeers."

"That they may be, but I do not perceive why, on that
account, I should be forbidden to hate M. d'Artagnan."

"What cause has he given you?"

"Me! personally, none."

"Why hate him, therefore?"

"Ask my dead father that question."

"Really, my dear De Wardes, you surprise me. M. d'Artagnan
is not one to leave unsettled any enmity he may have to
arrange, without completely clearing his account. Your
father, I have heard, on his side, carried matters with a
high hand. Moreover there are no enmities so bitter that
they cannot be washed away by blood, by a good sword-thrust
loyally given."

"Listen to me, my dear De Guiche, this inveterate dislike
existed between my father and M. d'Artagnan, and when I was
quite a child, he acquainted me with the reason for it, and,
as forming part of my inheritance, I regard it as a
particular legacy bestowed upon me."

"And does his hatred concern M. d'Artagnan alone?"

"As for that, M. d'Artagnan was so intimately associated
with his three friends, that some portion of the full
measure of my hatred falls to their lot, and that hatred is
of such a nature, whenever the opportunity occurs, they
shall have no occasion to complain of their allowance."

De Guiche had kept his eyes fixed on De Wardes, and
shuddered at the bitter manner in which the young man
smiled. Something like a presentiment flashed across his
mind; he knew that the time had passed away for grands coups
entre gentilshommes; but that the feeling of hatred
treasured up in the mind, instead of being diffused abroad,
was still hatred all the same; that a smile was sometimes as
full of meaning as a threat; and, in a word, that to the
fathers who had hated with their hearts and fought with
their arms, would now succeed the sons, who would indeed
hate with their hearts, but would no longer combat their
enemies, save by means of intrigue or treachery. As,
therefore, it certainly was not Raoul whom he could suspect
either of intrigue or treachery, it was on Raoul's account
that De Guiche trembled. However, while these gloomy
forebodings cast a shade of anxiety over De Guiche's
countenance, De Wardes had resumed the entire mastery over
himself.

"At all events," he observed, "I have no personal ill-will
towards M. de Bragelonne; I do not know him even."

"In any case," said De Guiche, with a certain amount of
severity in his tone of voice, "do not forget one
circumstance, that Raoul is my most intimate friend;" a
remark at which De Wardes bowed.

The conversation terminated there, although De Guiche tried
his utmost to draw out his secret from him; but, doubtless,
De Wardes had determined to say nothing further, and he
remained impenetrable. De Guiche therefore promised himself
a more satisfactory result with Raoul. In the meantime they
had reached the Palais-Royal, which was surrounded by a
crowd of lookers-on. The household belonging to Monsieur
awaited his command to mount their horses, in order to form
part of the escort of the ambassadors, to whom had been
intrusted the care of bringing the young princess to Paris.
The brilliant display of horses, arms, and rich liveries,
afforded some compensation in those times, thanks to the
kindly feelings of the people, and to the traditions of deep
devotion to their sovereigns, for the enormous expenses
charged upon the taxes. Mazarin had said: "Let them sing,
provided they pay;" while Louis XIV.'s remark was, "Let them
look." Sight had replaced the voice; the people could still
look, but they were no longer allowed to sing. De Guiche
left De Wardes and Malicorne at the bottom of the grand
staircase, while he himself, who shared the favor and good
graces of Monsieur with the Chevalier de Lorraine, who
always smiled at him most affectionately, though he could
not endure him, went straight to the prince's apartments,
whom he found engaged in admiring himself in the glass, and
rouging his face. In a corner of the cabinet, the Chevalier
de Lorraine was extended full length upon some cushions,
having just had his long hair curled, with which he was
playing in the same manner a woman would have done. The
prince turned round as the count entered, and perceiving who
it was, said:

"Ah! is that you, Guiche, come here and tell me the truth."

"You know, my lord, it is one of my defects to speak the
truth."

"You will hardly believe, De Guiche, how that wicked
chevalier has annoyed me."

The chevalier shrugged his shoulders.

"Why, he pretends," continued the prince, "that Mademoiselle
Henrietta is better looking as a woman than I am as a man."

"Do not forget, my lord," said De Guiche, frowning slightly,
"you require me to speak the truth?"

"Certainly," said the prince, tremblingly.

"Well, and I shall tell it you."

"Do not be in a hurry, Guiche," exclaimed the prince, "you
have plenty of time; look at me attentively, and try to
recollect Madame. Besides, her portrait is here. Look at
it." And he held out to him a miniature of the finest
possible execution. De Guiche took it, and looked at it for
a long time attentively.

"Upon my honor, my lord, this is indeed a most lovely face."

"But look at me, count, look at me," said the prince
endeavoring to direct upon himself the attention of the
count, who was completely absorbed in contemplation of the
portrait.

"It is wonderful," murmured Guiche.

"Really one would almost imagine you had never seen the
young lady before."

"It is true, my lord, I have seen her, but it was five years
ago; there is a great difference between a child twelve
years old and a girl of seventeen."

"Well, what is your opinion?"

"My opinion is that the portrait must be flattering, my
lord."

"Of that," said the prince triumphantly, "there can be no
doubt, but let us suppose that it is not, what would your
opinion be?"

"My lord, that your highness is exceedingly happy to have so
charming a bride."

"Very well, that is your opinion of her, but of me?"

"My opinion, my lord, is that you are too handsome for a
man."

The Chevalier de Lorraine burst out laughing. The prince
understood how severe towards himself this opinion of the
Comte de Guiche was, and he looked somewhat displeased,
saying, "My friends are not over indulgent." De Guiche
looked at the portrait again, and, after lengthened
contemplation, returned it with apparent unwillingness,
saying, "Most decidedly, my lord, I should rather prefer to
look ten times at your highness, than to look at Madame once
again." It seemed as if the chevalier had detected some
mystery in these words, which were incomprehensible to the
prince, for he exclaimed: "Very well, get married yourself."
Monsieur continued painting himself, and when he had
finished, looked at the portrait again once more, turned to
admire himself in the glass, and smiled, and no doubt was
satisfied with the comparison. "You are very kind to have
come," he said to Guiche, "I feared you would leave without
bidding me adieu."

"Your highness knows me too well to believe me capable of so
great a disrespect."

"Besides, I suppose you have something to ask from me before
leaving Paris?"

"Your highness has indeed guessed correctly, for I have a
request to make."

"Very good, what is it?"

The Chevalier de Lorraine immediately displayed the greatest
attention, for he regarded every favor conferred upon
another as a robbery committed against himself. And, as
Guiche hesitated, the prince said: "If it be money, nothing
could be more fortunate, for I am in funds; the
superintendent of the finances has sent me 500,000
pistoles."

"I thank your highness; but it is not an affair of money."

"What is it, then? Tell me."

"The appointment of a maid of honor."

"Oh! oh! Guiche, what a protector you have become of young
ladies," said the prince, "you never speak of any one else
now!"

The Chevalier de Lorraine smiled, for he knew very well that
nothing displeased the prince more than to show any interest
in ladies. "My lord," said the comte, "it is not I who am
directly interested in the lady of whom I have just spoken;
I am acting on behalf of one of my friends."

"Ah! that is different; what is the name of the young lady
in whom your friend is interested?"

"Mlle. de la Baume le Blanc de la Valliere; she is already
maid of honor to the dowager princess."

"Why, she is lame," said the Chevalier de Lorraine,
stretching himself on his cushions.

"Lame," repeated the prince, "and Madame to have her
constantly before her eyes? Most certainly not; it may be
dangerous for her when in an interesting condition."

The Chevalier de Lorraine burst out laughing.

"Chevalier," said Guiche, "your conduct is ungenerous; while
I am soliciting a favor, you do me all the mischief you
can."

"Forgive me, comte," said the Chevalier de Lorraine,
somewhat uneasy at the tone in which Guiche had made his
remark, "but I had no intention of doing so, and I begin to
believe that I have mistaken one young lady for another."

"There is no doubt of it, monsieur; and I do not hesitate to
declare that such is the case."

"Do you attach much importance to it, Guiche?" inquired the
prince.

"I do, my lord."

"Well, you shall have it, but ask me for no more
appointments, for there are none to give away."

"Ah!" exclaimed the chevalier, "midday already, that is the
hour fixed for the departure."

"You dismiss me, monsieur?" inquired Guiche.

"Really, count, you treat me very ill to-day," replied the
chevalier.

"For heaven's sake, count, for heaven's sake, chevalier,"
said Monsieur, "do you not see how you are distressing me?"

"Your highness's signature?" said Guiche.

"Take a blank appointment from that drawer, and give it to
me." Guiche handed the prince the document indicated, and at
the same time presented him with a pen already dipped in
ink; whereupon the prince signed. "Here," he said, returning
him the appointment, "but I give it on one condition."

"Name it."

"That you make friends with the chevalier."

"Willingly," said Guiche. And he held out his hand to the
chevalier with an indifference amounting to contempt.

"Adieu, count," said the chevalier, without seeming in any
way to have noticed the count's slight; "adieu, and bring us
back a princess who will not talk with her own portrait too
much."

"Yes, set off and lose no time. By the by, who accompany
you?"

"Bragelonne and De Wardes."

"Both excellent and fearless companions."

"Too fearless," said the chevalier; "endeavor to bring them
both back, count."

"A bad heart, bad!" murmured De Guiche; "he scents mischief
everywhere, and sooner than anything else." And taking leave
of the prince, he quitted the apartment. As soon as he
reached the vestibule, he waved in the air the paper which
the prince had signed. Malicorne hurried forward, and
received it, trembling with delight. When, however, he held
it in his hand Guiche observed that he still awaited
something further.

"Patience, monsieur," he said; "the Chevalier de Lorraine
was there, and I feared an utter failure if I asked too much
at once. Wait until I return. Adieu."

"Adieu, monsieur le comte; a thousand thanks," said
Malicorne.

"Send Manicamp to me. By the way, monsieur, is it true that
Mlle. de la Valliere is lame?" As he said this a horse drew
up behind him, and on turning round he noticed that
Bragelonne, who had just at that moment entered the
courtyard, turned suddenly pale. The poor lover had heard
the remark, which, however, was not the case with Malicorne,
for he was already beyond the reach of the count's voice.

"Why is Louise's name spoken of here?" said Raoul to
himself; "oh! let not De Wardes, who stands smiling yonder,
even say a word about her in my presence."

"Now, gentlemen," exclaimed the Comte de Guiche, "prepare to
start."

At this moment the prince, who had completed his toilette,
appeared at the window, and was immediately saluted by the
acclamations of all who composed the escort, and ten minutes
afterwards, banners, scarfs, and feathers were fluttering
and waving in the air, as the cavalcade galloped away.




CHAPTER 83

Havre



This brilliant and animated company, the members of which
were inspired by various feelings, arrived at Havre four
days after their departure from Paris. It was about five
o'clock in the afternoon, and no intelligence had yet been
received of Madame. They were soon engaged in quest of
apartments; but the greatest confusion immediately ensued
among the masters, and violent quarrels among their
attendants. In the midst of this disorder, the Comte de
Guiche fancied he recognized Manicamp. It was, indeed,
Manicamp himself; but as Malicorne had taken possession of
his very best costume, he had not been able to get any other
than a suit of violet velvet trimmed with silver. Guiche
recognized him as much by his dress as by his features, for
he had very frequently seen Manicamp in his violet suit,
which was his last resource. Manicamp presented himself to
the count under an arch of torches, which set in a blaze,
rather than illuminated, the gate by which Havre is entered,
and which is situated close to the tower of Francis I. The
count, remarking the woe-begone expression of Manicamp's
face, could not resist laughing. "Well, my poor Manicamp,"
he exclaimed, "how violet you look; are you in mourning?"

"Yes," replied Manicamp; "I am in mourning."

"For whom, or for what?"

"For my blue-and-gold suit, which has disappeared, and in
the place of which I could find nothing but this; and I was
even obliged to economize from compulsion, in order to get
possession of it."

"Indeed?"

"It is singular you should be astonished at that, since you
leave me without any money."

"At all events, here you are, and that is the principal
thing."

"By the most horrible roads."

"Where are you lodging?"

"Lodging?"

"Yes!"

"I am not lodging anywhere."

De Guiche began to laugh. "Well," said he, "where do you
intend to lodge?"

"In the same place you do."

"But I don't know, myself."

"What do you mean by saying you don't know?"

"Certainly, how is it likely I should know where I should
stay?"

"Have you not retained an hotel?"

"I?"

"Yes, you or the prince."

"Neither of us has thought of it. Havre is of considerable
size, I suppose; and provided I can get a stable for a dozen
horses, and a suitable house in a good quarter ---- "

"Certainly, there are some very excellent houses."

"Well then ---- "

"But not for us."

"What do you mean by saying not for us? -- for whom, then?"

"For the English, of course."

"For the English?"

"Yes; the houses are all taken."

"By whom?"

"By the Duke of Buckingham."

"I beg your pardon?" said Guiche, whose attention this name
had awakened.

"Yes, by the Duke of Buckingham. His Grace was preceded by a
courier, who arrived here three days ago, and immediately
retained all the houses fit for habitation the town
possesses."

"Come, come, Manicamp, let us understand each other."

"Well, what I have told you is clear enough, it seems to
me."

"But surely Buckingham does not occupy the whole of Havre?"

"He certainly does not occupy it, since he has not yet
arrived; but, once disembarked, he will occupy it."

"Oh! oh!"

"It is quite clear you are not acquainted with the English;
they have a perfect rage for monopolizing everything."

"That may be; but a man who has the whole of one house, is
satisfied with it, and does not require two."

"Yes, but two men?"

"Be it so; for two men, two houses, or four or six, or ten,
if you like; but there are a hundred houses at Havre."

"Yes, and all the hundred are let."

"Impossible!"

"What an obstinate fellow you are. I tell you Buckingham has
hired all the houses surrounding the one which the queen
dowager of England and the princess her daughter will
inhabit."

"He is singular enough, indeed," said De Wardes, caressing
his horse's neck.

"Such is the case, however, monsieur."

"You are quite sure of it, Monsieur de Manicamp?" and as he
put this question, he looked slyly at De Guiche, as though
to interrogate him upon the degree of confidence to be
placed in his friend's state of mind. During this discussion
the night had closed in, and the torches, pages, attendants,
squires, horses, and carriages, blocked up the gate and the
open place; the torches were reflected in the channel, which
the rising tide was gradually filling, while on the other
side of the jetty might be noticed groups of curious
lookers-on, consisting of sailors and townspeople, who
seemed anxious to miss nothing of the spectacle. Amidst all
this hesitation of purpose, Bragelonne, as though a perfect
stranger to the scene, remained on his horse somewhat in the
rear of Guiche, and watched the rays of light reflected on
the water, inhaling with rapture the sea breezes, and
listening to the waves which noisily broke upon the shore
and on the beach, tossing the spray into the air with a
noise that echoed in the distance. "But," exclaimed De
Guiche, "what is Buckingham's motive for providing such a
supply of lodgings?"

"Yes, yes," said De Wardes; "what reason has he?"

"A very excellent one," replied Manicamp.

"You know what it is, then?"

"I fancy I do."

"Tell us then."

"Bend your head down towards me."

"What! may it not be spoken except in private?"

"You shall judge of that yourself."

"Very well." De Guiche bent down.

"Love," said Manicamp.

"I do not understand you at all."

"Say rather, you cannot understand me yet."

"Explain yourself."

"Very well; it is quite certain, count, that his royal
highness will be the most unfortunate of husbands."

"What do you mean?"

"The Duke of Buckingham ---- "

"It is a name of ill omen to the princes of the house of
France."

"And so the duke is madly in love with Madame, so the rumor
runs, and will have no one approach her but himself."

De Guiche colored. "Thank you, thank you," said he to
Manicamp, grasping his hand. Then, recovering himself,
added, "Whatever you do, Manicamp, be careful that this
project of Buckingham's is not made known to any Frenchman
here; for, if so, many a sword would be unsheathed in this
country that does not fear English steel."

"But after all," said Manicamp, "I have had no satisfactory
proof given me of the love in question, and it may be no
more than an idle tale."

"No, no," said De Guiche, "it must be the truth;" and
despite his command over himself, he clenched his teeth.

"Well," said Manicamp, "after all, what does it matter to
you? What does it matter to me whether the prince is to be
what the late king was? Buckingham the father for the queen,
Buckingham the son for the princess."

"Manicamp! Manicamp!

"It is a fact, or at least, everybody says so."

"Silence!" cried the count.

"But why, silence?" said De Wardes, "it is a highly
creditable circumstance for the French nation. Are not you
of my opinion, Monsieur de Bragelonne?"

"To what circumstance do you allude?" inquired De Bragelonne
with an abstracted air.

"That the English should render homage to the beauty of our
queens and our princesses."

"Forgive me, but I have not been paying attention to what
has passed; will you oblige me by explaining,

"There is no doubt it was necessary that Buckingham the
father should come to Paris in order that his majesty, King
Louis XIII., should perceive that his wife was one of the
most beautiful women of the French court; and it seems
necessary, at the present time, that Buckingham the son
should consecrate, by the devotion of his worship, the
beauty of a princess who has French blood in her veins. The
fact of having inspired a passion on the other side of the
Channel will henceforth confer a title to beauty on this."

"Sir," replied De Bragelonne, "I do not like to hear such
matters treated so lightly. Gentlemen like ourselves should
be careful guardians of the honor of our queens and our
princesses. If we jest at them, what will our servants do?"

"How am I to understand that?" said De Wardes, whose ears
tingled at the remark.

"In any way you choose, monsieur," replied De Bragelonne,
coldly.

"Bragelonne, Bragelonne," murmured De Guiche.

"M. de Wardes," exclaimed Manicamp, noticing that the young
man had spurred his horse close to the side of Raoul.

"Gentlemen, gentlemen," said De Guiche, "do not set such an
example in public, in the street too. De Wardes, you are
wrong."

"Wrong; in what way, may I ask?"

"You are wrong, monsieur, because you are always speaking
ill of someone or something," replied Raoul with undisturbed
composure.

"Be indulgent, Raoul," said De Guiche, in an undertone.

"Pray do not think of fighting, gentlemen!" said Manicamp,
"before you have rested yourselves; for in that case you
will not be able to do much."

"Come," said De Guiche, "forward, gentlemen!" and breaking
through the horses and attendants, he cleared the way for
himself towards the center of the square, through the crowd,
followed by the whole cavalcade. A large gateway looking out
upon a courtyard was open; Guiche entered the courtyard, and
Bragelonne, De Wardes, Manicamp, and three or four other
gentlemen, followed him. A sort of council of war was held,
and the means to be employed for saving the dignity of the
embassy were deliberated upon. Bragelonne was of opinion
that the right of priority should be respected, while De
Wardes suggested that the town should be sacked. This latter
proposition appearing to Manicamp rather premature, he
proposed instead that they should first rest themselves.
This was the wisest thing to do, but, unhappily, to follow
his advice, two things were wanting; namely, a house and
beds. De Guiche reflected for awhile, and then said aloud,
"Let him who loves me, follow me!"

"The attendants also?" inquired a page who had approached
the group.

"Every one," exclaimed the impetuous young man. "Manicamp,
show us the way to the house. destined for her Royal
Highness's residence."

Without in any way divining the count's project, his friends
followed him, accompanied by a crowd of people whose
acclamations and delight seemed a happy omen for the success
of that project with which they were yet unacquainted. The
wind was blowing strongly from the harbor, and moaning in
fitful gusts.




CHAPTER 84

At Sea



The following day was somewhat calmer, although the gale
still continued. The sun had, however, risen through a bank
of orange clouds, tingeing with its cheerful rays the crests
of the black waves. Watch was impatiently kept from the
different look-outs. Towards eleven o'clock in the morning a
ship, with sails full set, was signalled as in view; two
others followed at the distance of about half a knot. They
approached like arrows shot from the bow of a skillful
archer; and yet the sea ran so high that their speed was as
nothing compared to the rolling of the billows in which the
vessels were plunging first in one direction and then in
another. The English fleet was soon recognized by the line
of the ships, and by the color of their pennants; the one
which had the princess on board and carried the admiral's
flag preceded the others.

The rumor now spread that the princess was arriving. The
whole French court ran to the harbor, while the quays and
jetties were soon covered by crowds of people. Two hours
afterwards, the other vessels had overtaken the flagship,
and the three, not venturing perhaps to enter the narrow
entrance of the harbor, cast anchor between Havre and La
Heve. When the maneuver had been completed, the vessel which
bore the admiral saluted France by twelve discharges of
cannon, which were returned, discharge for discharge, from
Fort Francis I. Immediately afterwards a hundred boats were
launched; they were covered with the richest stuffs, and
destined for the conveyance of the different members of the
French nobility towards the vessels at anchor. But when it
was observed that even inside the harbor the boats were
tossed to and fro, and that beyond the jetty the waves rose
mountains high, dashing upon the shore with a terrible
uproar, it will readily be believed that not one of those
frail boats would be able with safety to reach a fourth part
of the distance between the shore and the vessels at anchor.
A pilot-boat, however, notwithstanding the wind and the sea,
was getting ready to leave the harbor, for the purpose of
placing itself at the admiral's disposal.

De Guiche, who had been looking among the different boats
for one stronger than the others, which might offer a chance
of reaching the English vessels, perceiving the pilot-boat
getting ready to start, said to Raoul: "Do you not think,
Raoul, that intelligent and vigorous men, as we are, ought
to be ashamed to retreat before the brute strength of wind
and waves?"

"That is precisely the very reflection I was silently making
to myself," replied Bragelonne.

"Shall we get into that boat, then, and push off? Will you
come, De Wardes?"

"Take care, or you will get drowned," said Manicamp.

"And for no purpose," said De Wardes, "for with the wind in
your teeth, as it will be, you will never reach the
vessels."

"You refuse, then?"

"Assuredly I do; I would willingly risk and lose my life in
an encounter against men," he said, glancing at Bragelonne,
"but as to fighting with oars against waves, I have no taste
for that."

"And for myself," said Manicamp, "even were I to succeed in
reaching the ships, I should not be indifferent to the loss
of the only good dress which I have left, -- salt water
would spoil it."

"You, then, refuse also?" exclaimed De Guiche.

"Decidedly I do; I beg you to understand that most
distinctly."

"But," exclaimed De Guiche, "look, De Wardes -- look,
Manicamp -- look yonder, the princesses are looking at us
from the poop of the admiral's vessel."

"An additional reason, my dear fellow, why we should not
make ourselves ridiculous by being drowned while they are
looking on."

"Is that your last word, Manicamp?"

"Yes."

"And then yours, De Wardes?"

"Yes."

"Then I go alone."

"Not so," said Raoul, "for I shall accompany you; I thought
it was understood I should do so."

The fact is, that Raoul, uninfluenced by devotion, measuring
the risk they run, saw how imminent the danger was, but he
willingly allowed himself to accept a peril which De Wardes
had declined.

The boat was about to set off when De Guiche called to the
pilot. "Stay," said he: "we want two places in your boat;"
and wrapping five or six pistoles in paper, he threw them
from the quay into the boat.

"It seems you are not afraid of salt water, young
gentlemen."

"We are afraid of nothing," replied De Guiche.

"Come along, then."

The pilot approached the side of the boat, and the two young
men, one after the other, with equal vivacity, jumped into
the boat. "Courage, my men," said De Guiche; "I have twenty
pistoles left in this purse, and as soon as we reach the
admiral's vessel they shall be yours." The sailors bent
themselves to their oars, and the boat bounded over the
crest of the waves. The interest taken in this hazardous
expedition was universal; the whole population of Havre
hurried towards the jetties and every look was directed
towards the little bark; at one moment it flew suspended on
the crest of the foaming waves, then suddenly glided
downwards towards the bottom of a raging abyss, where it
seemed utterly lost. At the expiration of an hour's
struggling with the waves, it reached the spot where the
admiral's vessel was anchored, and from the side of which
two boats had already been dispatched towards their aid.
Upon the quarter-deck of the flagship, sheltered by a canopy
of velvet and ermine, which was suspended by stout supports,
Henrietta, the queen dowager, and the young princess -- with
the admiral, the Duke of Norfolk -- standing beside them --
watched with alarm this slender bark, at one moment tossed
to the heavens, and the next buried beneath the waves, and
against whose dark sail the noble figures of the two French
gentlemen stood forth in relief like two luminous
apparitions. The crew, leaning against the bulwarks and
clinging to the shrouds, cheered the courage of the two
daring young men, the skill of the pilot, and the strength
of the sailors. They were received at the side of the vessel
by a shout of triumph. The Duke of Norfolk, a handsome young
man, from twenty-six to twenty-eight years of age, advanced
to meet them. De Guiche and Bragelonne lightly mounted the
ladder on the starboard side, and conducted by the Duke of
Norfolk, who resumed his place near them, they approached to
offer their homage to the princesses. Respect, and yet more,
a certain apprehension, for which he could not account, had
hitherto restrained the Comte de Guiche from looking at
Madame attentively, who, however, had observed him
immediately, and had asked her mother, "Is not that Monsieur
in the boat yonder?" Madame Henrietta who knew Monsieur
better than her daughter did, smiled at the mistake her
vanity had led her into, and had answered, "No; it is only
M. de Guiche, his favorite." The princess, at this reply,
was constrained to check an instinctive tenderness of
feeling which the courage displayed by the count had
awakened. At the very moment the princess had put this
question to her mother, De Guiche had, at last, summoned
courage to raise his eyes towards her and could compare the
original with the portrait he had so lately seen. No sooner
had he remarked her pale face, her eyes so full of
animation, her beautiful nut-brown hair, her expressive
lips, and her every gesture, which, while betokening royal
descent, seemed to thank and to encourage him at one and the
same time, than he was, for a moment, so overcome, that, had
it not been for Raoul, on whose arm he leant, he would have
fallen. His friend's amazed look, and the encouraging
gesture of the queen, restored Guiche to his
self-possession. In a few words he explained his mission,
explained in what way he had become the envoy of his royal
highness; and saluted, according to their rank and the
reception they gave him, the admiral and several of the
English noblemen who were grouped around the princesses.

Raoul was then presented, and was most graciously received;
the share that the Comte de la Fere had had in the
restoration of Charles II. was known to all; and, more than
that, it was the comte who had been charged with the
negotiation of the marriage, by means of which the
granddaughter of Henry IV. was now returning to France.
Raoul spoke English perfectly, and constituted himself his
friend's interpreter with the young English noblemen, who
were indifferently acquainted with the French language. At
this moment a young man came forward, of extremely handsome
features, and whose dress and arms were remarkable for their
extravagance of material. He approached the princesses, who
were engaged in conversation with the Duke of Norfolk, and,
in a voice which ill concealed his impatience, said, "It is
time now to disembark, your royal highness. "The younger of
the princesses rose from her seat at this remark, and was
about to take the hand which the young nobleman extended to
her, with an eagerness which arose from a variety of
motives, when the admiral intervened between them,
observing; "A moment, if you please, my lord; it is not
possible for ladies to disembark just now, the sea is too
rough; it is probable the wind may abate before sunset, and
the landing will not be effected, therefore, until this
evening."

"Allow me to observe, my lord," said Buckingham, with an
irritation of manner which he did not seek to disguise, "you
detain these ladies, and you have no right to do so. One of
them, unhappily, now belongs to France, and you perceive
that France claims them by the voice of her ambassadors;"
and at the same moment he indicated Raoul and Guiche, whom
he saluted.

"I cannot suppose that these gentlemen intend to expose the
lives of their royal highnesses," replied the admiral.

"These gentlemen," retorted Buckingham, "arrived here
safely, notwithstanding the wind; allow me to believe that
the danger will not be greater for their royal highnesses
when the wind will be in their favor."

"These envoys have shown how great their courage is," said
the admiral. "You may have observed that there was a great
number of persons on shore who did not venture to accompany
them. Moreover, the desire which they had to show their
respect with the least possible delay to Madame and her
illustrious mother induced them to brave the sea, which is
very tempestuous to-day, even for sailors. These gentlemen,
however, whom I recommend as an example for my officers to
follow, can hardly be so for these ladies."

Madame glanced at the Comte de Guiche, and perceived that
his face was burning with confusion. This look had escaped
Buckingham, who had eyes for nothing but Norfolk, of whom he
was evidently very jealous; he seemed anxious to remove the
princesses from the deck of a vessel where the admiral
reigned supreme. "In that case," returned Buckingham, "I
appeal to Madame herself."

"And I, my lord," retorted the admiral, "I appeal to my own
conscience, and to my own sense of responsibility. I have
undertaken to convey Madame safe and sound to France, and I
shall keep my promise."

"But sir ---- " continued Buckingham.

"My lord, permit me to remind you that I command here."

"Are you aware what you are saying, my lord?" replied
Buckingham, haughtily.

"Perfectly so; I therefore repeat it: I alone command here,
all yield obedience to me; the sea and the winds, the ships
and men too." This remark was made in a dignified and
authoritative manner. Raoul observed its effect upon
Buckingham, who trembled with anger from head to foot, and
leaned against one of the poles of the tent to prevent
himself falling; his eyes became suffused with blood, and
the hand which he did not need for his support wandered
towards the hilt of his sword.

"My lord," said the queen, "permit me to observe that I
agree in every particular with the Duke of Norfolk; if the
heavens, instead of being clouded as they are at the present
moment, were perfectly serene and propitious, we can still
afford to bestow a few hours upon the officer who has
conducted us so successfully, and with such extreme
attention, to the French coast, where he is to take leave of
us."

Buckingham, instead of replying, seemed to seek counsel from
the expression of Madame's face. She, however,
half-concealed beneath the thick curtains of the velvet and
gold which sheltered her, had not listened to the
discussion, having been occupied in watching the Comte de
Guiche, who was conversing with Raoul. This was a fresh
misfortune for Buckingham, who fancied he perceived in
Madame Henrietta's look a deeper feeling than that of
curiosity. He withdrew, almost tottering in his gait, and
nearly stumbled against the mainmast of the ship.

"The duke has not acquired a steady footing yet," said the
queen-mother, in French, "and that may possibly be his
reason for wishing to find himself on firm land again."

The young man overheard this remark, turned suddenly pale,
and, letting his hands fall in great discouragement by his
side, drew aside, mingling in one sigh his old affection and
his new hatreds. The admiral, however, without taking any
further notice of the duke's ill-humor, led the princesses
into the quarter-deck cabin, where dinner had been served
with a magnificence worthy in every respect of his guests.
The admiral seated himself at the right hand of the
princess, and placed the Comte de Guiche on her left. This
was the place Buckingham usually occupied; and when he
entered the cabin, how profound was his unhappiness to see
himself banished by etiquette from the presence of his
sovereign, to a position inferior to that which, by rank, he
was entitled to. De Guiche, on the other hand, paler still
perhaps from happiness, than his rival was from anger,
seated himself tremblingly next the princess, whose silken
robe, as it lightly touched him, caused a tremor of mingled
regret and happiness to pass through his whole frame. The
repast finished, Buckingham darted forward to hand Madame
Henrietta from the table; but this time it was De Guiche's
turn to give the duke a lesson. "Have the goodness, my lord,
from this moment," said he, "not to interpose between her
royal highness and myself. From this moment, indeed, her
royal highness belongs to France, and when she deigns to
honor me by touching my hand it is the hand of Monsieur, the
brother of the king of France, she touches."

And saying this, he presented his hand to Madame Henrietta
with such marked deference, and at the same time with a
nobleness of mien so intrepid, that a murmur of admiration
rose from the English, whilst a groan of despair escaped
from Buckingham's lips. Raoul, who loved, comprehended it
all. He fixed upon his friend one of those profound looks
which a bosom friend or mother can alone extend, either as
protector or guardian, over the one who is about to stray
from the right path. Towards two o'clock in the afternoon
the sun shone forth anew, the wind subsided, the sea became
smooth as a crystal mirror, and the fog, which had shrouded
the coast, disappeared like a veil withdrawn from before it.
The smiling hills of France appeared in full view with their
numerous white houses rendered more conspicuous by the
bright green of the trees or the clear blue sky.




CHAPTER 85

The Tents



The admiral, as we have seen, was determined to pay no
further attention to Buckingham's threatening glances and
fits of passion. In fact, from the moment they quitted
England, he had gradually accustomed himself to his
behavior. De Guiche had not yet in any way remarked the
animosity which appeared to influence that young nobleman
against him, but he felt, instinctively, that there could be
no sympathy between himself and the favorite of Charles II.
The queen-mother, with greater experience and calmer
judgment, perceived the exact position of affairs, and, as
she discerned its danger, was prepared to meet it, whenever
the proper moment should arrive. Quiet had been everywhere
restored, except in Buckingham's heart; he, in his
impatience, addressed himself to the princess, in a low tone
of voice: "For Heaven's sake, madame, I implore you to
hasten your disembarkation. Do you not perceive how that
insolent Duke of Norfolk is killing me with his attentions
and devotions to you?"

Henrietta heard this remark; she smiled, and without turning
her head towards him, but giving only to the tone of her
voice that inflection of gentle reproach, and languid
impertinence, which women and princesses so well know how to
assume, she murmured, "I have already hinted, my lord, that
you must have taken leave of your senses."

Not a single detail escaped Raoul's attention; he heard both
Buckingham's entreaty and the princess's reply; he remarked
Buckingham retire, heard his deep sigh, and saw him pass his
hand across his face. He understood everything, and trembled
as he reflected on the position of affairs, and the state of
the minds of those about him. At last the admiral, with
studied delay, gave the last orders for the departure of the
boats.

Buckingham heard the directions given with such an
exhibition of delight that a stranger would really imagine
the young man's reason was affected. As the Duke of Norfolk
gave his commands, a large boat or barge, decked with flags,
and capable of holding about twenty rowers and fifteen
passengers, was slowly lowered from the side of the
admiral's vessel. The barge was carpeted with velvet and
decorated with coverings embroidered with the arms of
England, and with garlands of flowers; for, at that time,
ornamentation was by no means forgotten in these political
pageants. No sooner was this really royal boat afloat and
the rowers with oars uplifted, awaiting, like soldiers
presenting arms, the embarkation of the princess, than
Buckingham ran forward to the ladder in order to take his
place. His progress was, however, arrested by the queen. "My
lord," she said, "it is hardly becoming that you should
allow my daughter and myself to land without having
previously ascertained that our apartments are properly
prepared. I beg your lordship to be good enough to precede
us ashore, and to give directions that everything be in
proper order on our arrival."

This was a fresh disappointment for the duke, and, still
more so, since it was so unexpected. He hesitated, colored
violently, but could not reply. He had thought he might be
able to keep near Madame during the passage to the shore,
and, by this means, to enjoy to the very last moment the
brief period fortune still reserved for him. The order,
however, was explicit; and the admiral, who heard it given,
immediately called out, "Launch the ship's gig." His
directions were executed with that celerity which
distinguishes every maneuver on board a man-of-war.

Buckingham, in utter hopelessness, cast a look of despair at
the princess, of supplication towards the queen, and
directed a glance full of anger towards the admiral. The
princess pretended not to notice him, while the queen turned
aside her head, and the admiral laughed outright, at the
sound of which Buckingham seemed ready to spring upon him.
The queen-mother rose, and with a tone of authority said,
"Pray set off, sir."

The young duke hesitated, looked around him, and with a last
effort, half-choked by contending emotions, said, "And you,
gentlemen, M. de Guiche and M. de Bragelonne, do not you
accompany me?"

De Guiche bowed and said, "Both M. de Bragelonne and myself
await her majesty's orders; whatever the commands she
imposes on us, we shall obey them." Saying this, he looked
towards the princess, who cast down her eyes.

"Your grace will remember," said the queen, "that M. de
Guiche is here to represent Monsieur; it is he who will do
the honors of France, as you have done those of England; his
presence cannot be dispensed with; besides, we owe him this
slight favor for the courage he displayed in venturing to
seek us in such a terrible stress of weather."

Buckingham opened his lips, as if he were about to speak,
but, whether thoughts or expressions failed him, not a
syllable escaped them, and turning away, as though out of
his mind, he leapt from the vessel into the boat. The
sailors were just in time to catch hold of him to steady
themselves; for his weight and the rebound had almost upset
the boat.

"His grace cannot be in his senses," said the admiral aloud
to Raoul.

"I am uneasy on the Duke's account," replied Bragelonne.

While the boat was advancing towards the shore, the duke
kept his eyes immovably fixed upon the admiral's ship, like
a miser torn away from his coffers, or a mother separated
from her child, about to be led away to death. No one,
however, acknowledged his signals, his frowns, or his
pitiful gestures. In very anguish of mind, he sank down in
the boat, burying his hands in his hair, whilst the boat,
impelled by the exertions of the merry sailors, flew over
the waves. On his arrival he was in such a state of apathy,
that, had he not been received at the harbor by the
messenger whom he had directed to precede him, he would
hardly have had strength to ask his way. Having once,
however, reached the house which had been set apart for him,
he shut himself up, like Achilles in his tent. The barge
bearing the princesses quitted the admiral's vessel at the
very moment Buckingham landed. It was followed by another
boat filled with officers, courtiers, and zealous friends.
Great numbers of the inhabitants of Havre, having embarked
in fishing-cobles and boats of every description, set off to
meet the royal barge. The cannon from the forts fired
salutes, which were returned by the flagship and the two
other vessels, and the flashes from the open mouths of the
cannon floated in white fumes over the waves, and
disappeared in the clear blue sky.

The princess landed at the decorated quay. Bands of gay
music greeted her arrival, and accompanied her every step
she took. During the time she was passing through the center
of the town, and treading beneath her delicate feet the
richest carpets and the gayest flowers, which had been
strewn upon the ground, De Guiche and Raoul, escaping from
their English friends, hurried through the town and hastened
rapidly towards the place intended for the residence of
Madame.

"Let us hurry forward," said Raoul to De Guiche, "for if I
read Buckingham's character aright, he will create some
disturbance, when he learns the result of our deliberations
of yesterday."

"Never fear," said De Guiche, "De Wardes is there, who is
determination itself, while Manicamp is the very
personification of artless gentleness."

De Guiche was not, however, the less diligent on that
account, and five minutes afterwards they were within sight
of the Hotel de Ville. The first thing which struck them was
the number of people assembled in the square. "Excellent,"
said De Guiche; "our apartments, I see, are prepared."

In fact, in front of the Hotel de Ville, upon the wide open
space before it, eight tents had been raised, surmounted by
the flags of France and England united. The hotel was
surrounded by tents, as by a girdle of variegated colors;
ten pages and a dozen mounted troopers, who had been given
to the ambassadors, for an escort, mounted guard before the
tents. It had a singularly curious effect, almost fairy-like
in its appearance. These tents had been constructed during
the night-time. Fitted up, within and without, with the
richest materials that De Guiche had been able to procure in
Havre, they completely encircled the Hotel de Ville. The
only passage which led to the steps of the hotel, and which
was not inclosed by the silken barricade, was guarded by two
tents, resembling two pavilions, the doorways of both of
which opened towards the entrance. These two tents were
destined for De Guiche and Raoul; in whose absence they were
intended to be occupied, that of De Guiche by De Wardes, and
that of Raoul by Manicamp. Surrounding these two tents, and
the six others, a hundred officers, gentlemen, and pages,
dazzling in their display of silk and gold, thronged like
bees buzzing about a hive. Every one of them, their swords
by their sides, was ready to obey the slightest sign either
of De Guiche or Bragelonne, the leaders of the embassy.

At the very moment the two young men appeared at the end of
one of the streets leading to the square, they perceived,
crossing the square at full gallop, a young man on
horseback, whose costume was of surprising richness. He
pushed hastily through the crowd of curious lookers-on, and,
at the sight of these unexpected erections, uttered a cry of
anger and dismay. It was Buckingham, who had awakened from
his stupor, in order to adorn himself with a costume
perfectly dazzling from its beauty, and to await the arrival
of the princess and the queen-mother at the Hotel de Ville.
At the entrance to the tents, the soldiers barred his
passage, and his further progress was arrested. Buckingham,
hopelessly infuriated, raised his whip; but his arm was
seized by a couple of officers. Of the two guardians of the
tent, only one was there. De Wardes was in the interior of
the Hotel de Ville, engaged in attending to the execution of
some orders given by De Guiche. At the noise made by
Buckingham Manicamp, who was indolently reclining upon the
cushions at the doorway of one of the tents, rose with his
usual indifference, and, perceiving that the disturbance
continued, made his appearance from underneath the curtains.
"What is the matter?" he said, in a gentle tone of voice,
"and who is it making this disturbance?"

It so happened, that, at the moment he began to speak,
silence had just been restored, and, although his voice was
very soft and gentle in its tone, every one heard his
question. Buckingham turned round; and looked at the tall,
thin figure, and the listless expression of countenance of
his questioner. Probably the personal appearance of
Manicamp, who was dressed very plainly, did not inspire him
with much respect, for he replied disdainfully, "Who may you
be, monsieur?"

Manicamp, leaning on the arm of a gigantic trooper, as firm
as the pillar of a cathedral, replied in his usual tranquil
tone of voice, -- "And you, monsieur?"

"I, monsieur, am the Duke of Buckingham; I have hired all
the houses which surround the Hotel de Ville, where I have
business to transact; and as these houses are let, they
belong to me, and, as I hired them in order to preserve the
right of free access to the Hotel de Ville, you are not
justified in preventing me passing to it."

"But who prevents you passing, monsieur?" inquired Manicamp.

"Your sentinels."

"Because you wish to pass on horseback, and orders have been
given to let only persons on foot pass."

"No one has any right to give orders here, except myself,"
said Buckingham.

"On what grounds?" inquired Manicamp, with his soft tone.
"Will you do me the favor to explain this enigma to me?"

"Because, as I have already told you, I have hired all the
houses looking on the square."

"We are very well aware of that, since nothing but the
square itself has been left for us."

"You are mistaken, monsieur; the square belongs to me, as
well as the houses in it."

"Forgive me, monsieur, but you are mistaken there. In our
country, we say, the highway belongs to the king, therefore
this square is his majesty's; and, consequently, as we are
the king's ambassadors, the square belongs to us."

"I have already asked you who you are, monsieur," exclaimed
Buckingham, exasperated at the coolness of his interlocutor.

"My name is Manicamp," replied the young man, in a voice
whose tones were as harmonious and sweet as the notes of an
AEolian harp.

Buckingham shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and said,
"When I hired these houses which surround the Hotel de
Ville, the square was unoccupied; these barracks obstruct my
sight; I hereby order them to be removed."

A hoarse and angry murmur ran through the crowd of listeners
at these words. De Guiche arrived at this moment; he pushed
through the crowd which separated him from Buckingham, and,
followed by Raoul, arrived on the scene of action from one
side, just as De Wardes came up from the other. "Pardon me,
my lord; but if you have any complaint to make, have the
goodness to address it to me, inasmuch as it was I who
supplied the plans for the construction of these tents."

"Moreover, I would beg you to observe, monsieur, that the
term `barrack' is a highly objectionable one!" added
Manicamp, graciously.

"You were saying, monsieur -- " continued De Guiche.

"I was saying, monsieur le comte," resumed Buckingham, in a
tone of anger more marked than ever, although in some
measure moderated by the presence of an equal, "I was saying
that it is impossible these tents can remain where they
are."

"Impossible!" exclaimed De Guiche, "and why?"

"Because I object to them."

A movement of impatience escaped De Guiche, but a warning
glance from Raoul restrained him.

"You should the less object to them, monsieur, on account of
the abuse of priority you have permitted yourself to
exercise."

"Abuse!"

"Most assuredly. You commission a messenger, who hires in
your name the whole of the town of Havre, without
considering the members of the French court, who would be
sure to arrive here to meet Madame. Your Grace will admit
that this is hardly friendly conduct in the representative
of a friendly nation."

"The right of possession belongs to him who is first on the
ground."

"Not in France, monsieur."

"Why not in France?"

"Because France is a country where politeness is observed."

"Which means!" exclaimed Buckingham, in so violent a manner
that those who were present drew back, expecting an
immediate collision.

"Which means, monsieur," replied De Guiche, now rather pale,
"that I caused these tents to be raised as habitations for
myself and my friends, as a shelter for the ambassadors of
France, as the only place of refuge which your exactions
have left us in the town; and that I and those who are with
me, shall remain in them, at least, until an authority more
powerful, and more supreme, than your own shall dismiss me
from them."

"In other words, until we are ejected, as the lawyers say,"
observed Manicamp, blandly.

"I know an authority, monsieur, which I trust is such as you
will respect," said Buckingham, placing his hand on his
sword.

At this moment, and as the goddess of Discord, inflaming all
minds, was about to direct their swords against each other,
Raoul gently placed his hand on Buckingham's shoulder. "One
word, my lord," he said.

"My right, my right, first of all," exclaimed the fiery
young man.

"It is precisely upon that point I wish to have the honor of
addressing a word to you."

"Very well, monsieur, but let your remarks be brief."

"One question is all I ask; you can hardly expect me to be
briefer."

"Speak, monsieur, I am listening."

"Are you, or is the Duke of Orleans, going to marry the
granddaughter of Henry IV.?"

"What do you mean?" exclaimed Buckingham, retreating a few
steps, bewildered.

"Have the goodness to answer me," persisted Raoul,
tranquilly.

"Do you mean to ridicule me, monsieur?" inquired Buckingham.

"Your question is a sufficient answer for me. You admit,
then, that it is not you who are going to marry the
princess?"

"Thou know it perfectly well, monsieur, I should imagine."

"I beg your pardon, but your conduct has been such as to
leave it not altogether certain."

"Proceed, monsieur, what do you mean to convey?"

Raoul approached the duke. "Are you aware, my lord," he
said, lowering his voice, "that your extravagances very much
resemble the excesses of jealousy? These jealous fits, with
respect to any woman, are not becoming in one who is neither
her lover nor her husband; and I am sure you will admit that
my remark applies with still greater force, when the lady in
question is a princess of the blood royal!"

"Monsieur," exclaimed Buckingham, "do you mean to insult
Madame Henrietta?"

"Be careful, my lord," replied Bragelonne, coldly, "for it
is you who insult her. A little while since, when on board
the admiral's ship, you wearied the queen, and exhausted the
admiral's patience. I was observing, my lord; and, at first,
I concluded you were not in possession of your senses, but I
have since surmised the real significance of your madness."

"Monsieur!" exclaimed Buckingham.

"One moment more, for I have yet another word to add. I
trust I am the only one of my companions who has guessed
it."

"Are you aware, monsieur," said Buckingham, trembling with
mingled feelings of anger and uneasiness, "are you aware
that you are holding language towards me which requires to
be checked?"

"Weigh your words well, my lord," said Raoul, haughtily: "my
nature is not such that its vivacities need checking; whilst
you, on the contrary, are descended from a race whose
passions are suspected by all true Frenchmen; I repeat,
therefore, for the second time, be careful!"

"Careful of what, may I ask? Do you presume to threaten me?"

"I am the son of the Comte de la Fere, my lord, and I never
threaten, because I strike first. Therefore, understand me
well, the threat that I hold out to you is this ---- "

Buckingham clenched his hands, but Raoul continued, as
though he had not observed the gesture. "At the very first
word, beyond the respect and deference due to her royal
highness, which you permit yourself to use towards her, --
be patient, my lord, for I am perfectly so."

"You?"

"Undoubtedly. So long as Madame remained on English
territory, I held my peace; but from the very moment she
stepped on French ground, and now that we have received her
in the name of the prince, I warn you, that at the first
mark of disrespect which you, in your insane attachment,
exhibit towards the royal house of France, I shall have one
of two courses to follow; -- either I declare, in the
presence of every one, the madness with which you are now
affected, and I get you ignominiously ordered back to
England; or if you prefer it, I will run my dagger through
your throat in the presence of all here. This second
alternative seems to me the least disagreeable, and I think
I shall hold to it."

Buckingham had become paler than the lace collar around his
neck. "M. de Bragelonne," he said, "is it, indeed, a
gentleman who is speaking to me?"

"Yes; only the gentleman is speaking to a madman. Get cured,
my lord, and he will hold quite another language to you."

"But, M. de Bragelonne," murmured the duke, in a voice,
half-choked, and putting his hand to his neck, -- "Do you
not see I am choking?"

"If your death were to take place at this moment, my lord,"
replied Raoul, with unruffled composure, "I should, indeed,
regard it as a great happiness, for this circumstance would
prevent all kinds of evil remarks; not alone about yourself,
but also about those illustrious persons whom your devotion
is compromising in so absurd a manner."

"You are right, you are right," said the young man, almost
beside himself. "Yes, yes; better to die, than to suffer as
I do at this moment." And he grasped a beautiful dagger, the
handle of which was inlaid with precious stones; and which
he half drew from his breast.

Raoul thrust his hand aside. "Be careful what you do," he
said; "if you do not kill yourself, you commit a ridiculous
action; and if you were to kill yourself, you sprinkle blood
upon the nuptial robe of the princess of England."

Buckingham remained a minute gasping for breath; during this
interval, his lips quivered, his fingers worked
convulsively, and his eyes wandered as though in delirium.
Then suddenly, he said, "M. de Bragelonne, I know nowhere a
nobler mind than yours; you are, indeed, a worthy son of the
most perfect gentleman that ever lived. Keep your tents."
And he threw his arms round Raoul's neck. All who were
present, astounded at this conduct, which was the very
reverse of what was expected, considering the violence of
the one adversary and the determination of the other, began
immediately to clap their hands, and a thousand cheers and
joyful shouts arose from all sides. De Guiche, in his turn,
embraced Buckingham somewhat against his inclination; but,
at all events, he did embrace him. This was the signal for
French and English to do the same; and they who, until that
moment, had looked at each other with restless uncertainty,
fraternized on the spot. In the meantime, the procession of
the princess arrived, and had it not been for Bragelonne,
two armies would have been engaged together in conflict, and
blood have been shed upon the flowers with which the ground
was covered. At the appearance, however, of the banners
borne at the head of the procession, complete order was
restored.




CHAPTER 86

Night



Concord returned to its place amidst the tents. English and
French rivaled each other in their devotion and courteous
attention to the illustrious travelers. The English
forwarded to the French baskets of flowers, of which they
had made a plentiful provision to greet the arrival of the
young princess; the French in return invited the English to
a supper, which was to be given the next day.
Congratulations were poured in upon the princess everywhere
during her journey. From the respect paid her on all sides,
she seemed like a queen; and from the adoration with which
she was treated by two or three, she appeared an object of
worship. The queen-mother gave the French the most
affectionate reception. France was her native country, and
she had suffered too much unhappiness in England for England
to have made her forget France. She taught her daughter,
then, by her own affection for it, that love for a country
where they had both been hospitably received, and where a
brilliant future opened before them. After the public entry
was over, and the spectators in the streets had partially
dispersed, and the sound of the music and cheering of the
crowd could be heard only in the distance; when the night
had closed in, wrapping with its star-covered mantle the
sea, the harbor, the town, and surrounding country, De
Guiche, still excited by the great events of the day,
returned to his tent, and seated himself upon one of the
stools with so profound an expression of distress that
Bragelonne kept his eyes fixed on him, until he heard him
sigh, and then he approached him. The count had thrown
himself back on his seat, leaning his shoulders against the
partition of the tent, and remained thus, his face buried in
his hands, with heaving chest and restless limbs.

"You are suffering?" asked Raoul.

"Cruelly."

"Bodily, I suppose?"

"Yes; bodily."

"This has indeed been a harassing day," continued the young
man, his eyes fixed upon his friend.

"Yes; a night's rest will probably restore me."

"Shall I leave you?"

"No; I wish to talk to you."

"You shall not speak to me, Guiche, until you have first
answered my questions."

"Proceed then."

"You will be frank with me?"

"I always am."

"Can you imagine why Buckingham has been so violent?"

"I suspect."

"Because he is in love with Madame, is it not?"

"One could almost swear to it, to observe him."

"You are mistaken; there is nothing of the kind."

"It is you who are mistaken, Raoul; I have read his distress
in his eyes, in his every gesture and action the whole day."

"You are a poet, my dear count, and find subject for your
muse everywhere."

"I can perceive love clearly enough."

"Where it does not exist?"

"Nay, where it does exist."

"Do you not think you are deceiving yourself, Guiche?"

"I am convinced of what I say," said the count.

"Now, inform me count," said Raoul, fixing a penetrating
look upon him, "what has happened to render you so
clear-sighted?"

Guiche hesitated for a moment, and then answered,
"Self-love, I suppose."

"Self-love is a pedantic word, Guiche."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean that, generally, you are less out of spirits than
seems to be the case this evening."

"I am fatigued."

"Listen to me, Guiche; we have been campaigners together; we
have been on horseback for eighteen hours at a time, and our
horses dying from exhaustion, or hunger, have fallen beneath
us, and yet we have laughed at our mishaps. Believe me, it
is not fatigue that saddens you to-night."

"It is annoyance, then."

"What annoyance?"

"That of this evening."

"The mad conduct of the Duke of Buckingham, do you mean?"

"Of course; is it not vexatious for us, the representatives
of our sovereign master, to witness the devotion of an
Englishman to our future mistress, the second lady in point
of rank in the kingdom?"

"Yes, you are right; but I do not think any danger is to be
apprehended from Buckingham."

"No; still he is intrusive. Did he not, on his arrival here,
almost succeed in creating a disturbance between the English
and ourselves; and, had it not been for you, for your
admirable prudence, for your singular decision of character,
swords would have been drawn in the very streets of the
town."

"You observe, however, that he has changed his tactics."

"Yes, certainly; but this is the very thing that amazes me
so much. You spoke to him in a low tone of voice, what did
you say to him? You think he loves her; you admit that such
a passion does not give way readily. He does not love her,
then!" De Guiche pronounced the latter with so marked an
expression that Raoul raised his head. The noble character
of the young man's countenance expressed a displeasure which
could easily be read.

"What I said to him, count," replied Raoul, "I will repeat
to you. Listen to me. I said, `You are regarding with
wistful feelings, and most injurious desire, the sister of
your prince, -- her to whom you are not affianced, who is
not, who can never be anything to you; you are outraging
those who, like ourselves, have come to seek a young lady to
escort her to her husband.'"

"You spoke to him in that manner?" asked Guiche coloring.

"In those very terms; I even added more. `How would you
regard us,' I said, `if you were to perceive among us a man
mad enough, disloyal enough, to entertain other than
sentiments of the most perfect respect for a princess who is
the destined wife of our master?'"

These words were so applicable to De Guiche that he turned
pale, and, overcome by a sudden agitation, was barely able
to stretch out one hand mechanically towards Raoul, as he
covered his eyes and face with the other.

"But," continued Raoul, not interrupted by this movement of
his friend, "Heaven be praised, the French who are
pronounced to be thoughtless and indiscreet, reckless, even,
are capable of bringing a calm and sound judgment to bear on
matters of such high importance. I added even more, for I
said, `Learn, my lord, that we gentlemen of France devote
ourselves to our sovereigns by sacrificing for them our
affections, as well as our fortunes and our lives; and
whenever it may chance to happen that the tempter suggests
one of those vile thoughts that set the heart on fire, we
extinguish the flame, even if it has to be done by shedding
our blood for the purpose. Thus it is that the honor of
three is saved: our country's, our master's, and our own. It
is thus that we act, your Grace; it is thus that every man
of honor ought to act. In this manner, my dear Guiche,"
continued Raoul, "I addressed the Duke of Buckingham; and he
admitted I was right, and resigned himself unresistingly to
my arguments."

De Guiche, who had hitherto sat leaning forward while Raoul
was speaking, drew himself up, his eyes glancing proudly; he
seized Raoul's hand, his face, which had been as cold as
ice, seemed on fire. "And you spoke magnificently," he said,
in a half-choked voice; "you are indeed a friend, Raoul. But
now, I entreat you, leave me to myself."

"Do you wish it?"

"Yes; I need repose. Many things have agitated me to-day,
both in mind and body; when you return tomorrow I shall no
longer be the same man."

"I leave you, then," said Raoul, as he withdrew. The count
advanced a step towards his friend, and pressed him warmly
in his arms. But in this friendly pressure Raoul could
detect the nervous agitation of a great internal conflict.

The night was clear, starlit, and splendid; the tempest had
passed away, and the sweet influences of the evening had
restored life, peace and security everywhere. A few fleecy
clouds were floating in the heavens, and indicated from
their appearance a continuance of beautiful weather,
tempered by a gentle breeze from the east. Upon the large
square in front of the hotel, the shadows of the tents,
intersected by the golden moonbeams, formed as it were a
huge mosaic of jet and yellow flagstones. Soon, however, the
entire town was wrapped in slumber; a feeble light still
glimmered in Madame's apartment, which looked out upon the
square, and the soft rays from the expiring lamp seemed to
be the image of the calm sleep of a young girl, hardly yet
sensible of life's anxieties, and in whom the flame of
existence sinks placidly as sleep steals over the body.

Bragelonne quitted the tent with the slow and measured step
of a man curious to observe, but anxious not to be seen.
Sheltered behind the thick curtains of his own tent,
embracing with a glance the whole square, he noticed that,
after a few moments' pause, the curtains of De Guiche's tent
were agitated, and then drawn partially aside. Behind them
he could perceive the shadow of De Guiche, his eyes
glittering in the obscurity, fastened ardently upon the
princess's sitting apartment, which was partially lighted by
the lamp in the inner room. The soft light which illumined
the windows was the count's star. The fervent aspirations of
his nature could be read in his eyes. Raoul, concealed in
the shadow, divined the many passionate thoughts that
established, between the tent of the young ambassador and
the balcony of the princess, a mysterious and magical bond
of sympathy -- a bond created by thoughts imprinted with so
much strength and persistence of will, that they must have
caused happy and loving dreams to alight upon the perfumed
couch, which the count, with the eyes of his soul, devoured
so eagerly.

But De Guiche and Raoul were not the only watchers. The
window of one of the houses looking on the square was opened
too, the casement of the house where Buckingham resided. By
the aid of the rays of light which issued from this latter,
the profile of the duke could be distinctly seen, as he
indolently reclined upon the carved balcony with its velvet
hangings; he also was breathing in the direction of the
princess's apartment his prayers and the wild visions of his
love.

Raoul could not resist smiling, as thinking of Madame, he
said to himself, "Hers is, indeed, a heart well besieged;"
and then added, compassionately, as he thought of Monsieur,
"and he is a husband well threatened too; it is a good thing
for him that he is a prince of such high rank, that he has
an army to safeguard for him that which is his own."
Bragelonne watched for some time the conduct of the two
lovers, listened to the loud and uncivil slumbers of
Manicamp, who snored as imperiously as though he was wearing
his blue and gold, instead of his violet suit.

Then he turned towards the night breeze which bore towards
him, he seemed to think, the distant song of the
nightingale; and, after having laid in a due provision of
melancholy, another nocturnal malady, he retired to rest
thinking, with regard to his own love affair, that perhaps
four or even a larger number of eyes, quite as ardent as
those of De Guiche and Buckingham, were coveting his own
idol in the chateau at Blois. "And Mademoiselle de Montalais
is by no means a very conscientious garrison," said he to
himself, sighing aloud.




CHAPTER 87

From Havre to Paris



The next day the fetes took place, accompanied by all the
pomp and animation that the resources of the town and the
cheerful disposition of men's minds could supply. During the
last few hours spent in Havre, every preparation for the
departure had been made. After Madame had taken leave of the
English fleet, and, once again, had saluted the country in
saluting its flags, she entered her carriage, surrounded by
a brilliant escort. De Guiche had hoped that the Duke of
Buckingham would accompany the admiral to England; but
Buckingham succeeded in demonstrating to the queen that
there would be great impropriety in allowing Madame to
proceed to Paris almost unprotected. As soon as it had been
settled that Buckingham was to accompany Madame, the young
duke selected a corps of gentlemen and officers to form part
of his own suite, so that it was almost an army that now set
out towards Paris, scattering gold, and exciting the
liveliest demonstrations as they passed through the
different towns and villages on the route. The weather was
very fine. France is a beautiful country, especially along
the route by which the procession passed. Spring cast its
flowers and its perfumed foliage on their path. Normandy,
with its vast variety of vegetation, its blue skies and
silver rivers, displayed itself in all the loveliness of a
paradise to the new sister of the king. Fetes and brilliant
displays received them everywhere along the line of march.
De Guiche and Buckingham forgot everything; De Guiche in his
anxiety to prevent any fresh attempts on the part of the
duke, and Buckingham, in his desire to awaken in the heart
of the princess a softer remembrance of the country to which
the recollection of many happy days belonged. But, alas! the
poor duke could perceive that the image of that country so
cherished by himself became, from day to day, more and more
effaced in Madame's mind, in exact proportion as her
affection for France became more deeply engraved on her
heart. In fact, it was not difficult to perceive that his
most devoted attention awakened no acknowledgment, and that
the grace with which he rode one of his most fiery horses
was thrown away, for it was only casually and by the merest
accident that the princess's eyes were turned towards him.
In vain did he try, in order to fix upon himself one of
those looks, which were thrown carelessly around, or
bestowed elsewhere, to produce in the animal he rode its
greatest display of strength, speed, temper and address; in
vain did he, by exciting his horse almost to madness, spur
him, at the risk of dashing himself in pieces against the
trees, or of rolling in the ditches, over the gates and
barriers which they passed, or down the steep declivities of
the hills. Madame, whose attention had been aroused by the
noise, turned her head for a moment to observe the cause of
it, and then, slightly smiling, again entered into
conversation with her faithful guardians, Raoul and De
Guiche, who were quietly riding at her carriage doors.
Buckingham felt himself a prey to all the tortures of
jealousy; an unknown, unheard of anguish glided through his
veins, and laid siege to his heart; and then, as if to show
that he knew the folly of his conduct, and that he wished to
correct, by the humblest submission, his flights of
absurdity, he mastered his horse, and compelled him, reeking
with sweat and flecked with foam, to champ his bit close
beside the carriage, amidst the crowd of courtiers.
Occasionally he obtained a word from Madame as a recompense,
and yet her speech seemed almost a reproach.

"That is well, my lord," she said, "now you are reasonable."

Or from Raoul, "Your Grace is killing your horse."

Buckingham listened patiently to Raoul's remarks, for he
instinctively felt, without having had any proof that such
was the case, that Raoul checked the display of De Guiche's
feelings, and that, had it not been for Raoul, some mad act
or proceeding, either of the count, or of Buckingham
himself, would have brought about an open rupture, or a
disturbance -- perhaps even exile itself. From the moment of
that excited conversation the two young men had held in
front of the tents at Havre, when Raoul made the duke
perceive the impropriety of his conduct, Buckingham felt
himself attracted towards Raoul almost in spite of himself.
He often entered into conversation with him, and it was
nearly always to talk to him either of his father or of
D'Artagnan, their mutual friend, in whose praise Buckingham
was nearly as enthusiastic as Raoul. Raoul endeavored, as
much as possible, to make the conversation turn upon this
subject in De Wardes's presence, who had, during the whole
journey, been exceedingly annoyed at the superior position
taken by Bragelonne, and especially by his influence over De
Guiche. De Wardes had that keen and merciless penetration
most evil natures possess; he had immediately remarked De
Guiche's melancholy, and divined the nature of his regard
for the princess. Instead, however, of treating the subject
with the same reserve which Raoul practiced; instead of
regarding with that respect, which was their due, the
obligations and duties of society, De Wardes resolutely
attacked in the count the ever-sounding chord of juvenile
audacity and pride. It happened one evening, during a halt
at Nantes, that while De Guiche and De Wardes were leaning
against a barrier, engaged in conversation, Buckingham and
Raoul were also talking together as they walked up and down.
Manicamp was engaged in devoted attendance on the princess,
who already treated him without reserve, on account of his
versatile fancy, his frank courtesy of manner, and
conciliatory disposition.

"Confess," said De Wardes, "that you are really ill and that
your pedagogue of a friend has not succeeded in curing you."

"I do not understand you," said the count.

"And yet it is easy enough; you are dying of love."

"You are mad, De Wardes."

"Madness it would be, I admit, if Madame were really
indifferent to your martyrdom; but she takes so much notice
of it, observes it to such an extent, that she compromises
herself, and I tremble lest, on our arrival at Paris, M. de
Bragelonne may not denounce both of you."

"For shame, De Wardes, again attacking De Bragelonne."

"Come, come, a truce to child's play," replied the count's
evil genius, in an undertone; "you know as well as I do what
I mean. Besides, you must have observed how the princess's
glance softens as she looks at you; -- you can tell, by the
very inflection of her voice, what pleasure she takes in
listening to you, and can feel how thoroughly she
appreciates the verses you recite to her. You cannot deny,
too, that every morning she tells you how indifferently she
slept the previous night."

"True, De Wardes, quite true; but what good is there in your
telling me all that?"

"Is it not important to know the exact position of affairs?"

"No, no; not when I am a witness of things that are enough
to drive one mad."

"Stay, stay," said De Wardes; "look, she calls you, -- do
you understand? Profit by the occasion, while your pedagogue
is absent."

De Guiche could not resist; an invincible attraction drew
him towards the princess. De Wardes smiled as he saw him
withdraw.

"You are mistaken, monsieur," said Raoul, suddenly stepping
across the barrier against which the previous moment the two
friends had been leaning. "The pedagogue is here, and has
overheard you."

De Wardes, at the sound of Raoul's voice, which he
recognized without having occasion to look at him, half drew
his sword.

"Put up your sword," said Raoul, "you know perfectly well
that, until our journey is at an end, every demonstration of
that nature is useless. Why do you distill into the heart of
the man you term your friend all the bitterness that infects
your own? As regards myself, you wish to arouse a feeling of
deep dislike against a man of honor -- my father's friend
and my own: and as for the count you wish him to love one
who is destined for your master. Really, monsieur, I should
regard you as a coward, and a traitor too, if I did not,
with greater justice, regard you as a madman."

"Monsieur," exclaimed De Wardes, exasperated, "I was
deceived, I find, in terming you a pedagogue. The tone you
assume, and the style which is peculiarly your own, is that
of a Jesuit, and not of a gentleman. Discontinue, I beg,
whenever I am present, this style I complain of, and the
tone also. I hate M. d'Artagnan because he was guilty of a
cowardly act towards my father."

"You lie, monsieur," said Raoul, coolly.

"You give me the lie, monsieur?" exclaimed De Wardes.

"Why not, if what you assert is untrue?"

"You give me the lie and will not draw your sword?"

"I have resolved, monsieur, not to kill you until Madame
shall have been delivered safely into her husband's hands."

"Kill me! Believe me, monsieur, your schoolmaster's rod does
not kill so easily."

"No," replied Raoul, sternly, "but M. d'Artagnan's sword
kills; and, not only do I possess his sword, but he has
himself taught me how to use it: and with that sword, when a
befitting time arrives, I will avenge his name ---a name you
have dishonored."

"Take care, monsieur," exclaimed De Wardes; "if you do not
immediately give me satisfaction, I will avail myself of
every means to revenge myself."

"Indeed, monsieur," said Buckingham, suddenly, appearing
upon the scene of action, "that is a threat which savors of
assassination, and therefore, ill becomes a gentleman."

"What did you say, my lord?" said De Wardes, turning round
towards him.

"I said, monsieur, that the words you spoken are displeasing
to my English ears."

"Very well, monsieur, if what you say is true," exclaimed De
Wardes, thoroughly incensed, "I at least find in you one who
will not escape me. Understand my words as you like."

"I take them in the manner they cannot but be understood,"
replied Buckingham, with that haughty tone which
characterized him. and which, even in ordinary conversation,
gave a tone of defiance to everything he said; "M. de
Bragelonne is my friend, you insult M. de Bragelonne, and
you shall give me satisfaction for that insult."

De Wardes cast a look upon De Bragelonne, who, faithful to
the character he had assumed, remained calm and unmoved,
even after the duke's defiance.

"It would seem that I did not insult M. de Bragelonne, since
M. de Bragelonne, who carries a sword by his side, does not
consider himself insulted."

"At all events you insult some one."

"Yes, I insulted M. d'Artagnan," resumed De Wardes, who had
observed that this was the only means of stinging Raoul, so
as to awaken his anger.

"That then," said Buckingham, "is another matter."

"Precisely so," said De Wardes, "it is the province of M.
d'Artagnan's friends to defend him."

"I am entirely of your opinion," replied the duke, who had
regained all his indifference of manner; "if M. de
Bragelonne were offended, I could not reasonably be expected
to espouse his quarrel, since he is himself here; but when
you say that it is a quarrel of M. d'Artagnan ---- "

"You will of course leave me to deal with the matter," said
De Wardes.

"Nay, on the contrary, for I draw my sword," said
Buckingham, unsheathing it as he spoke; "for if M.
d'Artagnan injured your father, he rendered, or at least did
all that he could to render, a great service to mine."

De Wardes was thunderstruck.

"M. d'Artagnan," continued Buckingham, "is the bravest
gentleman I know. I shall be delighted, as I owe him many
personal obligations, to settle them with you, by crossing
my sword with yours." At the same moment Buckingham drew his
sword gracefully from its scabbard, saluted Raoul, and put
himself on guard.

De Wardes advanced a step to meet him.

"Stay, gentlemen," said Raoul, advancing towards them, and
placing his own drawn sword between the combatants, "the
affair is hardly worth the trouble of blood being shed
almost in the presence of the princess. M. de Wardes speaks
ill of M. d'Artagnan, with whom he is not even acquainted."

"What, monsieur," said De Wardes, setting his teeth hard
together, and resting the point of his sword on the toe of
his boot, "do you assert that I do not know M. d'Artagnan?"

"Certainly not; you do not know him," replied Raoul, coldly,
"and you are even not aware where he is to he found."

"Not know where he is?"

"Such must be the case, since you fix your quarrel with him
upon strangers, instead of seeking M. d'Artagnan where he is
to be found." De Wardes turned pale. "Well, monsieur,"
continued Raoul, "I will tell you where M. d'Artagnan is: he
is now in Paris; when on duty he is to be met with at the
Louvre, -- when not on duty, in the Rue des Lombards. M.
d'Artagnan can be easily discovered at either of those two
places. Having, therefore, as you assert, so many causes of
complaint against him, show your courage in seeking him out,
and afford him an opportunity of giving you that
satisfaction you seem to ask of every one but of himself."
De Wardes passed his hand across his forehead, which was
covered with perspiration. "For shame, M. de Wardes! so
quarrelsome a disposition is hardly becoming after the
publication of the edicts against duels. Pray think of that;
the king will be incensed at our disobedience, particularly
at such a time, -- and his majesty will be in the right."

"Excuses," murmured De Wardes; "mere pretexts."

"Really, M. De Wardes," resumed Raoul, "such remarks are the
idlest bluster. You know very well that the Duke of
Buckingham is a man of undoubted courage, who has already
fought ten duels, and will probably fight eleven. His name
alone is significant enough. As far as I am concerned, you
are well aware that I can fight also. I fought at Sens, at
Bleneau, at the Dunes in front of the artillery, a hundred
paces in front of the line, while you -- I say this
parenthetically -- were a hundred paces behind it. True it
is, that on that occasion there was far too great a
concourse of persons present for your courage to be
observed, and on that account, perhaps, you did not reveal
it; while here, it would be a display, and would excite
remark -- you wish that others should talk about you, in
what manner you do not care. Do not depend upon me, M. de
Wardes, to assist you in your designs, for I shall certainly
not afford you that pleasure."

"Sensibly observed," said Buckingham, putting up his sword,
"and I ask your forgiveness, M. de Bragelonne, for having
allowed myself to yield to a first impulse."

De Wardes, however, on the contrary, perfectly furious,
bounded forward and raised his sword, threateningly, against
Raoul, who had scarcely time to put himself in a posture of
defense.

"Take care, monsieur," said Bragelonne, tranquilly, "or you
will put out one of my eyes."

"You will not fight, then?" said De Wardes.

"Not at this moment, but this I promise to do; immediately
on our arrival at Paris I will conduct you to M. d'Artagnan,
to whom you shall detail all the causes of complaint you
have against him. M. d'Artagnan will solicit the king's
permission to measure swords with you. The king will yield
his consent, and when you shall have received the
sword-thrust in due course, you will consider, in a calmer
frame of mind, the precepts of the Gospel, which enjoin
forgetfulness of injuries."

"Ah!" exclaimed De Wardes, furious at this imperturbable
coolness, "one can clearly see you are half a bastard, M. de
Bragelonne."

Raoul became as pale as death; his eyes flashed lightning,
causing De Wardes involuntarily to fall back. Buckingham,
also, who had perceived their expression, threw himself
between the two adversaries, whom he had expected to see
precipitate themselves on each other. De Wardes had reserved
this injury for the last; he clasped his sword firmly in his
hand, and awaited the encounter. "You are right, monsieur,"
said Raoul, mastering his emotion, "I am only acquainted
with my father's name, but I know too well that the Comte de
la Fere is too upright and honorable a man to allow me to
fear for a single moment that there is, as you insinuate,
any stain upon my birth. My ignorance, therefore, of my
mother's name is a misfortune for me, and not a reproach.
You are deficient in loyalty of conduct; you are wanting in
courtesy, in reproaching me with misfortune. It matters
little, however, the insult has been given, and I consider
myself insulted accordingly. It is quite understood, then,
that after you shall have received satisfaction from M.
d'Artagnan, you will settle your quarrel with me."

"I admire your prudence, monsieur," replied De Wardes with a
bitter smile; "a little while ago you promised me a
sword-thrust from M. d'Artagnan, and now, after I shall have
received his, you offer me one from yourself."

"Do not disturb yourself," replied Raoul, with concentrated
anger, "in all affairs of that nature, M. d'Artagnan is
exceedingly skillful, and I will beg him as a favor to treat
you as he did your father; in other words, to spare your
life at least, so as to leave me the pleasure, after your
recovery, of killing you outright; for you have the heart of
a viper, M. de Wardes, and in very truth, too many
precautions cannot be taken against you."

"I shall take my precautions against you," said De Wardes,
"be assured of it."

"Allow me, monsieur," said Buckingham, "to translate your
remark by a piece of advice I am about to give M. de
Bragelonne; M. de Bragelonne, wear a cuirass."

De Wardes clenched his hands. "Ah!" said he, "you two
gentlemen intend to wait until you have taken that
precaution before you measure your swords against mine."

"Very well, monsieur," said Raoul, "since you positively
will have it so, let us settle the affair now." And drawing
his sword he advanced towards De Wardes.

"What are you going to do?" said Buckingham.

"Be easy," said Raoul, "it will not be very long."

De Wardes placed himself on his guard; their swords crossed.
De Wardes flew upon Raoul with such impetuosity, that at the
first clashing of the steel blades Buckingham clearly saw
that Raoul was only trifling with his adversary. Buckingham
stepped aside, and watched the combat. Raoul was as calm as
if he were handling a foil, instead of a sword; having
retreated a step, he parried three or four fierce thrusts
which De Wardes made at him, caught the sword of the latter
within his own, and sent it flying twenty paces the other
side of the barrier. Then as De Wardes stood disarmed and
astounded at his defeat Raoul sheathed his sword, seized him
by the collar and the waist-band, and hurled his adversary
to the other end of the barrier, trembling, and mad with
rage.

"We shall meet again," murmured De Wardes, rising from the
ground and picking up his sword.

"I have done nothing for the last hour," said Raoul, "but
say the same thing." Then, turning towards the duke, he
said, "I entreat you to be silent about this affair; I am
ashamed to have gone so far, but my anger carried me away,
and I ask your forgiveness for it; -- forget it, too."

"Dear viscount," said the duke, pressing within his own the
vigorous and valiant hand of his companion, "allow me, on
the contrary, to remember it, and to look after your safety;
that man is dangerous, -- he will kill you."

"My father," replied Raoul, "lived for twenty years under
the menace of a much more formidable enemy, and he still
lives."

"Your father had good friends, viscount."

"Yes," sighed Raoul, "such friends indeed, that none are now
left like them."

"Do not say that, I beg, at the very moment I offer you my
friendship;" and Buckingham opened his arms to embrace
Raoul, who delightedly received the proffered alliance. "In
my family," added Buckingham, "you are aware, M. de
Bragelonne, wee die to save our friends."

"I know it well, duke," replied Raoul.




CHAPTER 88

An Account of what the Chevalier de Lorraine thought of Madame



Nothing further interrupted the journey. Under a pretext
that was little remarked, M. de Wardes went forward in
advance of the others. He took Manicamp with him, for his
equable and dreamy disposition acted as a counterpoise to
his own. It is a subject of remark, that quarrelsome and
restless characters invariably seek the companionship of
gentle, timorous dispositions, as if the former sought, in
the contrast, a repose for their own ill-humor, and the
latter a protection for their weakness. Buckingham and
Bragelonne admitting De Guiche into their friendship, in
concert with him, sang the praises of the princess during
the whole of the journey. Bragelonne had, however, insisted
that their three voices should be in concert, instead of
singing in solo parts, as De Guiche and his rival seemed to
have acquired a dangerous habit of investigation. This style
of harmony pleased the queen-mother exceedingly, but it was
not perhaps so agreeable to the young princess, who was an
incarnation of coquetry, and who, without any fear as far as
her own voice was concerned, sought opportunities of so
perilously distinguishing herself. She possessed one of
those fearless and incautious dispositions that find
gratification in an excess of sensitiveness of feeling, and
for whom, also, danger has a certain fascination. And so her
glances, her smiles, her toilette, an inexhaustible armory
of weapons of offense. were showered on the three young men
with overwhelming force; and, from her well-stored arsenal
issued glances, kindly recognitions, and a thousand other
little charming attentions which were intended to strike at
long range the gentlemen who formed the escort, the
townspeople, the officers of the different cities she passed
through, pages, populace, and servants; it was wholesale
slaughter, a general devastation. By the time Madame arrived
at Paris, she had reduced to slavery about a hundred
thousand lovers: and brought in her train to Paris half a
dozen men who were almost mad about her, and two who were,
indeed, literally out of their minds. Raoul was the only
person who divined the power of this woman's attraction, and
as his heart was already engaged, he arrived in the capital
full of indifference and distrust. Occasionally during the
journey he conversed with the queen of England respecting
the power of fascination which Madame possessed, and the
mother, whom so many misfortunes and deceptions had taught
experience, replied: "Henrietta was sure to be illustrious
in one way or another, whether born in a palace or born in
obscurity; for she is a woman of great imagination,
capricious and self-willed." De Wardes and Manicamp, in
their self-assumed character of courtiers, had announced the
princess's arrival. The procession was met at Nanterre by a
brilliant escort of cavaliers and carriages. It was Monsieur
himself, followed by the Chevalier de Lorraine and by his
favorites, the latter being themselves followed by a portion
of the king's military household, who had arrived to meet
his affianced bride. At St. Germain, the princess and her
mother had changed their heavy traveling carriage, somewhat
impaired by the journey, for a light, richly decorated
chariot drawn by six horses with white and gold harness.
Seated in this open carriage, as though upon a throne, and
beneath a parasol of embroidered silk, fringed with
feathers, sat the young and lovely princess, on whose
beaming face were reflected the softened rose-tints which
suited her delicate skin to perfection. Monsieur, on
reaching the carriage, was struck by her beauty; he showed
his admiration in so marked a manner that the Chevalier de
Lorraine shrugged his shoulders as he listened to his
compliments, while Buckingham and De Guiche were almost
heart-broken. After the usual courtesies had been rendered,
and the ceremony completed, the procession slowly resumed
the road to Paris. The presentations had been carelessly
made, and Buckingham, with the rest of the English
gentlemen, had been introduced to Monsieur, from whom they
had received but very indifferent attention. But, during
their progress, as he observed that the duke devoted himself
with his accustomed earnestness to the carriage-door, he
asked the Chevalier de Lorraine, his inseparable companion,
"Who is that cavalier?"

"He was presented to your highness a short while ago; it is
the handsome Duke of Buckingham."

"Ah, yes, I remember."

"Madame's knight," added the favorite, with an inflection of
the voice which envious minds can alone give to the simplest
phrases.

"What do you say?" replied the prince.

"I said `Madame's knight.'"

"Has she a recognized knight, then?"

"One would think you can judge of that for yourself; look,
only, how they are laughing and flirting. All three of
them."

"What do you mean by all three?"

"Do you not see that De Guiche is one of the party?"

"Yes, I see. But what does that prove?"

"That Madame has two admirers instead of one."

"Thou poison the simplest thing!"

"I poison nothing. Ah! your royal highness's mind is
perverted. The honors of the kingdom of France are being
paid to your wife and you are not satisfied."

The Duke of Orleans dreaded the satirical humor of the
Chevalier de Lorraine whenever it reached a certain degree
of bitterness, and he changed the conversation abruptly.
"The princess is pretty," said he, very negligently, as if
he were speaking of a stranger.

"Yes," replied the chevalier, in the same tone.

"You say `yes' like a `no.' She has very beautiful black
eyes."

"Yes, but small."

"That is so, but they are brilliant. She is tall, and of a
good figure."

"I fancy she stoops a little, my lord?"

"I do not deny it. She has a noble appearance."

"Yes, but her face is thin."

"I thought her teeth beautiful."

"They can easily be seen, for her mouth is large enough.
Decidedly, I was wrong, my lord; you are certainly handsomer
than your wife."

"But do you think me as handsome as Buckingham?"

"Certainly, and he thinks so, too; for look, my lord, he is
redoubling his attentions to Madame to prevent your effacing
the impression he has made."

Monsieur made a movement of impatience, but as he noticed a
smile of triumph pass across the chevalier's lips, he drew
up his horse to a foot-pace. "Why," said he, "should I
occupy myself any longer about my cousin? Do I not already
know her? Were we not brought up together? Did I not see her
at the Louvre when she was quite a child?"

"A great change has taken place in her since then, prince.
At the period you allude to, she was somewhat less
brilliant, and scarcely so proud, either. One evening,
particularly, you may remember, my lord, the king refused to
dance with her, because he thought her plain and badly
dressed!"

These words made the Duke of Orleans frown. It was by no
means flattering for him to marry a princess of whom, when
young, the king had not thought much. He would probably have
retorted, but at this moment De Guiche quitted the carriage
to join the prince. He had remarked the prince and the
chevalier together, and full of anxious attention he seemed
to try and guess the nature of the remarks which they had
just exchanged. The chevalier, whether he had some
treacherous object in view, or from imprudence, did not take
the trouble to dissimulate. "Count," he said, "you're a man
of excellent taste."

"Thank you for the compliment," replied De Guiche; "but why
do you say that?"

"Well, I appeal to his highness."

"No doubt of it," said Monsieur, "and Guiche knows perfectly
well that I regard him as a most finished cavalier."

"Well, since that is decided, I resume. You have been in the
princess's society, count, for the last eight days, have you
not?"

"Yes," replied De Guiche, coloring in spite of himself.

"Well, then, tell us frankly, what do you think of her
personal appearance?"

"Of her personal appearance?" returned De Guiche, stupefied.

"`Yes; of her appearance, of her mind, of herself, in fact."

Astounded by this question, De Guiche hesitated answering.

"Come, come, De Guiche," resumed the chevalier, laughingly,
"tell us your opinion frankly; the prince commands it."

"Yes, yes," said the prince, "be frank."

De Guiche stammered out a few unintelligible words.

"I am perfectly well aware," returned Monsieur, "that the
subject is a delicate one, but you know you can tell me
everything. What do you think of her?"

In order to avoid betraying his real thoughts, De Guiche had
recourse to the only defense which a man taken by surprise
really has, and accordingly told an untruth. "I do not find
Madame," he said, "either good or bad looking, yet rather
good than bad looking."

"What! count," exclaimed the chevalier, "you who went into
such ecstasies and uttered so many exclamations at the sight
of her portrait."

De Guiche colored violently. Very fortunately his horse,
which was slightly restive, enabled him by a sudden plunge
to conceal his agitation. "What portrait!" he murmured,
joining them again. The chevalier had not taken his eyes off
him.

"Yes, the portrait. Was not the miniature a good likeness?"

"I do not remember. I had forgotten the portrait; it quite
escaped my recollection."

"And yet it made a very marked impression upon you," said
the chevalier.

"That is not unlikely."

"Is she witty, at all events?" inquired the duke.

"I believe so, my lord."

"Is M. de Buckingham witty, too?" said the chevalier.

"I do not know."

"My own opinion is, that he must be," replied the chevalier,
"for he makes Madame laugh, and she seems to take no little
pleasure in his society, which never happens to a clever
woman when in the company of a simpleton."

"Of course, then, he must be clever," said De Guiche,
simply.

At this moment Raoul opportunely arrived, seeing how De
Guiche was pressed by his dangerous questioner, to whom he
addressed a remark, and in that way changed the
conversation. The entree was brilliant and joyous.

The king, in honor of his brother, had directed that the
festivities should be on a scale of the greatest possible
magnificence. Madame and her mother alighted at the Louvre,
where, during their exile, they had so gloomily submitted to
obscurity, misery, and privations of every description. That
palace, which had been so inhospitable a residence for the
unhappy daughter of Henry IV., the naked walls, the uneven
floorings, the ceilings matted with cobwebs, the vast
dilapidated chimney-places, the cold hearths on which the
charity extended to them by parliament hardly permitted a
fire to glow, was completely altered in appearance. The
richest hangings and the thickest carpets, glistening
flagstones and pictures, with their richly gilded frames; in
every direction could be seen candelabra, mirrors, and
furniture and fittings of the most sumptuous character; in
every direction, also, were guards of the proudest military
bearing, with floating plumes, crowds of attendants and
courtiers in the ante-chambers and upon the staircases. In
the courtyards, where the grass had formerly been allowed to
luxuriate, as if the ungrateful Mazarin had thought it a
good idea to let the Parisians perceive that solitude and
disorder were, with misery and despair, the fit
accompaniments of fallen monarchy, the immense courtyards,
formerly silent and desolate, were now thronged with
courtiers whose horses were pacing and prancing to and fro.
The carriages were filled with young and beautiful women,
who awaited the opportunity of saluting, as she passed, the
daughter of that daughter of France who, during her
widowhood and exile, had sometimes gone without wood for her
fire, and bread for her table, whom the meanest attendants
at the chateau had treated with indifference and contempt.
And so, Madame Henrietta once more returned to the Louvre,
with her heart more swollen with bitter recollections than
her daughter's, whose disposition was fickle and forgetful,
with triumph and delight. She knew but too well this
brilliant reception was paid to the happy mother of a king
restored to his throne, a throne second to none in Europe,
while the worse than indifferent reception she had before
met with was paid to her, the daughter of Henry IV., as a
punishment for having been unfortunate. After the princesses
had been installed in their apartments and had rested, the
gentlemen who had formed their escort, having, in like
manner, recovered from their fatigue, they resumed their
accustomed habits and occupations. Raoul began by setting
off to see his father, who had left for Blois. He then tried
to see M. d'Artagnan, who, however, being engaged in the
organization of a military household for the king, could not
be found anywhere. Bragelonne next sought out De Guiche, but
the count was occupied in a long conference with his tailors
and with Manicamp, which consumed his whole time. With the
Duke of Buckingham he fared still worse, for the duke was
purchasing horses after horses, diamonds upon diamonds. He
monopolized every embroiderer, jeweler, and tailor that
Paris could boast of. Between De Guiche and himself a
vigorous contest ensued, invariably a courteous one, in
which, in order to insure success, the duke was ready to
spend a million; while the Marechal de Grammont had only
allowed his son sixty thousand francs. So Buckingham laughed
and spent his money. Guiche groaned in despair, and would
have shown it more violently, had it not been for the advice
De Bragelonne gave him.

"A million!" repeated De Guiche daily; "I must submit. Why
will not the marechal advance me a portion of my patrimony?"

"Because you would throw it away," said Raoul.

"What can that matter to him? If I am to die of it, I shall
die of it, and then I shall need nothing further."

"But what need is there to die?" said Raoul.

"I do not wish to be conquered in elegance by an
Englishman."

"My dear count," said Manicamp, "elegance is not a costly
commodity, it is only a very difficult accomplishment."

"Yes, but difficult things cost a good deal of money, and I
have only got sixty thousand francs."

"A very embarrassing state of things, truly," said De
Wardes; "even if you spent as much as Buckingham there is
only nine hundred and forty thousand francs difference."

"Where am I to find them?"

"Get into debt."

"I am in debt already."

"A greater reason for getting further."

Advice like this resulted in De Guiche becoming excited to
such an extent that he committed extravagances where
Buckingham only incurred expenses. The rumor of this
extravagant profuseness delighted the hearts of all the
shopkeepers in Paris, from the hotel of the Duke of
Buckingham to that of the Comte de Grammont nothing but
miracles was attempted. While all this was going on, Madame
was resting herself, and Bragelonne was engaged in writing
to Mademoiselle de la Valliere. He had already dispatched
four letters, and not an answer to any one of them had been
received, when, on the very morning fixed for the marriage
ceremony, which was to take place in the chapel at the
Palais-Royal, Raoul, who was dressing, heard his valet
announce M. de Malicorne. "What can this Malicorne want with
me?" thought Raoul; and then said to his valet, "Let him
wait."

"It is a gentleman from Blois," said the valet.

"Admit him at once," said Raoul, eagerly.

Malicorne entered as brilliant as a star, and wearing a
superb sword at his side. After having saluted Raoul most
gracefully, he said: "M. de Bragelonne, I am the bearer of a
thousand compliments from a lady to you."

Raoul colored. "From a lady," said he, "from a lady of
Blois?"

"Yes, monsieur; from Mademoiselle de Montalais."

"Thank you, monsieur; I recollect you now," said Raoul. "And
what does Mademoiselle de Montalais require of me?"

Malicorne drew four letters from his pocket, which he
offered to Raoul.

"My own letters, is it possible?" he said, turning pale; "my
letters, and the seals unbroken?"

"Monsieur, your letters did not find at Blois the person to
whom they were addressed, and so they are now returned to
you."

"Mademoiselle de la Valliere has left Blois, then?"
exclaimed Raoul.

"Eight days ago."

"Where is she, then?"

"In Paris."

"How was it known that these letters were from me?"

"Mademoiselle de Montalais recognized your handwriting and
your seal," said Malicorne.

Raoul colored and smiled. "Mademoiselle de Montalais is
exceedingly amiable," he said; "she is always kind and
charming."

"Always, monsieur."

"Surely she could give me some precise information about
Mademoiselle de la Valliere. I never could find her in this
immense city."

Malicorne drew another packet from his pocket.

"You may possibly find in this letter what you are anxious
to learn."

Raoul hurriedly broke the seal. The writing was that of
Mademoiselle Aure, and inclosed were these words: -- "Paris,
Palais-Royal. The day of the nuptial blessing."

"What does this mean?" inquired Raoul of Malicorne; "you
probably know."

"I do, monsieur."

"For pity's sake, tell me, then."

"Impossible, monsieur."

"Why so?"

"Because Mademoiselle Aure has forbidden me to do so."

Raoul looked at his strange visitor, and remained silent; --
"At least, tell me whether it is fortunate or unfortunate."

"That you will see."

"You are very severe in your reservations."

"Will you grant me a favor, monsieur?" said Malicorne.

"In exchange for that you refuse me?"

"Precisely."

"What is it?"

"I have the greatest desire to see the ceremony, and I have
no ticket to admit me, in spite of all the steps I have
taken to secure one. Could you get me admitted "

"Certainly."

"Do me this kindness, then, I entreat."

"Most willingly, monsieur; come with me."

"I am exceedingly indebted to you, monsieur," said
Malicorne.

"I thought you were a friend of M. de Manicamp."

"I am, monsieur; but this morning I was with him as he was
dressing, and I let a bottle of blacking fall over his new
dress, and he flew at me sword in hand, so that I was
obliged to make my escape. That is the reason I could not
ask him for a ticket. He wanted to kill me."

"I can well believe it," laughed Raoul. "I know Manicamp is
capable of killing a man who has been unfortunate enough to
commit the crime you have to reproach yourself with, but I
will repair the mischief as far as you are concerned. I will
but fasten my cloak, and shall then be ready to serve you,
not only as a guide, but as your introducer, too."




CHAPTER 89

A Surprise for Madame de Montalais



Madame's marriage was celebrated in the chapel of the
Palais-Royal, in the presence of a crowd of courtiers, who
had been most scrupulously selected. However,
notwithstanding the marked favor which an invitation
indicated, Raoul, faithful to his promise to Malicorne, who
was so anxious to witness the ceremony, obtained admission
for him. After he had fulfilled this engagement, Raoul
approached De Guiche, who, as if in contrast with his
magnificent costume, exhibited a countenance so utterly
dejected, that the Duke of Buckingham was the only one
present who could contend with him as far as pallor and
discomfiture were concerned.

"Take care, count," said Raoul, approaching his friend, and
preparing to support him at the moment the archbishop
blessed the married couple. In fact, the Prince of Conde was
attentively scrutinizing these two images of desolation,
standing like caryatides on either side of the nave of the
church. The count, after that, kept a more careful watch
over himself.

At the termination of the ceremony, the king and queen
passed onward towards the grand reception-room, where Madame
and her suite were to be presented to them. It was remarked
that the king, who had seemed more than surprised at his
sister-in-law's appearance was most flattering in his
compliments to her. Again, it was remarked that the
queen-mother, fixing a long and thoughtful gaze upon
Buckingham, leaned towards Madame de Motteville as though to
ask her, "Do you not see how much he resembles his father?"
and finally it was remarked that Monsieur watched everybody,
and seemed quite discontented. After the reception of the
princess and ambassadors, Monsieur solicited the king's
permission to present to him as well as to Madame the
persons belonging to their new household.

"Are you aware, vicomte," inquired the Prince de Conde of
Raoul, "whether the household has been selected by a person
of taste, and whether there are any faces worth looking at?"

"I have not the slightest idea, monseigneur," replied Raoul.

"You affect ignorance, surely."

"In what way, monseigneur?"

"You are a friend of De Guiche, who is one of the friends of
the prince."

"That may be so, monseigneur; but the matter having no
interest whatever for me, I never questioned De Guiche on
the subject; and De Guiche on his part, never having been
questioned, did not communicate any particulars to me."

"But Manicamp?"

"It is true I saw Manicamp at Havre, and during the journey
here, but I was no more inquisitive with him than I had been
towards De Guiche. Besides, is it likely that Manicamp
should know anything of such matters? for he is a person of
only secondary importance."

"My dear vicomte, do you not know better than that?" said
the prince; "why, it is these persons of secondary
importance who, on such occasions, have all the influence;
and the truth is, that nearly everything has been done
through Manicamp's presentations to De Guiche, and through
De Guiche to Monsieur."

"I assure you, monseigneur, I was ignorant of that," said
Raoul, "and what your highness does me the honor to impart
is perfectly new to me."

"I will most readily believe you, although it seems
incredible; besides, we shall not have long to wait. See,
the flying squadron is advancing, as good Queen Catherine
used to say. Ah! ah! what pretty faces!"

A bevy of young girls at this moment entered the salon,
conducted by Madame de Navailles, and to Manicamp's credit
be it said, if indeed he had taken that part in their
selection which the Prince de Conde assigned him, it was a
display calculated to dazzle those who, like the prince,
could appreciate every character and style of beauty. A
young, fair-complexioned girl, from twenty to one-and-twenty
years of age, and whose large blue eyes flashed, as she
opened them, in the most dazzling manner, walked at the head
of the band and was the first presented.

"Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente," said Madame de Navailles
to Monsieur, who, as he saluted his wife, repeated
"Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente."

"Ah! ah!" said the Prince de Conde to Raoul, "she is
presentable enough."

"Yes," said Raoul, "but has she not a somewhat haughty
style?"

"Bah! we know these airs very well, vicomte; three months
hence she will be tame enough. But look, there, indeed, is a
pretty face."

"Yes," said Raoul, "and one I am acquainted with."

"Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais," said Madame de Navailles.
The name and Christian name were carefully repeated by
Monsieur.

"Great heavens!" exclaimed Raoul, fixing his bewildered gaze
upon the entrance doorway.

"What's the matter?" inquired the prince; "was it
Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais who made you utter such a
`Great heavens'?"

"No, monseigneur, no," replied Raoul, pale and trembling.

"Well, then, if it be not Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais, it
is that pretty blonde who follows her. What beautiful eyes!
She is rather thin, but has fascinations without number."

"Mademoiselle de la Baume le Blanc de la Valliere!" said
Madame de Navailles; and, as this name resounded through his
whole being, a cloud seemed to rise from his breast to his
eyes, so that he neither saw nor heard anything more; and
the prince, finding him nothing more than a mere echo which
remained silent under his railleries, moved forward to
inspect somewhat closer the beautiful girls whom his first
glance had already particularized.

"Louise here! Louise a maid of honor to Madame!" murmured
Raoul, and his eyes, which did not suffice to satisfy his
reason, wandered from Louise to Montalais. The latter had
already emancipated herself from her assumed timidity, which
she only needed for the presentation and for her reverences.

Mademoiselle de Montalais, from the corner of the room to
which she had retired, was looking with no slight confidence
at the different persons present; and, having discovered
Raoul, she amused herself with the profound astonishment
which her own and her friend's presence there caused the
unhappy lover. Her waggish and malicious look, which Raoul
tried to avoid meeting, and which yet he sought inquiringly
from time to time, placed him on the rack. As for Louise,
whether from natural timidity, or some other reason for
which Raoul could not account, she kept her eyes constantly
cast down; intimidated, dazzled, and with impeded
respiration, she withdrew herself as much as possible aside,
unaffected even by the nudges Montalais gave her with her
elbow. The whole scene was a perfect enigma for Raoul, the
key to which he would have given anything to obtain. But no
one was there who could assist him, not even Malicorne; who,
a little uneasy at finding himself in the presence of so
many persons of good birth, and not a little discouraged by
Montalais's bantering glances, had described a circle, and
by degrees succeeded in getting a few paces from the prince,
behind the group of maids of honor, and nearly within reach
of Mademoiselle Aure's voice, she being the planet around
which he, as her attendant satellite, seemed constrained to
gravitate. As he recovered his self-possession, Raoul
fancied he recognized voices on his right hand that were
familiar to him, and he perceived De Wardes, De Guiche, and
the Chevalier de Lorraine, conversing together. It is true
they were talking in tones so low, that the sound of their
words could hardly be heard in the vast apartment. To speak
in that manner from any particular place without bending
down, or turning round, or looking at the person with whom
one may be engaged in conversation, is a talent that cannot
be immediately acquired by newcomers. Long study is needed
for such conversations, which, without a look, gesture, or
movement of the head, seem like the conversation of a group
of statues. In fact, in the king's and queen's grand
assemblies, while their majesties were speaking, and while
every one present seemed to be listening in the midst of the
most profound silence, some of these noiseless conversations
took place, in which adulation was not the prevailing
feature. But Raoul was one among others exceedingly clever
in this art, so much a matter of etiquette, that from the
movement of the lips he was often able to guess the sense of
the words.

"Who is that Montalais?" inquired De Wardes, "and that La
Valliere? What country-town have we had sent here?"

"Montalais?" said the chevalier, -- "oh, I know her; she is
a good sort of a girl, whom we shall find amusing enough. La
Valliere is a charming girl, slightly lame."

"Ah! bah!" said De Wardes.

"Do not be absurd, De Wardes, there are some very
characteristic and ingenious Latin axioms about lame
ladies."

"Gentlemen, gentlemen," said De Guiche, looking at Raoul
with uneasiness, "be a little careful, I entreat you."

But the uneasiness of the count, in appearance at least, was
not needed. Raoul had preserved the firmest and most
indifferent countenance, although he had not lost a word
that passed. He seemed to keep an account of the insolence
and license of the two speakers in order to settle matters
with them at the earliest opportunity.

De Wardes seemed to guess what was passing in his mind, and
continued:

"Who are these young ladies' lovers?"

"Montalais's lover?" said the chevalier.

"Yes, Montalais first."

"You, I, or De Guiche, -- whoever likes, in fact."

"And the other?"

"Mademoiselle de la Valliere?"

"Yes."

"Take care, gentlemen," exclaimed De Guiche, anxious to put
a stop to De Wardes's reply; "take care, Madame is listening
to us."

Raoul thrust his hand up to the wrist into his justaucorps
in great agitation. But the very malignity which he saw was
excited against these poor girls made him take a serious
resolution. "Poor Louise," he thought, "has come here only
with an honorable object in view and under honorable
protection; and I must learn what that object is which she
has in view, and who it is that protects her." And following
Malicorne's maneuver, he made his way toward the group of
the maids of honor. The presentations were soon over. The
king, who had done nothing but look at and admire Madame,
shortly afterwards left the reception-room, accompanied by
the two queens. The Chevalier de Lorraine resumed his place
beside Monsieur, and, as he accompanied him, insinuated a
few drops of the venom he had collected during the last
hour, while looking at some of the faces in the court, and
suspecting that some of their hearts might be happy. A few
of the persons present followed the king as he quitted the
apartment; but such of the courtiers as assumed an
independence of character, and professed a gallantry of
disposition, began to approach the ladies of the court. The
prince paid his compliments to Mademoiselle de
Tonnay-Charente, Buckingham devoted himself to Madame
Chalais and Mademoiselle de Lafayette, whom Madame already
distinguished by her notice, and whom she held in high
regard. As for the Comte de Guiche, who had abandoned
Monsieur as soon as he could approach Madame alone, he
conversed, with great animation, with Madame de Valentinois,
and with Mesdemoiselles de Crequy and de Chatillon.

Amid these varied political and amorous interests, Malicorne
was anxious to gain Montalais's attention; but the latter
preferred talking with Raoul, even if it were only to amuse
herself with his innumerable questions and his astonishment.
Raoul had gone direct to Mademoiselle de la Valliere, and
had saluted her with the profoundest respect, at which
Louise blushed, and could not say a word. Montalais,
however, hurried to her assistance.

"Well, monsieur le vicomte, here we are, you see."

"I do, indeed, see you," said Raoul, smiling, "and it is
exactly because you are here that I wish to ask for some
explanation."

Malicorne approached the group with his most fascinating
smile.

"Go away, Malicorne; really, you are exceedingly
indiscreet." At this remark Malicorne bit his lips and
retired a few steps, without making any reply. His smile,
however, changed its expression, and from its former
frankness, became mocking in its expression.

"You wished for an explanation, M. Raoul?" inquired
Montalais.

"It is surely worth one, I think; Mademoiselle de la
Valliere a maid of honor to Madame!"

"Why should not she be a maid of honor, as well as myself?"
inquired Montalais.

"Pray accept my compliments, young ladies," said Raoul, who
fancied he perceived they were not disposed to answer him in
a direct manner.

"Your remark was not made in a very complimentary manner,
vicomte."

"Mine?"

"Certainly; I appeal to Louise."

"M. de Bragelonne probably thinks the position is above my
condition," said Louise, hesitatingly.

"Assuredly not," replied Raoul, eagerly; "you know very well
that such is not my feeling; were you called upon to occupy
a queen's throne, I should not be surprised; how much
greater reason, then, such a position as this? The only
circumstance that amazes me is that I should have learned it
only to-day, and that by the merest accident."

"That is true," replied Montalais, with her usual giddiness;
"you know nothing about it, and there is no reason you
should. M. de Bragelonne had written several letters to you,
but your mother was the only person who remained behind at
Blois, and it was necessary to prevent these letters falling
into her hands; I intercepted them, and returned them to M.
Raoul, so that he believed you were still at Blois while you
were here in Paris, and had no idea whatever, indeed, how
high you had risen in rank."

"Did you not inform M. Raoul, as I begged you to do?"

"Why should I? to give him an opportunity or making some of
his severe remarks and moral reflections, and to undo what
we had so much trouble in effecting? Certainly not."

"Am I so very severe, then?" said Raoul, inquiringly.

"Besides," said Montalais, "it is sufficient to say that it
suited me. I was about setting off for Paris -- you were
away; Louise was weeping her eyes out; interpret that as you
please; I begged a friend, a protector of mine, who had
obtained the appointment for me, to solicit one for Louise;
the appointment arrived. Louise left in order to get her
costume prepared; as I had my own ready, I remained behind;
I received your letters, and returned them to you, adding a
few words, promising you a surprise. Your surprise is before
you, monsieur, and seems to be a fair one enough; you have
nothing more to ask. Come, M. Malicorne, it is now time to
leave these young people together: they have many things to
talk about; give me your hand; I trust that you appreciate
the honor conferred upon you, M. Malicorne."

"Forgive me," said Raoul, arresting the giddy girl, and
giving to his voice an intonation, the gravity of which
contrasted with that of Montalais; "forgive me, but may I
inquire the name of the protector you speak of; for if
protection be extended towards you, Mademoiselle Montalais,
-- for which, indeed, so many reasons exist," added Raoul,
bowing, "I do not see that the same reasons exist why
Mademoiselle de la Valliere should be similarly cared for."

"But, M. Raoul," said Louise, innocently, "there is no
difference in the matter, and I do not see why I should not
tell it you myself; it was M. Malicorne who obtained it for
me."

Raoul remained for a moment almost stupefied, asking himself
if they were trifling with him; he then turned round to
interrogate Malicorne, but he had been hurried away by
Montalais, and was already at some distance from them.
Mademoiselle de la Valliere attempted to follow her friend,
but Raoul, with gentle authority, detained her.

"Louise, one word, I beg."

"But, M. Raoul," said Louise, blushing, "we are alone. Every
one has left. They will become anxious, and will be looking
for us."

"Fear nothing," said the young man, smiling, "we are neither
of us of sufficient importance for our absence to be
remarked."

"But I have my duty to perform, M. Raoul."

"Do not be alarmed, I am acquainted with these usages of the
court; you will not be on duty until to-morrow; a few
minutes are at your disposal, which will enable you to give
me the information I am about to have the honor to ask you
for."

"How serious you are, M. Raoul!" said Louise.

"Because the circumstances are serious. Are you listening?"

"I am listening; I would only repeat, monsieur, that we are
quite alone."

"You are right," said Raoul, and, offering her his hand, he
led the young girl into the gallery adjoining the
reception-room, the windows of which looked out upon the
courtyard. Every one hurried towards the middle window,
which had a balcony outside, from which all the details of
the slow and formal preparations for departure could be
seen. Raoul opened one of the side windows, and then, being
alone with Louise, said to her: "You know, Louise, that from
my childhood I have regarded you as my sister, as one who
has been the confidante of all my troubles, to whom I have
entrusted all my hopes."

"Yes, M. Raoul," she answered softly; "yes, M. Raoul, I know
that."

"You used, on your side, to show the same friendship towards
me, and had the same confidence in me; why have you not, on
this occasion, been my friend -- why have you shown
suspicion of me?"

Mademoiselle de la Valliere did not answer. "I fondly
thought you loved me," said Raoul, whose voice became more
and more agitated; "I fondly thought you consented to all
the plans we had, together, laid down for our own happiness,
at the time when we wandered up and down the walks of
Cour-Cheverny, under the avenue of poplar trees leading to
Blois. You do not answer me, Louise. Is it possible," he
inquired, breathing with difficulty, "that you no longer
love me?"

"I did not say so," replied Louise, softly.

"Oh! tell me the truth, I implore you. All my hopes in life
are centered in you. I chose you for your gentle and simple
tastes. Do not suffer yourself to be dazzled, Louise, now
that you are in the midst of a court where all that is pure
too soon becomes corrupt -- where all that is young too soon
grows old. Louise, close your ears, so as not to hear what
may be said; shut your eyes, so as not to see the examples
before you; shut your lips, that you may not inhale the
corrupting influences about you. Without falsehood or
subterfuge, Louise, am I to believe what Mademoiselle de
Montalais stated? Louise, did you come to Paris because I
was no longer at Blois?"

La Valliere blushed and concealed her face in her hands.

"Yes, it was so, then!" exclaimed Raoul, delightedly; "that
was, then, your reason for coming here. I love you as I
never yet loved you. Thanks, Louise, for this devotion; but
measures must be taken to place you beyond all insult, to
shield you from every lure. Louise, a maid of honor in the
court of a young princess in these days of free manners and
inconstant affections ---a maid of honor is placed as an
object of attack without having any means of defence
afforded her; this state of things cannot continue, you must
be married in order to be respected."

"Married?"

"Yes, here is my hand, Louise; will you place yours within
it?"

"But your father?"

"My father leaves me perfectly free."

"Yet ---- "

"I understand your scruples, Louise; I will consult my
father."

"Reflect, M. Raoul; wait."

"Wait! it is impossible. Reflect, Louise, when you are
concerned! it would be insulting, -- give me your hand, dear
Louise; I am my own master. My father will consent, I know;
give me your hand, do not keep me waiting thus. One word in
answer, one word only; if not, I shall begin to think that,
in order to change you forever, nothing more was needed than
a single step in the palace, a single breath of favor, a
smile from the queen, a look from the king."

Raoul had no sooner pronounced this latter word, than La
Valliere became as pale as death, no doubt from fear at
seeing the young man excite himself. With a movement as
rapid as thought, she placed both her hands in those of
Raoul, and then fled without adding a syllable; disappearing
without casting a look behind her. Raoul felt his whole
frame tremble at the contact of her hand; he received the
compact as a solemn bargain wrung by affection from her
child-like timidity.




CHAPTER 90

The Consent of Athos



Raoul quitted the Palais-Royal full of ideas that admitted
no delay in execution. He mounted his horse in the
courtyard, and followed the road to Blois, while the
marriage festivities of Monsieur and the princess of England
were being celebrated with exceeding animation by the
courtiers, but to the despair of De Guiche and Buckingham.
Raoul lost no time on the road, and in sixteen hours he
arrived at Blois. As he traveled along, he marshaled his
arguments in the most becoming manner. Fever also is an
argument that cannot be answered, and Raoul had an attack.
Athos was in his study, making additions to his memoirs,
when Raoul entered, accompanied by Grimaud. Keen-sighted and
penetrating, a mere glance at his son told him that
something extraordinary had befallen him.

"You seem to come on a matter of importance," said he to
Raoul, after he had embraced him, pointing to a seat.

"Yes, monsieur," replied the young man; "and I entreat you
to give me the same kind attention that has never yet failed
me."

"Speak, Raoul."

"I present the case to you, monsieur, free from all preface,
for that would be unworthy of you. Mademoiselle de la
Valliere is in Paris as one of Madame's maids of honor. I
have pondered deeply on the matter; I love Mademoiselle de
la Valliere above everything; and it is not proper to leave
her in a position where her reputation, her virtue even, may
be assailed. It is my wish, therefore, to marry her,
monsieur, and I have come to solicit your consent to my
marriage."

While this communication was being made to him, Athos
maintained the profoundest silence and reserve. Raoul, who
had begun his address with an assumption of self-possession,
finished it by allowing a manifest emotion to escape him at
every word. Athos fixed upon Bragelonne a searching look,
overshadowed indeed by a slight sadness.

"You have reflected well upon it?" he inquired.

"Yes, monsieur."

"I believe you are already acquainted with my views
respecting this alliance?"

"Yes, monsieur," replied Raoul, in a low tone of voice, "but
you added, that if I persisted ---- "

"You do persist, then?"

Bragelonne stammered out an almost unintelligible assent.

"Your passion," continued Athos, tranquilly, "must indeed be
very great, since, notwithstanding my dislike to this union,
you persist in wishing it."

Raoul passed his trembling hand across his forehead to
remove the perspiration that collected there. Athos looked
at him, and his heart was touched by pity. He rose and said,
----

"It is no matter. My own personal feelings are not to be
taken into consideration since yours are concerned; you need
my assistance; I am ready to give it. Tell me what you
want."

"Your kind indulgence, first of all, monsieur," said Raoul,
taking hold of his hand.

"You have mistaken my feelings, Raoul, I have more than mere
indulgence for you in my heart."

Raoul kissed as devotedly as a lover could have done the
hand he held in his own.

"Come, come," said Athos, "I am quite ready; what do you
wish me to sign?"

"Nothing whatever, monsieur. only it would be very kind if
you would take the trouble to write to the king to whom I
belong, and solicit his majesty's permission for me to marry
Mademoiselle de la Valliere."

"Well thought, Raoul! After, or rather before myself, you
have a master to consult, that master being the king; it is
loyal in you to submit yourself voluntarily to this double
proof; I will grant your request without delay, Raoul."

The count approached the window, and leaning out, called to
Grimaud, who showed his head from an arbor covered with
jasmine, which he was occupied in trimming.

"My horses, Grimaud," continued the count.

"Why this order, monsieur?" inquired Raoul.

"We shall set off in a few hours."

"Whither?"

"For Paris."

"Paris, monsieur?"

"Is not the king at Paris?"

"Certainly."

"Well, ought we not to go there?"

"Yes, monsieur," said Raoul, almost alarmed by this kind
condescension. "I do not ask you to put yourself to such
inconvenience, and a letter merely ---- "

"You mistake my position, Raoul; it is not respectful that a
simple gentleman, such as I am, should write to his
sovereign. I wish to speak, I ought to speak, to the king,
and I will do so. We will go together, Raoul."

"You overpower me with your kindness, monsieur."

"How do you think his majesty is affected?"

"Towards me, monsieur?"

"Yes."

"Excellently well disposed."

"You know that to be so?" continued the count.

"The king has himself told me so."

"On what occasion?"

"Upon the recommendation of M. d'Artagnan, I believe, and on
account of an affair in the Place de Greve, when I had the
honor to draw my sword in the king's service. I have reason
to believe that, vanity apart, I stand well with his
majesty."

"So much the better."

"But I entreat you, monsieur," pursued Raoul, "not to
maintain towards me your present grave and serious manner.
Do not make me bitterly regret having listened to a feeling
stronger than anything else."

"That is the second time you have said so, Raoul; it was
quite unnecessary, you require my formal consent, and you
have it. We need talk no more on the subject, therefore.
Come and see my new plantations, Raoul."

The young man knew very well, that, after the expression of
his father's wish, no opportunity of discussion was left
him. He bowed his head, and followed his father into the
garden. Athos slowly pointed out to him the grafts, the
cuttings, and the avenues he was planting. This perfect
repose of manner disconcerted Raoul extremely; the affection
with which his own heart was filled seemed so great that the
whole world could hardly contain it. How, then, could his
father's heart remain void, and closed to its influence?
Bragelonne, therefore, collecting all his courage, suddenly
exclaimed, ----

"It is impossible, monsieur, you can have any reason to
reject Mademoiselle de la Valliere? In Heaven's name, she is
so good, so gentle and pure, that your mind, so perfect in
its penetration, ought to appreciate her accordingly. Does
any secret repugnance, or any hereditary dislike, exist
between you and her family?"

"Look, Raoul, at that beautiful lily of the valley," said
Athos; "observe how the shade and the damp situation suit
it, particularly the shadow which that sycamore-tree casts
over it, so that the warmth, and not the blazing heat of the
sun, filters through its leaves."

Raoul stopped, bit his lips, and then with the blood
mantling in his face, he said, courageously, -- "One word of
explanation, I beg, monsieur. You cannot forget that your
son is a man."

"In that case," replied Athos, drawing himself up with
sternness, "prove to me that you are a man, for you do not
show yourself a son. I begged you to wait the opportunity of
forming an illustrious alliance. I would have obtained a
wife for you from the first ranks of the rich nobility. I
wish you to be distinguished by the splendor which glory and
fortune confer, for nobility of descent you have already."

"Monsieur," exclaimed Raoul, carried away by a first
impulse, "I was reproached the other day for not knowing who
my mother was."

Athos turned pale; then, knitting his brows like the
greatest of all the heathen deities: -- "I am waiting to
learn the reply you made," he demanded, in an imperious
manner.

"Forgive me! oh, forgive me," murmured the young man,
sinking at once from the lofty tone he had assumed.

"What was your reply, monsieur?" inquired the count,
stamping his feet upon the ground.

"Monsieur, my sword was in my hand immediately, my adversary
placed himself on guard, I struck his sword over the
palisade, and threw him after it."

"Why did you suffer him to live?"

"The king has prohibited duelling, and, at that moment, I
was an ambassador of the king."

"Very well," said Athos, "but all the greater reason I
should see his majesty."

"What do you intend to ask him?"

"Authority to draw my sword against the man who has
inflicted this injury upon me."

"If I did not act as I ought to have done, I beg you to
forgive me."

"Did I reproach you, Raoul?"

"Still, the permission you are going to ask from the king?"

"I will implore his majesty to sign your marriage-contract,
but on one condition."

"Are conditions necessary with me, monsieur? Command, and
you shall be obeyed."

"On one condition, I repeat," continued Athos; "that you
tell me the name of the man who spoke of your mother in that
way."

"What need is there that you should know his name; the
offense was directed against myself, and the permission once
obtained from his majesty, to revenge it is my affair."

"Tell me his name, monsieur."

"I will not allow you to expose yourself.

"Do you take me for a Don Diego? His name, I say."

"You insist upon it?"

"I demand it."

"The Vicomte de Wardes."

"Very well," said Athos, tranquilly, "I know him. But our
horses are ready, I see; and, instead of delaying our
departure for a couple of hours, we will set off at once.
Come, monsieur."




CHAPTER 91

Monsieur becomes jealous of the Duke of Buckingha



While the Comte de la Fere was proceeding on his way to
Paris, accompanied by Raoul, the Palais-Royal was the
theatre wherein a scene of what Moliere would have called
excellent comedy was being performed. Four days had elapsed
since his marriage, and Monsieur, having breakfasted very
hurriedly, passed into his ante-chamber, frowning and out of
temper. The repast had not been over-agreeable. Madame had
had breakfast served in her own apartment, and Monsieur had
breakfasted almost alone; the Chevalier de Lorraine and
Manicamp were the only persons present at the meal which
lasted three-quarters of an hour without a single syllable
having been uttered. Manicamp, who was less intimate with
his royal highness than the Chevalier de Lorraine, vainly
endeavored to detect, from the expression of the prince's
face, what had made him so ill-humored. The Chevalier de
Lorraine, who had no occasion to speculate about anything,
inasmuch as he knew all, ate his breakfast with that
extraordinary appetite which the troubles of one's friends
but stimulates, and enjoyed at the same time both Monsieur's
ill-humor and the vexation of Manicamp. He seemed delighted,
while he went on eating, to detain the prince, who was very
impatient to move, still at table. Monsieur at times
repented the ascendancy which he had permitted the Chevalier
de Lorraine to acquire over him, and which exempted the
latter from any observance of etiquette towards him.
Monsieur was now in one of those moods, but he dreaded as
much as he liked the chevalier, and contented himself with
nursing his anger without betraying it. Every now and then
Monsieur raised his eyes to the ceiling, then lowered them
towards the slices of pate which the chevalier was
attacking, and finally, not caring to betray his resentment,
he gesticulated in a manner which Harlequin might have
envied. At last, however, Monsieur could control himself no
longer, and at the dessert, rising from the table in
excessive wrath, as we have related, he left the Chevalier
de Lorraine to finish his breakfast as he pleased. Seeing
Monsieur rise from the table, Manicamp, napkin in hand, rose
also. Monsieur ran rather than walked, towards the
ante-chamber, where, noticing an usher in attendance, he
gave him some directions in a low tone of voice. Then
turning back again, but avoiding passing through the
breakfast apartment, he crossed several rooms, with the
intention of seeking the queen-mother in her oratory, where
she usually remained.

It was about ten o'clock in the morning. Anne of Austria was
engaged in writing as Monsieur entered. The queen-mother was
extremely attached to her son, for he was handsome in person
and amiable in disposition. He was, in fact, more
affectionate, and, it might be, more effeminate than the
king. He pleased his mother by those trifling sympathizing
attentions all women are glad to receive. Anne of Austria,
who would have been rejoiced to have had a daughter, almost
found in this, her favorite son, the attentions, solicitude,
and playful manners of a child of twelve years of age. All
the time he passed with his mother he employed in admiring
her arms, in giving his opinion upon her cosmetics, and
receipts for compounding essences, in which she was very
particular; and then, too, he kissed her hands and cheeks in
the most childlike and endearing manner, and had always some
sweetmeats to offer her, or some new style of dress to
recommend. Anne of Austria loved the king, or rather the
regal power in her eldest son; Louis XIV. represented
legitimacy by right divine. With the king, her character was
that of the queen-mother, with Philip she was simply the
mother. The latter knew that, of all places of refuge, a
mother's heart is the most compassionate and surest. When
quite a child he always fled there for refuge when he and
his brother quarrelled, often, after having struck him,
which constituted the crime of high treason on his part,
after certain engagements with hands and nails, in which the
king and his rebellious subject indulged in their
night-dresses respecting the right to a disputed bed, having
their servant Laporte as umpire, -- Philip, conqueror, but
terrified at victory, used to flee to his mother to obtain
reinforcements from her, or at least the assurance of
forgiveness, which Louis XIV. granted with difficulty, and
after an interval. Anne, from this habit of peaceable
intervention, succeeded in arranging the disputes of her
sons, and in sharing, at the same time, all their secrets.
The king, somewhat jealous of that maternal solicitude which
was bestowed particularly upon his brother, felt disposed to
show towards Anne of Austria more submission and attachment
than his character really dictated. Anne of Austria had
adopted this line of conduct especially towards the young
queen. In this manner she ruled with almost despotic sway
over the royal household, and she was already preparing her
batteries to govern with the same absolute authority the
household of her second son. Anne experienced almost a
feeling of pride whenever she saw any one enter her
apartment with woe-begone looks, pale cheeks, or red eyes,
gathering from appearances that assistance was required
either by the weakest or the most rebellious. She was
writing, we have said, when Monsieur entered her oratory,
not with red eyes or pale cheeks, but restless, out of
temper, and annoyed. With an absent air he kissed his
mother's hands, and sat himself down before receiving her
permission to do so. Considering the strict rules of
etiquette established at the court of Anne of Austria, this
forgetfulness of customary civilities was a sign of
preoccupation, especially on Philip's part, who, of his own
accord, observed a respect towards her of a somewhat
exaggerated character. If, therefore, he so notoriously
failed in this regard, there must be a serious cause for it.

"What is the matter, Philip?" inquired Anne of Austria,
turning towards her son.

"A good many things," murmured the prince, in a doleful tone
of voice.

"You look like a man who has a great deal to do," said the
queen, laying down her pen. Philip frowned, but did not
reply. "Among the various subjects which occupy your mind,"
said Anne of Austria, "there must surely be one that absorbs
it more than others."

"One indeed has occupied me more than any other."

"Well, what is it? I am listening."

Philip opened his mouth as if to express all the troubles
his mind was filled with, and which he seemed to be waiting
only for an opportunity of declaring. But he suddenly became
silent, and a sigh alone expressed all that his heart was
overflowing with.

"Come, Philip, show a little firmness," said the
queen-mother. "When one has to complain of anything, it is
generally an individual who is the cause of it. Am I not
right?"

"I do not say no, madame."

"Whom do you wish to speak about? Come, take courage."

"In fact, madame, what I might possibly have to say must be
kept a profound secret; for when a lady is in the case ----
"

"Ah! you are speaking of Madame, then?" inquired the
queen-mother, with a feeling of the liveliest curiosity.

"Yes."

"Well, then, if you wish to speak of Madame, do not hesitate
to do so. I am your mother, and she is no more than a
stranger to me. Yet, as she is my daughter-in-law, rest
assured I shall be interested, even were it for your own
sake alone, in hearing all you may have to say about her."

"Pray tell me, madame, in your turn, whether you have not
remarked something?"

"`Something'! Philip? Your words almost frighten me, from
their want of meaning. What do you mean by `something'?"

"Madame is pretty, certainly."

"No doubt of it."

"Yet not altogether beautiful."

"No, but as she grows older, she will probably become
strikingly beautiful. You must have remarked the change
which a few years have already made in her. Her beauty will
improve more and more; she is now only sixteen years of age.
At fifteen I was, myself, very thin; but even as she is at
present, Madame is very pretty."

"And consequently others have remarked it."

"Undoubtedly, for a woman of ordinary rank is noticed -- and
with still greater reason a princess."

"She has been well brought up, I suppose?"

"Madame Henrietta, her mother, is a woman somewhat cold in
manner, slightly pretentious, but full of noble thoughts.
The princess's education may have been neglected, but her
principles, I believe, are good. Such at least was the
opinion I formed of her when she resided in France; but she
afterwards returned to England, and I am ignorant what may
have occurred there."

"What do you mean?"

"Simply that there are some heads naturally giddy, which are
easily turned by prosperity."

"That is the very word, madame. I think the princess rather
giddy."

"We must not exaggerate, Philip; she is clever and witty,
and has a certain amount of coquetry very natural in a young
woman; but this defect in persons of high rank and position
is a great advantage at a court. A princess who is tinged
with coquetry usually forms a brilliant court around her;
her smile stimulates luxury, arouses wit, and even courage;
the nobles, too, fight better for a prince whose wife is
beautiful."

"Thank you extremely, madame," said Philip, with some
temper; "you really have drawn some very alarming pictures
for me."

"In what respect?" asked the queen, with pretended
simplicity.

"You know, madame," said Philip, dolefully, "whether I had
or had not a very great dislike to getting married."

"Now, indeed, you alarm me. You have some serious cause of
complaint against Madame."

"I do not precisely say it is serious."

"In that case, then, throw aside your doleful looks. If you
show yourself to others in your present state, people will
take you for a very unhappy husband."

"The fact is," replied Philip, "I am not altogether
satisfied as a husband, and I shall not be sorry if others
know it."

"For shame, Philip."

"Well, then, madame, I will tell you frankly that I do not
understand the life I am required to lead."

"Explain yourself."

"My wife does not seem to belong to me; she is always
leaving me for some reason or another. In the mornings there
are visits, correspondences, and toilettes; in the evenings,
balls and concerts."

"You are jealous, Philip."

"I! Heaven forbid. Let others act the part of a jealous
husband, not I. But I am annoyed."

"All these things you reproach your wife with are perfectly
innocent, and, so long as you have nothing of greater
importance ---- "

"Yet, listen; without being very blamable, a woman can
excite a good deal of uneasiness. Certain visitors may be
received, certain preferences shown, which expose young
women to remark, and which are enough to drive out of their
senses even those husbands who are least disposed to be
jealous."

"Ah! now we are coming to the real point at last, and not
without some difficulty. You speak of frequent visits, and
certain preferences -- very good; for the last hour we have
been beating about the bush, and at last you have broached
the true question. This is more serious than I thought. It
is possible, then, that Madame can have given you grounds
for these complaints against her?"

"Precisely so."

"What, your wife, married only four days ago, prefers some
other person to yourself? Take care, Philip, you exaggerate
your grievances; in wishing to prove everything, you prove
nothing."

The prince, bewildered by his mother's serious manner wished
to reply, but he could only stammer out some unintelligible
words.

"You draw back, then?" said Anne of Austria. "I prefer that,
as it is an acknowledgment of your mistake."

"No!" exclaimed Philip, "I do not draw back, and I will
prove all I asserted. I spoke of preference and of visits,
did I not? Well, listen."

Anne of Austria prepared herself to listen, with that love
of gossip which the best woman living and the best mother,
were she a queen even, always finds in being mixed up with
the petty squabbles of a household.

"Well," said Philip, "tell me one thing."

"What is that?"

"Why does my wife retain an English court about her?" said
Philip, as he crossed his arms and looked his mother
steadily in the face, as if he were convinced that she could
not answer the question.

"For a very simple reason," returned Anne of Austria;
"because the English are her countrymen, because they have
expended large sums in order to accompany her to France, and
because it would be hardly polite -- not politic, certainly
-- to dismiss abruptly those members of the English nobility
who have not shrunk from any devotion or from any
sacrifice."

"A wonderful sacrifice indeed," returned Philip, "to desert
a wretched country to come to a beautiful one, where a
greater effect can be produced for a crown than can be
procured elsewhere for four! Extraordinary devotion, really,
to travel a hundred leagues in company with a woman one is
in love with!"

"In love, Philip! think what you are saying. Who is in love
with Madame?"

"The Duke of Buckingham. Perhaps you will defend him, too."

Anne of Austria blushed and smiled at the same time. The
name of the Duke of Buckingham recalled certain
recollections of a very tender and melancholy nature. "The
Duke of Buckingham?" she murmured.

"Yes; one of those arm-chair soldiers ---- "

"The Buckinghams are loyal and brave," said Anne of Austria,
courageously.

"This is too bad; my own mother takes the part of my wife's
lover against me," exclaimed Philip, incensed to such an
extent that his weak organization was effected almost to
tears.

"Philip, my son," exclaimed Anne of Austria, "such an
expression is unworthy of you. Your wife has no lover and,
had she one, it would not be the Duke of Buckingham. The
members of that family, I repeat are loyal and discreet, and
the rights of hospitality are sure to be respected by them."

"The Duke of Buckingham is an Englishman, madame," said
Philip; "and may I ask if the English so very religiously
respect what belongs to princes of France?"

Anne blushed a second time, and turned aside under the
pretext of taking her pen from her desk again, but in
reality to conceal her confusion from her son. "Really,
Philip," she said, "you seem to discover expressions for the
purpose of embarrassing me, and your anger blinds you while
it alarms me; reflect a little."

"There is no need for reflection, madame. I can see with my
own eyes."

"Well, and what do you see?"

"That Buckingham never quits my wife. He presumes to make
presents to her, and she ventures to accept them. Yesterday
she was talking about sachets a la violette; well, our
French perfumers, you know very well, madame, for you have
over and over again asked for it without success -- our
French perfumers, I say, have never been able to procure
this scent. The duke, however, wore about him a sachet a la
violette, and I am sure that the one my wife has came from
him."

"Indeed, monsieur," said Anne of Austria, "you build your
pyramids on needle points; be careful. What harm, I ask you,
can there be in a man giving to his countrywoman a receipt
for a new essence? These strange ideas, I protest, painfully
recall your father to me; he who so frequently and so
unjustly made me suffer."

"The Duke of Buckingham's father was probably more reserved
and more respectful than his son," said Philip,
thoughtlessly, not perceiving how deeply he had wounded his
mother's feelings. The queen turned pale, and pressed her
clenched hands upon her bosom; but, recovering herself
immediately, she said, "You came here with some intention or
another, I suppose?"

"Certainly."

"What was it?"

"I came, madame, intending to complain energetically, and to
inform you that I will not submit to such behavior from the
Duke of Buckingham."

"What do you intend to do, then?"

"I shall complain to the king."

"And what do you expect the king to reply?"

"Very well, then," said Monsieur, with an expression of
stern determination on his countenance, which offered a
singular contrast to its usual gentleness. "Very well. I
will right myself!"

"What do you call righting yourself?" inquired Anne of
Austria, in alarm.

"I will have the Duke of Buckingham quit the princess, I
will have him quit France, and I will see that my wishes are
intimated to him."

"You will intimate nothing of the kind, Philip," said the
queen, "for if you act in that manner, and violate
hospitality to that extent, I will invoke the severity of
the king against you."

"Do you threaten me, madame?" exclaimed Philip, almost in
tears; "do you threaten me in the midst of my complaints!"

"I do not threaten you; I do but place an obstacle in the
path of your hasty anger. I maintain that, to adopt towards
the Duke of Buckingham, or any other Englishman, any
rigorous measure -- to take even a discourteous step towards
him, would be to plunge France and England into the most
disastrous disagreement. Can it be possible that a prince of
the blood, the brother of the king of France, does not know
how to hide an injury, even did it exist in reality, where
political necessity requires it?" Philip made a movement.
"Besides," continued the queen, "the injury is neither true
nor possible, and it is merely a matter of silly jealousy."

"Madame, I know what I know."

"Whatever you may know, I can only advise you to be
patient."

"I am not patient by disposition, madame."

The queen rose, full of severity, and with an icy
ceremonious manner. "Explain what you really require,
monsieur," she said.

"I do not require anything, madame; I simply express what I
desire. If the Duke of Buckingham does not, of his own
accord, discontinue his visits to my apartments I shall
forbid him entrance."

"That is a point you will refer to the king," said Anne of
Austria, her heart swelling as she spoke, and her voice
trembling with emotion.

"But, madame," exclaimed Philip, striking his hands
together, "act as my mother and not as the queen, since I
speak to you as a son; it is simply a matter of a few
minutes' conversation between the duke and myself."

"It is that very conversation I forbid," said the queen,
resuming her authority, "because it is unworthy of you."

"Be it so; I will not appear in the matter, but I shall
intimate my will to Madame."

"Oh!" said the queen-mother, with a melancholy arising from
reflection, "never tyrannize over a wife -- never behave too
haughtily or imperiously towards your own. A woman
unwillingly convinced is unconvinced."

"What is to be done, then? -- I will consult my friends
about it."

"Yes, your double-dealing advisers, your Chevalier de
Lorraine -- your De Wardes. Intrust the conduct of this
affair to me. You wish the Duke of Buckingham to leave, do
you not?"

"As soon as possible, madame."

"Send the duke to me, then; smile upon your wife, behave to
her, to the king, to every one, as usual. But follow no
advice but mine. Alas! I too well know what any household
comes to that is troubled by advisers."

"You shall be obeyed, madame."

"And you will be satisfied at the result. Send the duke to
me."

"That will not be difficult."

"Where do you suppose him to be?"

"At my wife's door, whose levee he is probably awaiting."

"Very well." said Anne of Austria, calmly. "Be good enough
to tell the duke that I shall be charmed if he will pay me a
visit."

Philip kissed his mother's hand, and started off to find the
Duke of Buckingham.




CHAPTER 92

Forever!



The Duke of Buckingham, obedient to the queen-mother's
invitation, presented himself in her apartments half an hour
after the departure of the Duc d'Orleans. When his name was
announced by the gentleman-usher in attendance, the queen,
who was sitting with her elbow resting on a table, and her
head buried in her hands, rose, and smilingly received the
graceful and respectful salutation which the duke addressed
to her. Anne of Austria was still beautiful. It is well
known that at her then somewhat advanced age, her long
auburn hair, perfectly formed hands, and bright ruby lips,
were still the admiration of all who saw her. On the present
occasion, abandoned entirely to a remembrance which evoked
all the past in her heart, she looked almost as beautiful as
in the days of her youth, when her palace was open to the
visits of the Duke of Buckingham's father, then a young and
impassioned man, as well as an unfortunate prince, who lived
for her alone, and died with her name upon his lips. Anne of
Austria fixed upon Buckingham a look so tender in its
expression, that it denoted, not alone the indulgence of
maternal affection, but a gentleness of expression like the
coquetry of a woman who loves.

"Your majesty," said Buckingham, respectfully, "desired to
speak to me."

"Yes, duke," said the queen, in English; "will you be good
enough to sit down?"

The favor which Anne of Austria thus extended to the young
man, and the welcome sound of the language of a country from
which the duke had been estranged since his stay in France,
deeply affected him. He immediately conjectured that the
queen had a request to make of him. After having abandoned
the first few moments to the irrepressible emotions she
experienced, the queen resumed the smiling air with which
she had received him. "What do you think of France?" she
said, in French.

"It is a lovely country, madame," replied the duke.

"Had you ever seen it before?"

"Once only, madame."

"But, like all true Englishmen, you prefer England?"

"I prefer my own native land to France," replied the duke;
"but if your majesty were to ask me which of the two cities,
London or Paris, I should prefer as a residence, I should be
forced to answer, Paris."

Anne of Austria observed the ardent manner with which these
words had been pronounced. "I am told my lord, you have rich
possessions in your own country and that you live in a
splendid and time-honored palace."

"It was my father's residence," replied Buckingham, casting
down his eyes.

"Those are indeed great advantages and souvenirs," replied
the queen, alluding, in spite of herself, to recollections
from which it is impossible voluntarily to detach one's
self.

"In fact," said the duke, yielding to the melancholy
influence of this opening conversation, "sensitive persons
live as much in the past or the future, as in the present."

"That is very true," said the queen, in a low tone of voice.
"It follows, then, my lord,' she added, "that you, who are a
man of feeling, will soon quit France in order to shut
yourself up with your wealth and your relics of the past."

Buckingham raised his head and said, "I think not, madame."

"What do you mean?"

"On the contrary, I think of leaving England in order to
take up my residence in France."

It was now Anne of Austria's turn to exhibit surprise.
"Why?" she said. "Are you not in favor with the new king?"

"Perfectly so, madame, for his majesty's kindness to me is
unbounded."

"It cannot," said the queen, "be because your fortune has
diminished, for it is said to be enormous."

"My income, madame, has never been so large."

"There is some secret cause, then?"

"No, madame," said Buckingham, eagerly, "there is nothing
secret in my reason for this determination. I prefer
residence in France; I like a court so distinguished by its
refinement and courtesy; I like the amusements, somewhat
serious in their nature, which are not the amusements of my
own country, and which are met with in France."

Anne of Austria smiled shrewdly. "Amusements of a serious
nature?" she said. "Has your Grace well reflected on their
seriousness?" The duke hesitated. "There is no amusement so
serious," continued the queen, "as to prevent a man of your
rank ---- "

"Your majesty seems to insist greatly on that point,"
interrupted the duke.

"Do you think so, my lord?"

"If you will forgive me for saying so, it is the second time
you have vaunted the attractions of England at the expense
of the delight which all experience who live in France."

Anne of Austria approached the young man, and placing her
beautiful hand upon his shoulder, which trembled at the
touch, said, "Believe me, monsieur, nothing can equal a
residence in one's own native country. I have very
frequently had occasion to regret Spain. I have lived long,
my lord, very long for a woman, and I confess to you, that
not a year has passed I have not regretted Spain."

"Not one year, madame?" said the young duke coldly. "Not one
of those years when you reigned Queen of Beauty -- as you
still are, indeed?"

"A truce to flattery, duke, for I am old enough to be your
mother." She emphasized these latter words in a manner, and
with a gentleness, which penetrated Buckingham's heart.
"Yes," she said, "I am old enough to be your mother; and for
this reason, I will give you a word of advice."

"That advice being that I should return to London?" he
exclaimed.

"Yes, my lord."

The duke clasped his hands with a terrified gesture which
could not fail of its effect upon the queen, already
disposed to softer feelings by the tenderness of her own
recollections. "It must be so," added the queen.

"What!" he again exclaimed, "am I seriously told that I must
leave, -- that I must exile myself, -- that I am to flee at
once?"

"Exile yourself, did you say? One would fancy France was
your native country."

"Madame, the country of those who love is the country of
those whom they love."

"Not another word, my lord; you forget whom you are
addressing."

Buckingham threw himself on his knees. "Madame, you are the
source of intelligence, of goodness, and of compassion; you
are the first person in this kingdom, not only by your rank,
but the first person in the world on account of your angelic
attributes. I have said nothing, madame. Have I, indeed,
said anything you should answer with such a cruel remark?
What have I betrayed?"

"You have betrayed yourself," said the queen, in a low tone
of voice.

"I have said nothing, -- I know nothing."

"You forget you have spoken and thought in the presence of a
woman, and besides ---- "

"Besides," said the duke, "no one knows you are listening to
me."

"On the contrary, it is known; you have all the defects and
all the qualities of youth."

"I have been betrayed or denounced, then?"

"By whom?"

"By those who, at Havre, had, with infernal perspicacity,
read my heart like an open book."

"I do not know whom you mean."

"M. de Bragelonne, for instance."

"I know the name without being acquainted with the person to
whom it belongs. M. de Bragelonne has said nothing."

"Who can it be, then? If any one, madame, had had the
boldness to notice in me that which I do not myself wish to
behold ---- "

"What would you do, duke?"

"There are secrets which kill those who discover them."

"He, then, who has discovered your secret, madman that you
are, still lives; and, what is more, you will not slay him,
for he is armed on all sides, -- he is a husband, a jealous
man, -- he is the second gentleman in France, -- he is my
son, the Duc d'Orleans."

The duke turned pale as death. "You are very cruel, madame,"
he said.

"You see, Buckingham," said Anne of Austria, sadly, "how you
pass from one extreme to another, and fight with shadows,
when it would seem so easy to remain at peace with
yourself."

"If we fight, madame, we die on the field of battle,"
replied the young man, gently, abandoning himself to the
most gloomy depression.

Anne ran towards him and took him by the hand. "Villiers,"
she said, in English, with a vehemence of tone which nothing
could resist, "what is it you ask? Do you ask a mother to
sacrifice her son, -- a queen to consent to the dishonor of
her house? Child that you are, do not dream of it. What! in
order to spare your tears am I to commit these crimes?
Villiers! you speak of the dead; the dead, at least, were
full of respect and submission; they resigned themselves to
an order of exile; they carried their despair away with them
in their hearts, like a priceless possession, because the
despair was caused by the woman they loved, and because
death, thus deceptive, was like a gift or a favor conferred
upon them."

Buckingham rose, his features distorted, and his hands
pressed against his heart. "You are right, madame," he said,
"but those of whom you speak had received their order of
exile from the lips of the one whom they loved; they were
not driven away; they were entreated to leave, and were not
laughed at."

"No," murmured Anne of Austria, "they were not forgotten.
But who says you are driven away, or that you are exiled?
Who says that your devotion will not be remembered? I do not
speak on any one's behalf but my own, when I tell you to
leave. Do me this kindness -- grant me this favor; let me,
for this also, be indebted to one of your name."

"It is for your sake, then, madame?"

"For mine alone."

"No one whom I shall leave behind me will venture to mock,
-- no prince even who shall say, `I required it.'"

"Listen to me, duke," and hereupon the dignified features of
the queen assumed a solemn expression. "I swear to you that
no one commands in this matter but myself. I swear to you
that, not only shall no one either laugh or boast in any
way, but no one even shall fail in the respect due to your
rank. Rely upon me, duke, as I rely upon you."

"You do not explain yourself, madame; my heart is full of
bitterness, and I am in utter despair; no consolation,
however gentle and affectionate, can afford me relief."

"Do you remember your mother, duke?" replied the queen, with
a winning smile.

"Very slightly, madame; yet I remember how she used to cover
me with her caresses and her tears whenever I wept."

"Villiers," murmured the queen, passing her arm round the
young man's neck, "look upon me as your mother, and believe
that no one shall ever make my son weep."

"I thank you, madame," said the young man, affected and
almost suffocated by his emotion, "I feel there is indeed
still room in my heart for a gentler and nobler sentiment
than love."

The queen-mother looked at him and pressed his hand. "Go,"
she said.

"When must I leave? Command me."

"At any time that may suit you, my lord," resumed the queen;
"you will choose your own day of departure. Instead,
however, of setting off to-day, as you would doubtless wish
to do, or to-morrow, as others may have expected, leave the
day after to-morrow, in the evening; but announce to-day
that it is your wish to leave."

"My wish?" murmured the young duke.

"Yes, duke."

"And shall I never return to France?"

Anne of Austria reflected for a moment, seemingly absorbed
in sad and serious thought. "It would be a consolation for
me," she said, "if you were to return on the day when I
shall be carried to my final resting-place at Saint-Denis
beside the king, my husband."

"Madame, you are goodness itself; the tide of prosperity is
setting in on you; your cup brims over with happiness, and
many long years are yet before you."

"In that case you will not come for some time, then," said
the queen, endeavoring to smile.

"I shall not return," said Buckingham, "young as I am. Death
does not reckon by years; it is impartial; some die young,
some reach old age."

"I will not harbor any sorrowful ideas, duke. Let me comfort
you; return in two years. I perceive from your face that the
very idea which saddens you so much now, will have
disappeared before six months have passed, and will be not
only dead but forgotten in the period of absence I have
assigned you.'

"I think you judged me better a little while ago madame,"
replied the young man, "when you said that time is powerless
against members of the family of Buckingham."

"Silence," said the queen, kissing the duke upon the
forehead with an affection she could not restrain. "Go, go;
spare me and forget yourself no longer. I am the queen; you
are the subject of the king of England. King Charles awaits
your return. Adieu, Villiers, -- farewell."

"Forever!" replied the young man, and he fled, endeavoring
to master his emotion.

Anne leaned her head upon her hands, and then looking at
herself in the glass, murmured, "It has been truly said,
that a woman who has truly loved is always young, and that
the bloom of twenty years ever lies concealed in some secret
cloister of the heart."




CHAPTER 93

King Louis XIV. does not think Mademoiselle de la
Valliere either rich enough or pretty enough for a
Gentleman of the Rank of the Vicomte de Bragelonne



Raoul and the Comte de la Fere reached Paris the evening of
the same day on which Buckingham had held the conversation
with the queen-mother. The count had scarcely arrived, when,
through Raoul, he solicited an audience of the king. His
majesty had passed a portion of the morning in looking over,
with Madame and the ladies of the court, various goods of
Lyons manufacture, of which he had made his sister-in-law a
present. A court dinner had succeeded, then cards, and
afterwards, according to his usual custom, the king, leaving
the card-tables at eight o'clock, passed into his cabinet in
order to work with M. Colbert and M. Fouquet. Raoul entered
the ante-chamber at the very moment the two ministers
quitted it, and the king, perceiving him through the
half-closed door, said, "What do you want, M. de
Bragelonne?"

The young man approached: "An audience, sire," he replied,
"for the Comte de la Fere, who has just arrived from Blois,
and is most anxious to have an interview with your majesty."

"I have an hour to spare between cards and supper," said the
king. "Is the Comte de la Fere at hand?"

"He is below, and awaits your majesty's permission."

"Let him come up at once," said the king, and five minutes
afterwards Athos entered the presence of Louis XIV. He was
received by the king with that gracious kindness of manner
which Louis, with a tact beyond his years, reserved for the
purpose of gaining those who were not to be conquered by
ordinary favors. "Let me hope, comte," said the king, "that
you have come to ask me for something."

"I will not conceal from your majesty," replied the comte,
"that I am indeed come for that purpose."

"That is well," said the king, joyously.

"It is not for myself, sire."

"So much the worse; but, at least, I will do for your
protege what you refuse to permit me to do for you."

"Your majesty encourages me. I have come to speak on behalf
of the Vicomte de Bragelonne."

"It is the same as if you spoke on your own behalf, comte."

"Not altogether so, sire. I am desirous of obtaining from
your majesty that which I cannot ask for myself. The vicomte
thinks of marrying."

"He is still very young; but that does not matter. He is an
eminently distinguished man, I will choose a wife for him."

"He has already chosen one, sire, and only awaits your
consent."

"It is only a question, then, of signing the
marriage-contract?" Athos bowed. "Has he chosen a wife whose
fortune and position accord with your own anticipations?"

Athos hesitated for a moment. "His affianced wife is of good
birth, but has no fortune."

"That is a misfortune we can remedy."

"You overwhelm me with gratitude, sire; but your majesty
will permit me to offer a remark?"

"Do so, comte."

"Your majesty seems to intimate an intention of giving a
marriage-portion to this young lady."

"Certainly."

"I should regret, sire, if the step I have taken towards
your majesty should be attended by this result."

"No false delicacy, comte; what is the bride's name?"

"Mademoiselle de la Baume le Blanc de la Valliere," said
Athos, coldly."

"I seem to know that name," said the king, as if reflecting;
"there was a Marquis de la Valliere"

"Yes, sire, it is his daughter."

"But he died, and his widow married again M. de Saint-Remy,
I think, steward of the wager Madame's household."

"Your majesty is correctly informed."

"More than that, the young lady has lately become one of the
princess's maids of honor."

"Your majesty is better acquainted with her history than I
am."

The king again reflected, and glancing at the comte's
anxious countenance, said: "The young lady does not seem to
me to be very pretty, comte."

"I am not quite sure," replied Athos.

"I have seen her, but she hardly struck me as being so."

"She seems to be a good and modest girl, but has little
beauty, sire."

"Beautiful fair hair, however."

"I think so."

"And her blue eyes are tolerably good."

"Yes, sire."

"With regard to beauty, then, the match is but an ordinary
one. Now for the money side of the question."

"Fifteen to twenty thousand francs dowry at the very
outside, sire; the lovers are disinterested enough; for
myself, I care little for money."

"For superfluity, you mean; but a needful amount is of
importance. With fifteen thousand francs, without landed
property, a woman cannot live at court. We will make up the
deficiency; I will do it for De Bragelonne." The king again
remarked the coldness with which Athos received the remark.

"Let us pass from the question of money to that of rank,"
said Louis XIV.; "the daughter of the Marquis de la
Valliere, that is well enough; but there is that excellent
Saint-Remy, who somewhat damages the credit of the family;
and you, comte, are rather particular, I believe, about your
own family."

"Sire, I no longer hold to anything but my devotion to your
majesty."

The king again paused. "A moment, comte. You have surprised
me in no little degree from the beginning of your
conversation. You came to ask me to authorize a marriage,
and you seem greatly disturbed in having to make the
request. Nay, pardon me, comte, but I am rarely deceived,
young as I am; for while with some persons I place my
friendship at the disposal of my understanding, with others
I call my distrust to my aid, by which my discernment is
increased. I repeat that you do not prefer your request as
though you wished it success."

"Well, sire, that is true."

"I do not understand you, then; refuse."

"Nay, sire; I love De Bragelonne with my whole heart; he is
smitten with Mademoiselle de la Valliere, he weaves dreams
of bliss for the future; I am not one who is willing to
destroy the illusions of youth. This marriage is
objectionable to me, but I implore your majesty to consent
to it forthwith, and thus make Raoul happy."

"Tell me, comte, is she in love with him?"

"If your majesty requires me to speak candidly, I do not
believe in Mademoiselle de la Valliere's affection; the
delight at being at court, the honor of being in the service
of Madame, counteract in her head whatever affection she may
happen to have in her heart; it is a marriage similar to
many others which already exist at court; but De Bragelonne
wishes it, and so let it be."

"And yet you do not resemble those easy-tempered fathers who
volunteer as stepping-stones for their children," said the
king.

"I am determined enough against the viciously disposed, but
not so against men of upright character. Raoul is suffering;
he is in great distress of mind: his disposition, naturally
light and cheerful, has become gloomy and melancholy. I do
not wish to deprive your majesty of the services he may be
able to render."

"I understand you," said the king; "and what is more, I
understand your heart, too, comte."

"There is no occasion, therefore," replied the comte, "to
tell your majesty that my object is to make these children,
or rather Raoul, happy."

"And I, too, as much as yourself, comte, wish to secure M.
de Bragelonne's happiness."

"I only await your majesty's signature. Raoul will have the
honor of presenting himself before your majesty to receive
your consent."

"You are mistaken, comte," said the king, firmly; "I have
just said that I desire to secure M. de Bragelonne's
happiness, and from the present moment, therefore, I oppose
his marriage."

"But, sire," exclaimed Athos, "your majesty has promised!"

"Not so, comte, I did not promise you, for it is opposed to
my own views."

"I appreciate your majesty's considerate and generous
intentions in my behalf; but I take the liberty of recalling
to you that I undertook to approach you as an ambassador."

"An ambassador, comte, frequently asks, but does not always
obtain what he asks."

"But, sire, it will be such a blow for De Bragelonne."

"My hand shall deal the blow; I will speak to the vicomte."

"Love, sir, is overwhelming in its might."

"Love can be resisted, comte. I myself can assure you of
that."

"When one has the soul of a king, -- your own, for instance,
sire."

"Do not make yourself uneasy on the subject. I have certain
views for De Bragelonne. I do not say that he shall not
marry Mademoiselle de la Valliere, but I do not wish him to
marry so young; I do not wish him to marry her until she has
acquired a fortune; and he, on his side, no less deserves
favor, such as I wish to confer upon him. In a word, comte,
I wish them to wait."

"Yet once more, sire."

"Comte, you told me you came to request a favor."

"Assuredly, sire."

"Grant me one, then, instead; let us speak no longer upon
this matter. It is probable that, before long, war may be
declared. I require men about me who are unfettered. I
should hesitate to send under fire a married man, or a
father of a family. I should hesitate also, on De
Bragelonne's account, to endow with a fortune, without some
sound reason for it, a young girl, a perfect stranger; such
an act would sow jealousy amongst my nobility." Athos bowed,
and remained silent.

"Is that all you wished to ask me?" added Louis XIV.

"Absolutely all, sire; and I take my leave of your majesty.
Is it, however, necessary that I should inform Raoul?"

"Spare yourself the trouble and annoyance. Tell the vicomte
that at my levee to-morrow morning I will speak to him. I
shall expect you this evening, comte, to join my
card-table."

"I am in traveling-costume, sire."

"A day will come, I hope, when you will leave me no more.
Before long, comte, the monarchy will be established in such
a manner as to enable me to offer a worthy hospitality to
men of your merit."

"Provided, sire, a monarch reigns grandly in the hearts of
his subjects, the palace he inhabits matters little, since
he is worshipped in a temple." With these words Athos left
the cabinet, and found De Bragelonne, who was awaiting him
anxiously.

"Well, monsieur?" said the young man.

"The king, Raoul, is well intentioned towards us both; not,
perhaps, in the sense you suppose, but he is kind, and
generously disposed to our house."

"You have bad news to communicate to me, monsieur," said the
young man, turning very pale.

"The king himself will inform you tomorrow morning that it
is not bad news."

"The king has not signed, however?"

"The king wishes himself to settle the terms of the
contract, and he desires to make it so grand that he
requires time for consideration. Throw the blame rather on
your own impatience, than on the king's good feeling towards
you."

Raoul, in utter consternation, on account of his knowledge
of the count's frankness as well as his diplomacy, remained
plunged in dull and gloomy stupor.

"Will you not go with me to my lodgings?" said Athos.

"I beg your pardon, monsieur; I will follow you," he
stammered out, following Athos down the staircase.

"Since I am here," said Athos, suddenly, "cannot I see M.
d'Artagnan?"

"Shall I show you his apartments?" said De Bragelonne.

"Do so."

"They are on the opposite staircase."

They altered their course, but on reaching the landing of
the grand staircase, Raoul perceived a servant in the Comte
de Guiche's livery, who ran towards him as soon as he heard
his voice.

"What is it?" said Raoul.

"This note, monsieur. My master heard of your return and
wrote to you without delay; I have been looking for you for
the last half-hour."

Raoul approached Athos as he unsealed the letter. saying,
"With your permission, monsieur."

"Certainly."

"Dear Raoul," wrote the Comte de Guiche, "I have an affair
in hand which requires immediate attention; I know you have
returned, come to me as soon as possible."

Hardly had he finished reading it, when a servant in the
livery of the Duke of Buckingham, turning out of the
gallery, recognized Raoul, and approached him respectfully,
saying, "From his Grace, monsieur."

"Well, Raoul, as I see you are already as busy as a general
of an army, I shall leave you, and will find M. d'Artagnan
myself."

"You will excuse me, I trust," said Raoul.

"Yes, yes, I excuse you; adieu, Raoul; you will find me at
my apartments until to-morrow; during the day I may set out
for Blois, unless I have orders to the contrary."

"I shall present my respects to you to-morrow, monsieur."

As soon as Athos had left, Raoul opened Buckingham's letter.



"Monsieur de Bragelonne," it ran, "You are, of all the
Frenchmen I have known, the one with whom I am most pleased;
I am about to put your friendship to the proof. I have
received a certain message, written in very good French. As
I am an Englishman, I am afraid of not comprehending it very
clearly. The letter has a good name attached to it, and that
is all I can tell you. Will you be good enough to come and
see me? for I am told you have arrived from Blois.

"Your devoted

"Villiers, Duke of Buckingham."



"I am going now to see your master," said Raoul to De
Guiche's servant, as he dismissed him; "and I shall be with
the Duke of Buckingham in an hour," he added, dismissing
with these words the duke's messenger.




CHAPTER 94

Sword-thrusts in the Water



Raoul, on betaking himself to De Guiche, found him
conversing with De Wardes and Manicamp. De Wardes, since the
affair of the barricade, had treated Raoul as a stranger;
they behaved as if they were not acquainted. As Raoul
entered, De Guiche walked up to him; and Raoul, as he
grasped his friend's hand, glanced rapidly at his two
companions, hoping to be able to read on their faces what
was passing in their minds. De Wardes was cold and
impenetrable; Manicamp seemed absorbed in the contemplation
of some trimming to his dress. De Guiche led Raoul to an
adjoining cabinet, and made him sit down, saying, "How well
you look!"

"That is singular," replied Raoul, "for I am far from being
in good spirits."

"It is your case, then, Raoul, as it is my own, -- our love
affairs do not progress."

"So much the better, count, as far as you are concerned; the
worst news would be good news."

"In that case do not distress yourself, for, not only am I
very unhappy, but, what is more, I see others about me who
are happy."

"Really, I do not understand you," replied Raoul; "explain
yourself."

"You will soon learn. I have tried, but in vain, to overcome
the feeling you saw dawn in me, increase and take entire
possession of me. I have summoned all your advice and my own
strength to my aid. I have well weighed the unfortunate
affair in which I have embarked; I have sounded its depths;
that it is an abyss, I am aware, but it matters little, for
I shall pursue my own course."

"This is madness, De Guiche! you cannot advance another step
without risking your own ruin to-day, perhaps your life
to-morrow."

"Whatever may happen, I have done with reflections; listen."

"And you hope to succeed; you believe that Madame will love
you?"

"Raoul, I believe nothing; I hope, because hope exists in
man, and never abandons him till death."

"But, admitting that you obtain the happiness you covet,
even then, you are more certainly lost than if you had
failed in obtaining it."

"I beseech you, Raoul, not to interrupt me any more; you
could never convince me, for I tell you beforehand, I do not
wish to be convinced; I have gone so far I cannot recede; I
have suffered so much, death itself would be a boon. I no
longer love to madness, Raoul, I am being engulfed by a
whirlpool of jealousy."

Raoul struck his hands together with an expression
resembling anger. "Well?" said he.

"Well or ill matters little. This is what I claim from you,
my friend, my almost brother. During the last three days
Madame has been living in a perfect intoxication of gayety.
On the first day, I dared not look at her; I hated her for
not being as unhappy as myself. The next day I could not
bear her out of my sight; and she, Raoul -- at least I
thought I remarked it -- she looked at me, if not with pity,
at least with gentleness. But between her looks and mine, a
shadow intervened; another's smile invited hers. Beside her
horse another's always gallops, which is not mine; in her
ear another's caressing voice, not mine, unceasingly
vibrates. Raoul, for three days past my brain has been on
fire; flame, not blood, courses through my veins. That
shadow must be driven away, that smile must be quenched;
that voice must be silenced."

"You wish Monsieur's death," exclaimed Raoul.

"No, no, I am not jealous of the husband; I am jealous of
the lover."

"Of the lover?" said Raoul.

"Have you not observed it, you who were formerly so
keen-sighted?"

"Are you jealous of the Duke of Buckingham?"

"To the very death."

"Again jealous?"

"This time the affair will be easy to arrange between us; I
have taken the initiative, and have sent him a letter."

"It was you, then, who wrote to him?"

"How do you know that?"

"I know it, because he told me so. Look at this;" and he
handed De Guiche the letter he had received nearly at the
same moment as his own. De Guiche read it eagerly, and said,
"He is a brave man, and more than that, a gallant man."

"Most certainly the duke is a gallant man; I need not ask if
you wrote to him in a similar style."

"He will show you my letter when you call on him on my
behalf."

"But that is almost out of the question."

"What is?"

"That I shall call on him for that purpose."

"Why so?"

"The duke consults me as you do."

"I suppose you will give me the preference! Listen to me,
Raoul, I wish you to tell his Grace -- it is a very simple
matter -- that to-day, to-morrow, the following day, or any
other day he may choose. I will meet him at Vincennes."

"Reflect, De Guiche."

"I thought I told you I have reflected."

"The duke is a stranger here; he is on a mission which
renders his person inviolable.... Vincennes is close to the
Bastile."

"The consequences concern me."

"But the motive for this meeting? What motive do you wish me
to assign?"

"Be perfectly easy on that score, he will not ask any. The
duke must be as sick of me as I am of him. I implore you,
therefore, seek the duke, and if it is necessary to entreat
him to accept my offer, I will do so."

"That is useless. The duke has already informed me that he
wishes to speak to me. The duke is now playing cards with
the king. Let us both go there. I will draw him aside in the
gallery: you will remain aloof. Two words will be
sufficient."

"That is well arranged. I will take De Wardes to keep me in
countenance."

"Why not Manicamp? De Wardes can join us at any time; we can
leave him here."

"Yes, that is true."

"He knows nothing?"

"Positively nothing. You continue still on an unfriendly
footing, then?"

"Has he not told you anything?"

"Nothing."

"I do not like the man, and, as I never liked him, the
result is, that I am on no worse terms with him to-day than
I was yesterday."

"Let us go, then."

The four descended the stairs. De Guiche's carriage was
waiting at the door, and took them to the Palais-Royal. As
they were going along, Raoul was engaged in devising his
scheme of action. The sole depositary of two secrets, he did
not despair of concluding some arrangement between the two
parties. He knew the influence he exercised over Buckingham,
and the ascendency he had acquired over De Guiche, and
affairs did not look utterly hopeless. On their arrival in
the gallery, dazzling with the blaze of light, where the
most beautiful and illustrious women of the court moved to
and fro, like stars in their own atmosphere, Raoul could not
prevent himself for a moment forgetting De Guiche in order
to seek out Louise, who, amidst her companions, like a dove
completely fascinated, gazed long and fixedly upon the royal
circle, which glittered with jewels and gold. All its
members were standing, the king alone being seated. Raoul
perceived Buckingham, who was standing a few places from
Monsieur, in a group of French and English, who were
admiring his aristocratic carriage and the incomparable
magnificence of his costume. Some of the older courtiers
remembered having seen his father, but their recollections
were not prejudicial to the son.

Buckingham was conversing with Fouquet, who was talking with
him aloud about Belle-Isle. "I cannot speak to him at
present," said Raoul.

"Wait, then, and choose your opportunity, but finish
everything speedily. I am on thorns."

"See, our deliverer approaches," said Raoul, perceiving
D'Artagnan, who, magnificently dressed in his new uniform of
captain of the musketeers, had just made his entry in the
gallery; and he advanced towards D'Artagnan.

"The Comte de la Fere has been looking for you, chevalier,"
said Raoul.

"Yes," replied D'Artagnan, "I have just left him."

"I thought you would have passed a portion of the evening
together."

"We have arranged to meet again."

As he answered Raoul, his absent looks were directed on all
sides, as if seeking some one in the crowd, or looking for
something in the room. Suddenly his gaze became fixed, like
that of an eagle on its prey. Raoul followed the direction
of his glance, and noticed that De Guiche and D'Artagnan
saluted each other, but he could not distinguish at whom the
captain's inquiring and haughty glance was aimed.

"Chevalier," said Raoul, "there is no one here but yourself
who can render me a service."

"What is it, my dear vicomte?"

"It is simply to go and interrupt the Duke of Buckingham, to
whom I wish to say two words, and, as the duke is conversing
with M. Fouquet, you understand that it would not do for me
to throw myself into the middle of the conversation."

"Ah, ah, is M. Fouquet there?" inquired D'Artagnan.

"Do you not see him?"

"Yes, now I do. But do you think I have a greater right than
you have?"

"You are a more important personage."

"Yes, you're right; I am captain of the musketeers; I have
had the post promised me so long, and have enjoyed it for so
brief a period, that I am always forgetting my dignity."

"You will do me this service, will you not?"

"M. Fouquet -- the deuce!"

"Are you not on good terms with him?"

"It is rather he who may not be on good terms with me;
however, since it must be done some day or another ---- "

"Stay; I think he is looking at you; or is it likely that it
might be ---- "

"No, no, don't deceive yourself, it is indeed me for whom
this honor is intended."

"The opportunity is a good one, then?"

"Do you think so?"

"Pray go."

"Well, I will."

De Guiche had not removed his eyes from Raoul, who made a
sign to him that all was arranged. D'Artagnan walked
straight up to the group, and civilly saluted M. Fouquet as
well as the others.

"Good evening, M. d'Artagnan; we were speaking of
Belle-Isle," said Fouquet, with that usage of society, and
that perfect knowledge of the language of looks, which
require half a lifetime thoroughly to acquire, and which
some persons, notwithstanding all their study, never attain.

"Of Belle-Isle-en-Mer! Ah!" said D'Artagnan. "It belongs to
you, I believe, M. Fouquet?"

"M. Fouquet has just told me that he had presented it to the
king," said Buckingham.

"Do you know Belle-Isle, chevalier?" inquired Fouquet.

"I have only been there once," replied D'Artagnan, with
readiness and good-humor.

"Did you remain there long?"

"Scarcely a day."

"Did you see much of it while you were there?"

"All that could be seen in a day."

"A great deal can be seen with observation as keen as
yours," said Fouquet; at which D'Artagnan bowed.

During this Raoul made a sign to Buckingham. "M. Fouquet,"
said Buckingham, "I leave the captain with you, he is more
learned than I am in bastions, scarps, and counter-scarps,
and I will join one of my friends, who has just beckoned
me." Saying this, Buckingham disengaged himself from the
group, and advanced towards Raoul, stopping for a moment at
the table where the queen-mother, the young queen, and the
king were playing together.

"Now, Raoul," said De Guiche, "there he is; be firm and
quick."

Buckingham, having made some complimentary remark to Madame,
continued his way towards Raoul, who advanced to meet him,
while De Guiche remained in his place, though he followed
him with his eyes. The maneuver was so arranged that the
young men met in an open space which was left vacant,
between the group of players and the gallery, where they
walked, stopping now and then for the purpose of saying a
few words to some of the graver courtiers who were walking
there. At the moment when the two lines were about to unite,
they were broken by a third. It was Monsieur who advanced
toward the Duke of Buckingham. Monsieur had his most
engaging smile on his red and perfumed lips.

"My dear duke," said he, with the most affectionate
politeness; "is it really true what I have just been told?"

Buckingham turned round, he had not noticed Monsieur
approach; but had merely heard his voice. He started in
spite of his command over himself, and a slight pallor
overspread his face. "Monseigneur," he asked, "what has been
told you that surprises you so much?"

"That which throws me into despair, and will, in truth, be a
real cause of mourning for the whole court."

"Your highness is very kind, for I perceive that you allude
to my departure."

"Precisely."

Guiche had overheard the conversation from where he was
standing, and started in his turn. "His departure," he
murmured. "What does he say?"

Philip continued with the same gracious air, "I can easily
conceive, monsieur, why the king of Great Britain recalls
you; we all know that King Charles II.; who appreciates true
gentlemen, cannot dispense with you. But it cannot be
supposed we can let you go without great regret; and I beg
you to receive the expression of my own."

"Believe me, monseigneur," said the duke, "that if I quit
the court of France ---- "

"Because you are recalled; but, if you suppose the
expression of my own wish on the subject might possibly have
any influence with the king, I will gladly volunteer to
entreat his majesty Charles II. to leave you with us a
little while longer."

"I am overwhelmed, monseigneur, by so much kindness,"
replied Buckingham, "but I have received positive commands.
My residence in France was limited; I have prolonged it at
the risk of displeasing my gracious sovereign. It is only
this very day that I recollected I ought to have set off
four days ago."

"Indeed," said Monsieur.

"Yes, but," added Buckingham, raising his voice in such a
manner that the princess could hear him, -- "but I resemble
that dweller in the East, who turned mad, and remained so
for several days, owing to a delightful dream that he had
had, but who one day awoke, if not completely cured, in some
respects rational at least. The court of France has its
intoxicating properties, which are not unlike this dream, my
lord; but at last I wake and leave it. I shall be unable,
therefore, to prolong my residence, as your highness has so
kindly invited me to do."

"When do you leave?" inquired Philip, with an expression
full of interest.

"To-morrow, monseigneur. My carriages have been ready for
three days."

The Duc d'Orleans made a movement of the head, which seemed
to signify, "Since you are determined, duke, there is
nothing to be said." Buckingham returned the gesture,
concealing under a smile a contraction of his heart; and
then Monsieur moved away in the same direction by which he
had approached. At the same moment, however, De Guiche
advanced from the opposite direction. Raoul feared that the
impatient young man might possibly make the proposition
himself, and hurried forward before him.

"No, no, Raoul, all is useless now," said Guiche, holding
both his hands toward the duke, and leading him behind a
column. "Forgive me, duke, for what I wrote to you, I was
mad; give me back my letter."

"It is true," said the duke, "you cannot owe me a grudge any
longer now."

"Forgive me, duke; my friendship, my lasting friendship is
yours."

"There is certainly no reason why you should bear me any
ill-will from the moment I leave her never to see her
again."

Raoul heard these words, and comprehending that his presence
was now useless between the two young men, who had now only
friendly words to exchange, withdrew a few paces; a movement
which brought him closer to De Wardes, who was conversing
with the Chevalier de Lorraine respecting the departure of
Buckingham. "A strategic retreat," said De Wardes.

"Why so?"

"Because the dear duke saves a sword-thrust by it." At which
reply both laughed.

Raoul, indignant, turned round frowningly, flushed with
anger and his lip curling with disdain. The Chevalier de
Lorraine turned on his heel, but De Wardes remained and
waited.

"You will not break yourself of the habit," said Raoul to De
Wardes, "of insulting the absent; yesterday it was M.
d'Artagnan, to-day it is the Duke of Buckingham."

"You know very well, monsieur," returned De Wardes, "that I
sometimes insult those who are present."

De Wardes was close to Raoul, their shoulders met, their
faces approached, as if to mutually inflame each other by
the fire of their looks and of their anger. It could be seen
that the one was at the height of fury, the other at the end
of his patience. Suddenly a voice was heard behind them full
of grace and courtesy saying, "I believe I heard my name
pronounced."

They turned round and saw D'Artagnan, who, with a smiling
eye and a cheerful face, had just placed his hand on De
Wardes's shoulder. Raoul stepped back to make room for the
musketeer. De Wardes trembled from head to foot, turned
pale, but did not move. D'Artagnan, still with the same
smile, took the place which Raoul abandoned to him.

"Thank you, my dear Raoul," he said. "M. de Wardes, I wish
to talk with you. Do not leave us Raoul; every one can hear
what I have to say to M. de Wardes." His smile immediately
faded away, and his glance became cold and sharp as a sword.

"I am at your orders, monsieur," said De Wardes.

"For a very long time," resumed D'Artagnan, "I have sought
an opportunity of conversing with you; to-day is the first
time I have found it. The place is badly chosen, I admit,
but you will perhaps have the goodness to accompany me to my
apartments, which are on the staircase at the end of this
gallery."

"I follow you, monsieur," said De Wardes.

"Are you alone here?" said D'Artagnan.

"No; I have M. Manicamp and M. de Guiche, two of my
friends."

"That's well," said D'Artagnan; "but two persons are not
sufficient; you will be able to find a few others, I trust."

"Certainly," said the young man, who did not know what
object D'Artagnan had in view. "As many as you please."

"Are they friends?"

"Yes, monsieur."

"Real friends?"

"No doubt of it."

"Very well, get a good supply, then. Do you come, too,
Raoul; bring M. de Guiche and the Duke of Buckingham."

"What a disturbance," replied De Wardes, attempting to
smile. The captain slightly signed to him with his hand, as
though to recommend him to be patient, and then led the way
to his apartments.




CHAPTER 95

Sword-thrusts in the Water (concluded)



D'Artagnan's apartment was not unoccupied, for the Comte de
la Fere, seated in the recess of a window, awaited him.
"Well," said he to D'Artagnan, as he saw him enter.

"Well," said the latter, "M. de Wardes has done me the honor
to pay me a visit, in company with some of his own friends,
as well as of ours." In fact, behind the musketeer appeared
De Wardes and Manicamp followed by De Guiche and Buckingham,
who looked surprised, not knowing what was expected of them.
Raoul was accompanied by two or three gentlemen; and, as he
entered, glanced round the room, and perceiving the count,
he went and placed himself by his side. D'Artagnan received
his visitors with all the courtesy he was capable of; he
preserved his unmoved and unconcerned look. All the persons
present were men of distinction, occupying posts of honor
and credit at the court. After he had apologized to each of
them for any inconvenience he might have put them to, he
turned towards De Wardes, who, in spite of his customary
self-command, could not prevent his face betraying some
surprise mingled with not a little uneasiness.

"Now, monsieur," said D'Artagnan, "since we are no longer
within the precincts of the king's palace, and since we can
speak out without failing in respect to propriety, I will
inform you why I have taken the liberty to request you to
visit me here, and why I have invited these gentlemen to be
present at the same time. My friend, the Comte de la Fere,
has acquainted me with the injurious reports you are
spreading about myself. You have stated that you regard me
as your mortal enemy, because I was, so you affirm, that of
your father."

"Perfectly true, monsieur, I have said so," replied De
Wardes, whose pallid face became slightly tinged with color.

"You accuse me, therefore, of a crime, or a fault, or of
some mean and cowardly act. Have the goodness to state your
charge against me in precise terms."

"In the presence of witnesses?"

"Most certainly in the presence of witnesses; and you see I
have selected them as being experienced in affairs of
honor."

"You do not appreciate my delicacy, monsieur. I have accused
you, it is true; but I have kept the nature of the
accusation a perfect secret. I entered into no details; but
have rested satisfied by expressing my hatred in the
presence of those on whom a duty was almost imposed to
acquaint you with it. You have not taken the discreetness I
have shown into consideration, although you were interested
in remaining silent. I can hardly recognize your habitual
prudence in that, M. d'Artagnan."

D'Artagnan, who was quietly biting the corner of his
mustache, said, "I have already had the honor to beg you to
state the particulars of the grievances you say you have
against me."

"Aloud?"

"Certainly, aloud."

"In that case, I will speak."

"Speak, monsieur," said D'Artagnan, bowing; "we are all
listening to you."

"Well, monsieur, it is not a question of a personal injury
towards myself, but one towards my father."

"That you have already stated."

"Yes, but there are certain subjects which are only
approached with hesitation."

"If that hesitation, in your case, really does exist, I
entreat you to overcome it."

"Even if it refer to a disgraceful action?"

"Yes; in every and any case."

Those who were present at this scene had, at first, looked
at each other with a good deal of uneasiness. They were
reassured, however, when they saw that D'Artagnan manifested
no emotion whatever.

De Wardes still maintained the same unbroken silence.
"Speak, monsieur," said the musketeer; "you see you are
keeping us waiting."

"Listen, then: -- My father loved a lady of noble birth, and
this lady loved my father." D'Artagnan and Athos exchanged
looks. De Wardes continued: "M. d'Artagnan found some
letters which indicated a rendezvous, substituted himself,
under disguise, for the person who was expected, and took
advantage of the darkness."

"That is perfectly true," said D'Artagnan.

A slight murmur was heard from those present. "Yes, I was
guilty of that dishonorable action. You should have added,
monsieur, since you are so impartial, that, at the period
when the circumstance which you have just related, happened,
I was not one-and-twenty years of age."

"Such an action is not the less shameful on that account,"
said De Wardes; "and it is quite sufficient for a gentleman
to have attained the age of reason, to avoid committing an
act of indelicacy."

A renewed murmur was heard, but this time of astonishment,
and almost of doubt.

"It was a most shameful deception, I admit," said
D'Artagnan, "and I have not waited for M. de Wardes's
reproaches to reproach myself for it, and very bitterly,
too. Age has, however, made me more reasonable, and above
all, more upright; and this injury has been atoned for by a
long and lasting regret. But I appeal to you, gentlemen;
this affair took place in 1626, at a period, happily for
yourselves, known to you by tradition only, at a period when
love was not over scrupulous, when consciences did not
distill, as in the present day, poison and bitterness. We
were young soldiers, always fighting, or being attacked, our
swords always in our hands, or at least ready to be drawn
from their sheaths. Death then always stared us in the face,
war hardened us, and the cardinal pressed us sorely. I have
repented of it, and more than that -- I still repent it, M.
de Wardes."

"I can well understand that, monsieur, for the action itself
needed repentance; but you were not the less the cause of
that lady's disgrace. She, of whom you have been speaking,
covered with shame, borne down by the affront you brought
upon her, fled, quitted France, and no one ever knew what
became of her."

"Stay," said the Comte de la Fere, stretching his hand
towards De Wardes, with a peculiar smile upon his face, "you
are mistaken; she was seen; and there are persons even now
present, who, having often heard her spoken of, will easily
recognize her by the description I am about to give. She was
about five-and-twenty years of age, slender in form, of a
pale complexion, and fair-haired; she was married in
England."

"Married?" exclaimed De Wardes.

"So, you were not aware she was married? You see we are far
better informed than yourself. Do you happen to know she was
usually styled `My Lady,' without the addition of any name
to that description?"

"Yes, I know that."

"Good Heavens!" murmured Buckingham.

"Very well, monsieur. That woman, who came from England,
returned to England after having thrice attempted M.
d'Artagnan's life. That was but just, you will say, since M.
d'Artagnan had insulted her. But that which was not just
was, that, when in England, this woman, by her seductions,
completely enslaved a young man in the service of Lord de
Winter, by name Felton. You change color, my lord," said
Athos turning to the Duke of Buckingham, "and your eyes
kindle with anger and sorrow. Let your Grace finish the
recital, then, and tell M. de Wardes who this woman was who
placed the knife in the hand of your father's murderer."

A cry escaped from the lips of all present. The young duke
passed his handkerchief across his forehead, which was
covered with perspiration. A dead silence ensued among the
spectators.

"You see, M. de Wardes," said D'Artagnan, whom this recital
had impressed more and more, as his own recollection revived
as Athos spoke, "you see that my crime did not cause the
destruction of any one's soul, and that the soul in question
may fairly be considered to have been altogether lost before
my regret. It is, however, an act of conscience on my part.
Now this matter is settled, therefore, it remains for me to
ask with the greatest humility, your forgiveness for this
shameless action, as most certainly I should have asked it
of your father, if he were still alive, and if I had met him
after my return to France, subsequent to the death of King
Charles I."

"That is too much, M. d'Artagnan," exclaimed many voices,
with animation.

"No, gentlemen," said the captain. "And now, M. de Wardes, I
hope all is finished between us, and that you will have no
further occasion to speak ill of me again. Do you consider
it completely settled?"

De Wardes bowed, and muttered to himself inarticulately.

"I trust also," said D'Artagnan, approaching the young man
closely, "that you will no longer speak ill of any one, as
it seems you have the unfortunate habit of doing; for a man
so puritanically conscientious as you are, who can reproach
an old soldier for a youthful freak five-and-thirty years
after it happened, will allow me to ask whether you who
advocate such excessive purity of conscience, will undertake
on your side to do nothing contrary either to conscience or
the principle of honor. And now, listen attentively to what
I am going to say, M. de Wardes, in conclusion. Take care
that no tale, with which your name may be associated,
reaches my ear."

"Monsieur," said De Wardes, "it is useless threatening to no
purpose."

"I have not yet finished, M. de Wardes, and you must listen
to me still further." The circle of listeners, full of eager
curiosity, drew closer. "You spoke just now of the honor of
a woman, and of the honor of your father. We were glad to
hear you speak in that manner; for it is pleasing to think
that such a sentiment of delicacy and rectitude, and which
did not exist, it seems, in our minds, lives in our
children; and it is delightful too, to see a young man, at
an age when men from habit become the destroyers of the
honor of women, respect and defend it."

De Wardes bit his lips and clenched his hands, evidently
much disturbed to learn how this discourse, the commencement
of which was announced in so threatening a manner, would
terminate.

"How did it happen, then, that you allowed yourself to say
to M. de Bragelonne that he did not know who his mother
was?"

Raoul's eye flashed, as, darting forward, he exclaimed, --
"Chevalier, this is a personal affair of my own!" At which
exclamation, a smile, full of malice, passed across De
Wardes's face.

D'Artagnan put Raoul aside, saying, -- "Do not interrupt me,
young man." And looking at De Wardes in an authoritative
manner, he continued: -- "I am now dealing with a matter
which cannot be settled by means of the sword. I discuss it
before men of honor, all of whom have more than once had
their swords in their hands in affairs of honor. I selected
them expressly. These gentlemen well know that every secret
for which men fight ceases to be a secret. I again put my
question to M. de Wardes. What was the subject of
conversation when you offended this young man, in offending
his father and mother at the same time?"

"It seems to me," returned De Wardes, "that liberty of
speech is allowed, when it is supported by every means which
a man of courage has at his disposal."

"Tell me what the means are by which a man of courage can
sustain a slanderous expression."

"The sword."

"You fail, not only in logic, in your argument, but in
religion and honor. You expose the lives of many others,
without referring to your own, which seems to be full of
hazard. Besides, fashions pass away, monsieur, and the
fashion of duelling has passed away, without referring in
any way to the edicts of his majesty which forbid it.
Therefore, in order to be consistent with your own
chivalrous notions, you will at once apologize to M. de
Bragelonne; you will tell him how much you regret having
spoken so lightly, and that the nobility and purity of his
race are inscribed, not in his heart alone, but still more
in every action of his life. You will do and say this, M. de
Wardes, as I, an old officer, did and said just now to your
boy's mustache."

"And if I refuse?" inquired De Wardes.

"In that case the result will be -- "

"That which you think you will prevent," said De Wardes,
laughing; "the result will be that your conciliatory address
will end in a violation of the king's prohibition."

"Not so," said the captain, "you are quite mistaken."

"What will be the result, then?"

"The result will be that I shall go to the king, with whom I
am on tolerably good terms, to whom I have been happy enough
to render certain services dating from a period when you
were not born, and who at my request, has just sent me an
order in blank for M. Baisemeaux de Montlezun, governor of
the Bastile; and I shall say to the king: `Sire, a man has
in a most cowardly way insulted M. de Bragelonne by
insulting his mother; I have written this man's name upon
the lettre de cachet which your majesty has been kind enough
to give me, so that M. de Wardes is in the Bastile for three
years.'" And D'Artagnan drawing the order signed by the king
from his pocket, held it towards De Wardes.

Remarking that the young man was not quite convinced, and
received the warning as an idle threat, he shrugged his
shoulders and walked leisurely towards the table, upon which
lay a writing-case and a pen, the length of which would have
terrified the topographical Porthos. De Wardes then saw that
nothing could well be more seriously intended than the
threat in question for the Bastile, even at that period, was
already held in dread. He advanced a step towards Raoul,
and, in an almost unintelligible voice, said, -- "I offer my
apologies in the terms which M. d'Artagnan just now
dictated, and which I am forced to make to you."

"One moment, monsieur," said the musketeer, with the
greatest tranquillity, "you mistake the terms of the
apology. I did not say, `and which I am forced to make'; I
said, `and which my conscience induces me to make.' This
latter expression, believe me, is better than the former;
and it will be far preferable, since it will be the most
truthful expression of your own sentiments."

"I subscribe to it," said De Wardes; "but submit, gentlemen,
that a thrust of a sword through the body, as was the custom
formerly, was far better than tyranny like this."

"No, monsieur," replied Buckingham; "for the sword-thrust,
when received, was no indication that a particular person
was right or wrong; it only showed that he was more or less
skillful in the use of the weapon."

"Monsieur!" exclaimed De Wardes.

"There, now," interrupted D'Artagnan, "you are going to say
something very rude, and I am rendering you a service by
stopping you in time."

"Is that all, monsieur?" inquired De Wardes.

"Absolutely everything," replied D'Artagnan, "and these
gentlemen, as well as myself, are quite satisfied with you."

"Believe me monsieur, that your reconciliations are not
successful."

"In what way?"

"Because, as we are now about to separate. I would wager
that M. de Bragelonne and myself are greater enemies than
ever."

"You are deceived, monsieur, as far as I am concerned,"
returned Raoul; "for I do not retain the slightest animosity
in my heart against you."

This last blow overwhelmed De Wardes. He cast his eyes
around him like a man bewildered. D'Artagnan saluted most
courteously the gentlemen who had been present at the
explanation; and every one, on leaving the room, shook hands
with him; but not one hand was held out towards De Wardes.
"Oh!" exclaimed the young man, abandoning himself to the
rage which consumed him, "can I not find some one on whom to
wreak my vengeance?"

"You can, monsieur, for I am here," whispered a voice full
of menace in his ear.

De Wardes turned round, and saw the Duke of Buckingham, who,
having probably remained behind with that intention, had
just approached him. "You, monsieur?" exclaimed De Wardes.

"Yes, I! I am no subject of the king of France; I am not
going to remain on the territory, since I am about setting
off for England. I have accumulated in my heart such a mass
of despair and rage, that I, too, like yourself, need to
revenge myself upon some one. I approve M. d'Artagnan's
principles profoundly, but I am not bound to apply them to
you. I am an Englishman, and, in my turn, I propose to you
what you proposed to others to no purpose. Since you,
therefore, are so terribly incensed, take me as a remedy. In
thirty-four hours' time I shall be at Calais. Come with me;
the journey will appear shorter if together, than if alone.
We will fight, when we get there, upon the sands which are
covered by the rising tide, and which form part of the
French territory during six hours of the day, but belong to
the territory of Heaven during the other six."

"I accept willingly," said De Wardes.

"I assure you," said the duke, "that if you kill me, you
will be rendering me an infinite service."

"I will do my utmost to make myself agreeable to you, duke,"
said De Wardes.

"It is agreed, then, that I carry you off with me?"

"I shall be at your commands. I needed some real danger and
some mortal risk to run, to tranquilize me."

"In that case, I think you have met with what you are
looking for. Farewell, M. de Wardes; to-morrow morning, my
valet will tell you the exact hour of our departure; we can
travel together like two excellent friends. I generally
travel as fast as I can. Adieu."

Buckingham saluted De Wardes, and returned towards the
king's apartments; De Wardes, irritated beyond measure, left
the Palais-Royal, and hurried through the streets homeward
to the house where he lodged.




CHAPTER 96

Baisemeaux de Montlezun



After the austere lesson administered to De Wardes, Athos
and D'Artagnan together descended the staircase which led to
the courtyard of the Palais-Royal. "You perceive," said
Athos to D'Artagnan, "that Raoul cannot, sooner or later,
avoid a duel with De Wardes, for De Wardes is as brave as he
is vicious and wicked."

"I know such fellows well," replied D'Artagnan; "I had an
affair with the father. I assure you that, although at that
time I had good muscles and a sort of brute courage -- I
assure you that the father did me some mischief. But you
should have seen how I fought it out with him. Ah, Athos,
such encounters never take place in these times! I had a
hand which could never remain at rest, a hand like
quicksilver, -- you knew its quality, for you have seen me
at work. My sword was no longer a piece of steel; it was a
serpent that assumed every form and every length, seeking
where it might thrust its head; in other words, where it
might fix its bite. I advanced half a dozen paces, then
three, and then, body to body, I pressed my antagonist
closely, then I darted back again ten paces. No human power
could resist that ferocious ardor. Well, De Wardes, the
father, with the bravery of his race, with his dogged
courage, occupied a good deal of my time; and my fingers, at
the end of the engagement, were, I well remember, tired
enough."

"It is, then, as I said," resumed Athos, "the son will
always be looking out for Raoul, and will end by meeting
him; and Raoul can easily be found when he is sought for."

"Agreed; but Raoul calculates well; he bears no grudge
against De Wardes, -- he has said so; he will wait until he
is provoked, and in that case his position is a good one.
The king will not be able to get out of temper about the
matter; besides we shall know how to pacify his majesty. But
why so full of these fears and anxieties? You don't easily
get alarmed."

"I will tell you what makes me anxious; Raoul is to see the
king to-morrow, when his majesty will inform him of his
wishes respecting a certain marriage. Raoul, loving as he
does, will get out of temper, and once in an angry mood, if
he were to meet De Wardes, the shell would explode."

"We will prevent the explosion."

"Not I," said Athos, "for I must return to Blois. All this
gilded elegance of the court, all these intrigues, sicken
me. I am no longer a young man who can make terms with the
meannesses of the day. I have read in the Great Book many
things too beautiful and too comprehensive, to longer take
any interest in the trifling phrases which these men whisper
among themselves when they wish to deceive others. In one
word, I am weary of Paris wherever and whenever you are not
with me; and as I cannot have you with me always, I wish to
return to Blois."

"How wrong you are, Athos; how you gainsay your origin and
the destiny of your noble nature. Men of your stamp are
created to continue, to the very last moment, in full
possession of their great faculties. Look at my sword, a
Spanish blade, the one I wore at Rochelle; it served me for
thirty years without fail; one day in the winter it fell
upon the marble floor on the Louvre and was broken. I had a
hunting-knife made of it which will last a hundred years
yet. You, Athos, with your loyalty, your frankness, your
cool courage and your sound information, are the very man
kings need to warn and direct them. Remain here; Monsieur
Fouquet will not last as long as my Spanish blade."

"Is it possible," said Athos, smiling, "that my friend,
D'Artagnan, who, after having raised me to the skies, making
me an object of worship, casts me down from the top of
Olympus, and hurls me to the ground? I have more exalted
ambition, D'Artagnan. To be a minister -- to be a slave, --
never! Am I not still greater? I am nothing. I remember
having heard you occasionally call me `the great Athos;' I
defy you, therefore, if I were minister, to continue to
bestow that title upon me. No, no; I do not yield myself in
this manner."

"We will not speak of it any more, then; renounce
everything, even the brotherly feeling which unites us."

"It is almost cruel what you say."

D'Artagnan pressed Athos's hand warmly. "No, no; renounce
everything without fear. Raoul can get on without you. I am
at Paris."

"In that case I shall return to Blois. We will take leave of
each other to-night, to-morrow at daybreak I shall be on my
horse again."

"You cannot return to your hotel alone; why did you not
bring Grimaud with you?"

"Grimaud takes his rest now; he goes to bed early, for my
poor old servant gets easily fatigued. He came from Blois
with me, and I compelled him to remain within doors; for if,
in retracing the forty leagues which separate us from Blois,
he needed to draw breath even, he would die without a
murmur. But I don't want to lose Grimaud."

"You shall have one of my musketeers to carry a torch for
you. Hola! some one there," called out D'Artagnan, leaning
over the gilded balustrade. The heads of seven or eight
musketeers appeared. "I wish some gentleman who is so
disposed to escort the Comte de la Fere," cried D'Artagnan.

"Thank you for your readiness, gentlemen," said Athos; "I
regret to have occasion to trouble you in this manner."

"I would willingly escort the Comte de la Fere," said some
one, "if I had not to speak to Monsieur d'Artagnan."

"Who is that?" said D'Artagnan, looking into the darkness.

"I, Monsieur d'Artagnan."

"Heaven forgive me, if that is not Monsieur Baisemeaux's
voice."

"It is, monsieur."

"What are you doing in the courtyard, my dear Baisemeaux?"

"I am waiting your orders, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan."

"Wretch that I am," thought D'Artagnan; "true, you have been
told, I suppose, that some one was to be arrested, and have
come yourself, instead of sending an officer?"

"I came because I had occasion to speak to you."

"You did not send to me?"

"I waited until you were disengaged," said Monsieur
Baisemeaux, timidly.

"I leave you, D'Artagnan," said Athos.

"Not before I have presented Monsieur Baisemeaux de
Montlezun, the governor of the Bastile."

Baisemeaux and Athos saluted each other.

"Surely you must know each other," said D'Artagnan.

"I have an indistinct recollection of Monsieur Baisemeaux,"
said Athos.

"You remember, my dear, Baisemeaux, the king's guardsman
with whom we used formerly to have such delightful meetings
in the cardinal's time?"

"Perfectly," said Athos, taking leave of him with
affability.

"Monsieur le Comte de la Fere, whose nom de guerre was
Athos," whispered D'Artagnan to Baisemeaux.

"Yes, yes, a brave man, one of the celebrated four."

"Precisely so. But, my dear Baisemeaux, shall we talk now?"

"If you please."

"In the first place, as for the orders -- there are none.
The king does not intend to arrest the person in question."

"So much the worse," said Baisemeaux with a sigh.

"What do you mean by so much the worse?" exclaimed
D'Artagnan, laughing.

"No doubt of it," returned the governor, "my prisoners are
my income."

"I beg your pardon, I did not see it in that light."

"And so there are no orders," repeated Baisemeaux with a
sigh. "What an admirable situation yours is captain," he
continued, after a pause, "captain-lieutenant of the
musketeers."

"Oh, it is good enough; but I don't see why you should envy
me; you, governor of the Bastile, the first castle in
France."

"I am well aware of that," said Baisemeaux, in a sorrowful
tone of voice.

"You say that like a man confessing his sins. I would
willingly exchange my profits for yours."

"Don't speak of profits to me if you wish to save me the
bitterest anguish of mind."

"Why do you look first on one side and then on the other, as
if you were afraid of being arrested yourself, you whose
business it is to arrest others?"

"I was looking to see whether any one could see or listen to
us; it would be safer to confer more in private, if you
would grant me such a favor."

"Baisemeaux, you seem to forget we are acquaintances of five
and thirty years' standing. Don't assume such sanctified
airs; make yourself quite comfortable; I don't eat governors
of the Bastile raw."

"Heaven be praised!"

"Come into the courtyard with me, it's a beautiful moonlight
night; we will walk up and down arm in arm under the trees,
while you tell me your pitiful tale." He drew the doleful
governor into the courtyard, took him by the arm as he had
said, and, in his rough, good-humored way, cried: "Out with
it, rattle away, Baisemeaux; what have you got to say?"

"It's a long story."

"You prefer your own lamentations, then; my opinion is, it
will be longer than ever. I'll wager you are making fifty
thousand francs out of your pigeons in the Bastile."

"Would to heaven that were the case, M. d'Artagnan."

"You surprise me, Baisemeaux; just look at you, acting the
anchorite. I should like to show you your face in a glass,
and you would see how plump and florid-looking you are, as
fat and round as a cheese, with eyes like lighted coals; and
if it were not for that ugly wrinkle you try to cultivate on
your forehead, you would hardly look fifty years old, and
you are sixty, if I am not mistaken."

"All quite true."

"Of course I knew it was true, as true as the fifty thousand
francs profit you make," at which remark Baisemeaux stamped
on the ground.

"Well, well," said D'Artagnan, "I will add up your accounts
for you: you were captain of M. Mazarin's guards; and twelve
thousand francs a year would in twelve years amount to one
hundred and forty thousand francs."

"Twelve thousand francs! Are you mad?" cried Baisemeaux;
"the old miser gave me no more than six thousand, and the
expenses of the post amounted to six thousand five hundred
francs. M. Colbert, who deducted the other six thousand
francs, condescended to allow me to take fifty pistoles as a
gratification; so that, if it were not for my little estate
at Montlezun, which brings me in twelve thousand francs a
year, I could not have met my engagements."

"Well, then, how about the fifty thousand francs from the
Bastile? There, I trust, you are boarded and lodged, and get
your six thousand francs salary besides."

"Admitted!"

"Whether the year be good or bad, there are fifty prisoners,
who, on an average, bring you in a thousand francs a year
each."

"I don't deny it."

"Well, there is at once an income of fifty thousand francs;
you have held the post three years, and must have received
in that time one hundred and fifty thousand francs."

"You forget one circumstance, dear M. d'Artagnan."

"What is that?"

"That while you received your appointment as captain from
the king himself, I received mine as governor from Messieurs
Tremblay and Louviere."

"Quite right, and Tremblay was not a man to let you have the
post for nothing."

"Nor Louviere either: the result was, that I gave
seventy-five thousand francs to Tremblay as his share."

"Very agreeable that! and to Louviere?"

"The very same."

"Money down?"

"No: that would have been impossible. The king did not wish,
or rather M. Mazarin did not wish, to have the appearance of
removing those two gentlemen, who had sprung from the
barricades; he permitted them therefore, to make certain
extravagant conditions for their retirement."

"What were those conditions?"

"Tremble...three years' income for the good-will."

"The deuce! so that the one hundred and fifty thousand
francs have passed into their hands."

"Precisely so."

"And beyond that?"

"A sum of one hundred and fifty thousand francs, or fifteen
thousand pistoles, whichever you please, in three payments."

"Exorbitant."

"Yes, but that is not all."

"What besides?"

"In default of the fulfillment by me of any one of those
conditions, those gentlemen enter upon their functions
again. The king has been induced to sign that."

"It is monstrous, incredible!"

"Such is the fact, however."

"I do indeed pity you, Baisemeaux. But why, in the name of
fortune, did M. Mazarin grant you this pretended favor? It
would have been far better to have refused you altogether."

"Certainly, but he was strongly persuaded to do so by my
protector."

"Who is he?"

"One of your own friends, indeed; M. d'Herblay."

"M. d'Herblay! Aramis!"

"Just so; he has been very kind towards me."

"Kind! to make you enter into such a bargain!"

"Listen! I wished to leave the cardinal's service. M.
d'Herblay spoke on my behalf to Louviere and Tremblay --
they objected; I wished to have the appointment very much,
for I knew what it could be made to produce; in my distress
I confided in M. d'Herblay, and he offered to become my
surety for the different payments."

"You astound me! Aramis become your surety?"

"Like a man of honor; he procured the signature; Tremblay
and Louviere resigned their appointments, I have paid every
year twenty-five thousand francs to these two gentlemen; on
the thirty-first of May every year, M. d'Herblay himself
comes to the Bastile, and brings me five thousand pistoles
to distribute between my crocodiles."

"You owe Aramis one hundred and fifty thousand francs,
then?"

"That is the very thing which is the cause of my despair,
for I only owe him one hundred thousand."

"I don't quite understand you."

"He came and settled with the vampires only two years.
To-day, however, is the thirty-first of May, and he has not
been yet, and to-morrow, at midday, the payment falls due;
if, therefore, I don't pay to-morrow, those gentlemen can,
by the terms of the contract, break off the bargain; I shall
be stripped of everything; I shall have worked for three
years, and given two hundred and fifty thousand francs for
nothing, absolutely for nothing at all, dear M. d'Artagnan."

"This is very strange," murmured D'Artagnan.

"You can now imagine that I may well have wrinkles on my
forehead, can you not?"

"Yes, indeed!"

"And you can imagine, too, that notwithstanding I may be as
round as a cheese, with a complexion like an apple, and my
eyes like coals on fire, I may almost be afraid that I shall
not have a cheese or an apple left me to eat, and that my
eyes will be left me only to weep with."

"It is really a very grievous affair."

"I have come to you, M. d'Artagnan, for you are the only man
who can get me out of my trouble."

"In what way?"

"You are acquainted with the Abbe d'Herblay and you know
that he is a somewhat mysterious gentleman."

"Yes."

"Well, you can, perhaps, give me the address of his
presbytery, for I have been to Noisy-le-Sec, and he is no
longer there."

"I should think not, indeed. He is Bishop of Vannes."

"What! Vannes in Bretagne?"

"Yes."

The little man began to tear his hair, saying, "How can I
get to Vannes from here by midday to-morrow? I am a lost
man."

"Your despair quite distresses me."

"Vannes, Vannes!" cried Baisemeaux.

"But listen; a bishop is not always a resident. M. d'Herblay
may not possibly be so far away as you fear."

"Pray tell me his address."

"I really don't know it."

"In that case I am lost. I will go and throw myself at the
king's feet."

"But, Baisemeaux, I can hardly believe what you tell me;
besides, since the Bastile is capable of producing fifty
thousand francs a year, why have you not tried to screw one
hundred thousand out of it?"

"Because I am an honest man, M. d'Artagnan, and because my
prisoners are fed like ambassadors."

"Well, you're in a fair way to get out of your difficulties;
give yourself a good attack of indigestion with your
excellent living, and put yourself out of the way between
this and midday to-morrow."

"How can you be hard-hearted enough to laugh?"

"Nay, you really afflict me. Come, Baisemeaux, if you can
pledge me your word of honor, do so, that you will not open
your lips to any one about what I am going to say to you."

"Never, never!"

"You wish to put your hand on Aramis?"

"At any cost!"

"Well, go and see where M. Fouquet is."

"Why, what connection can there be ---- "

"How stupid you are! Don't you know that Vannes is in the
diocese of Belle-Isle, or Belle-Isle in the diocese of
Vannes? Belle-Isle belongs to M. Fouquet, and M. Fouquet
nominated M. d'Herblay to that bishopric!"

"I see, I see; you restore me to life again."

"So much the better. Go and tell M. Fouquet very simply that
you wish to speak to M. d'Herblay."

"Of course, of course," exclaimed Baisemeaux, delightedly.

"But," said D'Artagnan, checking him by a severe look, "your
word of honor?"

"I give you my sacred word of honor," replied the little
man, about to set off running.

"Where are you going?"

"To M. Fouquet's house."

"It is useless doing that, M. Fouquet is playing at cards
with the king. All you can do is to pay M. Fouquet a visit
early to-morrow morning."

"I will do so. Thank you."

"Good luck attend you," said D'Artagnan.

"Thank you."

"This is a strange affair," murmured D'Artagnan, as he
slowly ascended the staircase after he had left Baisemeaux.
"What possible interest can Aramis have in obliging
Baisemeaux in this manner? Well, I suppose we shall learn
some day or another."




CHAPTER 97

The King's Card-table



Fouquet was present, as D'Artagnan had said, at the king's
card-table. It seemed as if Buckingham's departure had shed
a balm on the lacerated hearts of the previous evening.
Monsieur, radiant with delight, made a thousand affectionate
signs to his mother. The Count de Guiche could not separate
himself from Buckingham and while playing, conversed with
him upon the circumstance of his projected voyage.
Buckingham, thoughtful, and kind in his manner, like a man
who has adopted a resolution, listened to the count, and
from time to time cast a look full of regret and hopeless
affection at Madame. The princess, in the midst of her
elation of spirits, divided her attention between the king,
who was playing with her, Monsieur, who quietly joked her
about her enormous winnings, and De Guiche, who exhibited an
extravagant delight. Of Buckingham she took but little
notice; for her, this fugitive, this exile, was now simply a
remembrance, no longer a man. Light hearts are thus
constituted; while they themselves continue untouched, they
roughly break off with every one who may possibly interfere
with their little calculations of selfish comfort. Madame
had received Buckingham's smiles and attentions and sighs
while he was present; but what was the good of sighing,
smiling and kneeling at a distance? Can one tell in what
direction the winds in the Channel, which toss mighty
vessels to and fro, carry such sighs as these. The duke
could not fail to mark this change, and his heart was
cruelly hurt. Of a sensitive character, proud and
susceptible of deep attachment, he cursed the day on which
such a passion had entered his heart. The looks he cast,
from time to time at Madame, became colder by degrees at the
chilling complexion of his thoughts. He could hardly yet
despair, but he was strong enough to impose silence upon the
tumultuous outcries of his heart. In exact proportion,
however, as Madame suspected this change of feeling, she
redoubled her activity to regain the ray of light she was
about to lose; her timid and indecisive mind was displayed
in brilliant flashes of wit and humor. At any cost she felt
that she must be remarked above everything and every one,
even above the king himself. And she was so, for the queens,
notwithstanding their dignity, and the king, despite the
respect which etiquette required, were all eclipsed by her.
The queens, stately and ceremonious, were softened and could
not restrain their laughter. Madame Henrietta, the
queen-mother, was dazzled by the brilliancy which cast
distinction upon her family, thanks to the wit of the
grand-daughter of Henry IV. The king, jealous, as a young
man and as a monarch, of the superiority of those who
surrounded him, could not resist admitting himself
vanquished by a petulance so thoroughly French in its
nature, whose energy was more than ever increased by English
humor. Like a child, he was captivated by her radiant
beauty, which her wit made still more dazzling. Madame's
eyes flashed like lightning. Wit and humor escaped from her
scarlet lips, like persuasion from the lips of Nestor of
old. The whole court, subdued by her enchanting grace,
noticed for the first time that laughter could be indulged
in before the greatest monarch in the world, like people who
merited their appellation of the wittiest and most polished
people in Europe.

Madame, from that evening, achieved and enjoyed a success
capable of bewildering all not born to those altitudes
termed thrones; which, in spite of their elevation, are
sheltered from such giddiness. From that very moment Louis
XIV. acknowledged Madame as a person to be recognized.
Buckingham regarded her as a coquette deserving the cruelest
tortures, and De Guiche looked upon her as a divinity; the
courtiers as a star whose light might some day become the
focus of all favor and power. And yet Louis XIV., a few
years previously, had not even condescended to offer his
hand to that "ugly girl" for a ballet; and Buckingham had
worshipped this coquette "on both knees." De Guiche had once
looked upon this divinity as a mere woman; and the courtiers
had not dared to extol this star in her upward progress,
fearful to disgust the monarch whom such a dull star had
formerly displeased.

Let us see what was taking place during this memorable
evening at the king's card-table. The young queen, although
Spanish by birth, and the niece of Anne of Austria, loved
the king, and could not conceal her affection. Anne of
Austria, a keen observer, like all women, and imperious,
like every queen, was sensible of Madame's power, and
acquiesced in it immediately, a circumstance which induced
the young queen to raise the siege and retire to her
apartments. The king hardly paid any attention to her
departure, notwithstanding the pretended symptoms of
indisposition by which it was accompanied. Encouraged by the
rules of etiquette, which he had begun to introduce at the
court as an element of every relation of life, Louis XIV.
did not disturb himself; he offered his hand to Madame
without looking at Monsieur his brother, and led the young
princess to the door of her apartments. It was remarked that
at the threshold of the door, his majesty, freed from every
restraint, or not equal to the situation, sighed very
deeply. The ladies present -- for nothing escapes a woman's
glance -- Mademoiselle Montalais, for instance -- did not
fail to say to each other, "the king sighed," and "Madame
sighed too." This had been indeed the case. Madame had
sighed very noiselessly, but with an accompaniment very far
more dangerous for the king's repose. Madame had sighed,
first closing her beautiful black eyes, next opening them,
and then, laden, as they were, with an indescribable
mournfulness of expression, she had raised them towards the
king, whose face at that moment visibly heightened in color.
The consequence of these blushes, of these interchanged
sighs, and of this royal agitation, was, that Montalais had
committed an indiscretion which had certainly affected her
companion, for Mademoiselle de la Valliere, less clear
sighted, perhaps, turned pale when the king blushed; and her
attendance being required upon Madame, she tremblingly
followed the princess without thinking of taking the gloves,
which court etiquette required her to do. True it is that
this young country girl might allege as her excuse the
agitation into which the king seemed to be thrown, for
Mademoiselle de la Valliere, busily engaged in closing the
door, had involuntarily fixed her eyes upon the king, who,
as he retired backwards, had his face towards it. The king
returned to the room where the card-tables were set out. He
wished to speak to the different persons there, but it was
easy to see that his mind was absent. He jumbled different
accounts together, which was taken advantage of by some of
the noblemen who had retained those habits since the time of
Monsieur Mazarin -- who had a poor memory, but was a good
calculator. In this way Monsieur Manicamp, with a
thoughtless and absent air -- for M. Manicamp was the
honestest man in the world appropriated twenty thousand
francs, which were littering the table, and which did not
seem to belong to any person in particular. In the same way,
Monsieur de Wardes, whose head was doubtless a little
bewildered by the occurrences of the evening, somehow forgot
to leave behind him the sixty double louis which he had won
for the Duke of Buckingham, and which the duke, incapable,
like his father, of soiling his hands with coin of any sort,
had left lying on the table before him. The king only
recovered his attention in some degree at the moment that
Monsieur Colbert, who had been narrowly observant for some
minutes, approached, and, doubtless, with great respect, yet
with much perseverance, whispered a counsel of some sort
into the still tingling ears of the king. The king, at the
suggestion, listened with renewed attention and immediately
looking around him, said, "Is Monsieur Fouquet no longer
here?"

"Yes, sire, I am here," replied the superintendent, till
then engaged with Buckingham, and approached the king, who
advanced a step towards him with a smiling yet negligent
air. "Forgive me," said Louis, "if I interrupt your
conversation; but I claim your attention wherever I may
require your services."

"I am always at the king's service," replied Fouquet.

"And your cash-box too," said the king, laughing with a
false smile.

"My cash-box more than anything else," said Fouquet, coldly.

"The fact is, I wish to give a fete at Fontainebleau -- to
keep open house for fifteen days, and I shall require ---- "
and he stopped glancing at Colbert. Fouquet waited without
showing discomposure; and the king resumed, answering
Colbert's icy smile, "four million francs."

"Four million," repeated Fouquet, bowing profoundly. And his
nails, buried in his bosom, were thrust into his flesh, but
the tranquil expression of his face remained unaltered.
"When will they be required, sire?"

"Take your time, -- I mean -- no, no, as soon as possible."

"A certain time will be necessary, sire."

"Time!" exclaimed Colbert, triumphantly.

"The time, monsieur," said the superintendent, with the
haughtiest disdain, "simply to count the money: a million
can only be drawn and weighed in a day."

"Four days then," said Colbert.

"My clerks," replied Fouquet, addressing himself to the
king, "will perform wonders on his majesty's service, and
the sum shall be ready in three days."

It was for Colbert now to turn pale. Louis looked at him
astonished. Fouquet withdrew without any parade or weakness,
smiling at his numerous friends, in whose countenances alone
he read the sincerity of their friendship -- an interest
partaking of compassion. Fouquet, however, should not be
judged by his smile, for, in reality he felt as if he had
been stricken by death. Drops of blood beneath his coat
stained the fine linen that clothed his chest. His dress
concealed the blood, and his smile the rage which devoured
him. His domestics perceived, by the manner in which he
approached his carriage, that their master was not in the
best of humors: the result of their discernment was, that
his orders were executed with that exactitude of maneuver
which is found on board a man-of-war, commanded during a
storm by an ill-tempered captain. The carriage, therefore,
did not simply roll along -- it flew. Fouquet had hardly
time to recover himself during the drive; on his arrival he
went at once to Aramis, who had not yet retired for the
night. As for Porthos, he had supped very agreeably off a
roast leg of mutton, two pheasants, and a perfect heap of
cray-fish; he then directed his body to be anointed with
perfumed oils, in the manner of the wrestlers of old; and
when this anointment was completed, he had himself wrapped
in flannels and placed in a warm bed. Aramis, as we have
already said, had not retired. Seated at his ease in a
velvet dressing-gown, he wrote letter after letter in that
fine and hurried handwriting, a page of which contained a
quarter of a volume. The door was thrown hurriedly open, and
the superintendent appeared, pale, agitated, anxious. Aramis
looked up: "Good-evening," said he, and his searching look
detected his host's sadness and disordered state of mind.
"Was your play as good as his majesty's?" asked Aramis, by
way of beginning the conversation.

Fouquet threw himself upon a couch, and then pointed to the
door to the servant who had followed him; when the servant
had left he said, "Excellent."

Aramis, who had followed every movement with his eyes,
noticed that he stretched himself upon the cushions with a
sort of feverish impatience. "You have lost as usual?"
inquired Aramis, his pen still in his hand.

"Even more than usual," replied Fouquet.

"You know how to support losses?"

"Sometimes."

"What, Monsieur Fouquet a bad player!"

"There is play and play, Monsieur d'Herblay."

"How much have you lost?" inquired Aramis, with a slight
uneasiness.

Fouquet collected himself a moment, and then, without the
slightest emotion, said, "The evening has cost me four
millions," and a bitter laugh drowned the last vibration of
these words.

Aramis, who did not expect such an amount, dropped his pen.
"Four millions," he said; "you have lost four millions, --
impossible!"

"Monsieur Colbert held my cards for me," replied the
superintendent, with a similar bitter laugh.

"Ah, now I understand; so, so, a new application for funds?"

"Yes, and from the king's own lips. It was impossible to
ruin a man with a more charming smile. What do you think of
it?"

"It is clear that your destruction is the object in view."

"That is your opinion?"

"Still. Besides, there is nothing in it which should
astonish you, for we have foreseen it all along"

"Yes; but I did not expect four millions."

"No doubt the amount is serious, but, after all, four
millions are not quite the death of a man, especially when
the man in question is Monsieur Fouquet."

"My dear D'Herblay, if you knew the contents of my coffers,
you would be less easy."

"And you promised?"

"What could I do?"

"That's true."

"The very day I refuse, Colbert will procure the money;
whence I know not, but he will procure it: and I shall be
lost."

"There is no doubt of that. In how many days did you promise
these four millions?"

"In three days. The king seemed exceedingly pressed."

"In three days?"

"When I think," resumed Fouquet, "that just now as I passed
along the streets, the people cried out, `There is the rich
Monsieur Fouquet,' it is enough to turn my brain."

"Stay, monsieur, the matter is not worth so much trouble,"
said Aramis, calmly, sprinkling some sand over the letter he
had just written.

"Suggest a remedy, then, for this evil without a remedy."

"There is only one remedy for you, -- pay."

"But it is very uncertain whether I have the money.
Everything must be exhausted; Belle-Isle is paid for; the
pension has been paid; and money, since the investigation of
the accounts of those who farm the revenue, is scarce.
Besides, admitting that I pay this time, how can I do so on
another occasion? When kings have tasted money, they are
like tigers who have tasted flesh, they devour everything.
The day will arrive -- must arrive -- when I shall have to
say, `Impossible, sire,' and on that very day I am a lost
man."

Aramis raised his shoulders slightly, saying:

"A man in your position, my lord, is only lost when he
wishes to be so."

"A man, whatever his position may be, cannot hope to
struggle against a king."

"Nonsense; when I was young I wrestled successfully with the
Cardinal Richelieu, who was king of France, -- nay more --
cardinal."

"Where are my armies, my troops, my treasures? I have not
even Belle-Isle."

"Bah! necessity is the mother of invention, and when you
think all is lost, something will be discovered which will
retrieve everything."

"Who will discover this wonderful something?"

"Yourself."

"I! I resign my office of inventor."

"Then I will."

"Be it so. But set to work without delay."

"Oh! we have time enough!"

"You kill me, D'Herblay, with your calmness," said the
superintendent, passing his handkerchief over his face.

"Do you not remember that I one day told you not to make
yourself uneasy, if you possessed courage? Have you any?"

"I believe so."

"Then don't make yourself uneasy."

"It is decided, then, that, at the last moment, you will
come to my assistance."

"It will only be the repayment of a debt I owe you."

"It is the vocation of financiers to anticipate the wants of
men such as yourself, D'Herblay."

"If obligingness is the vocation of financiers, charity is
the virtue of the clergy. Only, on this occasion, do you
act, monsieur. You are not yet sufficiently reduced, and at
the last moment we will see what is to be done."

"We shall see, then, in a very short time."

"Very well. However, permit me to tell you that, personally,
I regret exceedingly that you are at present so short of
money, because I was myself about to ask you for some."

"For yourself?"

"For myself, or some of my people, for mine or for ours."

"How much do you want?"

"Be easy on that score; a roundish sum, it is true, but not
too exorbitant."

"Tell me the amount."

"Fifty thousand francs."

"Oh! a mere nothing. Of course one has always fifty thousand
francs. Why the deuce cannot that knave Colbert be as easily
satisfied as you are -- and I should give myself far less
trouble than I do. When do you need this sum?"

"To-morrow morning; but you wish to know its destination."

"Nay, nay, chevalier, I need no explanation."

"To-morrow is the first of June."

"Well?"

"One of our bonds becomes due."

"I did not know we had any bond."

"Certainly, to-morrow we pay our last third instalment."

"What third?"

"Of the one hundred and fifty thousand francs to
Baisemeaux."

"Baisemeaux? Who is he?"

"The governor of the Bastile."

"Yes, I remember. On what grounds am I to pay one hundred
and fifty thousand francs for that man?"

"On account of the appointment which he, or rather we,
purchased from Louviere and Tremblay."

"I have a very vague recollection of the matter."

"That is likely enough, for you have so many affairs to
attend to. However, I do not believe you have any affair in
the world of greater importance than this one."

"Tell me, then, why we purchased this appointment."

"Why, in order to render him a service in the first place,
and afterwards ourselves."

"Ourselves? You are joking."

"Monseigneur, the time may come when the governor of the
Bastile may prove a very excellent acquaintance."

"I have not the good fortune to understand you, D'Herblay."

"Monseigneur, we had our own poets, our own engineer, our
own architect, our own musicians, our own printer, and our
own painters; we needed our own governor of the Bastile."

"Do you think so?"

"Let us not deceive ourselves, monseigneur; we are very much
opposed to paying the Bastile a visit," added the prelate,
displaying, beneath his pale lips, teeth which were still
the same beautiful teeth so much admired thirty years
previously by Marie Michon.

"And you think it is not too much to pay one hundred and
fifty thousand francs for that? I thought you generally put
out money at better interest than that."

"The day will come when you will admit your mistake."

"My dear D'Herblay, the very day on which a man enters the
Bastile, he is no longer protected by his past."

"Yes, he is, if the bonds are perfectly regular; besides,
that good fellow Baisemeaux has not a courtier's heart. I am
certain, my lord, that he will not remain ungrateful for
that money, without taking into account, I repeat, that I
retain the acknowledgments."

"It is a strange affair! usury in a matter of benevolence."

"Do not mix yourself up with it, monseigneur; if there be
usury, it is I who practice it, and both of us reap the
advantage from it -- that is all."

"Some intrigue, D'Herblay?"

"I do not deny it."

"And Baisemeaux an accomplice in it?"

"Why not? -- there are worse accomplices than he. May I
depend, then, upon the five thousand pistoles to-morrow?"

"Do you want them this evening?"

"It would be better, for I wish to start early; poor
Baisemeaux will not be able to imagine what has become of
me, and must be upon thorns."

"You shall have the amount in an hour. Ah, D'Herblay, the
interest of your one hundred and fifty thousand francs will
never pay my four millions for me."

"Why not, monseigneur."

"Good-night, I have business to transact with my clerks
before I retire."

"A good night's rest, monseigneur."

"D'Herblay, you wish things that are impossible."

"Shall I have my fifty thousand francs this evening?"

"Yes."

"Go to sleep, then, in perfect safety -- it is I who tell
you to do so."

Notwithstanding this assurance, and the tone in which it was
given, Fouquet left the room shaking his head, and heaving a
sigh.




CHAPTER 98

M. Baisemeaux de Montlezun's Accounts



The clock of St. Paul was striking seven as Aramis, on
horseback, dressed as a simple citizen, that is to say, in
colored suit, with no distinctive mark about him, except a
kind of hunting-knife by his side, passed before the Rue du
Petit-Muse, and stopped opposite the Rue des Tourelles, at
the gate of the Bastile. Two sentinels were on duty at the
gate; they made no difficulty about admitting Aramis, who
entered without dismounting, and they pointed out the way he
was to go by a long passage with buildings on both sides.
This passage led to the drawbridge, or, in other words, to
the real entrance. The drawbridge was down, and the duty of
the day was about being entered upon. The sentinel at the
outer guardhouse stopped Aramis's further progress, asking
him, in a rough tone of voice, what had brought him there.
Aramis explained, with his usual politeness, that a wish to
speak to M. Baisemeaux de Montlezun had occasioned his
visit. The first sentinel then summoned a second sentinel,
stationed within an inner lodge, who showed his face at the
grating, and inspected the new arrival most attentively.
Aramis reiterated the expression of his wish to see the
governor, whereupon the sentinel called to an officer of
lower grade, who was walking about in a tolerably spacious
courtyard and who, in turn, on being informed of his object,
ran to seek one of the officers of the governor's staff. The
latter, after having listened to Aramis's request, begged
him to wait a moment, then went away a short distance, but
returned to ask his name. "I cannot tell it you, monsieur,"
said Aramis, "I need only mention that I have matters of
such importance to communicate to the governor, that I can
only rely beforehand upon one thing, that M. de Baisemeaux
will be delighted to see me; nay, more than that, when you
have told him that it is the person whom he expected on the
first of June, I am convinced he will hasten here himself."
The officer could not possibly believe that a man of the
governor's importance should put himself out for a person of
so little importance as the citizen-looking visitor on
horseback. "It happens most fortunately, monsieur," he said,
"that the governor is just going out, and you can perceive
his carriage with the horses already harnessed, in the
courtyard yonder; there will be no occasion for him to come
to meet you, as he will see you as he passes by." Aramis
bowed to signify his assent; he did not wish to inspire
others with too exalted an opinion of himself, and therefore
waited patiently and in silence, leaning upon the saddle-bow
of his horse. Ten minutes had hardly elapsed when the
governor's carriage was observed to move. The governor
appeared at the door, and got into the carriage, which
immediately prepared to start. The same ceremony was
observed for the governor himself as with a suspected
stranger; the sentinel at the lodge advanced as the carriage
was about to pass under the arch, and the governor opened
the carriage-door, himself setting the example of obedience
to orders; so that, in this way, the sentinel could convince
himself that no one quitted the Bastile improperly. The
carriage rolled along under the archway, but at the moment
the iron-gate was opened, the officer approached the
carriage, which had been again stopped, and said something
to the governor, who immediately put his head out of the
door-way, and perceived Aramis on horseback at the end of
the drawbridge. He immediately uttered almost a shout of
delight, and got out, or rather darted out of his carriage,
running towards Aramis, whose hands he seized, making a
thousand apologies. He almost embraced him. "What a
difficult matter to enter the Bastile!" said Aramis. "Is it
the same for those who are sent here against their wills, as
for those who come of their own accord?"

"A thousand pardons, my lord. How delighted I am to see your
Grace!"

"Hush! What are you thinking of, my dear M. Baisemeaux? What
do you suppose would be thought of a bishop in my present
costume?"

"Pray, excuse me, I had forgotten. Take this gentleman's
horse to the stables," cried Baisemeaux.

"No, no," said Aramis; "I have five thousand pistoles in the
saddle-bags."

The governor's countenance became so radiant, that if the
prisoners had seen him they would have imagined some prince
of the blood royal had arrived. "Yes, you are right, the
horse shall be taken to the government house. Will you get
into the carriage, my dear M. d'Herblay? and it shall take
us back to my house."

"Get into a carriage to cross a courtyard! do you believe I
am so great an invalid? No, no, we will go on foot."

Baisemeaux then offered his arm as a support, but the
prelate did not accept it. They arrived in this manner at
the government house, Baisemeaux rubbing his hands and
glancing at the horse from time to time, while Aramis was
looking at the bleak bare walls. A tolerably handsome
vestibule and a staircase of white stone led to the
governor's apartments, who crossed the ante-chamber, the
dining-room, where breakfast was being prepared, opened a
small side door, and closeted himself with his guest in a
large cabinet, the windows of which opened obliquely upon
the courtyard and the stables. Baisemeaux installed the
prelate with that all-inclusive politeness of which a good
man, or a grateful man, alone possesses the secret. An
arm-chair, a footstool, a small table beside him, on which
to rest his hand, everything was prepared by the governor
himself. With his own hands, too, he placed upon the table,
with much solicitude, the bag containing the gold, which one
of the soldiers had brought up with the most respectful
devotion; and the soldier having left the room, Baisemeaux
himself closed the door after him, drew aside one of the
window-curtains, and looked steadfastly at Aramis to see if
the prelate required anything further.

"Well, my lord," he said, still standing up, "of all men of
their word, you still continue to be the most punctual."

"In matters of business, dear M. de Baisemeaux, exactitude
is not a virtue only, it is a duty as well."

"Yes, in matters of business, certainly; but what you have
with me is not of that character; it is a service you are
rendering me."

"Come, confess, dear M. de Baisemeaux, that, notwithstanding
this exactitude, you have not been without a little
uneasiness."

"About your health, I certainly have," stammered out
Baisemeaux.

"I wished to come here yesterday, but I was not able, as I
was too fatigued," continued Aramis. Baisemeaux anxiously
slipped another cushion behind his guest's back. "But,"
continued Aramis, "I promised myself to come and pay you a
visit to-day, early in the morning."

"You are really very kind, my lord."

"And it was a good thing for me I was punctual, I think."

"What do you mean?"

"Yes, you were going out." At which latter remark Baisemeaux
colored and said, "It is true I was going out."

"Then I prevent you," said Aramis; whereupon the
embarrassment of Baisemeaux became visibly greater. "I am
putting you to inconvenience," he continued, fixing a keen
glance upon the poor governor; "if I had known that, I
should not have come."

"How can your lordship imagine that you could ever
inconvenience me?"

"Confess you were going in search of money."

"No," stammered out Baisemeaux, "no! I assure you I was
going to ---- "

"Does the governor still intend to go to M. Fouquet?"
suddenly called out the major from below. Baisemeaux ran to
the window like a madman. "No, no," he exclaimed in a state
of desperation, "who the deuce is speaking of M. Fouquet?
are you drunk below there? why an I interrupted when I am
engaged on business?"

"You were going to M. Fouquet's," said Aramis biting his
lips, "to M. Fouquet, the abbe, or the superintendent?"

Baisemeaux almost made up his mind to tell an untruth, but
he could not summon courage to do so. "To the
superintendent," he said.

"It is true, then, that you were in want of money, since you
were going to a person who gives it away!"

"I assure you, my lord ---- "

"You were afraid?"

"My dear lord, it was the uncertainty and ignorance in which
I was as to where you were to be found."

"You would have found the money you require at M. Fouquet's,
for he is a man whose hand is always open."

"I swear that I should never have ventured to ask M. Fouquet
for money. I only wished to ask him for your address."

"To ask M. Fouquet for my address?" exclaimed Aramis,
opening his eyes in real astonishment.

"Yes," said Baisemeaux, greatly disturbed by the glance
which the prelate fixed upon him, -- "at M. Fouquet's
certainly."

"There is no harm in that, dear M. Baisemeaux, only I would
ask, why ask my address of M. Fouquet?"

"That I might write to you."

"I understand," said Aramis, smiling, "but that is not what
I meant; I do not ask you what you required my address for;
I only ask why you should go to M. Fouquet for it?"

"Oh!" said Baisemeaux, "as Belle-Isle is the property of M.
Fouquet, and as Belle-Isle is in the diocese of Vannes, and
as you are bishop of Vannes ---- "

"But, my dear Baisemeaux, since you knew I was bishop of
Vannes, you had no occasion to ask M. Fouquet for my
address."

"Well, monsieur," said Baisemeaux, completely at bay, "if I
have acted indiscreetly, I beg your pardon most sincerely."

"Nonsense," observed Aramis, calmly: "how can you possibly
have acted indiscreetly?" And while he composed his face,
and continued to smile cheerfully on the governor, he was
considering how Baisemeaux, who was not aware of his
address, knew, however, that Vannes was his residence. "I
shall clear all this up," he said to himself, and then
speaking aloud, added, -- "Well, my dear governor, shall we
now arrange our little accounts?"

"I am at your orders, my lord; but tell me beforehand, my
lord, whether you will do me the honor to breakfast with me
as usual?"

"Very willingly, indeed."

"Thai's well," said Baisemeaux, as he struck the bell before
him three times.

"What does that mean?" inquired Aramis.

"That I have some one to breakfast with me, and that
preparations are to be made accordingly."

"And you rang thrice. Really, my dear governor, I begin to
think you are acting ceremoniously with me."

"No, indeed. Besides, the least I can do is to receive you
in the best way I can."

"But why so?"

"Because not even a prince could have done what you have
done for me."

"Nonsense! nonsense!"

"Nay, I assure you ---- "

"Let us speak of other matters," said Aramis. "Or rather,
tell me how your affairs here are getting on."

"Not over well."

"The deuce!"

"M. de Mazarin was not hard enough."

"Yes, I see; you require a government full of suspicion --
like that of the old cardinal, for instance."

"Yes; matters went on better under him. The brother of his
`gray eminence' made his fortune here."

"Believe me, my dear governor," said Aramis, drawing closer
to Baisemeaux, "a young king is well worth an old cardinal.
Youth has its suspicions, its fits of anger, its prejudices,
as old age has its hatreds, its precautions, and its fears.
Have you paid your three years' profits to Louviere and
Tremblay?"

"Most certainly I have."

"So that you have nothing more to give them than the fifty
thousand francs I have brought with me?"

"Nothing."

"Have you not saved anything, then?"

"My lord, in giving the fifty thousand francs of my own to
these gentlemen, I assure you that I give them everything I
gain. I told M. d'Artagnan so yesterday evening."

"Ah!" said Aramis, whose eyes sparkled for a moment, but
became immediately afterwards as unmoved as before; "so you
have seen my old friend D'Artagnan; how was he?"

"Wonderfully well."

"And what did you say to him, M. de Baisemeaux?"

"I told him," continued the governor, not perceiving his own
thoughtlessness, "I told him that I fed my prisoners too
well."

"How many have you?" inquired Aramis, in an indifferent tone
of voice.

"Sixty."

"Well, that is a tolerably round number."

"In former times, my lord, there were, during certain years,
as many as two hundred."

"Still a minimum of sixty is not to be grumbled at."

"Perhaps not; for, to anybody but myself, each prisoner
would bring in two hundred and fifty pistoles; for instance,
for a prince of the blood I have fifty francs a day."

"Only you have no prince of the blood; at least, I suppose
so," said Aramis, with a slight tremor in his voice.

"No, thank Heaven! -- I mean, no, unfortunately."

"What do you mean by unfortunately?"

"Because my appointment would be improved by it. So, fifty
francs per day for a prince of the blood, thirty-six for a
marechal of France ---- "

"But you have as many marechals of France, I suppose, as you
have princes of the blood?"

"Alas! no more. It is true lieutenant-generals and
brigadiers pay twenty-six francs, and I have two of them.
After that, come councilors of parliament, who bring me
fifteen francs, and I have six of them."

"I did not know," said Aramis, "that councilors were so
productive."

"Yes, but from fifteen francs I sink at once to ten francs;
namely, for an ordinary judge, and for an ecclesiastic."

"And you have seven, you say; an excellent affair."

"Nay, a bad one, and for this reason. How can I possibly
treat these poor fellows, who are of some good, at all
events, otherwise than as a councilor of parliament?"

"Yes, you are right; I do not see five francs difference
between them."

"You understand; if I have a fine fish, I pay four or five
francs for it; if I get a fine fowl, it costs me a franc and
a half. I fatten a good deal of poultry, but I have to buy
grain, and you cannot imagine the army of rats that infest
this place."

"Why not get half a dozen cats to deal with them?"

"Cats, indeed; yes, they eat them, but I was obliged to give
up the idea because of the way in which they treated my
grain. I have been obliged to have some terrier dogs sent me
from England to kill the rats. These dogs, unfortunately,
have tremendous appetites; they eat as much as a prisoner of
the fifth order, without taking into account the rabbits and
fowls they kill."

Was Aramis really listening or not? No one could have told;
his downcast eyes showed the attentive man; but the restless
hand betrayed the man absorbed in thought -- Aramis was
meditating.

"I was saying," continued Baisemeaux, "that a good-sized
fowl costs me a franc and a half, and that a fine fish costs
me four or five francs. Three meals are served at the
Bastile, and, as the prisoners, having nothing to do, are
always eating, a ten-franc man costs me seven francs and a
half."

"But did you not say that you treated those at ten francs
like those at fifteen?"

"Yes, certainly."

"Very well! Then you gain seven francs and a half upon those
who pay you fifteen francs."

"I must compensate myself somehow," said Baisemeaux, who saw
how he had been snapped up.

"You are quite right, my dear governor; but have you no
prisoners below ten francs?"

"Oh, yes! we have citizens and barristers at five francs.

"And do they eat, too?"

"Not a doubt about it; only you understand that they do not
get fish or poultry, nor rich wines at every meal; but at
all events thrice a week they have a good dish at their
dinner."

"Really, you are quite a philanthropist, my dear governor,
and you will ruin yourself."

"No, understand me; when the fifteen-franc has not eaten his
fowl, or the ten-franc has left his dish unfinished, I send
it to the five-franc prisoner; it is a feast for the poor
devil, and one must be charitable, you know."

"And what do you make out of your five-franc prisoners?"

"A franc and a half."

"Baisemeaux, you're an honest fellow; in honest truth I say
so."

"Thank you, my lord. But I feel most for the small tradesmen
and bailiffs' clerks, who are rated at three francs. They do
not often see Rhine carp or Channel sturgeon."

"But do not the five-franc gentlemen sometimes leave some
scraps?"

"Oh! my lord, do not believe I am so stingy as that; I
delight the heart of some poor little tradesman or clerk by
sending him a wing of a red partridge, a slice of venison,
or a slice of a truffled pasty, dishes which he never tasted
except in his dreams; these are the leavings of the
twenty-four franc prisoners; and as he eats and drinks, at
dessert he cries `Long live the King,' and blesses the
Bastile; with a couple of bottles of champagne, which cost
me five sous, I made him tipsy every Sunday. That class of
people call down blessings upon me, and are sorry to leave
the prison. Do you know that I have remarked, and it does me
infinite honor, that certain prisoners, who have been set at
liberty, have, almost immediately afterwards, got imprisoned
again? Why should this be the case, unless it be to enjoy
the pleasures of my kitchen? It is really the fact."

Aramis smiled with an expression of incredulity.

"You smile," said Baisemeaux.

"I do," returned Aramis.

"I tell you that we have names which have been inscribed on
our books thrice in the space of two years."

"I must see it before I believe it," said Aramis.

"Well, I can show it to you, although it is prohibited to
communicate the registers to strangers; and if you really
wish to see it with your own eyes ---- "

"I should be delighted, I confess."

"Very well," said Baisemeaux, and he took out of a cupboard
a large register. Aramis followed him most anxiously with
his eyes, and Baisemeaux returned, placed the register upon
the table, and turned over the leaves for a minute, and
stayed at the letter M.

"Look here," said he, "Martinier, January, 1659; Martinier,
June, 1660; Martinier, March, 1661. Mazarinades, etc.; you
understand it was only a pretext; people were not sent to
the Bastile for jokes against M. Mazarin; the fellow
denounced himself in order to get imprisoned here."

"And what was his object?"

"None other than to return to my kitchen at three francs a
day,."

"Three francs -- poor devil!"

"The poet, my lord, belongs to the lowest scale, the same
style of board as the small tradesman and bailiff's clerk;
but I repeat, it is to those people only that I give these
little surprises."

Aramis mechanically turned over the leaves of the register,
continuing to read the names, but without appearing to take
any interest in the names he read.

"In 1661, you perceive," said Baisemeaux, "eighty entries;
and in 1659, eighty also."

"Ah!" said Aramis. "Seldon; I seem to know that name. Was it
not you who spoke to me about a certain young man?"

"Yes, a poor devil of a student, who made -- What do you
call that where two Latin verses rhyme together?"

"A distich."

"Yes; that is it."

"Poor fellow; for a distich."

"Do you know that he made this distich against the Jesuits?"

"That makes no difference; the punishment seems very
severe."

"Do not pity him; last year you seemed to interest yourself
in him."

"Yes, I did so."

"Well, as your interest is all-powerful here, my lord, I
have treated him since that time as a prisoner at fifteen
francs."

"The same as this one, then," said Aramis, who had continued
turning over the leaves, and who had stopped at one of the
names which followed Martinier.

"Yes, the same as that one."

"Is that Marchiali an Italian?" said Aramis, pointing with
his finger to the name which had attracted his attention.

"Hush!" said Baisemeaux.

"Why hush?" said Aramis, involuntarily clenching his white
hand.

"I thought I had already spoken to you about that
Marchiali."

"No, it is the first time I ever heard his name pronounced."

"That may be, but perhaps I have spoken to you about him
without naming him."

"Is he an old offender?" asked Aramis, attempting to smile.

"On the contrary, he is quite young."

"Is his crime, then, very heinous?"

"Unpardonable."

"Has he assassinated any one?"

"Bah!"

"An incendiary, then?"

"Bah!"

"Has he slandered any one?"

"No, no! It is he who -- " and Baisemeaux approached
Aramis's ear, making a sort of ear-trumpet of his hands, and
whispered: "It is he who presumes to resemble the ---- "

"Yes, yes." said Aramis, "I now remember you already spoke
about it last year to me; but the crime appeared to me so
slight.

"Slight, do you say?"

"Or rather, so involuntary."

"My lord, it is not involuntarily that such a resemblance is
detected."

"Well, the fact is, I had forgotten it. But, my dear host,"
said Aramis, closing the register, "if I am not mistaken, we
are summoned."

Baisemeaux took the register, hastily restored it to its
place in the closet, which he locked, and put the key in his
pocket. "Will it be agreeable to your lordship to breakfast
now?" said he; "for you are right in supposing that
breakfast was announced."

"Assuredly, my dear governor," and they passed into the
dining-room.




CHAPTER 99

The Breakfast at Monsieur de Baisemeaux's



Aramis was generally temperate; but on this occasion, while
taking every care of his constitution, he did ample justice
to Baisemeaux's breakfast, which, in all respects, was most
excellent. The latter, on his side, was animated with the
wildest gayety; the sight of the five thousand pistoles,
which he glanced at from time to time, seemed to open his
heart. Every now and then he looked at Aramis with an
expression of the deepest gratitude; while the latter,
leaning back in his chair, took a few sips of wine from his
glass, with the air of a connoisseur. "Let me never hear any
ill words against the fare of the Bastile," said he, half
closing his eyes; "happy are the prisoners who can get only
half a bottle of such Burgundy every day."

"All those at fifteen francs drink it," said Baisemeaux. "It
is very old Volnay."

"Does that poor student, Seldon, drink such good wine?"

"Oh, no!"

"I thought I heard you say he was boarded at fifteen
francs."

"He! no, indeed; a man who makes districts -- distichs, I
mean -- at fifteen francs! No, no! it is his neighbor who is
at fifteen francs."

"Which neighbor?"

"The other, second Bertaudiere."

"Excuse me, my dear governor; but you speak a language which
requires quite an apprenticeship to understand."

"Very true," said the governor. "Allow me to explain: second
Bertaudiere is the person who occupies the second floor of
the tower of the Bertaudiere."

"So that Bertaudiere is the name of one of the towers of the
Bastile? The fact is, I think I recollect hearing that each
tower has a name of its own. Whereabouts is the one you are
speaking of?"

"Look," said Baisemeaux, going to the window. "It is that
tower to the left ---the second one."

"Is the prisoner at fifteen francs there?"

"Yes."

"Since when?"

"Seven or eight years, nearly."

"What do you mean by nearly? Do you not know the dates more
precisely?"

"It was not in my time, M. d'Herblay."

"But I should have thought that Louviere or Tremblay would
have told you."

"The secrets of the Bastile are never handed over with the
keys of the governorship."

"Indeed! Then the cause of his imprisonment is a mystery --
a state secret."

"Oh no! I do not suppose it is a state secret, but a secret
-- like everything else that happens at the Bastile."

"But," said Aramis, "why do you speak more freely of Seldon
than of second Bertaudiere?"

"Because, in my opinion, the crime of the man who writes a
distich is not so great as that of the man who resembles
---- "

"Yes, yes, I understand you. Still, do not the turnkeys talk
with your prisoners?"

"Of course."

"The prisoners, I suppose, tell them they are not guilty?"

"They are always telling them that; it is a matter of
course; the same song over and over again."

"But does not the resemblance you were speaking about just
now strike the turnkeys?"

"My dear M. d'Herblay, it is only for men attached to the
court, as you are, to take trouble about such matters."

"You're right, you're right, my dear M. Baisemeaux. Let me
give you another taste of this Volnay."

"Not a taste merely, a full glass; fill yours too."

"Nay, nay! You are a musketeer still, to the very tips of
your fingers, while I have become a bishop. A taste for me;
a glass for yourself."

"As you please." And Aramis and the governor nodded to each
other, as they drank their wine. "But," said Aramis, looking
with fixed attention at the ruby-colored wine he had raised
to the level of his eyes, as if he wished to enjoy it with
all his senses at the same moment, "but what you might call
a resemblance, another would not, perhaps, take any notice
of."

"Most certainly he would, though, if it were any one who
knew the person he resembles."

"I really think, dear M. Baisemeaux, that it can be nothing
more than a resemblance of your own creation."

"Upon my honor, it is not so."

"Stay," continued Aramis, "I have seen many persons very
like the one we are speaking of; but, out of respect, no one
ever said anything about it."

"Very likely; because there is resemblance and resemblance.
This is a striking one, and, if you were to see him, you
would admit it to be so."

"If I were to see him, indeed," said Aramis, in an
indifferent tone; "but in all probability I never shall."

"Why not?"

"Because if I were even to put my foot inside one of those
horrible dungeons, I should fancy I was buried there
forever."

"No, no; the cells are very good places to live in."

"I really do not, and cannot believe it, and that is a
fact."

"Pray do not speak ill of second Bertaudiere. It is really a
good room, very nicely furnished and carpeted. The young
fellow has by no means been unhappy there; the best lodging
the Bastile affords has been his. There is a chance for
you."

"Nay, nay," said Aramis, coldly; "you will never make me
believe there are any good rooms in the Bastile; and, as for
your carpets, they exist only in your imagination. I should
find nothing but spiders, rats, and perhaps toads, too."

"Toads?" cried Baisemeaux.

"Yes, in the dungeons."

"Ah! I don't say there are not toads in the dungeons,"
replied Baisemeaux. "But -- will you be convinced by your
own eyes?" he continued, with a sudden impulse.

"No, certainly not."

"Not even to satisfy yourself of the resemblance which you
deny, as you do the carpets?"

"Some spectral-looking person, a mere shadow; an unhappy,
dying man."

"Nothing of the kind -- as brisk and vigorous a young fellow
as ever lived."

"Melancholy and ill-tempered, then?"

"Not at all; very gay and lively."

"Nonsense; you are joking."

"Will you follow me?" said Baisemeaux.

"What for?"

"To go the round of the Bastile."

"Why?"

"You will then see for yourself -- see with your own eyes."

"But the regulations?"

"Never mind them. To-day my major has leave of absence; the
lieutenant is visiting the post on the bastions; we are sole
masters of the situation."

"No, no, my dear governor; why, the very idea of the sound
of the bolts makes me shudder. You will only have to forget
me in second or fourth Bertaudiere, and then ---- "

"You are refusing an opportunity that may never present
itself again. Do you know that, to obtain the favor I
propose to you gratis, some of the princes of the blood have
offered me as much as fifty thousand francs."

"Really! he must be worth seeing, then?"

"Forbidden fruit, my lord, forbidden fruit. You who belong
to the church ought to know that."

"Well, if I had any curiosity, it would be to see the poor
author of the distich."

"Very well, we will see him, too; but if I were at all
curious, it would be about the beautiful carpeted room and
its lodger."

"Furniture is very commonplace; and a face with no
expression in it offers little or no interest."

"But a boarder at fifteen francs is always interesting."

"By the by, I forgot to ask you about that. Why fifteen
francs for him, and only three francs for poor Seldon?"

"The distinction made in that instance was a truly noble
act, and one which displayed the king's goodness of heart to
great advantage."

"The king's, you say."

"The cardinal's, I mean. `This unhappy man,' said M.
Mazarin, `is destined to remain in prison forever.'"

"Why so?"

"Why, it seems that his crime is a lasting one, and,
consequently, his punishment ought to be so, too."

"Lasting?"

"No doubt of it, unless he is fortunate enough to catch the
small-pox, and even that is difficult, for we never get any
impure air here."

"Nothing can be more ingenious than your train of reasoning,
my dear M. de Baisemeaux. Do you, however, mean to say that
this unfortunate man must suffer without interruption or
termination?"

"I did not say he was to suffer, my lord, a fifteen-franc
boarder does not suffer."

"He suffers imprisonment, at all events."

"No doubt; there is no help for that, but this suffering is
sweetened for him. You must admit that this young fellow was
not born to eat all the good things he does eat; for
instance, such things as we have on the table now; this
pasty that has not been touched, these crawfish from the
River Marne, of which we have hardly taken any, and which
are almost as large as lobsters; all these things will at
once be taken to second Bertaudiere, with a bottle of that
Volnay which you think so excellent. After you have seen it
you will believe it, I hope."

"Yes, my dear governor, certainly; but all this time you are
thinking only of your very happy fifteen-franc prisoner, and
you forget poor Seldon, my protege."

"Well, out of consideration for you, it shall be a gala day
for him; he shall have some biscuits and preserves with this
small bottle of port."

"You are a good-hearted fellow; I have said so already, and
I repeat it, my dear Baisemeaux."

"Well, let us set off, then," said the governor, a little
bewildered, partly from the wine he had drunk, and partly
from Aramis's praises.

"Do not forget that I only go to oblige you," said the
prelate.

"Very well; but you will thank me when you get there."

"Let us go, then."

"Wait until I have summoned the jailer," said Baisemeaux, as
he struck the bell twice, at which summons a man appeared.
"I am going to visit the towers," said the governor. "No
guards, no drums, no noise at all."

"If I were not to leave my cloak here," said Aramis,
pretending to be alarmed; "I should really think I was going
to prison on my own account."

The jailer preceded the governor, Aramis walking on his
right hand; some of the soldiers who happened to be in the
courtyard drew themselves up in line, as stiff as posts, as
the governor passed along. Baisemeaux led the way down
several steps which conducted to a sort of esplanade; thence
they arrived at the draw-bridge, where the sentinels on duty
received the governor with the proper honors. The governor
turned toward Aramis, and, speaking in such a tone that the
sentinels could not lose a word, he observed, -- "I hope you
have a good memory, monsieur?"

"Why?" inquired Aramis.

"On account of your plans and your measurements, for you
know that no one is allowed, not architects even, to enter
where the prisoners are, with paper, pens or pencil."

"Good," said Aramis to himself, "it seems I am an architect,
then. It sounds like one of D'Artagnan's jokes, who
perceived in me the engineer of Belle-Isle." Then he added
aloud: "Be easy on that score, monsieur; in our profession,
a mere glance and a good memory are quite sufficient."

Baisemeaux did not change countenance, and the soldiers took
Aramis for what he seemed to be. "Very well; we will first
visit la Bertaudiere, "said Baisemeaux, still intending the
sentinels to hear him. Then, turning to the jailer, he
added: "You will take the opportunity of carrying to No. 2
the few dainties I pointed out."

"Dear M. de Baisemeaux," said Aramis, "you are always
forgetting No. 3."

"So I am," said the governor; and upon that, they began to
ascend. The number of bolts, gratings, and locks for this
single courtyard would have sufficed for the safety of an
entire city. Aramis was neither an imaginative nor a
sensitive man; he had been somewhat of a poet in his youth,
but his heart was hard and indifferent, as the heart of
every man of fifty-five years of age is, who has been
frequently and passionately attached to women in his
lifetime, or rather who has been passionately loved by them.
But when he placed his foot upon the worn stone steps, along
which so many unhappy wretches had passed, when he felt
himself impregnated, as it were, with the atmosphere of
those gloomy dungeons, moistened with tears, there could be
but little doubt he was overcome by his feelings, for his
head was bowed and his eyes became dim, as he followed
Baisemeaux without a syllable.




CHAPTER 100

The Second Floor of la Bertaudiere



On the second flight of stairs, whether from fatigue or
emotion, the breathing of the visitor began to fail him, and
he leaned against the wall. "Will you begin with this one?"
said Baisemeaux; "for since we are going to both, it matters
very little whether we ascend from the second to the third
story, or descend from the third to the second."

"No, no," exclaimed Aramis, eagerly, "higher, if you please;
the one above is the more urgent." They continued their
ascent. "Ask the jailer for the keys," whispered Aramis.
Baisemeaux did so, took the keys, and, himself, opened the
door of the third room. The jailer was the first to enter;
he placed upon the table the provisions, which the
kind-hearted governor called dainties, and then left the
room. The prisoner had not stirred; Baisemeaux then entered,
while Aramis remained at the threshold, from which place he
saw a youth about eighteen years of age, who, raising his
head at the unusual noise, jumped off the bed, as he
perceived the governor, and clasping his hands together,
began to cry out, "My mother, my mother," in tones which
betrayed such deep distress that Aramis, despite his command
over himself, felt a shudder pass through his frame. "My
dear boy," said Baisemeaux, endeavoring to smile, "I have
brought you a diversion and an extra, -- the one for the
mind, the other for the body; this gentleman has come to
take your measure, and here are some preserves for your
dessert."

"Oh, monsieur," exclaimed the young man, "keep me in
solitude for a year, let me have nothing but bread and water
for a year, but tell me that at the end of a year I shall
leave this place, tell me that at the end of a year I shall
see my mother again."

"But I have heard you say that your mother was very poor,
and that you were very badly lodged when you were living
with her, while here -- upon my word!"

"If she were poor, monsieur, the greater reason to restore
her only means of support to her. Badly lodged with her! Oh,
monsieur, every one is always well lodged when he is free."

"At all events, since you yourself admit you have done
nothing but write that unhappy distich ---- "

"But without any intention, I swear. Let me be punished --
cut off the hand which wrote it, I will work with the other
-- but restore my mother to me."

"My boy," said Baisemeaux, "you know very well that it does
not depend upon me; all I can do for you is to increase your
rations, give you a glass of port wine now and then, slip in
a biscuit for you between a couple of plates."

"Great heaven!" exclaimed the young man, falling backward
and rolling on the ground.

Aramis, unable to bear this scene any longer, withdrew as
far as the landing. "Unhappy, wretched man," he murmured.

"Yes, monsieur, he is indeed very wretched," said the
jailer; "but it is his parents' fault.

"In what way?"

"No doubt. Why did they let him learn Latin? Too much
knowledge, you see; it is that which does harm. Now I, for
instance, can't read or write, and therefore I am not in
prison." Aramis looked at the man, who seemed to think that
being a jailer in the Bastile was not being in prison. As
for Baisemeaux, noticing the little effect produced by his
advice and his port wine, he left the dungeon quite upset.
"You have forgotten to close the door," said the jailer.

"So I have," said Baisemeaux, "there are the keys, do you do
it."

"I will solicit the pardon of that poor boy," said Aramis.

"And if you do not succeed," said Baisemeaux, "at least beg
that he may be transferred to the ten-franc list, by which
both he and I shall be gainers."

"If the other prisoner calls out for his mother in a similar
manner," said Aramis, "I prefer not to enter at all, but
will take my measure from outside."

"No fear of that, monsieur architect, the one we are now
going to see is as gentle as a lamb; before he could call
after his mother he must open his lips, and he never says a
word."

"Let us go in, then," said Aramis, gloomily.

"Are you the architect of the prisons, monsieur?" said the
jailer.

"I am."

"It is odd, then, that you are not more accustomed to all
this."

Aramis perceived that, to avoid giving rise to any
suspicions he must summon all his strength of mind to his
assistance. Baisemeaux, who carried the keys, opened the
door. "Stay outside," he said to the jailer, "and wait for
us at the bottom of the steps." The jailer obeyed and
withdrew.

Baisemeaux entered first and opened the second door himself.
By the light which filtered through the iron-barred window,
could be seen a handsome young man, short in stature, with
closely cut hair, and a beard beginning to grow; he was
sitting on a stool, his elbow resting on an armchair, and
all the upper part of his body reclining against it. His
dress, thrown upon the bed, was of rich black velvet, and he
inhaled the fresh air which blew in upon his breast through
a shirt of the very finest cambric. As the governor entered,
the young man turned his head with a look full of
indifference; and on recognizing Baisemeaux, he arose and
saluted him courteously. But when his eyes fell upon Aramis,
who remained in the background, the latter trembled, turned
pale, and his hat, which he held in his hand, fell upon the
ground, as if all his muscles had become relaxed at once.
Baisemeaux, habituated to the presence of his prisoner, did
not seem to share any of the sensations which Aramis
experienced, but, with all the zeal of a good servant, he
busied himself in arranging on the table the pasty and
crawfish he had brought with him. Occupied in this manner,
he did not remark how disturbed his guest had become. When
he had finished, however, he turned to the young prisoner
and said: "You are looking very well, -- are you so?"

"Quite well, I thank you, monsieur," replied the young man.

The effect of the voice was such as almost to overpower
Aramis, and notwithstanding his control over himself, he
advanced a few steps towards him, with his eyes wide open
and his lips trembling. The movement he made was so marked
that Baisemeaux, notwithstanding his preoccupation, observed
it. "This gentleman is an architect who has come to examine
your chimney," said Baisemeaux, "does it smoke?"

"Never, monsieur."

"You were saying just now," said the governor, rubbing his
hands together, "that it was not possible for a man to be
happy in prison; here, however, is one who is so. You have
nothing to complain of, I hope?"

"Nothing."

"Do you ever feel weary?" said Aramis.

"Never."

"Ha, ha," said Baisemeaux, in a low tone of voice; "was I
right?"

"Well, my dear governor, it is impossible not to yield to
evidence. Is it allowed to put any question to him?"

"As many as you like."

"Very well; be good enough to ask him if he knows why he is
here."

"This gentleman requests me to ask you," said Baisemeaux,
"if you are aware of the cause of your imprisonment?"

"No, monsieur," said the young man, unaffectedly, "I am
not."

"That is hardly possible," said Aramis, carried away by his
feelings in spite of himself; "if you were really ignorant
of the cause of your detention, you would be furious."

"I was so during the early days of my imprisonment."

"Why are you not so now?"

"Because I have reflected."

"That is strange," said Aramis.

"Is it not odd?" said Baisemeaux.

"May one venture to ask you, monsieur, on what you have
reflected?"

"I felt that as I had committed no crime, Heaven could not
punish me."

"What is a prison, then," inquired Aramis, "if it be not a
punishment?"

"Alas! I cannot tell, said the young man; "all that I can
tell you now is the very opposite of what I felt seven years
ago."

"To hear you converse, to witness your resignation, one
might almost believe that you liked your imprisonment?"

"I endure it.

"In the certainty of recovering your freedom some day, I
suppose?"

"I have no certainty; hope I have, and that is all; and yet
I acknowledge that this hope becomes less every day."

"Still, why should you not again be free, since you have
already been so?"

"That is precisely the reason," replied the young man,
"which prevents me expecting liberty; why should I have been
imprisoned at all if it had been intended to release me
afterwards?"

"How old are you?"

"I do not know."

"What is your name?"

"I have forgotten the name by which I was called."

"Who are your parents?"

"I never knew them."

"But those who brought you up?"

"They did not call me their son."

"Did you ever love any one before coming here?"

"I loved my nurse, and my flowers."

"Was that all?"

"I also loved my valet."

"Do you regret your nurse and your valet?"

"I wept very much when they died."

"Did they die since you have been here, or before you came?"

"They died the evening before I was carried off."

"Both at the same time?"

"Yes, both at the same time."

"In what manner were you carried off?"

"A man came for me, directed me to get into a carriage,
which was closed and locked, and brought me here."

"Would you be able to recognize that man again?"

"He was masked."

"Is not this an extraordinary tale?" said Baisemeaux, in a
low tone of voice, to Aramis, who could hardly breathe.

"It is indeed extraordinary," he murmured.

"But what is still more extraordinary is, that he has never
told me so much as he has just told you."

"Perhaps the reason may be that you have never questioned
him," said Aramis.

"It's possible," replied Baisemeaux; "I have no curiosity.
Have you looked at the room? it's a fine one, is it not?"

"Very much so."

"A carpet ---- "

"Beautiful."

"I'll wager he had nothing like it before he came here."

"I think so, too." And then again turning towards the young
man, he said, "Do you not remember to have been visited at
some time or another by a strange lady or gentleman?"

"Yes, indeed; thrice by a woman, who each time came to the
door in a carriage, and entered covered with a veil, which
she raised when we were together and alone."

"Do you remember that woman?"

"Yes."

"What did she say to you?"

The young man smiled mournfully, and then replied, "She
inquired, as you have just done, if I were happy, and if I
were getting weary?"

"What did she do on arriving, and on leaving you?"

"She pressed me in her arms, held me in her embrace, and
kissed me."

"Do you remember her?"

"Perfectly."

"Do you recall her features distinctly?"

"Yes."

"You would recognize her, then, if accident brought her
before you, or led you into her presence?"

"Most certainly."

A flush of fleeting satisfaction passed across Aramis's
face. At this moment Baisemeaux heard the jailer
approaching. "Shall we leave?" he said, hastily, to Aramis.

Aramis, who probably had learnt all that he cared to know,
replied, "When you like."

The young man saw them prepare to leave, and saluted them
politely. Baisemeaux replied merely by a nod of the head,
while Aramis, with a respect, arising perhaps from the sight
of such misfortune, saluted the prisoner profoundly. They
left the room, Baisemeaux closing the door behind them.

"Well," said Baisemeaux, as they descended the staircase,
"what do you think of it all?"

"I have discovered the secret, my dear governor," he said.

"Bah! what is the secret, then?"

"A murder was committed in that house."

"Nonsense."

"But attend; the valet and nurse died the same day."

"Well."

"And by poison. What do you think?"

"That it is very likely to be true."

"What! that that young man is an assassin?"

"Who said that? What makes you think that poor young fellow
could be an assassin?"

"The very thing I was saying. A crime was committed in his
house," said Aramis, "and that was quite sufficient; perhaps
he saw the criminals, and it was feared that he might say
something."

"The deuce! if I only thought that ---- "

"Well?"

"I would redouble the surveillance."

"Oh, he does not seem to wish to escape."

"You do not know what prisoners are."

"Has he any books?"

"None; they are strictly prohibited, and under M. de
Mazarin's own hand."

"Have you the writing still?"

"Yes, my lord; would you like to look at it as you return to
take your cloak?

"I should, for I like to look at autographs."

"Well, then, this one is of the most unquestionable
authenticity; there is only one erasure."

"Ah, ah! an erasure; and in what respect?"

"With respect to a figure. At first there was written: `To
be boarded at fifty francs.'"

"As princes of the blood, in fact?"

"But the cardinal must have seen his mistake, you
understand; for he canceled the zero, and has added a one
before the five. But, by the by ---- "

"What?"

"You do not speak of the resemblance."

"I do not speak of it, dear M. de Baisemeaux, for a very
simple reason -- because it does not exist."

"The deuce it doesn't."

"Or, if it does exist, it is only in your own imagination;
but, supposing it were to exist elsewhere, I think it would
be better for you not to speak about it."

"Really."

"The king, Louis XIV. -- you understand -- would be
excessively angry with you, if he were to learn that you
contributed in any way to spread the report that one of his
subjects has the effrontery to resemble him."

"It is true, quite true," said Baisemeaux, thoroughly
alarmed; "but I have not spoken of the circumstance to any
one but yourself, and you understand, monseigneur, that I
perfectly rely on your discretion."

"Oh, be easy."

"Do you still wish to see the note?"

"Certainly."

While engaged in this manner in conversation, they had
returned to the governor's apartments; Baisemeaux took from
the cupboard a private register, like the one he had already
shown Aramis, but fastened by a lock, the key which opened
it being one of a small bunch of keys which Baisemeaux
always carried with him. Then placing the book upon the
table, he opened it at the letter "M," and showed Aramis the
following note in the column of observations: "No books at
any time; all linen and clothes of the finest and best
quality to be procured; no exercise; always the same jailer;
no communications with any one. Musical instruments; every
liberty and every indulgence which his welfare may require,
to be boarded at fifteen francs. M. de Baisemeaux can claim
more if the fifteen francs be not sufficient."

"Ah," said Baisemeaux, "now I think of it, I shall claim
it."

Aramis shut the book. "Yes," he said, "it is indeed M. de
Mazarin's handwriting; I recognize it well. Now, my dear
governor," he continued, as if this last communication had
exhausted his interest, "let us now turn to our own little
affairs."

"Well, what time for repayment do you wish me to take? Fix
it yourself."

"There need not be any particular period fixed; give me a
simple acknowledgment for one hundred and fifty thousand
francs."

"When to be made payable?"

"When I require it; but, you understand, I shall only wish
it when you yourself do."

"Oh, I am quite easy on that score," said Baisemeaux,
smiling; "but I have already given you two receipts."

"Which I now destroy," said Aramis; and after having shown
the two receipts to Baisemeaux, he destroyed them. Overcome
by so great a mark of confidence, Baisemeaux unhesitatingly
wrote out an acknowledgment of a debt of one hundred and
fifty thousand francs, payable at the pleasure of the
prelate. Aramis, who had, by glancing over the governor's
shoulder, followed the pen as he wrote, put the
acknowledgment into his pocket without seeming to have read
it, which made Baisemeaux perfectly easy. "Now," said
Aramis, "you will not be angry with me if I were to carry
off one of your prisoners?"

"What do you mean?"

"By obtaining his pardon, of course. Have I not already told
you that I took a great interest in poor Seldon?"

"Yes, quite true, you did so."

"Well?"

"That is your affair; do as you think proper. I see you have
an open hand, and an arm that can reach a great way."

"Adieu, adieu." And Aramis left, carrying with him the
governor's best wishes.




CHAPTER 101

The Two Friends



At the very time M. de Baisemeaux was showing Aramis the
prisoners in the Bastile, a carriage drew up at Madame de
Belliere's door, and, at that still early hour, a young
woman alighted, her head muffled in a silk hood. When the
servants announced Madame Vanel to Madame de Belliere, the
latter was engaged, or rather was absorbed, in reading, a
letter, which she hurriedly concealed. She had hardly
finished her morning toilette, her maid being still in the
next room. At the name ---at the footsteps of Marguerite
Vanel -- Madame de Belliere ran to meet her. She fancied she
could detect in her friend's eyes a brightness which was
neither that of health nor of pleasure. Marguerite embraced
her, pressed her hands, and hardly allowed her time to
speak. "Dearest," she said, "have you forgotten me? Have you
quite given yourself up to the pleasures of the court?"

"I have not even seen the marriage fetes."

"What are you doing with yourself, then?"

"I am getting ready to leave for Belliere."

"For Belliere?"

"Yes."

"You are becoming rustic in your tastes, then; I delight to
see you so disposed. But you are pale."

"No, I am perfectly well."

"So much the better; I was becoming uneasy about you. You do
not know what I have been told."

"People say so many things."

"Yes, but this is very singular."

"How well you know how to excite curiosity, Marguerite."

"Well, I was afraid of vexing you."

"Never; you have yourself always admired me for my evenness
of temper."

"Well, then, it is said that -- no, I shall never be able to
tell you."

"Do not let us talk about it, then," said Madame de
Belliere, who detected the ill-nature that was concealed by
all these prefaces, yet felt the most anxious curiosity on
the subject.

"Well, then, my dear marquise, it is said that, for some
time past, you no longer continue to regret Monsieur de
Belliere as you used to."

"It is an ill-natured report, Marguerite. I do regret and
shall always regret, my husband; but it is now two years
since he died. I am only twenty-eight years old, and my
grief at his loss ought not always to control every action
and thought of my life. You, Marguerite, who are the model
of a wife, would not believe me if I were to say so."

"Why not? Your heart is so soft and yielding." she said,
spitefully.

"Yours is so too, Marguerite, and yet I did not perceive
that you allowed yourself to be overcome by grief when your
heart was wounded." These words were in direct allusion to
Marguerite's rupture with the superintendent, and were also
a veiled but direct reproach made against her friend's
heart.

As if she only awaited this signal to discharge her shaft,
Marguerite exclaimed, "Well, Elise, it is said you are in
love." And she looked fixedly at Madame de Belliere, who
blushed against her will.

"Women never escape slander," replied the marquise, after a
moment's pause.

"No one slanders you, Elise."

"What! -- people say that I am in love, and yet they do not
slander me!"

"In the first place, if it be true, it is no slander, but
simply a scandal-loving report. In the next place -- for you
did not allow me to finish what I was saying -- the public
does not assert that you have abandoned yourself to this
passion. It represents you, on the contrary, as a virtuous
but loving woman, defending yourself with claws and teeth,
shutting yourself up in your own house as in a fortress; in
other respects, as impenetrable as that of Danae,
notwithstanding Danae's tower was made of brass."

"You are witty, Marguerite," said Madame de Belliere,
angrily.

"You always flatter me, Elise. In short, however you are
reported to be incorruptible and unapproachable. You cannot
decide whether the world is calumniating you or not; but
what is it you are musing about while I am speaking to you?"

"I?"

"Yes; you are blushing and do not answer me."

"I was trying," said the marquise, raising her beautiful
eyes brightened with an indication of growing temper, "I was
trying to discover to what you could possibly have alluded,
you who are so learned in mythological subjects in comparing
me to Danae."

"You were trying to guess that?" said Marguerite, laughing.

"Yes; do you not remember that at the convent, when we were
solving our problems in arithmetic -- ah! what I have to
tell you is learned also, but it is my turn -- do you not
remember, that if one of the terms were given, we were to
find out the other? Therefore do you guess now?"

"I cannot conjecture what you mean."

"And yet nothing is more simple. You pretend that I am in
love, do you not?"

"So it is said."

"Very well, it is not said, I suppose, that I am in love
with an abstraction. There must surely be a name mentioned
in this report."

"Certainly, a name is mentioned."

"Very well; it is not surprising, then, that I should try to
guess this name, since you do not tell it."

"My dear marquise, when I saw you blush, I did not think you
would have to spend much time in conjectures."

"It was the word Danae which you used that surprised me.
Danae means a shower of gold, does it not?"

"That is to say that the Jupiter of Danae changed himself
into a shower of gold for her."

"My lover, then, he whom you assign me ---- "

"I beg your pardon; I am your friend, and assign you no
one."

"That may be; but those who are ill disposed towards me."

"Do you wish to hear the name?"

"I have been waiting this half hour for it."

"Well, then, you shall hear it. Do not be shocked; he is a
man high in power."

"Good," said the marquise, as she clenched her hands like a
patient at the approach of the knife.

"He is a very wealthy man," continued Marguerite; "the
wealthiest, it may be. In a word, it is ---- "

The marquise closed her eyes for a moment.

"It is the Duke of Buckingham," said Marguerite, bursting
into laughter. This perfidy had been calculated with extreme
ability; the name that was pronounced, instead of the name
which the marquise awaited, had precisely the same effect
upon her as the badly sharpened axes that had hacked,
without destroying, Messieurs de Chalais and De Thou upon
the scaffold. She recovered herself, however, and said, "I
was perfectly right in saying you were a witty woman, for
you are making the time pass away most agreeably. This joke
is a most amusing one, for I have never seen the Duke of
Buckingham."

"Never?" said Marguerite, restraining her laughter.

"I have never even left my own house since the duke has been
at Paris."

"Oh!" resumed Madame Vanel, stretching out her foot towards
a paper which was lying on the carpet near the window; "it
is not necessary for people to see each other, since they
can write." The marquise trembled, for this paper was the
envelope of the letter she was reading as her friend had
entered, and was sealed with the superintendent's arms. As
she leaned back on the sofa on which she was sitting, Madame
de Belliere covered the paper with the thick folds of her
large silk dress, and so concealed it.

"Come, Marguerite, tell me, is it to tell me all these
foolish reports that you have come to see me so early in the
day?"

"No, I came to see you, in the first place, and to remind
you of those habits of our earlier days, so delightful to
remember, when we used to wander about together at
Vincennes, and, sitting beneath an oak, or in some sylvan
shade, used to talk of those we loved, and who loved us."

"Do you propose that we should go out together now?"

"My carriage is here, and I have three hours at my
disposal."

"I am not dressed yet, Marguerite; but if you wish that we
should talk together, we can, without going to the woods of
Vincennes, find in my own garden here, beautiful trees,
shady groves, a greensward covered with daisies and violets,
the perfume of which can be perceived from where we are
sitting."

"I regret your refusal, my dear marquise, for I wanted to
pour out my whole heart into yours."

"I repeat again, Marguerite, my heart is yours just as much
in this room, or beneath the lime-trees in the garden here,
as it would be under the oaks in the wood yonder."

"It is not the same thing for me. In approaching Vincennes,
marquise, my ardent aspirations approach nearer to that
object towards which they have for some days past been
directed." The marquise suddenly raised her head. "Are you
surprised, then, that I am still thinking of Saint-Mande?"

"Of Saint-Mande?" exclaimed Madame de Belliere; and the
looks of both women met each other like two resistless
swords.

"You, so proud!" said the marquise, disdainfully.

"I, so proud!" replied Madame Vanel. "Such is my nature. I
do not forgive neglect -- I cannot endure infidelity. When I
leave any one who weeps at my abandonment, I feel induced
still to love him; but when others forsake me and laugh at
their infidelity, I love distractedly."

Madame de Belliere could not restrain an involuntary
movement.

"She is jealous," said Marguerite to herself.

"Then," continued the marquise, "you are quite enamored of
the Duke of Buckingham -- I mean of M. Fouquet?" Elise felt
the allusion, and her blood seemed to congeal in her heart.
"And you wished to go to Vincennes, -- to Saint-Mande,
even?"

"I hardly know what I wished: you would have advised me
perhaps."

"In what respect?"

"You have often done so."

"Most certainly I should not have done so in the present
instance, for I do not forgive as you do. I am less loving,
perhaps; when my heart has been once wounded, it remains so
always."

"But M. Fouquet has not wounded you," said Marguerite Vanel,
with the most perfect simplicity.

"You perfectly understand what I mean. M. Fouquet has not
wounded me; I do not know of either obligation or injury
received at his hands, but you have reason to complain of
him. You are my friend, and I am afraid I should not advise
you as you would like."

"Ah! you are prejudging the case."

"The sighs you spoke of just now are more than indications."

"You overwhelm me," said the young woman suddenly, as if
collecting her whole strength, like a wrestler preparing for
a last struggle; "you take only my evil dispositions and my
weaknesses into calculation, and do not speak of my pure and
generous feelings. If, at this moment, I feel instinctively
attracted towards the superintendent, if I even make an
advance to him, which, I confess, is very probable, my
motive for it is, that M. Fouquet's fate deeply affects me,
and because he is, in my opinion, one of the most
unfortunate men living."

"Ah!" said the marquise, placing her hand upon her heart,
"something new, then, has occurred?"

"Do you not know it?"

"I am utterly ignorant of everything about him," said Madame
de Belliere, with the poignant anguish that suspends thought
and speech, and even life itself.

"In the first place, then, the king's favor is entirely
withdrawn from M. Fouquet, and conferred on M. Colbert."

"So it is stated."

"It is very clear, since the discovery of the plot of
Belle-Isle."

"I was told that the discovery of the fortifications there
had turned out to M. Fouquet's honor."

Marguerite began to laugh in so cruel a manner that Madame
de Belliere could at that moment have delightedly plunged a
dagger in her bosom. "Dearest," continued Marguerite, "there
is no longer any question of M. Fouquet's honor; his safety
is concerned. Before three days are passed the ruin of the
superintendent will be complete."

"Stay," said the marquise, in her turn smiling, "that is
going a little too fast."

"I said three days, because I wish to deceive myself with a
hope; but probably the catastrophe will be complete within
twenty-four hours."

"Why so?"

"For the simplest of all reasons, -- that M. Fouquet has no
more money."

"In matters of finance, my dear Marguerite, some are without
money to-day, who to-morrow can procure millions."

"That might be M. Fouquet's case when he had two wealthy and
clever friends who amassed money for him, and wrung it from
every possible or impossible source; but those friends are
dead."

"Money does not die, Marguerite; it may be concealed, but it
can be looked for, bought and found."

"You see things on the bright side, and so much the better
for you. It is really very unfortunate that you are not the
Egeria of M. Fouquet; you might now show him the source
whence he could obtain the millions which the king asked him
for yesterday."

"Millions!" said the marquise, in terror.

"Four -- an even number."

"Infamous!" murmured Madame de Belliere, tortured by her
friend's merciless delight.

"M. Fouquet, I should think, must certainly have four
millions," she replied, courageously.

"If he has those which the king requires to-day," said
Marguerite, "he will not, perhaps, possess those which the
king will demand in a month or so."

"The king will exact money from him again, then?"

"No doubt; and that is my reason for saying that the ruin of
poor M. Fouquet is inevitable. Pride will induce him to
furnish the money, and when he has no more, he will fall."

"It is true," said the marquise, trembling; "the plan is a
bold one; but tell me, does M. Colbert hate M. Fouquet so
very much?"

"I think he does not like him. M. Colbert is powerful; he
improves on close acquaintance, he has gigantic ideas, a
strong will, and discretion, he will rise."

"He will be superintendent?"

"It is probable. Such is the reason, my dear marquise, why I
felt myself impressed in favor of that poor man, who once
loved, and even adored me; and why, when I see him so
unfortunate, I forgive his infidelity which I have reason to
believe he also regrets; and why, moreover, I should not
have been disinclined to afford him some consolation, or
some good advice; he would have understood the step I had
taken, and would have thought kindly of me for it. It is
gratifying to be loved, you know. Men value love more highly
when they are no longer blinded by its influence."

The marquise, bewildered and overcome by these cruel
attacks, which had been calculated with the greatest nicety
and precision, hardly knew what answer to return; she even
seemed to have lost all power of thought. Her perfidious
friend's voice had assumed the most affectionate tone; she
spoke as a woman, but concealed the instincts of a wolf.

"Well," said Madame de Belliere, who had a vague hope that
Marguerite would cease to overwhelm a vanquished enemy, "why
do you not go and see M. Fouquet?"

"Decidedly, marquise, you have made me reflect. No, it would
be unbecoming for me to make the first advance. M. Fouquet
no doubt loves me, but he is too proud. I cannot expose
myself to an affront.... besides I have my husband to
consider. You tell me nothing? Very well, I shall consult M.
Colbert on the subject." Marguerite rose smilingly, as
though to take leave, but the marquise had not the strength
to imitate her. Marguerite advanced a few paces, in order
that she might continue to enjoy the humiliating grief in
which her rival was plunged, and then said, suddenly, --
"You do not accompany me to the door, then?" The marquise
rose, pale and almost lifeless, without thinking of the
envelope, which had occupied her attention so greatly at the
commencement of the conversation, and which was revealed at
the first step she took. She then opened the door of her
oratory, and without even turning her head towards
Marguerite Vanel, entered it, closing the door after her.
Marguerite said, or rather muttered a few words, which
Madame de Belliere did not even hear. As soon, however, as
the marquise had disappeared, her envious enemy, not being
able to resist the desire to satisfy herself that her
suspicions were well founded, advanced stealthily towards it
like a panther and seized the envelope. "Ah!" she said,
gnashing her teeth, "it was indeed a letter from M. Fouquet
she was reading when I arrived," and then darted out of the
room. During this interval, the marquise, having arrived
behind the rampart, as it were, of her door, felt that her
strength was failing her; for a moment she remained rigid,
pale and motionless as a statue, and then, like a statue
shaken on its base by an earthquake, tottered and fell
inanimate on the carpet. The noise of the fall resounded at
the same moment as the rolling of Marguerite's carriage
leaving the hotel.




CHAPTER 102

Madame de Belliere's Plate



The blow had been the more painful on account of its being
unexpected. It was some time before the marquise recovered
herself; but once recovered, she began to reflect upon the
events so heartlessly announced to her. She therefore
returned, at the risk even of losing her life in the way, to
that train of ideas which her relentless friend had forced
her to pursue. Treason, then -- deep menaces, concealed
under the semblance of public interest -- such were
Colbert's maneuvers. A detestable delight at an approaching
downfall, untiring efforts to attain this object, means of
seduction no less wicked than the crime itself -- such were
the weapons Marguerite employed. The crooked atoms of
Descartes triumphed; to the man without compassion was
united a woman without heart. The marquise perceived, with
sorrow rather than indignation, that the king was an
accomplice in the plot which betrayed the duplicity of Louis
XIII. in his advanced age, and the avarice of Mazarin at a
period of life when he had not had the opportunity of
gorging himself with French gold. The spirit of thus
courageous woman soon resumed its energy, no longer
overwhelmed by indulgence in compassionate lamentations. The
marquise was not one to weep when action was necessary, nor
to waste time in bewailing a misfortune as long as means
still existed of relieving it. For some minutes she buried
her face in her cold fingers, and then, raising her head,
rang for her attendants with a steady hand, and with a
gesture betraying a fixed determination of purpose. Her
resolution was taken.

"Is everything prepared for my departure?" she inquired of
one of her female attendants who entered.

"Yes, madame; but it was not expected that your ladyship
would leave for Belliere for the next few days."

"All my jewels and articles of value, then, are packed up?"

"Yes, madame; but hitherto we have been in the habit of
leaving them in Paris. Your ladyship does not generally take
your jewels with you into the country."

"But they are all in order, you say?"

"Yes, in your ladyship's own room."

"The gold plate?"

"In the chest."

"And the silver plate?"

"In the great oak closet."

The marquise remained silent for a few moments, and then
said calmly, "Let my goldsmith be sent for."

Her attendants quitted the room to execute the order. The
marquise, however, had entered her own room, and was
inspecting her casket of jewels with the greatest attention.
Never, until now, had she bestowed such close attention upon
riches in which women take so much pride; never, until now,
had she looked at her jewels except for the purpose of
making a selection, according to their settings or their
colors. On this occasion, however, she admired the size of
the rubies and the brilliancy of the diamonds; she grieved
over every blemish and every defect; she thought the gold
light, and the stones wretched. The goldsmith, as he
entered, found her thus occupied. "M. Faucheux " she said,
"I believe you supplied me with my gold service?"

"I did, your ladyship."

"I do not now remember the amount of the account."

"Of the new service, madame, or of that which M. de Belliere
presented to you on your marriage? for I have furnished
both."

"First of all, the new one."

"The covers, the goblets, and the dishes, with their covers,
the eau-epergne, the ice-pails, the dishes for the
preserves, and the tea and coffee urns, cost your ladyship
sixty thousand francs."

"No more?"

"Your ladyship thought the account very high."

"Yes, yes; I remember, in fact, that it was dear; but it was
the workmanship, I suppose?"

"Yes, madame; the designs, the chasings -- all new
patterns."

"What proportion of the cost does the workmanship form? Do
not hesitate to tell me."

"A third of its value, madame."

"There is the other service, the old one, that which
belonged to my husband?"

"Yes, madame; there is less workmanship in that than in the
other. Its intrinsic value does not exceed thirty thousand
francs."

"Thirty thousand," murmured the marquise. "But, M. Faucheux,
there is also the service which belonged to my mother; all
that massive plate which I did not wish to part with, on
account of the associations connected with it."

"Ah! madame, that would indeed be an excellent resource for
those who, unlike your ladyship, might not be in a position
to keep their plate. In chasing that they worked in solid
metal. But that service is no longer in fashion. Its weight
is its only advantage."

"That is all I care about. How much does it weigh?"

"Fifty thousand livres at the very least. I do not allude to
the enormous vases for the buffet, which alone weigh five
thousand livres, or ten thousand the pair."

"One hundred and thirty," murmured the marquise. "You are
quite sure of your figures, M. Faucheux?"

"Positive, madame. Besides, there is no difficulty in
weighing them."

"The amount is entered in my books."

"Your ladyship is extremely methodical, I am aware."

"Let us now turn to another subject," said Madame de,
Belliere; and she opened one of her jewel-boxes.

"I recognize these emeralds," said M. Faucheux; "for it was
I who had the setting of them. They are the most beautiful
in the whole court. No, I am mistaken; Madame de Chatillon
has the most beautiful set; she had them from Messieurs de
Guise; but your set madame, comes next."

"What are they worth?"

"Mounted?"

"No; supposing I wished to sell them."

"I know very well who would buy them," exclaimed M.
Faucheux.

"That is the very thing I ask. They could be sold, then?"

"All your jewels could be sold, madame. It is well known
that you possess the most beautiful jewels in Paris. You are
not changeable in your tastes; when you make a purchase it
is of the very best; and what you purchase you do not part
with."

"What could these emeralds be sold for, then?"

"A hundred and thirty thousand francs."

The marquise wrote down upon her tablets the amount which
the jeweler mentioned. "The ruby necklace?" she said.

"Are they balas-rubies, madame?"

"Here they are."

"They are beautiful -- magnificent. I did not know that your
ladyship had these stones."

"What is their value?"

"Two hundred thousand francs. The center one is alone worth
a hundred thousand."

"I thought so," said the marquise. "As for diamonds, I have
them in numbers; rings, necklaces, sprigs, earrings, clasps.
Tell me their value, M. Faucheux."

The jeweler took his magnifying-glass and scales, weighed
and inspected them, and silently made his calculations.
"These stones," he said, "must have cost your ladyship an
income of forty thousand francs."

"You value them at eight hundred thousand francs?"

"Nearly so."

"It is about what I imagined ---but the settings are not
included?"

"No, madame; but if I were called upon to sell or to buy, I
should be satisfied with the gold of the settings alone as
my profit upon the transaction. I should make a good
twenty-five thousand francs."

"An agreeable sum."

"Very much so, madame."

"Will you accept that profit, then, on condition of
converting the jewels into money?"

"But you do not intend to sell your diamonds, I suppose,
madame?" exclaimed the bewildered jeweler.

"Silence, M. Faucheux, do not disturb yourself about that;
give me an answer simply. You are an honorable man, with
whom my family has dealt for thirty years; you knew my
father and mother, whom your own father and mother served. I
address you as a friend; will you accept the gold of the
settings in return for a sum of ready money to be placed in
my hands?"

"Eight hundred thousand francs! it is enormous."

"I know it."

"Impossible to find."

"Not so."

"But reflect, madame, upon the effect which will be produced
by the sale of your jewels."

"No one need know it. You can get sets of false jewels made
for me, similar to the real. Do not answer a word; I insist
upon it. Sell them separately, sell the stones only."

"In that way it is easy. Monsieur is looking out for some
sets of jewels as well as single stones for Madame's
toilette. There will be a competition for them. I can easily
dispose of six hundred thousand francs' worth to Monsieur. I
am certain yours are the most beautiful."

"When can you do so?"

"In less than three days' time."

"Very well, the remainder you will dispose of among private
individuals. For the present, make me out a contract of
sale, payment to be made in four days."

"I entreat you to reflect, madame; for if you force the
sale, you will lose a hundred thousand francs."

"If necessary, I will lose two hundred; I wish everything to
be settled this evening. Do you accept?"

"I do, your ladyship. I will not conceal from you that I
shall make fifty thousand francs by the transaction."

"So much the better for you. In what way shall I have the
money?"

"Either in gold, or in bills of the bank of Lyons, payable
at M. Colbert's."

"I agree," said the marquise, eagerly; "return home and
bring the sum in question in notes, as soon as possible."

"Yes, madame, but for Heaven's sake ---- "

"Not a word, M. Faucheux. By the by, I was forgetting the
silver plate. What is the value of that which I have?"

"Fifty thousand francs, madame."

"That makes a million," said the marquise to herself. "M.
Faucheux, you will take away with you both the gold and
silver plate. I can assign, as a pretext, that I wish it
remodelled on patterns more in accordance with my own taste.
Melt it down, and return me its value in money, at once."

"It shall be done, your ladyship."

"You will be good enough to place the money in a chest, and
direct one of your clerks to accompany the chest, and
without my servants seeing him; and order him to wait for me
in a carriage."

"In Madame de Faucheux's carriage?" said the jeweler.

"If you will allow it, and I will call for it at your
house."

"Certainly, your ladyship."

"I will direct some of my servants to convey the plate to
your house." The marquise rung. "Let the small van be placed
at M. Faucheux's disposal," she said. The jeweler bowed and
left the house, directing that the van should follow him
closely, saying aloud that the marquise was about to have
her plate melted down in order to have other plate
manufactured of a more modern style. Three hours afterwards
she went to M. Faucheux's house and received from him eight
hundred thousand francs in gold inclosed in a chest, which
one of the clerks could hardly carry towards Madame
Faucheux's carriage -- for Madame Faucheux kept her
carriage. As the daughter of a president of accounts, she
had brought a marriage portion of thirty thousand crowns to
her husband, who was syndic of the goldsmiths. These thirty
thousand crowns had become very fruitful during twenty
years. The jeweler, though a millionaire, was a modest man.
He had purchased a substantial carriage, built in 1648, ten
years after the king's birth. This carriage, or rather house
upon wheels, excited the admiration of the whole quarter in
which he resided -- it was covered with allegorical
paintings, and clouds scattered over with stars. The
marquise entered this somewhat extraordinary vehicle,
sitting opposite the clerk, who endeavored to put his knees
out of the way, afraid even of touching the marquise's
dress. It was the clerk, too, who told the coachman, who was
very proud of having a marquise to drive, to take the road
to Saint-Mande.




CHAPTER 103

The Dowry



Monsieur Faucheux's horses were serviceable animals, with
thickset knees, and legs that had some difficulty in moving.
Like the carriage, they belonged to the earlier part of the
century. They were not as fleet as the English horses of M.
Fouquet, and consequently took two hours to get to
Saint-Mande. Their progress, it might be said, was majestic.
Majesty, however, precludes hurry. The marquise stopped the
carriage at the door so well known to her, although she had
seen it only once, under circumstances, it will be
remembered, no less painful than those which brought her now
to it again. She drew a key from her pocket, and inserted it
in the lock, pushed open the door, which noiselessly yielded
to her touch, and directed the clerk to carry the chest
upstairs to the first floor. The weight of the chest was so
great that the clerk was obliged to get the coachman to
assist him with it. They placed it in a small cabinet,
anteroom, or boudoir rather, adjoining the saloon where we
once saw M. Fouquet at the marquise's feet. Madame de
Belliere gave the coachman a louis, smiled gracefully at the
clerk, and dismissed them both. She closed the door after
them, and waited in the room, alone and barricaded. There
was no servant to be seen about the rooms, but everything
was prepared as though some invisible genius had divined the
wishes and desires of an expected guest. The fire was laid,
candles in the candelabra, refreshments upon the table,
books scattered about, fresh-cut flowers in the vases. One
might almost have imagined it an enchanted house. The
marquise lighted the candles, inhaled the perfume of the
flowers, sat down, and was soon plunged in profound thought.
Her deep musings, melancholy though they were, were not
untinged with a certain vague joy. Spread out before her was
a treasure, a million wrung from her fortune as a gleaner
plucks the blue corn-flower from her crown of flowers. She
conjured up the sweetest dreams. Her principal thought, and
one that took precedence of all others, was to devise means
of leaving this money for M. Fouquet without his possibly
learning from whom the gift had come. This idea, naturally
enough, was the first to present itself to her mind. But
although, on reflection, it appeared difficult to carry out,
she did not despair of success. She would then ring to
summon M. Fouquet and make her escape, happier than if,
instead of having given a million, she had herself found
one. But, being there, and having seen the boudoir so
coquettishly decorated that it might almost be said the
least particle of dust had but the moment before been
removed by the servants; having observed the drawing-room,
so perfectly arranged that it might almost be said her
presence there had driven away the fairies who were its
occupants, she asked herself if the glance or gaze of those
whom she had displaced -- whether spirits, fairies, elves,
or human creatures -- had not already recognized her. To
secure success, it was necessary that some steps should be
seriously taken, and it was necessary also that the
superintendent should comprehend the serious position in
which he was placed, in order to yield compliance with the
generous fancies of a woman; all the fascinations of an
eloquent friendship would be required to persuade him, and,
should this be insufficient, the maddening influence of a
devoted passion, which, in its resolute determination to
carry conviction, would not be turned aside. Was not the
superintendent, indeed, known for his delicacy and dignity
of feeling? Would he allow himself to accept from any woman
that of which she had stripped herself? No! He would resist,
and if any voice in the world could overcome his resistance,
it would be the voice of the woman he loved.

Another doubt, and that a cruel one, suggested itself to
Madame de Belliere with a sharp, acute pain, like a dagger
thrust. Did he really love her? Would that volatile mind,
that inconstant heart, be likely to be fixed for a moment,
even were it to gaze upon an angel? Was it not the same with
Fouquet, notwithstanding his genius and his uprightness of
conduct, as with those conquerors on the field of battle who
shed tears when they have gained a victory?" I must learn if
it be so, and must judge of that for myself," said the
marquise. "Who can tell whether that heart, so coveted, is
not common in its impulses, and full of alloy? Who can tell
if that mind, when the touchstone is applied to it, will not
be found of a mean and vulgar character? Come, come," she
said, "this is doubting and hesitating too much -- to the
proof." She looked at the timepiece. "It is now seven
o'clock," she said; "he must have arrived, it is the hour
for signing his papers." With a feverish impatience she rose
and walked towards the mirror, in which she smiled with a
resolute smile of devotedness; she touched the spring and
drew out the handle of the bell. Then, as if exhausted
beforehand by the struggle she had just undergone, she threw
herself on her knees, in utter abandonment, before a large
couch, in which she buried her face in her trembling hands.
Ten minutes afterwards she heard the spring of the door
sound. The door moved upon invisible hinges, and Fouquet
appeared. He looked pale, and seemed bowed down by the
weight of some bitter reflection. He did not hurry, but
simply came at the summons. The pre-occupation of his mind
must indeed have been very great, that a man so devoted to
pleasure, for whom indeed pleasure meant everything, should
obey such a summons so listlessly. The previous night, in
fact, fertile in melancholy ideas, had sharpened his
features, generally so noble in their indifference of
expression, and had traced dark lines of anxiety around his
eyes. Handsome and noble he still was, and the melancholy
expression of his mouth, a rare expression with men, gave a
new character to his features, by which his youth seemed to
be renewed. Dressed in black, the lace in front of his chest
much disarranged by his feverishly restless hand, the looks
of the superintendent, full of dreamy reflection, were fixed
upon the threshold of the room which he had so frequently
approached in search of expected happiness. This gloomy
gentleness of manner, this smiling sadness of expression,
which had replaced his former excessive joy, produced an
indescribable effect upon Madame de Belliere, who was
regarding him at a distance.

A woman's eye can read the face of the man she loves, its
every feeling of pride, its every expression of suffering;
it might almost be said that Heaven has graciously granted
to women, on account of their very weakness, more than it
has accorded to other creatures. They can conceal their own
feelings from a man, but from them no man can conceal his.
The marquise divined in a single glance the whole weight of
the unhappiness of the superintendent. She divined a night
passed without sleep, a day passed in deceptions. From that
moment she was firm in her own strength, and she felt that
she loved Fouquet beyond everything else. She arose and
approached him, saying, "You wrote to me this morning to say
you were beginning to forget me, and that I, whom you had
not seen lately, had no doubt ceased to think of you. I have
come to undeceive you, monsieur, and the more completely so,
because there is one thing I can read in your eyes."

"What is that, madame?" said Fouquet, astonished.

"That you have never loved me so much as at this moment; in
the same manner you can read, in my present step towards
you, that I have not forgotten you."

"Oh! madame," said Fouquet, whose face was for a moment
lighted up by a sudden gleam of joy, "you are indeed an
angel, and no man can suspect you. All he can do is to
humble himself before you and entreat forgiveness."

"Your forgiveness is granted, then," said the marquise.
Fouquet was about to throw himself upon his knees. "No, no,"
she said, "sit here by my side. Ah! that is an evil thought
which has just crossed your mind."

"How do you detect it, madame?"

"By the smile that has just marred the expression of your
countenance, Be candid, and tell me what your thought was --
no secrets between friends."

"Tell me, then, madame, why have you been so harsh these
three or four months past?"

"Harsh?"

"Yes; did you not forbid me to visit you?"

"Alas!" said Madame de Belliere, sighing, "because your
visit to me was the cause of your being visited with a great
misfortune; because my house is watched; because the same
eyes that have seen you already might see you again; because
I think it less dangerous for you that I should come here
than that you should come to my house; and, lastly, because
I know you to be already unhappy enough not to wish to
increase your unhappiness further."

Fouquet started, for these words recalled all the anxieties
connected with his office of superintendent -- he who, for
the last few minutes, had indulged in all the wild
aspirations of the lover. "I unhappy?" he said, endeavoring
to smile: "indeed, marquise, you will almost make me believe
I am so, judging from your own sadness. Are your beautiful
eyes raised upon me merely in pity? I was looking for
another expression from them."

"It is not I who am sad, monsieur; look in the mirror, there
-- it is yourself."

"It is true I am somewhat pale, marquise; but it is from
overwork; the king yesterday required a supply of money from
me."

"Yes, four millions, I am aware of it."

"You know it?" exclaimed Fouquet, in a tone of surprise;
"how can you have learnt it? It was after the departure of
the queen, and in the presence of one person only, that the
king ---- "

"You perceive that I do know it; is not that sufficient?
Well, go on, monsieur, the money the king has required you
to supply ---- "

"You understand, marquise, that I have been obliged to
procure it, then to get it counted, afterwards registered --
altogether a long affair. Since Monsieur de Mazarin's death,
financial affairs occasion some little fatigue and
embarrassment. My administration is somewhat overtaxed, and
this is the reason why I have not slept during the past
night."

"So that you have the amount?" inquired the marquise, with
some anxiety.

"It would indeed be strange, marquise," replied Fouquet,
cheerfully, "if a superintendent of finances were not to
have a paltry four millions in his coffers."

"Yes, yes, I believe you either have, or will have them."

"What do you mean by saying I shall have them?"

"It is not very long since you were required to furnish two
millions."

"On the contrary, to me it seems almost an age; but do not
let us talk of money matters any longer."

"On the contrary, we will continue to speak of them, for
that is my only reason for coming to see you."

"I am at a loss to compass your meaning," said the
superintendent, whose eyes began to express an anxious
curiosity.

"Tell me, monsieur, is the office of superintendent a
permanent position?"

"You surprise me, marchioness, for you speak as if you had
some motive or interest in putting the question."

"My reason is simple enough; I am desirous of placing some
money in your hands, and naturally I wish to know if you are
certain of your post."

"Really, marquise, I am at a loss what to reply; I cannot
conceive your meaning."

"Seriously, then, dear M. Fouquet, funds which somewhat
embarrass me. I am tired of investing my money in land, and
am anxious to intrust it to some friend who will turn it to
account."

"Surely it does not press," said M. Fouquet.

"On the contrary, it is very pressing."

"Very well, we will talk of that by and by."

"By and by will not do, for my money is there," returned the
marquise, pointing out the coffer to the superintendent, and
showing him, as she opened it, the bundles of notes and
heaps of gold. Fouquet, who had risen from his seat at the
same moment as Madame de Belliere, remained for a moment
plunged in thought; then suddenly starting back, he turned
pale, and sank down in his chair, concealing his face in his
hands. "Madame, madame," he murmured, "what opinion can you
have of me, when you make me such an offer?"

"Of you!" returned the marquise. "Tell me, rather, what you
yourself think of the step I have taken."

"You bring me this money for myself, and you bring it
because you know me to be embarrassed. Nay, do not deny it,
for I am sure of it. Can I not read your heart?"

"If you know my heart, then, can you not see that it is my
heart I offer you?"

"I have guessed rightly, then," exclaimed Fouquet. "In
truth, madame, I have never yet given you the right to
insult me in this manner."

"Insult you," she said, turning pale, "what singular
delicacy of feeling! You tell me you love me; in the name of
that affection you wish me to sacrifice my reputation and my
honor, yet, when I offer you money which is my own, you
refuse me."

"Madame, you are at liberty to preserve what you term your
reputation and your honor. Permit me to preserve mine. Leave
me to my ruin, leave me to sink beneath the weight of the
hatreds which surround me, beneath the faults I have
committed, beneath the load even, of my remorse, but, for
Heaven's sake, madame, do not overwhelm me with this last
infliction."

"A short time since, M. Fouquet, you were wanting in
judgment; now you are wanting in feeling."

Fouquet pressed his clenched hand upon his breast, heaving
with emotion, saying: "Overwhelm me, madame for I have
nothing to reply."

"I offered you my friendship, M. Fouquet."

"Yes, madame, and you limited yourself to that."

"And what I am now doing is the act of a friend."

"No doubt it is."

"And you reject this mark of my friendship?"

"I do reject it."

"Monsieur Fouquet, look at me," said the marquise, with
glistening eyes, "I now offer you my love."

"Oh, madame," exclaimed Fouquet.

"I have loved you for a long while past; women, like men,
have a false delicacy at times. For a long time past I have
loved you, but would not confess it. Well, then, you have
implored this love on your knees, and I have refused you; I
was blind, as you were a little while since; but as it was
my love that you sought, it is my love I now offer you."

"Oh! madame, you overwhelm me beneath a load of happiness."

"Will you be happy, then, if I am yours -- entirely?"

"It will be the supremest happiness for me."

"Take me, then. If, however, for your sake I sacrifice a
prejudice, do you, for mine, sacrifice a scruple."

"Do not tempt me."

"Do not refuse me."

"Think seriously of what you are proposing."

"Fouquet, but one word. Let it be `No,' and I open this
door," and she pointed to the door which led into the
streets, "and you will never see me again. Let that word be
`Yes,' and I am yours entirely."

"Elsie! Elsie! But this coffer?"

"Contains my dowry."

"It is your ruin," exclaimed Fouquet, turning over the gold
and papers; "there must be a million here."

"Yes, my jewels, for which I care no longer if you do not
love me, and for which, equally, I care no longer if you
love me as I love you."

"This is too much," exclaimed Fouquet. "I yield, I yield,
even were it only to consecrate so much devotion. I accept
the dowry."

"And take the woman with it." said the: marquise, throwing
herself into his arms.




CHAPTER 104

Le Terrain de Dieu



During the progress of these events Buckingham and De Wardes
traveled in excellent companionship, and made the journey
from Paris to Calais in undisturbed harmony together.
Buckingham had hurried his departure, so that the greater
part of his adieux were very hastily made. His visit to
Monsieur and Madame, to the young queen, and to the
queen-dowager, had been paid collectively -- a precaution on
the part of the queen-mother which saved him the distress of
any private conversation with Monsieur, and also the danger
of seeing Madame again. The carriages containing the luggage
had already been sent on beforehand, and in the evening he
set off in his traveling carriage with his attendants.

De Wardes, irritated at finding himself dragged away in so
abrupt a manner by this Englishman, had sought in his subtle
mind for some means of escaping from his fetters; but no one
having rendered him any assistance in this respect, he was
absolutely obliged, therefore, to submit to the burden of
his own evil thoughts and caustic spirit.

Such of his friends in whom he had been able to confide,
had, in their character of wits, rallied him upon the duke's
superiority. Others, less brilliant, but more sensible, had
reminded him of the king's orders prohibiting dueling.
Others, again, and they the larger number, who, in virtue of
charity, or national vanity, might have rendered him
assistance, did not care to run the risk of incurring
disgrace, and would, at the best, have informed the
ministers of a departure which might end in a massacre on a
small scale. The result was, that, after having fully
deliberated upon the matter, De Wardes packed up his
luggage, took a couple of horses, and, followed only by one
servant, made his way towards the barrier, where
Buckingham's carriage was to await him.

The duke received his adversary as he would have done an
intimate acquaintance, made room beside him on the same seat
with himself, offered him refreshments, and spread over his
knees the sable cloak that had been thrown on the front
seat. They then conversed of the court, without alluding to
Madame; of Monsieur, without speaking of domestic affairs;
of the king, without speaking of his brother's wife; of the
queen-mother, without alluding to her daughter-in-law; of
the king of England, without alluding to his sister-in-law;
of the state of the affections of either of the travelers,
without pronouncing any name that might be dangerous. In
this way the journey, which was performed by short stages,
was most agreeable, and Buckingham, almost a Frenchman from
wit and education, was delighted at having so admirably
selected his traveling companion. Elegant repasts were
served, of which they partook but lightly; trials of horses
made in the beautiful meadows that skirted the road;
coursing indulged in, for Buckingham had his greyhounds with
him; and in such ways did they pass away the pleasant time.
The duke somewhat resembled the beautiful river Seine, which
folds France a thousand times in its loving embrace, before
deciding upon joining its waters with the ocean. In quitting
France, it was her recently adopted daughter he had brought
to Paris whom he chiefly regretted; his every thought was a
remembrance of her -- his every memory a regret. Therefore,
whenever, now and then, despite his command over himself, he
was lost in thought, De Wardes left him entirely to his
musings. This delicacy might have touched Buckingham, and
changed his feelings towards De Wardes, if the latter, while
preserving silence, had shown a glance less full of malice,
and a smile less false. Instinctive dislikes, however, are
relentless; nothing appeases them; a few ashes may
sometimes, apparently, extinguish them; but beneath those
ashes the smothered embers rage more furiously. Having
exhausted every means of amusement the route offered, they
arrived, as we have said, at Calais towards the end of the
sixth day. The duke's attendants, since the previous
evening, had traveled in advance, and now chartered a boat,
for the purpose of joining the yacht, which had been tacking
about in sight, or bore broadside on, whenever it felt its
white wings wearied, within cannon-shot of the jetty.

The boat was destined for the transport of the duke's
equipages from the shore to the yacht. The horses had been
embarked, having been hoisted from the boat upon the deck in
baskets expressly made for the purpose, and wadded in such a
manner that their limbs, even in the most violent fits of
terror or impatience, were always protected by the soft
support which the sides afforded, and their coats not even
turned. Eight of these baskets, placed side by side, filled
the ship's hold. It is well known that in short voyages
horses refuse to eat, but remain trembling all the while,
with the best of food before them, such as they would have
greatly coveted on land. By degrees, the duke's entire
equipage was transported on board the yacht; he was then
informed that everything was in readiness, and that they
only waited for him, whenever he would be disposed to embark
with the French gentleman; for no one could possibly imagine
that the French gentleman would have any other accounts to
settle with his Grace than those of friendship. Buckingham
desired the captain to be told to hold himself in readiness,
but that, as the sea was beautiful, and as the day promised
a splendid sunset, he did not intend to go on board until
nightfall, and would avail himself of the evening to enjoy a
walk on the strand. He added also, that, finding himself in
such excellent company, he had not the least desire to
hasten his embarkation.

As he said this he pointed out to those who surrounded him
the magnificent spectacle which the sky presented, of
deepest azure in the horizon, the amphitheatre of fleecy
clouds ascending from the sun's disc to the zenith, assuming
the appearance of a range of snowy mountains, whose summits
were heaped one upon another. The dome of clouds was tinged
at its base with, as it were, the foam of rubies, fading
away into opal and pearly tints, in proportion as the gaze
was carried from base to summit. The sea was gilded with the
same reflection, and upon the crest of every sparkling wave
danced a point of light, like a diamond by lamplight. The
mildness of the evening, the sea breezes, so dear to
contemplative minds, setting in from the east and blowing in
delicious gusts; then, in the distance, the black outline of
the yacht with its rigging traced upon the empurpled
background of the sky -- while, dotting the horizon, might
be seen, here and there, vessels with their trimmed sails,
like the wings of a seagull about to plunge; such a
spectacle indeed well merited admiration. A crowd of curious
idlers followed the richly dressed attendants, amongst whom
they mistook the steward and the secretary for the master
and his friend. As for Buckingham, who was dressed very
simply, in a gray satin vest, and doublet of violet-colored
velvet, wearing his hat thrust over his eyes, and without
orders or embroidery, he was taken no more notice of than De
Wardes, who was in black, like an attorney.

The duke's attendants had received directions to have a boat
in readiness at the jetty head, and to watch the embarkation
of their master, without approaching him until either he or
his friend should summon them, -- "whatever may happen," he
had added, laying a stress upon these words, so that they
might not be misunderstood. Having walked a few paces upon
the strand, Buckingham said to De Wardes, "I think it is now
time to take leave of each other. The tide, you perceive, is
rising; ten minutes hence it will have soaked the sands
where we are now walking in such a manner that we shall not
be able to keep our footing."

"I await your orders, my lord, but ---- "

"But, you mean, we are still upon soil which is part of the
king's territory."

"Exactly."

"Well, do you see yonder a kind of little island surrounded
by a circle of water? The pool is increasing every minute,
and the isle is gradually disappearing. This island, indeed,
belongs to Heaven, for it is situated between two seas, and
is not shown on the king's charts. Do you observe it?"

"Yes; but we can hardly reach it now, without getting our
feet wet."

"Yes; but observe that it forms an eminence tolerably high,
and that the tide rises on every side, leaving the top free.
We shall be admirably placed upon that little theatre. What
do you think of it?"

"I shall be perfectly happy wherever I may have the honor of
crossing my sword with your lordship's."

"Very well, then, I am distressed to be the cause of your
wetting your feet, M. de Wardes, but it is most essential
you should be able to say to the king: `Sire, I did not
fight upon your majesty's territory.' Perhaps the
distinction is somewhat subtle, but, since Port-Royal, your
nation delights in subtleties of expression. Do not let us
complain of this, however, for it makes your wit very
brilliant, and of a style peculiarly your own. If you do not
object, we will hurry ourselves, for the sea, I perceive, is
rising fast, and night is setting in."

"My reason for not walking faster was, that I did not wish
to precede your Grace. Are you still on dry land, my lord?"

"Yes, at present I am. Look yonder! My servants are afraid
we shall be drowned, and have converted the boat into a
cruiser. Do you remark how curiously it dances upon the
crests of the waves? But, as it makes me feel sea-sick,
would you permit me to turn my back towards them?"

"You will observe, my lord, that in turning your back to
them, you will have the sun full in your face."

"Oh, its rays are very feeble at this hour and it will soon
disappear; do not be uneasy on that score."

"As you please, my lord; it was out of consideration for
your lordship that I made the remark."

"I am aware of that, M. de Wardes, and I fully appreciate
your kindness. Shall we take off our doublets?"

"As you please, my lord."

"Do not hesitate to tell me, M. de Wardes, if you do not
feel comfortable upon the wet sand, or if you think yourself
a little too close to the French territory. We could fight
in England, or even upon my yacht."

"We are exceedingly well placed here, my lord; only I have
the honor to remark that, as the sea is rising fast, we have
hardly time ---- "

Buckingham made a sign of assent, took off his doublet and
threw it on the ground, a proceeding which De Wardes
imitated. Both their bodies, which seemed like phantoms to
those who were looking at them from the shore, were thrown
strongly into relief by a dark red violet-colored shadow
with which the sky became overspread.

"Upon my word, your Grace," said De Wardes, "we shall hardly
have time to begin. Do you not perceive how our feet are
sinking into the sand?"

"I have sunk up to the ankles," said Buckingham, "without
reckoning that the water is even now breaking in upon us."

"It has already reached me. As soon as you please,
therefore, your Grace," said De Wardes, who drew his sword,
a movement imitated by the duke.

"M. de Wardes," said Buckingham, "one final word. I am about
to fight you because I do not like you, -- because you have
wounded me in ridiculing a certain devotional regard I have
entertained, and one which I acknowledge that, at this
moment, I still retain, and for which I would very willingly
die. You are a bad and heartless man, M. de Wardes, and I
will do my very utmost to take your life; for I feel assured
that, if you survive this engagement, you will, in the
future, work great mischief towards my friends. That is all
I have to remark, M. de Wardes," concluded Buckingham, as he
saluted him.

"And I, my lord, have only this to reply to you: I have not
disliked you hitherto, but, since you give me such a
character, I hate you, and will do all I possibly can to
kill you; "and De Wardes saluted Buckingham.

Their swords crossed at the same moment, like two flashes of
lightning on a dark night. The swords seemed to seek each
other, guessed their position, and met. Both were practiced
swordsmen, and the earlier passes were without any result.
The night was fast closing in, and it was so dark that they
attacked and defended themselves almost instinctively.
Suddenly De Wardes felt his sword arrested, -- he had just
touched Buckingham's shoulder. The duke's sword sunk as his
arm was lowered.

"You are wounded, my lord," said De Wardes, drawing back a
step or two.

"Yes, monsieur, but only slightly."

"Yet you quitted your guard."

"Only from the first effect of the cold steel, but I have
recovered. Let us go on, if you please." And disengaging his
sword with a sinister clashing of the blade, the duke
wounded the marquis in the breast.

"A hit?" he said.

"No," cried De Wardes, not moving from his place.

"I beg your pardon, but observing that your shirt was
stained ---- " said Buckingham.

"Well," said De Wardes furiously, "it is now your turn."

And with a terrible lunge, he pierced Buckingham's arm, the
sword passing between the two bones. Buckingham, feeling his
right arm paralyzed, stretched out his left, seized his
sword, which was about falling from his nerveless grasp, and
before De Wardes could resume his guard, he thrust him
through the breast. De Wardes tottered, his knees gave way
beneath him, and leaving his sword still fixed in the duke's
arm, he fell into the water, which was soon crimsoned with a
more genuine reflection than that which it had borrowed from
the clouds. De Wardes was not dead; he felt the terrible
danger that menaced him, for the sea rose fast. The duke,
too, perceived the danger. With an effort and an exclamation
of pain he tore out the blade which remained in his arm, and
turning towards De Wardes said, "Are you dead, marquis?"

"No," replied De Wardes, in a voice choked by the blood
which rushed from his lungs to his throat, "but very near
it."

"Well, what is to be done; can you walk?" said Buckingham,
supporting him on his knee.

"Impossible," he replied. Then falling down again, said,
"Call to your people, or I shall be drowned."

"Halloa! boat there! quick, quick!"

The boat flew over the waves, but the sea rose faster than
the boat could approach. Buckingham saw that De Wardes was
on the point of being again covered by a wave; he passed his
left arm, safe and unwounded, round his body and raised him
up. The wave ascended to his waist but did not move him. The
duke immediately began to carry his late antagonist towards
the shore. He had hardly gone ten paces, when a second wave,
rushing onwards higher, more furious and menacing than the
former, struck him at the height of his chest, threw him
over and buried him beneath the water. At the reflux,
however, the duke and De Wardes were discovered lying on the
strand. De Wardes had fainted. At this moment four of the
duke's sailors, who comprehended the danger, threw
themselves into the sea, and in a moment were close beside
him. Their terror was extreme when they observed how their
master became covered with blood, in proportion as the water
with which it was impregnated, flowed towards his knees and
feet; they wished to carry him.

"No, no," exclaimed the duke, "take the marquis on shore
first."

"Death to the Frenchman!" cried the English sullenly.

"Wretched knaves!" exclaimed the duke, drawing himself up
with a haughty gesture, which sprinkled them with blood,
"obey directly! M. de Wardes on shore! M. de Wardes's safety
to be looked to first, or I will have you all hanged!"

The boat had by this time reached them; the secretary and
steward leaped into the sea, and approached the marquis, who
no longer showed any sign of life.

"I commit him to your care, as you value your lives," said
the duke. "Take M. de Wardes on shore." They took him in
their arms, and carried him to the dry sand, where the tide
never rose so high. A few idlers and five or six fishermen
had gathered on the shore, attracted by the strange
spectacle of two men fighting with the water up to their
knees. The fishermen, observing a group of men approaching
carrying a wounded man, entered the sea until the water was
up to their waists. The English transferred the wounded man
to them, at the very moment the latter began to open his
eyes again. The salt water and the fine sand had got into
his wounds, and caused him the acutest pain. The duke's
secretary drew out a purse filled with gold from his pocket,
and handed it to the one among those present who appeared of
most importance, saying: "From my master, his Grace the Duke
of Buckingham, in order that every possible care may be
taken of the Marquis de Wardes."

Then, followed by those who had accompanied him, he returned
to the boat, which Buckingham had been enabled to reach with
the greatest difficulty, but only after he had seen De
Wardes out of danger. By this time it was high tide;
embroidered coats and silk sashes were lost; many hats, too,
had been carried away by the waves. The flow of the tide had
borne the duke's and De Wardes's clothes to the shore, and
De Wardes was wrapped in the duke's doublet, under the
belief that it was his own, when the fishermen carried him
in their arms towards the town.
