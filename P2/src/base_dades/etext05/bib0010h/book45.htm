<h1>Book 45 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romans</h1>

<p>45:001:001 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;separated unto the gospel of God,</p>

<p>45:001:002 (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scriptures,)</p>

<p>45:001:003 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the seed of David according to the flesh;</p>

<p>45:001:004 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</p>

<p>45:001:005 By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the faith among all nations, for his name:</p>

<p>45:001:006 Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</p>

<p>45:001:007 To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ.</p>

<p>45:001:008 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</p>

<p>45:001:009 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always in my prayers;</p>

<p>45:001:010 Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</p>

<p>45:001:011 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</p>

<p>45:001:012 That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mutual faith both of you and me.</p>

<p>45:001:013 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might have some fruit among you also, even as among other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentiles.</p>

<p>45:001:014 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wise, and to the unwise.</p>

<p>45:001:015 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you that are at Rome also.</p>

<p>45:001:016 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>

<p>45:001:017 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</p>

<p>45:001:018 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unrighteousness;</p>

<p>45:001:019 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for God hath shewed it unto them.</p>

<p>45:001:020 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without excuse:</p>

<p>45:001:021 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</p>

<p>45:001:022 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</p>

<p>45:001:023 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beasts, and creeping things.</p>

<p>45:001:024 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between themselves:</p>

<p>45:001:025 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ever. Amen.</p>

<p>45:001:026 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their women did change the natural use into that which is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against nature:</p>

<p>45:001:027 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that recompence of their error which was meet.</p>

<p>45:001:028 And even as they did not like to retain God in their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things which are not convenient;</p>

<p>45:001:029 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</p>

<p>45:001:030 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</p>

<p>45:001:031 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affection, implacable, unmerciful:</p>

<p>45:001:032 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pleasure in them that do them.</p>

<p>45:002:001 Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.</p>

<p>45:002:002 But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against them which commit such things.</p>

<p>45:002:003 And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judgment of God?</p>

<p>45:002:004 Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leadeth thee to repentance?</p>

<p>45:002:005 But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteous judgment of God;</p>

<p>45:002:006 Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</p>

<p>45:002:007 To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:</p>

<p>45:002:008 But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,</p>

<p>45:002:009 Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;</p>

<p>45:002:010 But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:</p>

<p>45:002:011 For there is no respect of persons with God.</p>

<p>45:002:012 For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judged by the law;</p>

<p>45:002:013 (For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doers of the law shall be justified.</p>

<p>45:002:014 For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the things contained in the law, these, having not the law,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are a law unto themselves:</p>

<p>45:002:015 Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while accusing or else excusing one another;)</p>

<p>45:002:016 In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ according to my gospel.</p>

<p>45:002:017 Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;makest thy boast of God,</p>

<p>45:002:018 And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;excellent, being instructed out of the law;</p>

<p>45:002:019 And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a light of them which are in darkness,</p>

<p>45:002:020 An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</p>

<p>45:002:021 Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;steal?</p>

<p>45:002:022 Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sacrilege?</p>

<p>45:002:023 Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;law dishonourest thou God?</p>

<p>45:002:024 For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, as it is written.</p>

<p>45:002:025 For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uncircumcision.</p>

<p>45:002:026 Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</p>

<p>45:002:027 And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transgress the law?</p>

<p>45:002:028 For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</p>

<p>45:002:029 But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;praise is not of men, but of God.</p>

<p>45:003:001 What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circumcision?</p>

<p>45:003:002 Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the oracles of God.</p>

<p>45:003:003 For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the faith of God without effect?</p>

<p>45:003:004 God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</p>

<p>45:003:005 But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak as a man)</p>

<p>45:003:006 God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</p>

<p>45:003:007 For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</p>

<p>45:003:008 And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;damnation is just.</p>

<p>45:003:009 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under sin;</p>

<p>45:003:010 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</p>

<p>45:003:011 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after God.</p>

<p>45:003:012 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>

<p>45:003:013 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</p>

<p>45:003:014 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</p>

<p>45:003:015 Their feet are swift to shed blood:</p>

<p>45:003:016 Destruction and misery are in their ways:</p>

<p>45:003:017 And the way of peace have they not known:</p>

<p>45:003:018 There is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>

<p>45:003:019 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the world may become guilty before God.</p>

<p>45:003:020 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sin.</p>

<p>45:003:021 But now the righteousness of God without the law is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</p>

<p>45:003:022 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no difference:</p>

<p>45:003:023 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>

<p>45:003:024 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is in Christ Jesus:</p>

<p>45:003:025 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</p>

<p>45:003:026 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus.</p>

<p>45:003:027 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nay: but by the law of faith.</p>

<p>45:003:028 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the deeds of the law.</p>

<p>45:003:029 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</p>

<p>45:003:030 Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</p>

<p>45:003:031 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we establish the law.</p>

<p>45:004:001 What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the flesh, hath found?</p>

<p>45:004:002 For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glory; but not before God.</p>

<p>45:004:003 For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counted unto him for righteousness.</p>

<p>45:004:004 Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but of debt.</p>

<p>45:004:005 But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteousness.</p>

<p>45:004:006 Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom God imputeth righteousness without works,</p>

<p>45:004:007 Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose sins are covered.</p>

<p>45:004:008 Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.</p>

<p>45:004:009 Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</p>

<p>45:004:010 How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</p>

<p>45:004:011 And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteousness of the faith which he had yet being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might be imputed unto them also:</p>

<p>45:004:012 And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uncircumcised.</p>

<p>45:004:013 For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the righteousness of faith.</p>

<p>45:004:014 For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the promise made of none effect:</p>

<p>45:004:015 Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no transgression.</p>

<p>45:004:016 Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,</p>

<p>45:004:017 (As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were.</p>

<p>45:004:018 Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall thy seed be.</p>

<p>45:004:019 And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the deadness of Sarah's womb:</p>

<p>45:004:020 He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was strong in faith, giving glory to God;</p>

<p>45:004:021 And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;able also to perform.</p>

<p>45:004:022 And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.</p>

<p>45:004:023 Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to him;</p>

<p>45:004:024 But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;</p>

<p>45:004:025 Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our justification.</p>

<p>45:005:001 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>

<p>45:005:002 By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</p>

<p>45:005:003 And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that tribulation worketh patience;</p>

<p>45:005:004 And patience, experience; and experience, hope:</p>

<p>45:005:005 And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.</p>

<p>45:005:006 For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the ungodly.</p>

<p>45:005:007 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.</p>

<p>45:005:008 But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet sinners, Christ died for us.</p>

<p>45:005:009 Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saved from wrath through him.</p>

<p>45:005:010 For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saved by his life.</p>

<p>45:005:011 And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.</p>

<p>45:005:012 Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sinned:</p>

<p>45:005:013 (For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imputed when there is no law.</p>

<p>45:005:014 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.</p>

<p>45:005:015 But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ, hath abounded unto many.</p>

<p>45:005:016 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many offences unto justification.</p>

<p>45:005:017 For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</p>

<p>45:005:018 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gift came upon all men unto justification of life.</p>

<p>45:005:019 For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</p>

<p>45:005:020 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:</p>

<p>45:005:021 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord.</p>

<p>45:006:001 What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may abound?</p>

<p>45:006:002 God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;longer therein?</p>

<p>45:006:003 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ were baptized into his death?</p>

<p>45:006:004 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</p>

<p>45:006:005 For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</p>

<p>45:006:006 Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serve sin.</p>

<p>45:006:007 For he that is dead is freed from sin.</p>

<p>45:006:008 Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;live with him:</p>

<p>45:006:009 Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death hath no more dominion over him.</p>

<p>45:006:010 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;liveth, he liveth unto God.</p>

<p>45:006:011 Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>45:006:012 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should obey it in the lusts thereof.</p>

<p>45:006:013 Neither yield ye your members as instruments of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those that are alive from the dead, and your members as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instruments of righteousness unto God.</p>

<p>45:006:014 For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the law, but under grace.</p>

<p>45:006:015 What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under grace? God forbid.</p>

<p>45:006:016 Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</p>

<p>45:006:017 But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delivered you.</p>

<p>45:006:018 Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteousness.</p>

<p>45:006:019 I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</p>

<p>45:006:020 For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteousness.</p>

<p>45:006:021 What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ashamed? for the end of those things is death.</p>

<p>45:006:022 But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life.</p>

<p>45:006:023 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

<p>45:007:001 Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;liveth?</p>

<p>45:007:002 For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is loosed from the law of her husband.</p>

<p>45:007:003 So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adulteress, though she be married to another man.</p>

<p>45:007:004 Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fruit unto God.</p>

<p>45:007:005 For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death.</p>

<p>45:007:006 But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not in the oldness of the letter.</p>

<p>45:007:007 What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</p>

<p>45:007:008 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</p>

<p>45:007:009 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came, sin revived, and I died.</p>

<p>45:007:010 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto death.</p>

<p>45:007:011 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by it slew me.</p>

<p>45:007:012 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and good.</p>

<p>45:007:013 Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is good; that sin by the commandment might become<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exceeding sinful.</p>

<p>45:007:014 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under sin.</p>

<p>45:007:015 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not; but what I hate, that do I.</p>

<p>45:007:016 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that it is good.</p>

<p>45:007:017 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>45:007:018 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is good I find not.</p>

<p>45:007:019 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not, that I do.</p>

<p>45:007:020 Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sin that dwelleth in me.</p>

<p>45:007:021 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with me.</p>

<p>45:007:022 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</p>

<p>45:007:023 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is in my members.</p>

<p>45:007:024 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of this death?</p>

<p>45:007:025 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of sin.</p>

<p>45:008:001 There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirit.</p>

<p>45:008:002 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;free from the law of sin and death.</p>

<p>45:008:003 For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</p>

<p>45:008:004 That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</p>

<p>45:008:005 For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirit.</p>

<p>45:008:006 For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minded is life and peace.</p>

<p>45:008:007 Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</p>

<p>45:008:008 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</p>

<p>45:008:009 But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</p>

<p>45:008:010 And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</p>

<p>45:008:011 But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you.</p>

<p>45:008:012 Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after the flesh.</p>

<p>45:008:013 For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;live.</p>

<p>45:008:014 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God.</p>

<p>45:008:015 For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abba, Father.</p>

<p>45:008:016 The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the children of God:</p>

<p>45:008:017 And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also glorified together.</p>

<p>45:008:018 For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in us.</p>

<p>45:008:019 For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manifestation of the sons of God.</p>

<p>45:008:020 For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,</p>

<p>45:008:021 Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of God.</p>

<p>45:008:022 For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pain together until now.</p>

<p>45:008:023 And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our body.</p>

<p>45:008:024 For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?</p>

<p>45:008:025 But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wait for it.</p>

<p>45:008:026 Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uttered.</p>

<p>45:008:027 And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the will of God.</p>

<p>45:008:028 And we know that all things work together for good to them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that love God, to them who are the called according to his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purpose.</p>

<p>45:008:029 For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;firstborn among many brethren.</p>

<p>45:008:030 Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them he also glorified.</p>

<p>45:008:031 What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can be against us?</p>

<p>45:008:032 He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</p>

<p>45:008:033 Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God that justifieth.</p>

<p>45:008:034 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also maketh intercession for us.</p>

<p>45:008:035 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nakedness, or peril, or sword?</p>

<p>45:008:036 As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</p>

<p>45:008:037 Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him that loved us.</p>

<p>45:008:038 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to come,</p>

<p>45:008:039 Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our Lord.</p>

<p>45:009:001 I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,</p>

<p>45:009:002 That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.</p>

<p>45:009:003 For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:</p>

<p>45:009:004 Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;service of God, and the promises;</p>

<p>45:009:005 Whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ came, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.</p>

<p>45:009:006 Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are not all Israel, which are of Israel:</p>

<p>45:009:007 Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are they all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.</p>

<p>45:009:008 That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not the children of God: but the children of the promise are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counted for the seed.</p>

<p>45:009:009 For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarah shall have a son.</p>

<p>45:009:010 And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even by our father Isaac;</p>

<p>45:009:011 (For the children being not yet born, neither having done any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)</p>

<p>45:009:012 It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.</p>

<p>45:009:013 As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.</p>

<p>45:009:014 What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forbid.</p>

<p>45:009:015 For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compassion.</p>

<p>45:009:016 So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.</p>

<p>45:009:017 For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth.</p>

<p>45:009:018 Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will he hardeneth.</p>

<p>45:009:019 Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who hath resisted his will?</p>

<p>45:009:020 Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me thus?</p>

<p>45:009:021 Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?</p>

<p>45:009:022 What if God, willing to shew his wrath, and to make his power<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fitted to destruction:</p>

<p>45:009:023 And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,</p>

<p>45:009:024 Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Gentiles?</p>

<p>45:009:025 As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.</p>

<p>45:009:026 And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the children of the living God.</p>

<p>45:009:027 Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be saved:</p>

<p>45:009:028 For he will finish the work, and cut it short in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth.</p>

<p>45:009:029 And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gomorrha.</p>

<p>45:009:030 What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteousness which is of faith.</p>

<p>45:009:031 But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath not attained to the law of righteousness.</p>

<p>45:009:032 Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stumblingstone;</p>

<p>45:009:033 As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ashamed.</p>

<p>45:010:001 Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they might be saved.</p>

<p>45:010:002 For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to knowledge.</p>

<p>45:010:003 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves unto the righteousness of God.</p>

<p>45:010:004 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one that believeth.</p>

<p>45:010:005 For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.</p>

<p>45:010:006 But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is, to bring Christ down from above:)</p>

<p>45:010:007 Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ again from the dead.)</p>

<p>45:010:008 But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;</p>

<p>45:010:009 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dead, thou shalt be saved.</p>

<p>45:010:010 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</p>

<p>45:010:011 For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be ashamed.</p>

<p>45:010:012 For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.</p>

<p>45:010:013 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saved.</p>

<p>45:010:014 How then shall they call on him in whom they have not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</p>

<p>45:010:015 And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</p>

<p>45:010:016 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, who hath believed our report?</p>

<p>45:010:017 So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God.</p>

<p>45:010:018 But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world.</p>

<p>45:010:019 But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foolish nation I will anger you.</p>

<p>45:010:020 But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after me.</p>

<p>45:010:021 But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.</p>

<p>45:011:001 I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin.</p>

<p>45:011:002 God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intercession to God against Israel saying,</p>

<p>45:011:003 Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</p>

<p>45:011:004 But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;image of Baal.</p>

<p>45:011:005 Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the election of grace.</p>

<p>45:011:006 And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grace: otherwise work is no more work.</p>

<p>45:011:007 What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.</p>

<p>45:011:008 (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should not hear;) unto this day.</p>

<p>45:011:009 And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:</p>

<p>45:011:010 Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down their back alway.</p>

<p>45:011:011 I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</p>

<p>45:011:012 Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their fulness?</p>

<p>45:011:013 For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:</p>

<p>45:011:014 If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flesh, and might save some of them.</p>

<p>45:011:015 For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dead?</p>

<p>45:011:016 For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the root be holy, so are the branches.</p>

<p>45:011:017 And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</p>

<p>45:011:018 Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bearest not the root, but the root thee.</p>

<p>45:011:019 Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be graffed in.</p>

<p>45:011:020 Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</p>

<p>45:011:021 For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also spare not thee.</p>

<p>45:011:022 Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;off.</p>

<p>45:011:023 And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.</p>

<p>45:011:024 For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?</p>

<p>45:011:025 For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Gentiles be come in.</p>

<p>45:011:026 And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ungodliness from Jacob:</p>

<p>45:011:027 For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their sins.</p>

<p>45:011:028 As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sakes.</p>

<p>45:011:029 For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</p>

<p>45:011:030 For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obtained mercy through their unbelief:</p>

<p>45:011:031 Even so have these also now not believed, that through your<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mercy they also may obtain mercy.</p>

<p>45:011:032 For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have mercy upon all.</p>

<p>45:011:033 O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finding out!</p>

<p>45:011:034 For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counsellor?</p>

<p>45:011:035 Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him again?</p>

<p>45:011:036 For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom be glory for ever. Amen.</p>

<p>45:012:001 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto God, which is your reasonable service.</p>

<p>45:012:002 And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</p>

<p>45:012:003 For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dealt to every man the measure of faith.</p>

<p>45:012:004 For as we have many members in one body, and all members have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not the same office:</p>

<p>45:012:005 So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;members one of another.</p>

<p>45:012:006 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the proportion of faith;</p>

<p>45:012:007 Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teacheth, on teaching;</p>

<p>45:012:008 Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.</p>

<p>45:012:009 Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cleave to that which is good.</p>

<p>45:012:010 Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;honour preferring one another;</p>

<p>45:012:011 Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</p>

<p>45:012:012 Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in prayer;</p>

<p>45:012:013 Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.</p>

<p>45:012:014 Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.</p>

<p>45:012:015 Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weep.</p>

<p>45:012:016 Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conceits.</p>

<p>45:012:017 Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sight of all men.</p>

<p>45:012:018 If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with all men.</p>

<p>45:012:019 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repay, saith the Lord.</p>

<p>45:012:020 Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his head.</p>

<p>45:012:021 Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</p>

<p>45:013:001 Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.</p>

<p>45:013:002 Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves damnation.</p>

<p>45:013:003 For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:</p>

<p>45:013:004 For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrath upon him that doeth evil.</p>

<p>45:013:005 Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also for conscience sake.</p>

<p>45:013:006 For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</p>

<p>45:013:007 Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;honour.</p>

<p>45:013:008 Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loveth another hath fulfilled the law.</p>

<p>45:013:009 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy neighbour as thyself.</p>

<p>45:013:010 Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fulfilling of the law.</p>

<p>45:013:011 And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believed.</p>

<p>45:013:012 The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of light.</p>

<p>45:013:013 Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and envying.</p>

<p>45:013:014 But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.</p>

<p>45:014:001 Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disputations.</p>

<p>45:014:002 For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weak, eateth herbs.</p>

<p>45:014:003 Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received him.</p>

<p>45:014:004 Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is able to make him stand.</p>

<p>45:014:005 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mind.</p>

<p>45:014:006 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God thanks.</p>

<p>45:014:007 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</p>

<p>45:014:008 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we are the Lord's.</p>

<p>45:014:009 For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</p>

<p>45:014:010 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seat of Christ.</p>

<p>45:014:011 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</p>

<p>45:014:012 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</p>

<p>45:014:013 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to fall in his brother's way.</p>

<p>45:014:014 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</p>

<p>45:014:015 But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;died.</p>

<p>45:014:016 Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</p>

<p>45:014:017 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>45:014:018 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, and approved of men.</p>

<p>45:014:019 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and things wherewith one may edify another.</p>

<p>45:014:020 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</p>

<p>45:014:021 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made weak.</p>

<p>45:014:022 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</p>

<p>45:014:023 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</p>

<p>45:015:001 We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weak, and not to please ourselves.</p>

<p>45:015:002 Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edification.</p>

<p>45:015:003 For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.</p>

<p>45:015:004 For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scriptures might have hope.</p>

<p>45:015:005 Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:</p>

<p>45:015:006 That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>45:015:007 Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the glory of God.</p>

<p>45:015:008 Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fathers:</p>

<p>45:015:009 And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.</p>

<p>45:015:010 And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.</p>

<p>45:015:011 And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye people.</p>

<p>45:015:012 And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Gentiles trust.</p>

<p>45:015:013 Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>45:015:014 And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also to admonish one another.</p>

<p>45:015:015 Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that is given to me of God,</p>

<p>45:015:016 That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost.</p>

<p>45:015:017 I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those things which pertain to God.</p>

<p>45:015:018 For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by word and deed,</p>

<p>45:015:019 Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>45:015:020 Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:</p>

<p>45:015:021 But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see: and they that have not heard shall understand.</p>

<p>45:015:022 For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you.</p>

<p>45:015:023 But now having no more place in these parts, and having a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great desire these many years to come unto you;</p>

<p>45:015:024 Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your company.</p>

<p>45:015:025 But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.</p>

<p>45:015:026 For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;certain contribution for the poor saints which are at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem.</p>

<p>45:015:027 It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things.</p>

<p>45:015:028 When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.</p>

<p>45:015:029 And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>45:015:030 Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me in your prayers to God for me;</p>

<p>45:015:031 That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accepted of the saints;</p>

<p>45:015:032 That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with you be refreshed.</p>

<p>45:015:033 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</p>

<p>45:016:001 I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;church which is at Cenchrea:</p>

<p>45:016:002 That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.</p>

<p>45:016:003 Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:</p>

<p>45:016:004 Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.</p>

<p>45:016:005 Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ.</p>

<p>45:016:006 Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.</p>

<p>45:016:007 Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were in Christ before me.</p>

<p>45:016:008 Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.</p>

<p>45:016:009 Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.</p>

<p>45:016:010 Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aristobulus' household.</p>

<p>45:016:011 Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them that be of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.</p>

<p>45:016:012 Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.</p>

<p>45:016:013 Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.</p>

<p>45:016:014 Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brethren which are with them.</p>

<p>45:016:015 Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.</p>

<p>45:016:016 Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;salute you.</p>

<p>45:016:017 Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and avoid them.</p>

<p>45:016:018 For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hearts of the simple.</p>

<p>45:016:019 For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I am glad<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that which is good, and simple concerning evil.</p>

<p>45:016:020 And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</p>

<p>45:016:021 Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my kinsmen, salute you.</p>

<p>45:016:022 I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.</p>

<p>45:016:023 Gaius mine host, and of the whole church, saluteth you.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you, and Quartus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a brother.</p>

<p>45:016:024 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</p>

<p>45:016:025 Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world began,</p>

<p>45:016:026 But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:</p>

<p>45:016:027 To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amen.</p>
