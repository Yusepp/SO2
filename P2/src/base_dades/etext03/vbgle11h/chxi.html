<center>STRAIT OF MAGELLAN.&mdash;CLIMATE OF THE SOUTHERN
COASTS.</center>

<p>In the end of May 1834 we entered for a second time the eastern
mouth of the Strait of Magellan. The country on both sides of this
part of the Strait consists of nearly level plains, like those of
Patagonia. Cape Negro, a little within the second Narrows, may be
considered as the point where the land begins to assume the marked
features of Tierra del Fuego. On the east coast, south of the
Strait, broken park-like scenery in a like manner connects these
two countries, which are opposed to each other in almost every
feature. It is truly surprising to find in a space of twenty miles
such a change in the landscape. If we take a rather greater
distance, as between Port Famine and</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gregory Bay, that is about sixty miles, the difference is still
more wonderful. At the former place we have rounded mountains
concealed by impervious forests, which are drenched with the rain
brought by an endless succession of gales; while at Cape Gregory
there is a clear and bright blue sky over the dry and sterile
plains. The atmospheric currents,<sup>1</sup> although rapid,
turbulent, and unconfined by any apparent limits, yet seem to
follow, like a river in its bed, a regularly determined course.</p>

"Patagonians from Cape Gregory"></center>

<p>During our previous visit (in January), we had an interview at
Cape Gregory with the famous so-called gigantic Patagonians, who
gave us a cordial reception. Their height appears greater than it
really is, from their large guanaco mantles, their long flowing
hair, and general figure: on an average their height is about six
feet, with some men taller and only a few shorter; and the women
are also tall; altogether they are certainly the tallest race which
we anywhere saw. In features they strikingly</p>

<p class="fnote">1. The south-westerly breezes are generally very
dry. January 29th, being at anchor under Cape Gregory: a very hard

15th, at Port St. Julian: in the morning light winds with much

<p>resemble the more northern Indians whom I saw with Rosas, but
they have a wilder and more formidable appearance: their faces were
much painted with red and black, and one man was ringed and dotted
with white like a Fuegian. Captain Fitz Roy offered to take any
three of them on board, and all seemed determined to be of the
three. It was long before we could clear the boat; at last we got
on board with our three giants, who dined with the Captain, and
behaved quite like gentlemen, helping themselves with knives,
forks, and spoons: nothing was so much relished as sugar. This
tribe has had so much communication with sealers and whalers, that
most of the men can speak a little English and Spanish; and they
are half civilised, and proportionally demoralised.</p>

<p>The next morning a large party went on shore, to barter for
skins and ostrich-feathers; fire-arms being refused, tobacco was in
greatest request, far more so than axes or tools. The whole
population of the toldos, men, women, and children, were arranged
on a bank. It was an amusing scene, and it was impossible not
to</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 246">page 246</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>like the so-called giants, they were so thoroughly good-humoured
and unsuspecting: they asked us to come again. They seem to like to
have Europeans to live with them; and old Maria, an important woman
in the tribe, once begged Mr. Low to leave any one of his sailors
with them. They spend the greater part of the year here; but in
summer they hunt along the foot of the Cordillera: sometimes they
travel as far as the Rio Negro, 750 miles to the north. They are
well stocked with horses, each man having, according to Mr. Low,
six or seven, and all the women, and even children, their one own
horse. In the time of Sarmiento (1580) these Indians had bows and
arrows, now long since disused; they then also possessed some
horses. This is a very curious fact, showing the extraordinarily
rapid multiplication of horses in South America. The horse was
first landed at Buenos Ayres in 1537, and the colony being then for
a time deserted, the horse ran wild;<sup>1</sup> in 1580, only
forty-three years afterwards, we hear of them at the Strait of
Magellan! Mr. Low informs me, that a neighbouring tribe of
foot-Indians is now changing into horse-Indians: the tribe at
Gregory Bay giving them their worn-out horses, and sending in
winter a few of their best skilled men to hunt for them.</p>

<p><i>June 1st.</i>&mdash;We anchored in the fine bay of Port
Famine. It was now the beginning of winter, and I never saw a more
cheerless prospect; the dusky woods, piebald with snow, could be
only seen indistinctly through a drizzling hazy atmosphere. We
were, however, lucky in getting two fine days. On one of these,
Mount Sarmiento, a distant mountain 6800 feet high, presented a
very noble spectacle. I was frequently surprised, in the scenery of
Tierra del Fuego, at the little apparent elevation of mountains
really lofty. I suspect it is owing to a cause which would not at
first be imagined, namely, that the whole mass, from the summit to
the water's edge, is generally in full view. I remember having seen
a mountain, first from the Beagle Channel, where the whole sweep
from the summit to the base was full in view, and then from
Ponsonby Sound across several successive ridges; and it was curious
to observe in the latter case, as each fresh ridge afforded fresh
means of judging of the distance, how the mountain rose in
height.</p>

<p>Before reaching Port Famine, two men were seen running along the
shore and hailing the ship. A boat was sent for them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They turned out to be two sailors who had run away from a
sealing-vessel, and had joined the Patagonians. These Indians had
treated them with their usual disinterested hospitality. They had
parted company through accident, and were then proceeding to Port
Famine in hopes of finding some ship. I daresay they were worthless
vagabonds, but I never saw more miserable-looking ones. They had
been living for some days on mussel-shells and berries, and their
tattered clothes had been burnt by sleeping so near their fires.
They had been exposed night and day, without any shelter, to the
late incessant gales, with rain, sleet, and snow, and yet they were
in good health.</p>

"Patagonian bolas" align="left"> 

<p>During our stay at Port Famine, the Fuegians twice came and
plagued us. As there were many instruments, clothes, and men on
shore, it was thought necessary to frighten them away. The first
time a few great guns were fired, when they were far distant. It
was most ludicrous to watch through a glass the Indians, as often
as the shot struck the water, take up stones, and, as a bold
defiance, throw them towards the ship, though about a mile and a
half distant! A boat was then sent with orders to fire a few
musket-shots wide of them. The Fuegians hid themselves behind the
trees, and for every discharge of the muskets they fired their
arrows; all, however, fell short of the boat, and the officer as he
pointed at them laughed. This made the Fuegians frantic with
passion, and they shook their mantles in vain rage. At last, seeing
the balls cut and strike the trees, they ran away, and we were left
in peace and quietness. During the former voyage the Fuegians were
here very troublesome, and to frighten them a rocket was fired at
night over their wigwams; it answered effectually, and one of the
officers told me that the clamour first raised, and the barking of
the dogs, was quite ludicrous in contrast with the profound silence
which in a minute or two afterwards prevailed. The next morning not
a single Fuegian was in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>When the <i>Beagle</i> was here in the month of February, I
started one morning at four o'clock to ascend Mount Tarn, which is
2600 feet high, and is the most elevated point in this immediate
district. We went in a boat to the foot of the mountain (but
unluckily not to the best part), and then began our ascent. The
forest commences at the line of high-water mark, and during the
first two hours I gave over all hopes of reaching the summit. So
thick was the wood, that it was necessary to have constant recourse
to the compass; for every landmark, though in a mountainous
country, was completely shut out. In the deep ravines the
death-like scene of desolation exceeded all description; outside it
was blowing a gale, but in these hollows not even a breath of wind
stirred the leaves of the tallest trees. So gloomy, cold, and wet
was every part, that not even the fungi, mosses, or ferns could
flourish. In the valleys it was scarcely possible to crawl along,
they were so completely barricaded by great mouldering trunks,
which had fallen down in every direction. When passing over these
natural bridges, one's course was often arrested by sinking knee
deep into the rotten wood; at other times, when attempting to lean
against a firm tree, one was startled by finding a mass of decayed
matter ready to fall at the slightest touch. We at last found
ourselves among the stunted trees, and then soon reached the bare
ridge, which conducted us to the summit. Here was a view
characteristic of Tierra del Fuego; irregular chains of hills,
mottled with patches</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 249">page 249</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>of snow, deep yellowish-green valleys, and arms of the sea
intersecting the land in many directions. The strong wind was
piercingly cold, and the atmosphere rather hazy, so that we did not
stay long on the top of the mountain. Our descent was not quite so
laborious as our ascent, for the weight of the body forced a
passage, and all the slips and falls were in the right
direction.</p>

<br>
<p>I have already mentioned the sombre and dull character of the
evergreen forests,<sup>1</sup> in which two or three species of
trees grow, to the exclusion of all others. Above the forest land
there are many dwarf alpine plants, which all spring from the mass
of peat, and help to compose it: these plants are very remarkable
from their close alliance with the species growing on the mountains
of Europe, though so many thousand miles distant. The central part
of Tierra del Fuego, where the clay-slate formation occurs, is most
favourable to the growth of trees; on the outer coast the poorer
granitic soil, and a situation more exposed to the violent winds,
do not allow of their attaining any great size. Near Port Famine I
have seen more large trees than anywhere else: I measured a
Winter's Bark which was four feet six inches in girth, and several
of the beech were as much as thirteen feet. Captain King also
mentions a beech which was seven feet in diameter seventeen feet
above the roots.</p>

<img src="images/pl51.jpg" width="100" height="117" alt=
"Cytaria Darwinii" align="right"> 

<p>There is one vegetable production deserving notice from its
importance as an article of food to the Fuegians. It is a globular,
bright-yellow fungus, which grows in vast numbers on the
beech-trees. When young it is elastic and turgid, with a smooth
surface; but when mature, it shrinks, becomes tougher, and has its
entire surface deeply pitted or honeycombed, as represented in the
figure at right. This fungus belongs to a new and curious
genus;<sup>1</sup> I found a second</p>

<p class="fnote">1. Captain Fitz Roy informs me that in April (our
October) the leaves of those trees which grow near the base of the
mountains change colour, but not those on the more elevated parts.
I remember having read some observations, showing that in England
the leaves fall earlier in a warm and fine autumn than in a late
and cold one. The change in the colour being here retarded in the
more elevated, and therefore colder situations, must be owing to
the same general law of vegetation. The trees of Tierra del Fuego
during no part of the year entirely shed their leaves.<br>
2. Described from my specimens and notes by the Reverend J. M.
Berkeley in the <i>Linnean Transactions</i> (vol. xix, p. 37),
under the name of Cyttaria Darwinii: the Chilean species is the C.
Berteroii. This genus is allied to Bulgaria.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 250">page 250</a></p>

<p>species on another species of beech in Chile: and Dr. Hooker
informs me that just lately a third species has been discovered on
a third species of beech in Van Dieman's Land. How singular is this
relationship between parasitical fungi and the trees on which they
grow, in distant parts of the world! In Tierra del Fuego the fungus
in its tough and mature state is collected in large quantities by
the women and children, and is eaten un-cooked. It has a
mucilaginous, slightly sweet taste, with a faint smell like that of
a mushroom. With the exception of a few berries, chiefly of a dwarf
arbutus, the natives eat no vegetable food besides this fungus. In
New Zealand, before the introduction of the potato, the roots of
the fern were largely consumed; at the present time, I believe,
Tierra del Fuego is the only country in the world where a
cryptogamic plant affords a staple article of food.</p>

<p>The zoology of Tierra del Fuego, as might have been expected
from the nature of its climate and vegetation, is very poor. Of
mammalia, besides whales and seals, there is one bat, a kind of
mouse (Reithrodon chinchilloides), two true mice, a ctenomys allied
to or identical with the tucutuco, two foxes (Canis Magellanicus
and C. Azar&aelig;), a sea-otter, the guanaco, and a deer. Most of
these animals inhabit only the drier eastern parts of the country;
and the deer has never been seen south of the Strait of Magellan.
Observing the general correspondence of the cliffs of soft
sandstone, mud, and shingle, on the opposite sides of the Strait,
and on some intervening islands, one is strongly tempted to believe
that the land was once joined, and thus allowed animals so delicate
and helpless as the tucutuco and Reithrodon to pass over. The
correspondence of the cliffs is far from proving any junction;
because such cliffs generally are formed by the intersection of
sloping deposits, which, before the elevation of the land, had been
accumulated near the then existing shores. It is, however, a
remarkable coincidence, that in the two large islands cut off by
the Beagle Channel from the rest of Tierra del Fuego, one has
cliffs composed of matter that may be called stratified alluvium,
which front similar ones on the opposite side of the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 251">page 251</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>channel,&mdash;while the other is exclusively bordered by old
crystalline rocks; in the former, called Navarin Island, both foxes
and guanacos occur; but in the latter, Hoste Island, although
similar in every respect, and only separated by a channel a little
more than half a mile wide, I have the word of Jemmy Button for
saying that neither of these animals is found.</p>

<p>The gloomy woods are inhabited by few birds: occasionally the
plaintive note of a white-tufted tyrant-flycatcher (Myiobius
albiceps) may be heard, concealed near the summit of the most lofty
trees; and more rarely the loud strange cry of a black woodpecker,
with a fine scarlet crest on its head. A little, dusky-coloured
wren (Scytalopus Magellanicus) hops in a skulking manner among the
entangled mass of the fallen and decaying trunks. But the creeper
(Oxyurus tupinieri) is the commonest bird in the country.
Throughout the beech forests, high up and low down, in the most
gloomy, wet, and impenetrable ravines, it may be met with. This
little bird no doubt appears more numerous than it really is, from
its habit of following with seeming curiosity any person who enters
these silent woods: continually uttering a harsh twitter, it
flutters from tree to tree, within a few feet of the intruder's
face. It is far from wishing for the modest concealment of the true
creeper (Certhia familiaris); nor does it, like that bird, run up
the trunks of trees, but industriously, after the manner of a
willow-wren, hops about, and searches for insects on every twig and
branch. In the more open parts, three or four species of finches, a
thrush, a starling (or Icterus), two Opetiorhynchi, and several
hawks and owls occur.</p>

<p>The absence of any species whatever in the whole class of
Reptiles is a marked feature in the zoology of this country, as
well as in that of the Falkland Islands. I do not ground this
statement merely on my own observation, but I heard it from the
Spanish inhabitants of the latter place, and from Jemmy Button with
regard to Tierra del Fuego. On the banks of the Santa Cruz, in 50
degrees south, I saw a frog; and it is not improbable that these
animals, as well as lizards, may be found as far south as the
Strait of Magellan, where the country retains the character of
Patagonia; but within the damp and cold limit of Tierra del Fuego
not one occurs. That the climate would not have</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 252">page 252</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>suited some of the orders, such as lizards, might have been
foreseen; but with respect to frogs, this was not so obvious.</p>

<p>Beetles occur in very small numbers: it was long before I could
believe that a country as large as Scotland, covered with vegetable
productions and with a variety of stations, could be so
unproductive. The few which I found were alpine species
(Harpalid&aelig; and Heteromid&aelig;) living under stones. The
vegetable-feeding Chrysomelid&aelig;, so eminently characteristic
of the Tropics, are here almost entirely absent;<sup>1</sup> I saw
very few flies, butterflies, or bees, and no crickets or
Orthoptera. In the pools of water I found but few aquatic beetles,
and not any fresh-water shells: Succinea at first appears an
exception; but here it must be called a terrestrial shell, for it
lives on the damp herbage far from water. Land-shells could be
procured only in the same alpine situations with the beetles. I
have already contrasted the climate as well as the general
appearance of Tierra del Fuego with that of Patagonia; and the
difference is strongly exemplified in the entomology. I do not
believe they have one species in common; certainly the general
character of the insects is widely different.</p>

<p>If we turn from the land to the sea, we shall find the latter as
abundantly stocked with living creatures as the former is poorly
so. In all parts of the world a rocky and partially protected shore
perhaps supports, in a given space, a greater number of individual
animals than any other station. There is one marine production
which, from its importance, is worthy of a particular history. It
is the kelp, or Macrocystis pyrifera. This plant grows on every
rock from low-water mark to a great depth, both on the outer coast
and within the channels.<sup>2</sup> I</p>

<p class="fnote">1. I believe I must except one alpine Haltica, and
a single specimen of a Melasoma. Mr. Waterhouse informs me, that of
the Harpalid&aelig; there are eight or nine species&mdash;the forms
of the greater number being very peculiar; of Heteromera, four or
five species; of Rhyncophora, six or seven; and of the following
families one species in each: Staphylinid&aelig;, Elaterid&aelig;,
Cebrionid&aelig;, Melolonthid&aelig;. The species in the other
orders are even fewer. In all the orders, the scarcity of the
individuals is even more remarkable than that of the species. Most
of the Coleoptera have been carefully described by Mr. Waterhouse
in the <i>Annals of Nat. Hist.</i><br>
1. Its geographical range is remarkably wide; it is found from the
extreme southern islets near Cape Horn, as far north on the eastern
coast (according to information given me by Mr. Stokes) as lat.
43&deg;,&mdash;but on the western coast, as Dr. Hooker tells me, it
extends to the R. San Francisco in California, and perhaps even to
Kamtschatka. We thus have an immense range in latitude; and as
Cook, who must have been well acquainted with the species, found it
at Kerguelen Land, no less than 140&deg; in longitude.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 253">page 253</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>believe, during the voyages of the <i>Adventure</i> and <i>
Beagle</i>, not one rock near the surface was discovered which was
not buoyed by this floating weed. The good service it thus affords
to vessels navigating near this stormy land is evident; and it
certainly has saved many a one from being wrecked. I know few
things more surprising than to see this plant growing and
flourishing amidst those great breakers of the western ocean, which
no mass of rock, let it be ever so hard, can long resist. The stem
is round, slimy, and smooth, and seldom has a diameter of so much
as an inch. A few taken together are sufficiently strong to support
the weight of the large loose stones, to which in the inland
channels they grow attached; and yet some of these stones were so
heavy that when drawn to the surface, they could scarcely be lifted
into a boat by one person. Captain Cook, in his second voyage, says
that this plant at Kerguelen Land rises from a greater depth than
twenty-four fathoms; "and as it does not grow in a perpendicular
direction, but makes a very acute angle with the bottom, and much
of it afterwards spreads many fathoms on the surface of the sea, I
am well warranted to say that some of it grows to the length of
sixty fathoms and upwards." I do not suppose the stem of any other
plant attains so great a length as three hundred and sixty feet, as
stated by Captain Cook. Captain Fitz Roy, moreover, found it
growing<sup>1</sup> up from the greater depth of forty-five
fathoms. The beds of this sea-weed, even when of not great breadth,
make excellent natural floating breakwaters. It is quite curious to
see, in an exposed harbour, how soon the waves from the open sea,
as they travel through the straggling stems, sink in height, and
pass into smooth water.</p>

<p>The number of living creatures of all Orders, whose existence
intimately depends on the kelp, is wonderful. A great volume might
be written, describing the inhabitants of one of these beds of
seaweed. Almost all the leaves, excepting those that float on the
surface, are so thickly incrusted with corallines as</p>

<p class="fnote">1. <i>Voyages of the Adventure and Beagle</i>,
vol. i, p. 363. It appears that seaweed grows extremely quick. Mr.
Stephenson found (Wilson's <i>Voyage round Scotland</i> vol. ii, p.
228) that a rock uncovered only at spring-tides, which had been
chiselled smooth in November, on the following May, that is, within
six months afterwards, was thickly covered with Fucus digitatus two
feet, and F. esculentus six feet, in length.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 254">page 254</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>to be of a white colour. We find exquisitely delicate
structures, some inhabited by simple hydra-like polypi, others by
more organised kinds, and beautiful compound Ascidi&aelig;. On the
leaves, also, various patelliform shells, Trochi, uncovered
molluscs, and some bivalves are attached. Innumerable crustacea
frequent every part of the plant. On shaking the great entangled
roots, a pile of small fish, shells, cuttlefish, crabs of all
orders, sea-eggs, starfish, beautiful Holothuri&aelig;,
Planari&aelig;, and crawling nereidous animals of a multitude of
forms, all fall out together. Often as I recurred to a branch of
the kelp, I never failed to discover animals of new and curious
structures. In Chiloe, where the kelp does not thrive very well,
the numerous shells, corallines, and crustacea are absent; but
there yet remain a few of the Flustrace&aelig;, and some compound
Ascidi&aelig;; the latter, however, are of different species from
those in Tierra del Fuego; we see here the fucus possessing a wider
range than the animals which use it as an abode. I can only compare
these great aquatic forests of the southern hemisphere with the
terrestrial ones in the intertropical regions. Yet if in any
country a forest was destroyed, I do not believe nearly so many
species of animals would perish as would here, from the destruction
of the kelp. Amidst the leaves of this plant numerous species of
fish live, which nowhere else could find food or shelter; with
their destruction the many cormorants and other fishing birds, the
otters, seals, and porpoises, would soon perish also; and lastly,
the Fuegian savage, the miserable lord of this miserable land,
would redouble his cannibal feast, decrease in numbers, and perhaps
cease to exist.</p>

<p><i>June 8th.</i>&mdash;We weighed anchor early in the morning
and left Port Famine. Captain Fitz Roy determined to leave the
Strait of Magellan by the Magdalen Channel, which had not long been
discovered. Our course lay due south, down that gloomy passage
which I have before alluded to as appearing to lead to another and
worse world. The wind was fair, but the atmosphere was very thick;
so that we missed much curious scenery. The dark ragged clouds were
rapidly driven over the mountains, from their summits nearly down
to their bases. The glimpses which we caught through the dusky mass
were highly interesting; jagged points, cones of snow, blue
glaciers, strong outlines, marked on a lurid sky, were seen at
different distances and</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 255">page 255</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>heights. In the midst of such scenery we anchored at Cape Turn,
close to Mount Sarmiento, which was then hidden in the clouds. At
the base of the lofty and almost perpendicular sides of our little
cove there was one deserted wigwam, and it alone reminded us that
man sometimes wandered into these desolate regions. But it would be
difficult to imagine a scene where he seemed to have fewer claims
or less authority. The inanimate works of nature&mdash;rock, ice,
snow, wind, and water, all warring with each other, yet combined
against man&mdash;here reigned in absolute sovereignty.</p>

<p><i>June 9th.</i>&mdash;In the morning we were delighted by
seeing the veil of mist gradually rise from Sarmiento, and display
it to our view. This mountain, which is one of the highest in
Tierra del Fuego, has an altitude of 6800 feet. Its base, for about
an eighth of its total height, is clothed by dusky woods, and above
this a field of snow extends to the summit. These vast piles of
snow, which never melt, and seem destined to last as long as the
world holds together, present a noble and even sublime spectacle.
The outline of the mountain was admirably clear and defined. Owing
to the abundance of light reflected from the white and glittering
surface, no shadows were cast on any part; and those lines which
intersected the sky could alone be distinguished: hence the mass
stood out in the boldest relief. Several glaciers descended in a
winding course from the upper great expanse of snow to the
sea-coast: they may be likened to great frozen Niagaras; and
perhaps these cataracts of blue ice are full as beautiful as the
moving ones of water. By night we reached the western part of the
channel; but the water was so deep that no anchorage could be
found. We were in consequence obliged to stand off and on in this
narrow arm of the sea, during a pitch-dark night of fourteen hours
long.</p>

<p><i>June 10th.</i>&mdash;In the morning we made the best of our
way into the open Pacific. The western coast generally consists of
low, rounded, quite barren hills of granite and greenstone. Sir J.
Narborough called one part South Desolation, because it is "so
desolate a land to behold:" and well indeed might he say so.
Outside the main islands there are numberless scattered rocks on
which the long swell of the open ocean incessantly rages. We passed
out between the East and West Furies;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 256">page 256</a></p>

<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>and a little farther northward there are so many breakers that
the sea is called the Milky Way. One sight of such a coast is
enough to make a landsman dream for a week about shipwrecks, peril,
and death; and with this sight we bade farewell for ever to Tierra
del Fuego.</p>

<p>The following discussion on the climate of the southern parts of
the continent with relation to its productions, on the snow-line,
on the extraordinarily low descent of the glaciers, and on the zone
of perpetual congelation in the antarctic islands, may be passed

final recapitulation alone may be read. I shall, however, here give
only an abstract, and must refer for details to the Thirteenth

<p>Hence we see that the central part of Tierra del Fuego is colder
in winter, and no less than 9.5&deg; less hot in summer, than
Dublin. According to von Buch the mean temperature of July (not the
hottest month in the year) at Saltenfiord in Norway, is as high as
57.8&deg;, and this place is actually 13&deg; nearer the pole than
Port Famine!<sup>1</sup> Inhospitable as this climate appears to
our feelings, evergreen trees flourish luxuriantly under it.
Humming-birds may be seen sucking the flowers, and parrots feeding
on the seeds of the Winter's Bark, in latitude 55 degrees south. I
have already remarked to what a degree the sea swarms with living
creatures; and the shells</p>

<p class="fnote">1. With respect to Tierra del Fuego, the results
are deduced from the observations of Capt. King (<i>Geographical
Journal</i>, 1830), and those taken on board the <i>Beagle.</i> For
the Falkland Islands, I am indebted to Captain Sulivan for the mean
of the mean temperature (reduced from careful observation at
midnight, 8 <small>A.M.</small>, noon, and 8 <small>P.M.</small>)
of the three hottest months, namely, December, January, and
February. The temperature of Dublin is taken from Barton.</p>

<p>(such as the Patell&aelig;, Fissurell&aelig;, Chitons, and
Barnacles), according to Mr. G. B. Sowerby, are of a much larger
size, and of a more vigorous growth, than the analogous species in
the northern hemisphere. A large Voluta is abundant in southern
Tierra del Fuego and the Falkland Islands. At Bahia Blanca, in lat.
39&deg; S., the most abundant shells were three species of Oliva
(one of large size), one or two Volutas, and a Terebra. Now these
are amongst the best characterised tropical forms. It is doubtful
whether even one small species of Oliva exists on the southern
shores of Europe, and there are no species of the two other genera.
If a geologist were to find in lat. 39&deg; on the coast of
Portugal a bed containing numerous shells belonging to three
species of Oliva, to a Voluta, and Terebra, he would probably
assert that the climate at the period of their existence must have
been tropical; but, judging from South America, such an inference
might be erroneous.</p>

<p>The equable, humid, and windy climate of Tierra del Fuego
extends, with only a small increase of heat, for many degrees along
the west coast of the continent. The forests for 600 miles
northward of Cape Horn, have a very similar aspect. As a proof of
the equable climate, even for 300 or 400 miles still farther
northward, I may mention that in Chiloe (corresponding in latitude
with the northern parts of Spain) the peach seldom produces fruit,
whilst strawberries and apples thrive to perfection. Even the crops
of barley and wheat<sup>1</sup> are often brought into the houses
to be dried and ripened. At Valdivia (in the same latitude of
40&deg; with Madrid) grapes and figs ripen, but are not common;
olives seldom ripen even partially, and oranges not at all. These
fruits, in corresponding latitudes in Europe, are well known to
succeed to perfection; and even in this continent, at the Rio
Negro, under nearly the same parallel with Valdivia, sweet potatoes
(convolvulus) are cultivated; and grapes, figs, olives, oranges,
water and musk melons, produce abundant fruit. Although the humid
and equable climate of Chiloe, and of the coast northward and
southward of it, is so unfavourable to our fruits, yet the native
forests, from lat. 45&deg; to 38&deg;, almost rival in luxuriance
those of the glowing intertropical regions. Stately trees of many
kinds, with smooth and highly coloured barks, are loaded by
parasitical monocotyledonous</p>

<p>plants; large and elegant ferns are numerous, and arborescent
grasses entwine the trees into one entangled mass to the height of
thirty or forty feet above the ground. Palm-trees grow in latitude
37&deg;; an arborescent grass, very like a bamboo, in 40&deg;; and
another closely allied kind, of great length, but not erect,
flourishes even as far south as 45&deg; S.</p>

<p>An equable climate, evidently due to the large area of sea
compared with the land, seems to extend over the greater part of
the southern hemisphere; and as a consequence, the vegetation
partakes of a semi-tropical character. Tree-ferns thrive
luxuriantly in Van Diemen's Land (lat. 45&deg;), and I measured one
trunk no less than six feet in circumference. An arborescent fern
was found by Forster in New Zealand in 46&deg;, where orchideous
plants are parasitical on the trees. In the Auckland Islands,
ferns, according to Dr. Dieffenbach,<sup>1</sup> have trunks so
thick and high that they may be almost called tree-ferns; and in
these islands, and even as far south as lat. 55&deg; in the
Macquarie Islands, parrots abound.</p>

 As the height of the plane of perpetual snow seems chiefly to be
determined by the extreme heat of the summer, rather than by the
mean temperature of the year, we ought not to be surprised at its
descent in the Strait of Magellan, where the summer is so cool, to
only 3500 or 4000 feet above the level of the sea; although in
Norway, we must travel to between lat. 67&deg; and 70&deg; N., that
is, about 14&deg; nearer the pole, to meet with perpetual snow at
this low level. The difference in height, namely, about 9000 feet,
between the snow-line on the Cordillera behind Chiloe (with its
highest points ranging from<br>

<p>only 5600 to 7500 feet) and in central Chile<sup>1</sup> (a
distance of only 9&deg; of latitude), is truly wonderful. The land
from the southward of Chiloe to near Concepcion (lat. 37&deg;) is
hidden by one dense forest dripping with moisture. The sky is
cloudy, and we have seen how badly the fruits of southern Europe
succeed. In central Chile, on the other hand, a little northward of
Concepcion, the sky is generally clear, rain does not fall for the
seven summer months, and southern European fruits succeed
admirably; and even the sugar-cane has been cultivated.<sup>2</sup>
No doubt the plane of perpetual snow undergoes the above remarkable
flexure of 9000 feet, unparalleled in other parts of the world, not
far from the latitude of Concepcion, where the land ceases to be
covered with forest-trees; for trees in South America indicate a
rainy climate, and rain a clouded sky and little heat in
summer.</p>

<p>The descent of glaciers to the sea must, I conceive, mainly
depend (subject, of course, to a proper supply of snow in the upper
region) on the lowness of the line of perpetual snow on steep
mountains near the coast. As the snow-line is so low in Tierra del
Fuego, we might have expected that many of the glaciers would have
reached the sea. Nevertheless I was astonished when I first saw a
range, only from 3000 to 4000 feet in height, in the latitude of
Cumberland, with every valley filled with streams of ice descending
to the sea-coast. Almost every arm of the sea, which penetrates to
the interior higher chain, not only in Tierra del Fuego, but on the
coast for 650 miles northwards, is terminated by "tremendous and
astonishing glaciers," as described by one of the officers on the
survey. Great masses of ice frequently fall from these icy cliffs,
and the crash reverberates like the broadside of a man-of-war
through the lonely channels. These falls, as noticed in the last
chapter, produce great waves which break on the adjoining coasts.
It is known that earthquakes frequently cause masses of earth to
fall from sea-cliffs: how terrific, then, would be the</p>

<p class="fnote">1. On the Cordillera of central Chile, I believe
the snow-line varies exceedingly in height in different summers. I
was assured that during one very dry and long summer, all the snow
disappeared from Aconcagua, although it attains the prodigious
height of 23,000 feet. It is probable that much of the snow at
these great heights is evaporated, rather than thawed.<br>
2. Miers's <i>Chile</i>, vol. i, p. 415. It is said that the
sugar-cane grew at Ingenio, lat. 32&deg; to 33&deg;, but not in
sufficient quantity to make the manufacture profitable. In the
valley of Quillota, south of Ingenio, I saw some large date-palm
trees.</p>

<p>effect of a severe shock (and such occur here<sup>1</sup>) on a
body like a glacier, already in motion, and traversed by fissures!
I can readily believe that the water would be fairly beaten back
out of the deepest channel, and then, returning with an
overwhelming force, would whirl about huge masses of rock like so
much chaff. In Eyre's Sound, in the latitude of Paris, there are
immense glaciers, and yet the loftiest neighbouring mountain is
only 6200 feet high. In this Sound, about fifty icebergs were seen
at one time floating outwards, and one of them must have been <i>at
least</i> 168 feet in total height. Some of the icebergs were
loaded with blocks of no inconsiderable size, of granite and other
rocks, different from the clay-slate of the surrounding
mountains.</p>

<p>The glacier farthest from the Pole, surveyed during the voyages
of the <i>Adventure</i> and <i>Beagle</i>, is in lat. 46&deg; 50',
in the Gulf of Penas. It is 15 miles long, and in one part 7 broad,
and descends to the sea-coast. But even a few miles northward of
this glacier, in the Laguna de San Rafael, some Spanish
missionaries<sup>2</sup> encountered "many icebergs, some great,
some small, and others middle-sized," in a narrow arm of the sea,
on the 22nd of the month corresponding with our</p>

<p>June, and in a latitude corresponding with that of the Lake of
Geneva!</p>

<p>In Europe, the most southern glacier which comes down to the sea
is met with, according to Von Buch, on the coast of Norway, in lat.
67&deg;. Now, this is more than 20&deg; of latitude, or 1230 miles,
nearer the pole than the Laguna de San Rafael. The position of the
glaciers at this place and in the Gulf of Penas may be put even in
a more striking point of view, for they descend to the sea-coast
within 7&frac12;&deg; degrees of latitude, or 450 miles, of a
harbour, where three species of Oliva, a Voluta, and a Terebra, are
the commonest shells, within less than 9&deg; from where palms
grow, within 4&frac12;&deg; of a region where the jaguar and puma
range over the plains, less than 2&frac12;&deg; from arborescent
grasses, and (looking to the westward in the same hemisphere) less
than 2&deg; from orchideous parasites, and within a single degree
of tree-ferns!</p>

<p>These facts are of high geological interest with respect to the
climate of the northern hemisphere, at the period when boulders
were transported. I will not here detail how simply the theory of
icebergs being charged with fragments of rock explains the origin
and position of the gigantic boulders of eastern Tierra del Fuego,
on the high plain of Santa Cruz, and on the island of Chiloe. In
Tierra del Fuego the greater number of boulders lie on the lines of
old sea-channels, now converted into dry valleys by the elevation
of the land. They are associated with a great unstratified
formation of mud and sand, containing rounded and angular fragments
of all sizes, which has originated<sup>1</sup> in the repeated
ploughing up of the sea-bottom by the stranding of icebergs, and by
the matter transported on them. Few geologists now doubt that those
erratic boulders which lie near lofty mountains have been pushed
forward by the glaciers themselves, and that those distant from
mountains, and embedded in subaqueous deposits, have been conveyed
thither either on icebergs, or frozen in coast-ice. The connection
between the transportal of boulders and the presence of ice in some
form, is strikingly shown by their geographical distribution over
the earth. In South America they are not found farther than 48&deg;
of latitude, measured from the southern pole; in North America it
appears</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>that the limit of their transportal extends to 53&frac12;&deg;
from the northern pole; but in Europe to not more than 40&deg; of
latitude, measured from the same point. On the other hand, in the
intertropical parts of America, Asia, and Africa, they have never
been observed; nor at the Cape of Good Hope, nor in
Australia.<sup>1</sup></p>

<br>
<p><i>On the Climate and Productions of the Antarctic
Islands.</i>&mdash;Considering the rankness of the vegetation in
Tierra del Fuego, and on the coast northward of it, the condition
of the islands south and south-west of America is truly surprising.
Sandwich Land, in the latitude of the north part of Scotland, was
found by Cook, during the hottest month of the year, "covered many
fathoms thick with everlasting snow;" and there seems to be
scarcely any vegetation. Georgia, an island 96 miles long and 10
broad, in the latitude of Yorkshire, "in the very height of summer,
is in a manner wholly covered with frozen snow." It can boast only
of moss, some tufts of grass, and wild burnet; it has only one
land-bird (Anthus correndera), yet Iceland, which is 10&deg; nearer
the pole, has, according to Mackenzie, fifteen land-birds. The
South Shetland Islands, in the same latitude as the southern half
of Norway, possess only some lichens, moss, and a little grass; and
Lieut. Kendall<sup>2</sup> found the bay in which he was at anchor,
beginning to freeze at a period corresponding with our 8th of
September. The soil here consists of ice and volcanic ashes
interstratified; and at a little depth beneath the surface it must
remain perpetually congealed, for Lieut. Kendall found the body of
a foreign sailor which had long been buried, with the flesh and all
the features perfectly preserved. It is a singular fact that on the
two great continents in the northern hemisphere (but not in the
broken land of Europe between them) we have the zone of perpetually
frozen under-soil in a low latitude&mdash;namely, in 56 degrees in
North America at the depth of three feet,<sup>3</sup> and in
62&deg;</p>

<p class="fnote">1. I have given details (the first, I believe,
published) on this subject in the first edition, and in the
Appendix to it. I have there shown that the apparent exceptions to
the absence of erratic boulders in certain hot countries are due to
erroneous observations; several statements there given I have since
found confirmed by various authors.<br>

<p>in Siberia at the depth of twelve to fifteen feet&mdash;as the
result of a directly opposite condition of things to those of the
southern hemisphere. On the northern continents, the winter is
rendered excessively cold by the radiation from a large area of
land into a clear sky, nor is it moderated by the warmth-bringing
currents of the sea; the short summer, on the other hand, is hot.
In the Southern Ocean the winter is not so excessively cold, but
the summer is far less hot, for the clouded sky seldom allows the
sun to warm the ocean, itself a bad absorbent of heat: and hence
the mean temperature of the year, which regulates the zone of
perpetually congealed under-soil, is low. It is evident that a rank
vegetation, which does not so much require heat as it does
protection from intense cold, would approach much nearer to this
zone of perpetual congelation under the equable climate of the
southern hemisphere, than under the extreme climate of the northern
continents.</p>

<p>The case of the sailor's body perfectly preserved in the icy
soil of the South Shetland Islands (lat. 62&deg; to 63&deg; S.), in
a rather lower latitude than that (lat. 64&deg; N.) under which
Pallas found the frozen rhinoceros in Siberia, is very interesting.
Although it is a fallacy, as I have endeavoured to show in a former
chapter, to suppose that the larger quadrupeds require a luxuriant
vegetation for their support, nevertheless it is important to find
in the South Shetland Islands a frozen under-soil within 360 miles
of the forest-clad islands near Cape Horn, where, as far as the <i>
bulk</i> of vegetation is concerned, any number of great quadrupeds
might be supported. The perfect preservation of the carcasses of
the Siberian elephants and rhinoceroses is certainly one of the
most wonderful facts in geology; but independently of the imagined
difficulty of supplying them with food from the adjoining
countries, the whole case is not, I think, so perplexing as it has
generally been considered. The plains of Siberia, like those of the
Pampas, appear to have been formed under the sea, into which rivers
brought down the bodies of many animals; of the greater number of
these only the skeletons have been preserved, but of others the
perfect carcass. Now it is known that in the shallow sea on the
Arctic coast of America the bottom freezes,<sup>1</sup> and does
not thaw in spring so soon as the surface</p>

<p>of the land, moreover, at greater depths, where the bottom of
the sea does not freeze, the mud a few feet beneath the top layer
might remain even in summer below 32&deg;, as is the case on the
land with the soil at the depth of a few feet. At still greater
depths the temperature of the mud and water would probably not be
low enough to preserve the flesh; and hence, carcasses drifted
beyond the shallow parts near an arctic coast, would have only
their skeletons preserved: now in the extreme northern parts of
Siberia bones are infinitely numerous, so that even islets are said
to be almost composed of them;<sup>1</sup> and those islets lie no
less than ten degrees of latitude north of the place where Pallas
found the frozen rhinoceros. On the other hand, a carcass washed by
a flood into a shallow part of the Arctic Sea, would be preserved
for an indefinite period, if it were soon afterwards covered with
mud sufficiently thick to prevent the heat of the summer water
penetrating to it; and if, when the sea-bottom was upraised into
land, the covering was sufficiently thick to prevent the heat of
the summer air and sun thawing and corrupting it.</p>

<p><i>Recapitulation.</i>&mdash;I will recapitulate the principal
facts with regard to the climate, ice-action, and organic
productions of the southern hemisphere, transposing the places in
imagination to Europe, with which we are so much better acquainted.
Then, near Lisbon, the commonest sea-shells, namely, three species
of Oliva, a Voluta, and a Terebra, would have a tropical character.
In the southern provinces of France, magnificent forests, intwined
by arborescent grasses and with the trees loaded with parasitical
plants, would hide the face of the land. The puma and the jaguar
would haunt the Pyrenees. In the latitude of Mont Blanc, but on an
island as far westward as Central North America, tree-ferns and
parasitical Orchide&aelig; would thrive amidst the thick woods.
Even as far north as central Denmark humming-birds would be seen
fluttering about delicate flowers, and parrots feeding amidst the
evergreen woods; and in the sea there we should have a Voluta, and
all the shells of large size and vigorous growth. Nevertheless, on
some islands only 360 miles northward of our new Cape Horn in
Denmark, a carcass buried in the soil (or if washed into a shallow
sea, and covered up with mud) would be preserved perpetually
frozen. If some bold navigator attempted to penetrate northward of
these islands, he would run a thousand dangers amidst gigantic
icebergs, on some of which he would see great blocks of rock borne
far away from their original site. Another island of large size in
the latitude of southern Scotland, but twice as far to the west,
would be "almost wholly covered with everlasting snow," and would
have each bay terminated by ice-cliffs, whence great masses would
be yearly detached: this island would boast only of a little moss,
grass, and burnet, and a titlark would be its only land inhabitant.
From our new Cape Horn in Denmark, a chain of mountains, scarcely
half the height of the Alps, would run in a straight line due
southward; and on its western flank every deep creek of the sea, or
fiord, would end in "bold and astonishing glaciers." These lonely
channels would frequently reverberate with the falls of ice, and so
often would great waves rush along their coasts; numerous icebergs,
some as tall as cathedrals, and occasionally loaded with "no
inconsiderable blocks of rock," would be stranded on the outlying
islets; at intervals violent earthquakes would shoot prodigious
masses of ice into the waters below. Lastly, some missionaries</p>

<p>attempting to penetrate a long arm of the sea, would behold the
not lofty surrounding mountains, sending down their many grand icy
streams to the sea-coast, and their progress in the boats would be
checked by the innumerable floating icebergs, some small and some
great; and this would have occurred on our twenty-second of June,
and where the Lake of Geneva is now spread out!<sup>1</sup></p>

<p class="fnote">1. In the former edition and Appendix, I have
given some facts on the transportal of erratic boulders and
icebergs in the Antarctic Ocean. This subject has lately been
treated excellently by Mr. Hayes, in the <i>Boston Journal</i>
(vol. iv, p. 426). The author does not appear aware of a case
published by me (<i>Geographical Journal</i>, vol. ix, p. 528), of
a gigantic boulder embedded in an iceberg in the Antarctic Ocean,
almost certainly one hundred miles distant from any land, and
perhaps much more distant. In the Appendix I have discussed at
length the probability (at that time hardly thought of) of
icebergs, when stranded, grooving and polishing rocks, like
glaciers. This is now a very commonly received opinion; and I
cannot still avoid the suspicion that it is applicable even to such
cases as that of the Jura. Dr. Richardson has assured me that the
icebergs off North America push before them pebbles and sand, and
leave the submarine rocky flats quite bare; it is hardly possible
to doubt that such ledges must be polished and scored in the
direction of the set of the prevailing currents. Since writing that
Appendix I have seen in North Wales (<i>London Phil. Mag.</i> vol.
xxi, p. 180) the adjoining action of glaciers and floating
icebergs.</p>
