Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our books one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to send us error messages even years after
the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our sites at:

Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
can surf to them as follows, and just download by date; this is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release fifty new Etext
files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 3000+
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding.

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.

disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etexts,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and

below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

                         THE AMERICAN CRISIS.

                          EDITOR'S PREFACE.

THOMAS PAINE, in his Will, speaks of this work as The American
Crisis, remembering perhaps that a number of political pamphlets had
appeared in London, 1775-1776, under general title of " The Crisis."
By the blunder of an early English publisher of Paine's writings, one
essay in the London " Crisis " was attributed to Paine, and the error
has continued to cause confusion. This publisher was D. I. Eaton, who
printed as the first number of Paine's " Crisis " an essay taken from
the London publication. But his prefatory note says: " Since the
printing of this book, the publisher is informed that No. 1, or first
Crisis in this publication, is not one of the thirteen which Paine
wrote, but a letter previous to them." Unfortunately this correction
is sufficiently equivocal to leave on some minds the notion that
Paine did write the letter in question, albeit not as a number of his
" Crisis " ; especially as Eaton's editor unwarrantably appended the
signature " C. S.," suggesting " Common Sense." There are, however,
no such letters in the London essay, which is signed " Casca." It was
published August , 1775, in the form of a letter to General Gage, in
answer to his Proclamation concerning the affair at Lexington. It was
certainly not written by Paine. It apologizes for the Americans for
having, on April I9, at Lexington, made " an attack upon the King's
troops from behind walls and lurking holes." The writer asks : " Have
not the Americans been driven to this frenzy? Is it not common for an
enemy to take every advantage ? " Paine, who was in America when the
affair occurred at Lexington, would have promptly denounced Gage's
story as a falsehood, but the facts known to every one in America
were as yet not before the London writer. The English " Crisis "
bears evidence throughout of having been written in London. It
derived nothing from Paine, and he derived nothing from it, unless
its title, and this is too obvious for its origin to require
discussion. I have no doubt, however, that the title was suggested by
the English publication, because Paine has followed its scheme in
introducing a " Crisis Extraordinary." His work consists of thirteen
numbers, and, in addition to these, a " Crisis Extraordinary "and a "
Supernumerary Crisis." In some modern collections all of these have
been serially numbered, and a brief newspaper article added, making
sixteen numbers. But Paine, in his Will, speaks of the number as
thirteen, wishing perhaps, in his characteristic way, to adhere to
the number of the American Colonies, as he did in the thirteen ribs
of his iron bridge. His enumeration is therefore followed in the
present volume, and the numbers printed successively, although other
writings intervened.

The first " Crisis " was printed in the Pennsylvania Journal,
December 19, 1776, and opens with the famous sentence, " These are
the times that try men's souls"; the last " Crisis "appeared April
19,1783, (eighth anniversary of the first gun of the war, at
Lexington,) and opens with the words, " The times that tried men's
souls are over." The great effect produced by Paine's successive
publications has been attested by Washington and Franklin, by every
leader of the American Revolution, by resolutions of Congress, and by
every contemporary historian of the events amid which they were
written. The first " Crisis " is of especial historical interest. It
was written during the retreat of Washington across the Delaware, and
by order of the Commander was read to groups of his dispirited and
suffering soldiers. Its opening sentence was adopted as the watchword
of the movement on Trenton, a few days after its publication, and is
believed to have inspired much of the courage which won that victory,
which, though not imposing in extent, was of great moral effect on
Washington's little army.



                             THE CRISIS

                                   I.

THESE are the times that try men's souls. The summer soldier and the
sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of
their country; but he that stands it now, deserves the love and
thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered;
yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict,
the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too cheap, we esteem
too lightly: it is dearness only that gives every thing its value.
Heaven knows how to put a proper price upon its goods; and it would
be strange indeed if so celestial an article as FREEDOM should not be
highly rated. Britain, with an army to enforce her tyranny, has
declared that she has a right (not only to TAX) but "to BIND us in
ALL CASES WHATSOEVER," and if being bound in that manner, is not
slavery, then is there not such a thing as slavery upon earth. Even
the expression is impious; for so unlimited a power can belong only
to God.

Whether the independence of the continent was declared too soon, or
delayed too long, I will not now enter into as an argument; my own
simple opinion is, that had it been eight months earlier, it would
have been much better. We did not make a proper use of last winter,
neither could we, while we were in a dependent state. However, the
fault, if it were one, was all our own*; we have none to blame but
ourselves. But no great deal is lost yet. All that Howe has been
doing for this month past, is rather a ravage than a conquest, which
the spirit of the Jerseys, a year ago, would have quickly repulsed,
and which time and a little resolution will soon recover.

* The present winter is worth an age, if rightly employed; but, if
lost or neglected, the whole continent will partake of the evil; and
there is no punishment that man does not deserve, be he who, or what,
or where he will, that may be the means of sacrificing a season so
precious and useful.

I have as little superstition in me as any man living, but my secret
opinion has ever been, and still is, that God Almighty will not give
up a people to military destruction, or leave them unsupportedly to
perish, who have so earnestly and so repeatedly sought to avoid the
calamities of war, by every decent method which wisdom could invent.
Neither have I so much of the infidel in me, as to suppose that He
has relinquished the government of the world, and given us up to the
care of devils; and as I do not, I cannot see on what grounds the
king of Britain can look up to heaven for help against us: a common
murderer, a highwayman, or a house-breaker, has as good a pretence as
he.

'Tis surprising to see how rapidly a panic will sometimes run through
a country. All nations and ages have been subject to them. Britain
has trembled like an ague at the report of a French fleet of
flat-bottomed boats; and in the fourteenth [fifteenth] century the
whole English army, after ravaging the kingdom of France, was driven
back like men petrified with fear; and this brave exploit was
performed by a few broken forces collected and headed by a woman,
Joan of Arc. Would that heaven might inspire some Jersey maid to
spirit up her countrymen, and save her fair fellow sufferers from
ravage and ravishment! Yet panics, in some cases, have their uses;
they produce as much good as hurt. Their duration is always short;
the mind soon grows through them, and acquires a firmer habit than
before. But their peculiar advantage is, that they are the
touchstones of sincerity and hypocrisy, and bring things and men to
light, which might otherwise have lain forever undiscovered. In fact,
they have the same effect on secret traitors, which an imaginary
apparition would have upon a private murderer. They sift out the
hidden thoughts of man, and hold them up in public to the world. Many
a disguised Tory has lately shown his head, that shall penitentially
solemnize with curses the day on which Howe arrived upon the Delaware.

As I was with the troops at Fort Lee, and marched with them to the
edge of Pennsylvania, I am well acquainted with many circumstances,
which those who live at a distance know but little or nothing of. Our
situation there was exceedingly cramped, the place being a narrow
neck of land between the North River and the Hackensack. Our force
was inconsiderable, being not one-fourth so great as Howe could bring
against us. We had no army at hand to have relieved the garrison, had
we shut ourselves up and stood on our defence. Our ammunition, light
artillery, and the best part of our stores, had been removed, on the
apprehension that Howe would endeavor to penetrate the Jerseys, in
which case Fort Lee could be of no use to us; for it must occur to
every thinking man, whether in the army or not, that these kind of
field forts are only for temporary purposes, and last in use no
longer than the enemy directs his force against the particular object
which such forts are raised to defend. Such was our situation and
condition at Fort Lee on the morning of the 20th of November, when an
officer arrived with information that the enemy with 200 boats had
landed about seven miles above; Major General [Nathaniel] Green, who
commanded the garrison, immediately ordered them under arms, and sent
express to General Washington at the town of Hackensack, distant by
the way of the ferry = six miles. Our first object was to secure the
bridge over the Hackensack, which laid up the river between the enemy
and us, about six miles from us, and three from them. General
Washington arrived in about three-quarters of an hour, and marched at
the head of the troops towards the bridge, which place I expected we
should have a brush for; however, they did not choose to dispute it
with us, and the greatest part of our troops went over the bridge,
the rest over the ferry, except some which passed at a mill on a
small creek, between the bridge and the ferry, and made their way
through some marshy grounds up to the town of Hackensack, and there
passed the river. We brought off as much baggage as the wagons could
contain, the rest was lost. The simple object was to bring off the
garrison, and march them on till they could be strengthened by the
Jersey or Pennsylvania militia, so as to be enabled to make a stand.
We staid four days at Newark, collected our out-posts with some of
the Jersey militia, and marched out twice to meet the enemy, on being
informed that they were advancing, though our numbers were greatly
inferior to theirs. Howe, in my little opinion, committed a great
error in generalship in not throwing a body of forces off from Staten
Island through Amboy, by which means he might have seized all our
stores at Brunswick, and intercepted our march into Pennsylvania; but
if we believe the power of hell to be limited, we must likewise
believe that their agents are under some providential control.

I shall not now attempt to give all the particulars of our retreat to
the Delaware; suffice it for the present to say, that both officers
and men, though greatly harassed and fatigued, frequently without
rest, covering, or provision, the inevitable consequences of a long
retreat, bore it with a manly and martial spirit. All their wishes
centred in one, which was, that the country would turn out and help
them to drive the enemy back. Voltaire has remarked that King William
never appeared to full advantage but in difficulties and in action;
the same remark may be made on General Washington, for the character
fits him. There is a natural firmness in some minds which cannot be
unlocked by trifles, but which, when unlocked, discovers a cabinet of
fortitude; and I reckon it among those kind of public blessings,
which we do not immediately see, that God hath blessed him with
uninterrupted health, and given him a mind that can even flourish
upon care.

I shall conclude this paper with some miscellaneous remarks on the
state of our affairs; and shall begin with asking the following
question, Why is it that the enemy have left the New England
provinces, and made these middle ones the seat of war? The answer is
easy: New England is not infested with Tories, and we are. I have
been tender in raising the cry against these men, and used numberless
arguments to show them their danger, but it will not do to sacrifice
a world either to their folly or their baseness. The period is now
arrived, in which either they or we must change our sentiments, or
one or both must fall. And what is a Tory? Good God! what is he? I
should not be afraid to go with a hundred Whigs against a thousand
Tories, were they to attempt to get into arms. Every Tory is a
coward; for servile, slavish, self-interested fear is the foundation
of Toryism; and a man under such influence, though he may be cruel,
never can be brave.

But, before the line of irrecoverable separation be drawn between us,
let us reason the matter together: Your conduct is an invitation to
the enemy, yet not one in a thousand of you has heart enough to join
him. Howe is as much deceived by you as the American cause is injured
by you. He expects you will all take up arms, and flock to his
standard, with muskets on your shoulders. Your opinions are of no use
to him, unless you support him personally, for 'tis soldiers, and not
Tories, that he wants.

I once felt all that kind of anger, which a man ought to feel,
against the mean principles that are held by the Tories: a noted one,
who kept a tavern at Amboy, was standing at his door, with as pretty
a child in his hand, about eight or nine years old, as I ever saw,
and after speaking his mind as freely as he thought was prudent,
finished with this unfatherly expression, "Well! give me peace in my
day." Not a man lives on the continent but fully believes that a
separation must some time or other finally take place, and a generous
parent should have said, "If there must be trouble, let it be in my
day, that my child may have peace;" and this single reflection, well
applied, is sufficient to awaken every man to duty. Not a place upon
earth might be so happy as America. Her situation is remote from all
the wrangling world, and she has nothing to do but to trade with
them. A man can distinguish himself between temper and principle, and
I am as confident, as I am that God governs the world, that America
will never be happy till she gets clear of foreign dominion. Wars,
without ceasing, will break out till that period arrives, and the
continent must in the end be conqueror; for though the flame of
liberty may sometimes cease to shine, the coal can never expire.

America did not, nor does not want force; but she wanted a proper
application of that force. Wisdom is not the purchase of a day, and
it is no wonder that we should err at the first setting off. From an
excess of tenderness, we were unwilling to raise an army, and trusted
our cause to the temporary defence of a well-meaning militia. A
summer's experience has now taught us better; yet with those troops,
while they were collected, we were able to set bounds to the progress
of the enemy, and, thank God! they are again assembling. I always
considered militia as the best troops in the world for a sudden
exertion, but they will not do for a long campaign. Howe, it is
probable, will make an attempt on this city [Philadelphia]; should he
fail on this side the Delaware, he is ruined. If he succeeds, our
cause is not ruined. He stakes all on his side against a part on
ours; admitting he succeeds, the consequence will be, that armies
from both ends of the continent will march to assist their suffering
friends in the middle states; for he cannot go everywhere, it is
impossible. I consider Howe as the greatest enemy the Tories have; he
is bringing a war into their country, which, had it not been for him
and partly for themselves, they had been clear of. Should he now be
expelled, I wish with all the devotion of a Christian, that the names
of Whig and Tory may never more be mentioned; but should the Tories
give him encouragement to come, or assistance if he come, I as
sincerely wish that our next year's arms may expel them from the
continent, and the Congress appropriate their possessions to the
relief of those who have suffered in well-doing. A single successful
battle next year will settle the whole. America could carry on a two
years' war by the confiscation of the property of disaffected
persons, and be made happy by their expulsion. Say not that this is
revenge, call it rather the soft resentment of a suffering people,
who, having no object in view but the good of all, have staked their
own all upon a seemingly doubtful event. Yet it is folly to argue
against determined hardness; eloquence may strike the ear, and the
language of sorrow draw forth the tear of compassion, but nothing can
reach the heart that is steeled with prejudice.

Quitting this class of men, I turn with the warm ardor of a friend to
those who have nobly stood, and are yet determined to stand the
matter out: I call not upon a few, but upon all: not on this state or
that state, but on every state: up and help us; lay your shoulders to
the wheel; better have too much force than too little, when so great
an object is at stake. Let it be told to the future world, that in
the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive,
that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came
forth to meet and to repulse it. Say not that thousands are gone,
turn out your tens of thousands; throw not the burden of the day upon
Providence, but "show your faith by your works," that God may bless
you. It matters not where you live, or what rank of life you hold,
the evil or the blessing will reach you all. The far and the near,
the home counties and the back, the rich and the poor, will suffer or
rejoice alike. The heart that feels not now is dead; the blood of his
children will curse his cowardice, who shrinks back at a time when a
little might have saved the whole, and made them happy. I love the
man that can smile in trouble, that can gather strength from
distress, and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the business of little
minds to shrink; but he whose heart is firm, and whose conscience
approves his conduct, will pursue his principles unto death. My own
line of reasoning is to myself as straight and clear as a ray of
light. Not all the treasures of the world, so far as I believe, could
have induced me to support an offensive war, for I think it murder;
but if a thief breaks into my house, burns and destroys my property,
and kills or threatens to kill me, or those that are in it, and to
"bind me in all cases whatsoever" to his absolute will, am I to
suffer it? What signifies it to me, whether he who does it is a king
or a common man; my countryman or not my countryman; whether it be
done by an individual villain, or an army of them? If we reason to
the root of things we shall find no difference; neither can any just
cause be assigned why we should punish in the one case and pardon in
the other. Let them call me rebel and welcome, I feel no concern from
it; but I should suffer the misery of devils, were I to make a whore
of my soul by swearing allegiance to one whose character is that of a
sottish, stupid, stubborn, worthless, brutish man. I conceive
likewise a horrid idea in receiving mercy from a being, who at the
last day shall be shrieking to the rocks and mountains to cover him,
and fleeing with terror from the orphan, the widow, and the slain of
America.

There are cases which cannot be overdone by language, and this is
one. There are persons, too, who see not the full extent of the evil
which threatens them; they solace themselves with hopes that the
enemy, if he succeed, will be merciful. It is the madness of folly,
to expect mercy from those who have refused to do justice; and even
mercy, where conquest is the object, is only a trick of war; the
cunning of the fox is as murderous as the violence of the wolf, and
we ought to guard equally against both. Howe's first object is,
partly by threats and partly by promises, to terrify or seduce the
people to deliver up their arms and receive mercy. The ministry
recommended the same plan to Gage, and this is what the tories call
making their peace, "a peace which passeth all understanding" indeed!
A peace which would be the immediate forerunner of a worse ruin than
any we have yet thought of. Ye men of Pennsylvania, do reason upon
these things! Were the back counties to give up their arms, they
would fall an easy prey to the Indians, who are all armed: this
perhaps is what some Tories would not be sorry for. Were the home
counties to deliver up their arms, they would be exposed to the
resentment of the back counties who would then have it in their power
to chastise their defection at pleasure. And were any one state to
give up its arms, that state must be garrisoned by all Howe's army of
Britons and Hessians to preserve it from the anger of the rest.
Mutual fear is the principal link in the chain of mutual love, and
woe be to that state that breaks the compact. Howe is mercifully
inviting you to barbarous destruction, and men must be either rogues
or fools that will not see it. I dwell not upon the vapors of
imagination; I bring reason to your ears, and, in language as plain
as A, B, C, hold up truth to your eyes.

I thank God, that I fear not. I see no real cause for fear. I know
our situation well, and can see the way out of it. While our army was
collected, Howe dared not risk a battle; and it is no credit to him
that he decamped from the White Plains, and waited a mean opportunity
to ravage the defenceless Jerseys; but it is great credit to us,
that, with a handful of men, we sustained an orderly retreat for near
an hundred miles, brought off our ammunition, all our field pieces,
the greatest part of our stores, and had four rivers to pass. None
can say that our retreat was precipitate, for we were near three
weeks in performing it, that the country might have time to come in.
Twice we marched back to meet the enemy, and remained out till dark.
The sign of fear was not seen in our camp, and had not some of the
cowardly and disaffected inhabitants spread false alarms through the
country, the Jerseys had never been ravaged. Once more we are again
collected and collecting; our new army at both ends of the continent
is recruiting fast, and we shall be able to open the next campaign
with sixty thousand men, well armed and clothed. This is our
situation, and who will may know it. By perseverance and fortitude we
have the prospect of a glorious issue; by cowardice and submission,
the sad choice of a variety of evils- a ravaged country- a
depopulated city- habitations without safety, and slavery without
hope- our homes turned into barracks and bawdy-houses for Hessians,
and a future race to provide for, whose fathers we shall doubt of.
Look on this picture and weep over it! and if there yet remains one
thoughtless wretch who believes it not, let him suffer it unlamented.

COMMON SENSE.

December 23, 1776.

                           The Crisis 

                                  II.

                            TO LORD HOWE.

            "What's in the name of lord, that I should fear
              To bring my grievance to the public ear?"
                                              CHURCHILL.

UNIVERSAL empire is the prerogative of a writer. His concerns are
with all mankind, and though he cannot command their obedience, he
can assign them their duty. The Republic of Letters is more ancient
than monarchy, and of far higher character in the world than the
vassal court of Britain; he that rebels against reason is a real
rebel, but he that in defence of reason rebels against tyranny has a
better title to "Defender of the Faith," than George the Third.

As a military man your lordship may hold out the sword of war, and
call it the "ultima ratio regum": the last reason of kings; we in
return can show you the sword of justice, and call it "the best
scourge of tyrants." The first of these two may threaten, or even
frighten for a while, and cast a sickly languor over an insulted
people, but reason will soon recover the debauch, and restore them
again to tranquil fortitude. Your lordship, I find, has now commenced
author, and published a proclamation; I have published a Crisis. As
they stand, they are the antipodes of each other; both cannot rise at
once, and one of them must descend; and so quick is the revolution of
things, that your lordship's performance, I see, has already fallen
many degrees from its first place, and is now just visible on the
edge of the political horizon.

It is surprising to what a pitch of infatuation, blind folly and
obstinacy will carry mankind, and your lordship's drowsy proclamation
is a proof that it does not even quit them in their sleep. Perhaps
you thought America too was taking a nap, and therefore chose, like
Satan to Eve, to whisper the delusion softly, lest you should awaken
her. This continent, sir, is too extensive to sleep all at once, and
too watchful, even in its slumbers, not to startle at the unhallowed
foot of an invader. You may issue your proclamations, and welcome,
for we have learned to "reverence ourselves," and scorn the insulting
ruffian that employs you. America, for your deceased brother's sake,
would gladly have shown you respect and it is a new aggravation to
her feelings, that Howe should be forgetful, and raise his sword
against those, who at their own charge raised a monument to his
brother. But your master has commanded, and you have not enough of
nature left to refuse. Surely there must be something strangely
degenerating in the love of monarchy, that can so completely wear a
man down to an ingrate, and make him proud to lick the dust that
kings have trod upon. A few more years, should you survive them, will
bestow on you the title of "an old man": and in some hour of future
reflection you may probably find the fitness of Wolsey's despairing
penitence- "had I served my God as faithful as I have served my king,
he would not thus have forsaken me in my old age."

The character you appear to us in, is truly ridiculous. Your friends,
the Tories, announced your coming, with high descriptions of your
unlimited powers; but your proclamation has given them the lie, by
showing you to be a commissioner without authority. Had your powers
been ever so great they were nothing to us, further than we pleased;
because we had the same right which other nations had, to do what we
thought was best. "The UNITED STATES of AMERICA," will sound as
pompously in the world or in history, as "the kingdom of Great
Britain"; the character of General Washington will fill a page with
as much lustre as that of Lord Howe: and the Congress have as much
right to command the king and Parliament in London to desist from
legislation, as they or you have to command the Congress. Only
suppose how laughable such an edict would appear from us, and then,
in that merry mood, do but turn the tables upon yourself, and you
will see how your proclamation is received here. Having thus placed
you in a proper position in which you may have a full view of your
folly, and learn to despise it, I hold up to you, for that purpose,
the following quotation from your own lunarian proclamation.- "And we
(Lord Howe and General Howe) do command (and in his majesty's name
forsooth) all such persons as are assembled together, under the name
of general or provincial congresses, committees, conventions or other
associations, by whatever name or names known and distinguished, to
desist and cease from all such treasonable actings and doings."

You introduce your proclamation by referring to your declarations of
the 14th of July and 19th of September. In the last of these you sunk
yourself below the character of a private gentleman. That I may not
seem to accuse you unjustly, I shall state the circumstance: by a
verbal invitation of yours, communicated to Congress by General
Sullivan, then a prisoner on his parole, you signified your desire of
conferring with some members of that body as private gentlemen. It
was beneath the dignity of the American Congress to pay any regard to
a message that at best was but a genteel affront, and had too much of
the ministerial complexion of tampering with private persons; and
which might probably have been the case, had the gentlemen who were
deputed on the business possessed that kind of easy virtue which an
English courtier is so truly distinguished by. Your request, however,
was complied with, for honest men are naturally more tender of their
civil than their political fame. The interview ended as every
sensible man thought it would; for your lordship knows, as well as
the writer of the Crisis, that it is impossible for the King of
England to promise the repeal, or even the revisal of any acts of
parliament; wherefore, on your part, you had nothing to say, more
than to request, in the room of demanding, the entire surrender of
the continent; and then, if that was complied with, to promise that
the inhabitants should escape with their lives. This was the upshot
of the conference. You informed the conferees that you were two
months in soliciting these powers. We ask, what powers? for as
commissioner you have none. If you mean the power of pardoning, it is
an oblique proof that your master was determined to sacrifice all
before him; and that you were two months in dissuading him from his
purpose. Another evidence of his savage obstinacy! From your own
account of the matter we may justly draw these two conclusions: 1st,
That you serve a monster; and 2d, That never was a messenger sent on
a more foolish errand than yourself. This plain language may perhaps
sound uncouthly to an ear vitiated by courtly refinements, but words
were made for use, and the fault lies in deserving them, or the abuse
in applying them unfairly.

Soon after your return to New York, you published a very illiberal
and unmanly handbill against the Congress; for it was certainly
stepping out of the line of common civility, first to screen your
national pride by soliciting an interview with them as private
gentlemen, and in the conclusion to endeavor to deceive the multitude
by making a handbill attack on the whole body of the Congress; you
got them together under one name, and abused them under another. But
the king you serve, and the cause you support, afford you so few
instances of acting the gentleman, that out of pity to your situation
the Congress pardoned the insult by taking no notice of it.

You say in that handbill, "that they, the Congress, disavowed every
purpose for reconciliation not consonant with their extravagant and
inadmissible claim of independence." Why, God bless me! what have you
to do with our independence? We ask no leave of yours to set it up;
we ask no money of yours to support it; we can do better without your
fleets and armies than with them; you may soon have enough to do to
protect yourselves without being burdened with us. We are very
willing to be at peace with you, to buy of you and sell to you, and,
like young beginners in the world, to work for our living; therefore,
why do you put yourselves out of cash, when we know you cannot spare
it, and we do not desire you to run into debt? I am willing, sir,
that you should see your folly in every point of view I can place it
in, and for that reason descend sometimes to tell you in jest what I
wish you to see in earnest. But to be more serious with you, why do
you say, "their independence?" To set you right, sir, we tell you,
that the independency is ours, not theirs. The Congress were
authorized by every state on the continent to publish it to all the
world, and in so doing are not to be considered as the inventors, but
only as the heralds that proclaimed it, or the office from which the
sense of the people received a legal form; and it was as much as any
or all their heads were worth, to have treated with you on the
subject of submission under any name whatever. But we know the men in
whom we have trusted; can England say the same of her Parliament?

I come now more particularly to your proclamation of the 30th of
November last. Had you gained an entire conquest over all the armies
of America, and then put forth a proclamation, offering (what you
call) mercy, your conduct would have had some specious show of
humanity; but to creep by surprise into a province, and there
endeavor to terrify and seduce the inhabitants from their just
allegiance to the rest by promises, which you neither meant nor were
able to fulfil, is both cruel and unmanly: cruel in its effects;
because, unless you can keep all the ground you have marched over,
how are you, in the words of your proclamation, to secure to your
proselytes "the enjoyment of their property?" What is to become
either of your new adopted subjects, or your old friends, the Tories,
in Burlington, Bordentown, Trenton, Mount Holly, and many other
places, where you proudly lorded it for a few days, and then fled
with the precipitation of a pursued thief? What, I say, is to become
of those wretches? What is to become of those who went over to you
from this city and State? What more can you say to them than "shift
for yourselves?" Or what more can they hope for than to wander like
vagabonds over the face of the earth? You may now tell them to take
their leave of America, and all that once was theirs. Recommend them,
for consolation, to your master's court; there perhaps they may make
a shift to live on the scraps of some dangling parasite, and choose
companions among thousands like themselves. A traitor is the foulest
fiend on earth.

In a political sense we ought to thank you for thus bequeathing
estates to the continent; we shall soon, at this rate, be able to
carry on a war without expense, and grow rich by the ill policy of
Lord Howe, and the generous defection of the Tories. Had you set your
foot into this city, you would have bestowed estates upon us which we
never thought of, by bringing forth traitors we were unwilling to
suspect. But these men, you'll say, "are his majesty's most faithful
subjects;" let that honor, then, be all their fortune, and let his
majesty take them to himself.

I am now thoroughly disgusted with them; they live in ungrateful
ease, and bend their whole minds to mischief. It seems as if God had
given them over to a spirit of infidelity, and that they are open to
conviction in no other line but that of punishment. It is time to
have done with tarring, feathering, carting, and taking securities
for their future good behavior; every sensible man must feel a
conscious shame at seeing a poor fellow hawked for a show about the
streets, when it is known he is only the tool of some principal
villain, biassed into his offence by the force of false reasoning, or
bribed thereto, through sad necessity. We dishonor ourselves by
attacking such trifling characters while greater ones are suffered to
escape; 'tis our duty to find them out, and their proper punishment
would be to exile them from the continent for ever. The circle of
them is not so great as some imagine; the influence of a few have
tainted many who are not naturally corrupt. A continual circulation
of lies among those who are not much in the way of hearing them
contradicted, will in time pass for truth; and the crime lies not in
the believer but the inventor. I am not for declaring war with every
man that appears not so warm as myself: difference of constitution,
temper, habit of speaking, and many other things, will go a great way
in fixing the outward character of a man, yet simple honesty may
remain at bottom. Some men have naturally a military turn, and can
brave hardships and the risk of life with a cheerful face; others
have not; no slavery appears to them so great as the fatigue of arms,
and no terror so powerful as that of personal danger. What can we
say? We cannot alter nature, neither ought we to punish the son
because the father begot him in a cowardly mood. However, I believe
most men have more courage than they know of, and that a little at
first is enough to begin with. I knew the time when I thought that
the whistling of a cannon ball would have frightened me almost to
death; but I have since tried it, and find that I can stand it with
as little discomposure, and, I believe, with a much easier conscience
than your lordship. The same dread would return to me again were I in
your situation, for my solemn belief of your cause is, that it is
hellish and damnable, and, under that conviction, every thinking
man's heart must fail him.

From a concern that a good cause should be dishonored by the least
disunion among us, I said in my former paper, No. I. "That should the
enemy now be expelled, I wish, with all the sincerity of a Christian,
that the names of Whig and Tory might never more be mentioned;" but
there is a knot of men among us of such a venomous cast, that they
will not admit even one's good wishes to act in their favor. Instead
of rejoicing that heaven had, as it were, providentially preserved
this city from plunder and destruction, by delivering so great a part
of the enemy into our hands with so little effusion of blood, they
stubbornly affected to disbelieve it till within an hour, nay, half
an hour, of the prisoners arriving; and the Quakers put forth a
testimony, dated the 20th of December, signed "John Pemberton,"
declaring their attachment to the British government.* These men are
continually harping on the great sin of our bearing arms, but the
king of Britain may lay waste the world in blood and famine, and
they, poor fallen souls, have nothing to say.

* I have ever been careful of charging offences upon whole societies
of men, but as the paper referred to is put forth by an unknown set
of men, who claim to themselves the right of representing the whole:
and while the whole Society of Quakers admit its validity by a silent
acknowledgment, it is impossible that any distinction can be made by
the public: and the more so, because the New York paper of the 30th
of December, printed by permission of our enemies, says that "the
Quakers begin to speak openly of their attachment to the British
Constitution." We are certain that we have many friends among them,
and wish to know them.

In some future paper I intend to distinguish between the different
kind of persons who have been denominated Tories; for this I am clear
in, that all are not so who have been called so, nor all men Whigs
who were once thought so; and as I mean not to conceal the name of
any true friend when there shall be occasion to mention him, neither
will I that of an enemy, who ought to be known, let his rank, station
or religion be what it may. Much pains have been taken by some to set
your lordship's private character in an amiable light, but as it has
chiefly been done by men who know nothing about you, and who are no
ways remarkable for their attachment to us, we have no just authority
for believing it. George the Third has imposed upon us by the same
arts, but time, at length, has done him justice, and the same fate
may probably attend your lordship. You avowed purpose here is to
kill, conquer, plunder, pardon, and enslave: and the ravages of your
army through the Jerseys have been marked with as much barbarism as
if you had openly professed yourself the prince of ruffians; not even
the appearance of humanity has been preserved either on the march or
the retreat of your troops; no general order that I could ever learn,
has ever been issued to prevent or even forbid your troops from
robbery, wherever they came, and the only instance of justice, if it
can be called such, which has distinguished you for impartiality, is,
that you treated and plundered all alike; what could not be carried
away has been destroyed, and mahogany furniture has been deliberately
laid on fire for fuel, rather than the men should be fatigued with
cutting wood.* There was a time when the Whigs confided much in your
supposed candor, and the Tories rested themselves in your favor; the
experiments have now been made, and failed; in every town, nay, every
cottage, in the Jerseys, where your arms have been, is a testimony
against you. How you may rest under this sacrifice of character I
know not; but this I know, that you sleep and rise with the daily
curses of thousands upon you; perhaps the misery which the Tories
have suffered by your proffered mercy may give them some claim to
their country's pity, and be in the end the best favor you could show
them.

* As some people may doubt the truth of such wanton destruction, I
think it necessary to inform them that one of the people called
Quakers, who lives at Trenton, gave me this information at the house
of Mr. Michael Hutchinson, (one of the same profession,) who lives
near Trenton ferry on the Pennsylvania side, Mr. Hutchinson being
present.

In a folio general-order book belonging to Col. Rhal's battalion,
taken at Trenton, and now in the possession of the council of safety
for this state, the following barbarous order is frequently repeated,
"His excellency the Commander-in-Chief orders, that all inhabitants
who shall be found with arms, not having an officer with them, shall
be immediately taken and hung up." How many you may thus have
privately sacrificed, we know not, and the account can only be
settled in another world. Your treatment of prisoners, in order to
distress them to enlist in your infernal service, is not to be
equalled by any instance in Europe. Yet this is the humane Lord Howe
and his brother, whom the Tories and their three-quarter kindred, the
Quakers, or some of them at least, have been holding up for patterns
of justice and mercy!

A bad cause will ever be supported by bad means and bad men; and
whoever will be at the pains of examining strictly into things, will
find that one and the same spirit of oppression and impiety, more or
less, governs through your whole party in both countries: not many
days ago, I accidentally fell in company with a person of this city
noted for espousing your cause, and on my remarking to him, "that it
appeared clear to me, by the late providential turn of affairs, that
God Almighty was visibly on our side," he replied, "We care nothing
for that you may have Him, and welcome; if we have but enough of the
devil on our side, we shall do." However carelessly this might be
spoken, matters not, 'tis still the insensible principle that directs
all your conduct and will at last most assuredly deceive and ruin you.

If ever a nation was made and foolish, blind to its own interest and
bent on its own destruction, it is Britain. There are such things as
national sins, and though the punishment of individuals may be
reserved to another world, national punishment can only be inflicted
in this world. Britain, as a nation, is, in my inmost belief, the
greatest and most ungrateful offender against God on the face of the
whole earth. Blessed with all the commerce she could wish for, and
furnished, by a vast extension of dominion, with the means of
civilizing both the eastern and western world, she has made no other
use of both than proudly to idolize her own "thunder," and rip up the
bowels of whole countries for what she could get. Like Alexander, she
has made war her sport, and inflicted misery for prodigality's sake.
The blood of India is not yet repaid, nor the wretchedness of Africa
yet requited. Of late she has enlarged her list of national cruelties
by her butcherly destruction of the Caribbs of St. Vincent's, and
returning an answer by the sword to the meek prayer for "Peace,
liberty and safety." These are serious things, and whatever a foolish
tyrant, a debauched court, a trafficking legislature, or a blinded
people may think, the national account with heaven must some day or
other be settled: all countries have sooner or later been called to
their reckoning; the proudest empires have sunk when the balance was
struck; and Britain, like an individual penitent, must undergo her
day of sorrow, and the sooner it happens to her the better. As I wish
it over, I wish it to come, but withal wish that it may be as light
as possible.

Perhaps your lordship has no taste for serious things; by your
connections in England I should suppose not; therefore I shall drop
this part of the subject, and take it up in a line in which you will
better understand me.

By what means, may I ask, do you expect to conquer America? If you
could not effect it in the summer, when our army was less than yours,
nor in the winter, when we had none, how are you to do it? In point
of generalship you have been outwitted, and in point of fortitude
outdone; your advantages turn out to your loss, and show us that it
is in our power to ruin you by gifts: like a game of drafts, we can
move out of one square to let you come in, in order that we may
afterwards take two or three for one; and as we can always keep a
double corner for ourselves, we can always prevent a total defeat.
You cannot be so insensible as not to see that we have two to one the
advantage of you, because we conquer by a drawn game, and you lose by
it. Burgoyne might have taught your lordship this knowledge; he has
been long a student in the doctrine of chances.

I have no other idea of conquering countries than by subduing the
armies which defend them: have you done this, or can you do it? If
you have not, it would be civil in you to let your proclamations
alone for the present; otherwise, you will ruin more Tories by your
grace and favor, than you will Whigs by your arms.

Were you to obtain possession of this city, you would not know what
to do with it more than to plunder it. To hold it in the manner you
hold New York, would be an additional dead weight upon your hands;
and if a general conquest is your object, you had better be without
the city than with it. When you have defeated all our armies, the
cities will fall into your hands of themselves; but to creep into
them in the manner you got into Princeton, Trenton, &c. is like
robbing an orchard in the night before the fruit be ripe, and running
away in the morning. Your experiment in the Jerseys is sufficient to
teach you that you have something more to do than barely to get into
other people's houses; and your new converts, to whom you promised
all manner of protection, and seduced into new guilt by pardoning
them from their former virtues, must begin to have a very
contemptible opinion both of your power and your policy. Your
authority in the Jerseys is now reduced to the small circle which
your army occupies, and your proclamation is no where else seen
unless it be to be laughed at. The mighty subduers of the continent
have retreated into a nutshell, and the proud forgivers of our sins
are fled from those they came to pardon; and all this at a time when
they were despatching vessel after vessel to England with the great
news of every day. In short, you have managed your Jersey expedition
so very dexterously, that the dead only are conquerors, because none
will dispute the ground with them.

In all the wars which you have formerly been concerned in you had
only armies to contend with; in this case you have both an army and a
country to combat with. In former wars, the countries followed the
fate of their capitals; Canada fell with Quebec, and Minorca with
Port Mahon or St. Phillips; by subduing those, the conquerors opened
a way into, and became masters of the country: here it is otherwise;
if you get possession of a city here, you are obliged to shut
yourselves up in it, and can make no other use of it, than to spend
your country's money in. This is all the advantage you have drawn
from New York; and you would draw less from Philadelphia, because it
requires more force to keep it, and is much further from the sea. A
pretty figure you and the Tories would cut in this city, with a river
full of ice, and a town full of fire; for the immediate consequence
of your getting here would be, that you would be cannonaded out
again, and the Tories be obliged to make good the damage; and this
sooner or later will be the fate of New York.

I wish to see the city saved, not so much from military as from
natural motives. 'Tis the hiding place of women and children, and
Lord Howe's proper business is with our armies. When I put all the
circumstances together which ought to be taken, I laugh at your
notion of conquering America. Because you lived in a little country,
where an army might run over the whole in a few days, and where a
single company of soldiers might put a multitude to the rout, you
expected to find it the same here. It is plain that you brought over
with you all the narrow notions you were bred up with, and imagined
that a proclamation in the king's name was to do great things; but
Englishmen always travel for knowledge, and your lordship, I hope,
will return, if you return at all, much wiser than you came.

We may be surprised by events we did not expect, and in that interval
of recollection you may gain some temporary advantage: such was the
case a few weeks ago, but we soon ripen again into reason, collect
our strength, and while you are preparing for a triumph, we come upon
you with a defeat. Such it has been, and such it would be were you to
try it a hundred times over. Were you to garrison the places you
might march over, in order to secure their subjection, (for remember
you can do it by no other means,) your army would be like a stream of
water running to nothing. By the time you extended from New York to
Virginia, you would be reduced to a string of drops not capable of
hanging together; while we, by retreating from State to State, like a
river turning back upon itself, would acquire strength in the same
proportion as you lost it, and in the end be capable of overwhelming
you. The country, in the meantime, would suffer, but it is a day of
suffering, and we ought to expect it. What we contend for is worthy
the affliction we may go through. If we get but bread to eat, and any
kind of raiment to put on, we ought not only to be contented, but
thankful. More than that we ought not to look for, and less than that
heaven has not yet suffered us to want. He that would sell his
birthright for a little salt, is as worthless as he who sold it for
pottage without salt; and he that would part with it for a gay coat,
or a plain coat, ought for ever to be a slave in buff. What are salt,
sugar and finery, to the inestimable blessings of "Liberty and
Safety!" Or what are the inconveniences of a few months to the
tributary bondage of ages? The meanest peasant in America, blessed
with these sentiments, is a happy man compared with a New York Tory;
he can eat his morsel without repining, and when he has done, can
sweeten it with a repast of wholesome air; he can take his child by
the hand and bless it, without feeling the conscious shame of
neglecting a parent's duty.

In publishing these remarks I have several objects in view.

On your part they are to expose the folly of your pretended authority
as a commissioner; the wickedness of your cause in general; and the
impossibility of your conquering us at any rate. On the part of the
public, my intention is, to show them their true and sold interest;
to encourage them to their own good, to remove the fears and
falsities which bad men have spread, and weak men have encouraged;
and to excite in all men a love for union, and a cheerfulness for
duty.

I shall submit one more case to you respecting your conquest of this
country, and then proceed to new observations.

Suppose our armies in every part of this continent were immediately
to disperse, every man to his home, or where else he might be safe,
and engage to reassemble again on a certain future day; it is clear
that you would then have no army to contend with, yet you would be as
much at a loss in that case as you are now; you would be afraid to
send your troops in parties over to the continent, either to disarm
or prevent us from assembling, lest they should not return; and while
you kept them together, having no arms of ours to dispute with, you
could not call it a conquest; you might furnish out a pompous page in
the London Gazette or a New York paper, but when we returned at the
appointed time, you would have the same work to do that you had at
first.

It has been the folly of Britain to suppose herself more powerful
than she really is, and by that means has arrogated to herself a rank
in the world she is not entitled to: for more than this century past
she has not been able to carry on a war without foreign assistance.
In Marlborough's campaigns, and from that day to this, the number of
German troops and officers assisting her have been about equal with
her own; ten thousand Hessians were sent to England last war to
protect her from a French invasion; and she would have cut but a poor
figure in her Canadian and West Indian expeditions, had not America
been lavish both of her money and men to help her along. The only
instance in which she was engaged singly, that I can recollect, was
against the rebellion in Scotland, in the years 1745 and 1746, and in
that, out of three battles, she was twice beaten, till by thus
reducing their numbers, (as we shall yours) and taking a supply ship
that was coming to Scotland with clothes, arms and money, (as we have
often done,) she was at last enabled to defeat them. England was
never famous by land; her officers have generally been suspected of
cowardice, have more of the air of a dancing-master than a soldier,
and by the samples which we have taken prisoners, we give the
preference to ourselves. Her strength, of late, has lain in her
extravagance; but as her finances and credit are now low, her sinews
in that line begin to fail fast. As a nation she is the poorest in
Europe; for were the whole kingdom, and all that is in it, to be put
up for sale like the estate of a bankrupt, it would not fetch as much
as she owes; yet this thoughtless wretch must go to war, and with the
avowed design, too, of making us beasts of burden, to support her in
riot and debauchery, and to assist her afterwards in distressing
those nations who are now our best friends. This ingratitude may suit
a Tory, or the unchristian peevishness of a fallen Quaker, but none
else.

'Tis the unhappy temper of the English to be pleased with any war,
right or wrong, be it but successful; but they soon grow discontented
with ill fortune, and it is an even chance that they are as clamorous
for peace next summer, as the king and his ministers were for war
last winter. In this natural view of things, your lordship stands in
a very critical situation: your whole character is now staked upon
your laurels; if they wither, you wither with them; if they flourish,
you cannot live long to look at them; and at any rate, the black
account hereafter is not far off. What lately appeared to us
misfortunes, were only blessings in disguise; and the seeming
advantages on your side have turned out to our profit. Even our loss
of this city, as far as we can see, might be a principal gain to us:
the more surface you spread over, the thinner you will be, and the
easier wiped away; and our consolation under that apparent disaster
would be, that the estates of the Tories would become securities for
the repairs. In short, there is no old ground we can fail upon, but
some new foundation rises again to support us. "We have put, sir, our
hands to the plough, and cursed be he that looketh back."

Your king, in his speech to parliament last spring, declared, "That
he had no doubt but the great force they had enabled him to send to
America, would effectually reduce the rebellious colonies." It has
not, neither can it; but it has done just enough to lay the
foundation of its own next year's ruin. You are sensible that you
left England in a divided, distracted state of politics, and, by the
command you had here, you became a principal prop in the court party;
their fortunes rest on yours; by a single express you can fix their
value with the public, and the degree to which their spirits shall
rise or fall; they are in your hands as stock, and you have the
secret of the alley with you. Thus situated and connected, you become
the unintentional mechanical instrument of your own and their
overthrow. The king and his ministers put conquest out of doubt, and
the credit of both depended on the proof. To support them in the
interim, it was necessary that you should make the most of every
thing, and we can tell by Hugh Gaine's New York paper what the
complexion of the London Gazette is. With such a list of victories
the nation cannot expect you will ask new supplies; and to confess
your want of them would give the lie to your triumphs, and impeach
the king and his ministers of treasonable deception. If you make the
necessary demand at home, your party sinks; if you make it not, you
sink yourself; to ask it now is too late, and to ask it before was
too soon, and unless it arrive quickly will be of no use. In short,
the part you have to act, cannot be acted; and I am fully persuaded
that all you have to trust to is, to do the best you can with what
force you have got, or little more. Though we have greatly exceeded
you in point of generalship and bravery of men, yet, as a people, we
have not entered into the full soul of enterprise; for I, who know
England and the disposition of the people well, am confident, that it
is easier for us to effect a revolution there, than you a conquest
here; a few thousand men landed in England with the declared design
of deposing the present king, bringing his ministers to trial, and
setting up the Duke of Gloucester in his stead, would assuredly carry
their point, while you are grovelling here, ignorant of the matter.
As I send all my papers to England, this, like Common Sense, will
find its way there; and though it may put one party on their guard,
it will inform the other, and the nation in general, of our design to
help them.

Thus far, sir, I have endeavored to give you a picture of present
affairs: you may draw from it what conclusions you please. I wish as
well to the true prosperity of England as you can, but I consider
INDEPENDENCE as America's natural right and interest, and never could
see any real disservice it would be to Britain. If an English
merchant receives an order, and is paid for it, it signifies nothing
to him who governs the country. This is my creed of politics. If I
have any where expressed myself over-warmly, 'tis from a fixed,
immovable hatred I have, and ever had, to cruel men and cruel
measures. I have likewise an aversion to monarchy, as being too
debasing to the dignity of man; but I never troubled others with my
notions till very lately, nor ever published a syllable in England in
my life. What I write is pure nature, and my pen and my soul have
ever gone together. My writings I have always given away, reserving
only the expense of printing and paper, and sometimes not even that.
I never courted either fame or interest, and my manner of life, to
those who know it, will justify what I say. My study is to be useful,
and if your lordship loves mankind as well as I do, you would, seeing
you cannot conquer us, cast about and lend your hand towards
accomplishing a peace. Our independence with God's blessing we will
maintain against all the world; but as we wish to avoid evil
ourselves, we wish not to inflict it on others. I am never
over-inquisitive into the secrets of the cabinet, but I have some
notion that, if you neglect the present opportunity, it will not be
in our power to make a separate peace with you afterwards; for
whatever treaties or alliances we form, we shall most faithfully
abide by; wherefore you may be deceived if you think you can make it
with us at any time. A lasting independent peace is my wish, end and
aim; and to accomplish that, I pray God the Americans may never be
defeated, and I trust while they have good officers, and are well
commanded, and willing to be commanded, that they NEVER WILL BE.

                                     COMMON SENSE.

    PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 13, 1777.


                           The Crisis 


                                 III.

IN THE progress of politics, as in the common occurrences of life, we
are not only apt to forget the ground we have travelled over, but
frequently neglect to gather up experience as we go. We expend, if I
may so say, the knowledge of every day on the circumstances that
produce it, and journey on in search of new matter and new
refinements: but as it is pleasant and sometimes useful to look back,
even to the first periods of infancy, and trace the turns and
windings through which we have passed, so we may likewise derive many
advantages by halting a while in our political career, and taking a
review of the wondrous complicated labyrinth of little more than
yesterday.

Truly may we say, that never did men grow old in so short a time! We
have crowded the business of an age into the compass of a few months,
and have been driven through such a rapid succession of things, that
for the want of leisure to think, we unavoidably wasted knowledge as
we came, and have left nearly as much behind us as we brought with
us: but the road is yet rich with the fragments, and, before we
finally lose sight of them, will repay us for the trouble of stopping
to pick them up.

Were a man to be totally deprived of memory, he would be incapable of
forming any just opinion; every thing about him would seem a chaos:
he would have even his own history to ask from every one; and by not
knowing how the world went in his absence, he would be at a loss to
know how it ought to go on when he recovered, or rather, returned to
it again. In like manner, though in a less degree, a too great
inattention to past occurrences retards and bewilders our judgment in
everything; while, on the contrary, by comparing what is past with
what is present, we frequently hit on the true character of both, and
become wise with very little trouble. It is a kind of counter-march,
by which we get into the rear of time, and mark the movements and
meaning of things as we make our return. There are certain
circumstances, which, at the time of their happening, are a kind of
riddles, and as every riddle is to be followed by its answer, so
those kind of circumstances will be followed by their events, and
those events are always the true solution. A considerable space of
time may lapse between, and unless we continue our observations from
the one to the other, the harmony of them will pass away unnoticed:
but the misfortune is, that partly from the pressing necessity of
some instant things, and partly from the impatience of our own
tempers, we are frequently in such a hurry to make out the meaning of
everything as fast as it happens, that we thereby never truly
understand it; and not only start new difficulties to ourselves by so
doing, but, as it were, embarrass Providence in her good designs.

I have been civil in stating this fault on a large scale, for, as it
now stands, it does not appear to be levelled against any particular
set of men; but were it to be refined a little further, it might
afterwards be applied to the Tories with a degree of striking
propriety: those men have been remarkable for drawing sudden
conclusions from single facts. The least apparent mishap on our side,
or the least seeming advantage on the part of the enemy, have
determined with them the fate of a whole campaign. By this hasty
judgment they have converted a retreat into a defeat; mistook
generalship for error; while every little advantage purposely given
the enemy, either to weaken their strength by dividing it, embarrass
their councils by multiplying their objects, or to secure a greater
post by the surrender of a less, has been instantly magnified into a
conquest. Thus, by quartering ill policy upon ill principles, they
have frequently promoted the cause they designed to injure, and
injured that which they intended to promote.

It is probable the campaign may open before this number comes from
the press. The enemy have long lain idle, and amused themselves with
carrying on the war by proclamations only. While they continue their
delay our strength increases, and were they to move to action now, it
is a circumstantial proof that they have no reinforcement coming;
wherefore, in either case, the comparative advantage will be ours.
Like a wounded, disabled whale, they want only time and room to die
in; and though in the agony of their exit, it may be unsafe to live
within the flapping of their tail, yet every hour shortens their
date, and lessens their power of mischief. If any thing happens while
this number is in the press, it will afford me a subject for the last
pages of it. At present I am tired of waiting; and as neither the
enemy, nor the state of politics have yet produced any thing new, I
am thereby left in the field of general matter, undirected by any
striking or particular object. This Crisis, therefore, will be made
up rather of variety than novelty, and consist more of things useful
than things wonderful.

The success of the cause, the union of the people, and the means of
supporting and securing both, are points which cannot be too much
attended to. He who doubts of the former is a desponding coward, and
he who wilfully disturbs the latter is a traitor. Their characters
are easily fixed, and under these short descriptions I leave them for
the present.

One of the greatest degrees of sentimental union which America ever
knew, was in denying the right of the British parliament "to bind the
colonies in all cases whatsoever." The Declaration is, in its form,
an almighty one, and is the loftiest stretch of arbitrary power that
ever one set of men or one country claimed over another. Taxation was
nothing more than the putting the declared right into practice; and
this failing, recourse was had to arms, as a means to establish both
the right and the practice, or to answer a worse purpose, which will
be mentioned in the course of this number. And in order to repay
themselves the expense of an army, and to profit by their own
injustice, the colonies were, by another law, declared to be in a
state of actual rebellion, and of consequence all property therein
would fall to the conquerors.

The colonies, on their part, first, denied the right; secondly, they
suspended the use of taxable articles, and petitioned against the
practice of taxation: and these failing, they, thirdly, defended
their property by force, as soon as it was forcibly invaded, and, in
answer to the declaration of rebellion and non-protection, published
their Declaration of Independence and right of self-protection.

These, in a few words, are the different stages of the quarrel; and
the parts are so intimately and necessarily connected with each other
as to admit of no separation. A person, to use a trite phrase, must
be a Whig or a Tory in a lump. His feelings, as a man, may be
wounded; his charity, as a Christian, may be moved; but his political
principles must go through all the cases on one side or the other. He
cannot be a Whig in this stage, and a Tory in that. If he says he is
against the united independence of the continent, he is to all
intents and purposes against her in all the rest; because this last
comprehends the whole. And he may just as well say, that Britain was
right in declaring us rebels; right in taxing us; and right in
declaring her "right to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever."
It signifies nothing what neutral ground, of his own creating, he may
skulk upon for shelter, for the quarrel in no stage of it hath
afforded any such ground; and either we or Britain are absolutely
right or absolutely wrong through the whole.

Britain, like a gamester nearly ruined, has now put all her losses
into one bet, and is playing a desperate game for the total. If she
wins it, she wins from me my life; she wins the continent as the
forfeited property of rebels; the right of taxing those that are left
as reduced subjects; and the power of binding them slaves: and the
single die which determines this unparalleled event is, whether we
support our independence or she overturn it. This is coming to the
point at once. Here is the touchstone to try men by. He that is not a
supporter of the independent States of America in the same degree
that his religious and political principles would suffer him to
support the government of any other country, of which he called
himself a subject, is, in the American sense of the word, A TORY; and
the instant that he endeavors to bring his toryism into practice, he
becomes A TRAITOR. The first can only be detected by a general test,
and the law hath already provided for the latter.

It is unnatural and impolitic to admit men who would root up our
independence to have any share in our legislation, either as electors
or representatives; because the support of our independence rests, in
a great measure, on the vigor and purity of our public bodies. Would
Britain, even in time of peace, much less in war, suffer an election
to be carried by men who professed themselves to be not her subjects,
or allow such to sit in Parliament? Certainly not.

But there are a certain species of Tories with whom conscience or
principle has nothing to do, and who are so from avarice only. Some
of the first fortunes on the continent, on the part of the Whigs, are
staked on the issue of our present measures. And shall disaffection
only be rewarded with security? Can any thing be a greater inducement
to a miserly man, than the hope of making his Mammon safe? And though
the scheme be fraught with every character of folly, yet, so long as
he supposes, that by doing nothing materially criminal against
America on one part, and by expressing his private disapprobation
against independence, as palliative with the enemy, on the other
part, he stands in a safe line between both; while, I say, this
ground be suffered to remain, craft, and the spirit of avarice, will
point it out, and men will not be wanting to fill up this most
contemptible of all characters.

These men, ashamed to own the sordid cause from whence their
disaffection springs, add thereby meanness to meanness, by
endeavoring to shelter themselves under the mask of hypocrisy; that
is, they had rather be thought to be Tories from some kind of
principle, than Tories by having no principle at all. But till such
time as they can show some real reason, natural, political, or
conscientious, on which their objections to independence are founded,
we are not obliged to give them credit for being Tories of the first
stamp, but must set them down as Tories of the last.

In the second number of the Crisis, I endeavored to show the
impossibility of the enemy's making any conquest of America, that
nothing was wanting on our part but patience and perseverance, and
that, with these virtues, our success, as far as human speculation
could discern, seemed as certain as fate. But as there are many among
us, who, influenced by others, have regularly gone back from the
principles they once held, in proportion as we have gone forward; and
as it is the unfortunate lot of many a good man to live within the
neighborhood of disaffected ones; I shall, therefore, for the sake of
confirming the one and recovering the other, endeavor, in the space
of a page or two, to go over some of the leading principles in
support of independence. It is a much pleasanter task to prevent vice
than to punish it, and, however our tempers may be gratified by
resentment, or our national expenses eased by forfeited estates,
harmony and friendship is, nevertheless, the happiest condition a
country can be blessed with.

The principal arguments in support of independence may be
comprehended under the four following heads.

1st, The natural right of the continent to independence.
2d, Her interest in being independent.
3d, The necessity,- and
4th, The moral advantages arising therefrom.

I. The natural right of the continent to independence, is a point
which never yet was called in question. It will not even admit of a
debate. To deny such a right, would be a kind of atheism against
nature: and the best answer to such an objection would be, "The fool
hath said in his heart there is no God."

II. The interest of the continent in being independent is a point as
clearly right as the former. America, by her own internal industry,
and unknown to all the powers of Europe, was, at the beginning of the
dispute, arrived at a pitch of greatness, trade and population,
beyond which it was the interest of Britain not to suffer her to
pass, lest she should grow too powerful to be kept subordinate. She
began to view this country with the same uneasy malicious eye, with
which a covetous guardian would view his ward, whose estate he had
been enriching himself by for twenty years, and saw him just arriving
at manhood. And America owes no more to Britain for her present
maturity, than the ward would to the guardian for being twenty-one
years of age. That America hath flourished at the time she was under
the government of Britain, is true; but there is every natural reason
to believe, that had she been an independent country from the first
settlement thereof, uncontrolled by any foreign power, free to make
her own laws, regulate and encourage her own commerce, she had by
this time been of much greater worth than now. The case is simply
this: the first settlers in the different colonies were left to shift
for themselves, unnoticed and unsupported by any European government;
but as the tyranny and persecution of the old world daily drove
numbers to the new, and as, by the favor of heaven on their industry
and perseverance, they grew into importance, so, in a like degree,
they became an object of profit to the greedy eyes of Europe. It was
impossible, in this state of infancy, however thriving and promising,
that they could resist the power of any armed invader that should
seek to bring them under his authority. In this situation, Britain
thought it worth her while to claim them, and the continent received
and acknowledged the claimer. It was, in reality, of no very great
importance who was her master, seeing, that from the force and
ambition of the different powers of Europe, she must, till she
acquired strength enough to assert her own right, acknowledge some
one. As well, perhaps, Britain as another; and it might have been as
well to have been under the states of Holland as any. The same hopes
of engrossing and profiting by her trade, by not oppressing it too
much, would have operated alike with any master, and produced to the
colonies the same effects. The clamor of protection, likewise, was
all a farce; because, in order to make that protection necessary, she
must first, by her own quarrels, create us enemies. Hard terms indeed!

To know whether it be the interest of the continent to be
independent, we need only ask this easy, simple question: Is it the
interest of a man to be a boy all his life? The answer to one will be
the answer to both. America hath been one continued scene of
legislative contention from the first king's representative to the
last; and this was unavoidably founded in the natural opposition of
interest between the old country and the new. A governor sent from
England, or receiving his authority therefrom, ought never to have
been considered in any other light than that of a genteel
commissioned spy, whose private business was information, and his
public business a kind of civilized oppression. In the first of these
characters he was to watch the tempers, sentiments, and disposition
of the people, the growth of trade, and the increase of private
fortunes; and, in the latter, to suppress all such acts of the
assemblies, however beneficial to the people, which did not directly
or indirectly throw some increase of power or profit into the hands
of those that sent him.

America, till now, could never be called a free country, because her
legislation depended on the will of a man three thousand miles
distant, whose interest was in opposition to ours, and who, by a
single "no," could forbid what law he pleased.

The freedom of trade, likewise, is, to a trading country, an article
of such importance, that the principal source of wealth depends upon
it; and it is impossible that any country can flourish, as it
otherwise might do, whose commerce is engrossed, cramped and fettered
by the laws and mandates of another- yet these evils, and more than I
can here enumerate, the continent has suffered by being under the
government of England. By an independence we clear the whole at once-
put an end to the business of unanswered petitions and fruitless
remonstrances- exchange Britain for Europe- shake hands with the
world- live at peace with the world- and trade to any market where we
can buy and sell.

III. The necessity, likewise, of being independent, even before it
was declared, became so evident and important, that the continent ran
the risk of being ruined every day that she delayed it. There was
reason to believe that Britain would endeavor to make an European
matter of it, and, rather than lose the whole, would dismember it,
like Poland, and dispose of her several claims to the highest bidder.
Genoa, failing in her attempts to reduce Corsica, made a sale of it
to the French, and such trafficks have been common in the old world.
We had at that time no ambassador in any part of Europe, to
counteract her negotiations, and by that means she had the range of
every foreign court uncontradicted on our part. We even knew nothing
of the treaty for the Hessians till it was concluded, and the troops
ready to embark. Had we been independent before, we had probably
prevented her obtaining them. We had no credit abroad, because of our
rebellious dependency. Our ships could claim no protection in foreign
ports, because we afforded them no justifiable reason for granting it
to us. The calling ourselves subjects, and at the same time fighting
against the power which we acknowledged, was a dangerous precedent to
all Europe. If the grievances justified the taking up arms, they
justified our separation; if they did not justify our separation,
neither could they justify our taking up arms. All Europe was
interested in reducing us as rebels, and all Europe (or the greatest
part at least) is interested in supporting us as independent States.
At home our condition was still worse: our currency had no
foundation, and the fall of it would have ruined Whig and Tory alike.
We had no other law than a kind of moderated passion; no other civil
power than an honest mob; and no other protection than the temporary
attachment of one man to another. Had independence been delayed a few
months longer, this continent would have been plunged into
irrecoverable confusion: some violent for it, some against it, till,
in the general cabal, the rich would have been ruined, and the poor
destroyed. It is to independence that every Tory owes the present
safety which he lives in; for by that, and that only, we emerged from
a state of dangerous suspense, and became a regular people.

The necessity, likewise, of being independent, had there been no
rupture between Britain and America, would, in a little time, have
brought one on. The increasing importance of commerce, the weight and
perplexity of legislation, and the entangled state of European
politics, would daily have shown to the continent the impossibility
of continuing subordinate; for, after the coolest reflections on the
matter, this must be allowed, that Britain was too jealous of America
to govern it justly; too ignorant of it to govern it well; and too
far distant from it to govern it at all.

IV. But what weigh most with all men of serious reflection are, the
moral advantages arising from independence: war and desolation have
become the trade of the old world; and America neither could nor can
be under the government of Britain without becoming a sharer of her
guilt, and a partner in all the dismal commerce of death. The spirit
of duelling, extended on a national scale, is a proper character for
European wars. They have seldom any other motive than pride, or any
other object than fame. The conquerors and the conquered are
generally ruined alike, and the chief difference at last is, that the
one marches home with his honors, and the other without them. 'Tis
the natural temper of the English to fight for a feather, if they
suppose that feather to be an affront; and America, without the right
of asking why, must have abetted in every quarrel, and abided by its
fate. It is a shocking situation to live in, that one country must be
brought into all the wars of another, whether the measure be right or
wrong, or whether she will or not; yet this, in the fullest extent,
was, and ever would be, the unavoidable consequence of the
connection. Surely the Quakers forgot their own principles when, in
their late Testimony, they called this connection, with these
military and miserable appendages hanging to it- "the happy
constitution."

Britain, for centuries past, has been nearly fifty years out of every
hundred at war with some power or other. It certainly ought to be a
conscientious as well political consideration with America, not to
dip her hands in the bloody work of Europe. Our situation affords us
a retreat from their cabals, and the present happy union of the
states bids fair for extirpating the future use of arms from one
quarter of the world; yet such have been the irreligious politics of
the present leaders of the Quakers, that, for the sake of they scarce
know what, they would cut off every hope of such a blessing by tying
this continent to Britain, like Hector to the chariot wheel of
Achilles, to be dragged through all the miseries of endless European
wars.

The connection, viewed from this ground, is distressing to every man
who has the feelings of humanity. By having Britain for our master,
we became enemies to the greatest part of Europe, and they to us: and
the consequence was war inevitable. By being our own masters,
independent of any foreign one, we have Europe for our friends, and
the prospect of an endless peace among ourselves. Those who were
advocates for the British government over these colonies, were
obliged to limit both their arguments and their ideas to the period
of an European peace only; the moment Britain became plunged in war,
every supposed convenience to us vanished, and all we could hope for
was not to be ruined. Could this be a desirable condition for a young
country to be in?

Had the French pursued their fortune immediately after the defeat of
Braddock last war, this city and province had then experienced the
woful calamities of being a British subject. A scene of the same kind
might happen again; for America, considered as a subject to the crown
of Britain, would ever have been the seat of war, and the bone of
contention between the two powers.

On the whole, if the future expulsion of arms from one quarter of the
world would be a desirable object to a peaceable man; if the freedom
of trade to every part of it can engage the attention of a man of
business; if the support or fall of millions of currency can affect
our interests; if the entire possession of estates, by cutting off
the lordly claims of Britain over the soil, deserves the regard of
landed property; and if the right of making our own laws,
uncontrolled by royal or ministerial spies or mandates, be worthy our
care as freemen;- then are all men interested in the support of
independence; and may he that supports it not, be driven from the
blessing, and live unpitied beneath the servile sufferings of
scandalous subjection!

We have been amused with the tales of ancient wonders; we have read,
and wept over the histories of other nations: applauded, censured, or
pitied, as their cases affected us. The fortitude and patience of the
sufferers- the justness of their cause- the weight of their
oppressions and oppressors- the object to be saved or lost- with all
the consequences of a defeat or a conquest- have, in the hour of
sympathy, bewitched our hearts, and chained it to their fate: but
where is the power that ever made war upon petitioners? Or where is
the war on which a world was staked till now?

We may not, perhaps, be wise enough to make all the advantages we
ought of our independence; but they are, nevertheless, marked and
presented to us with every character of great and good, and worthy
the hand of him who sent them. I look through the present trouble to
a time of tranquillity, when we shall have it in our power to set an
example of peace to all the world. Were the Quakers really impressed
and influenced by the quiet principles they profess to hold, they
would, however they might disapprove the means, be the first of all
men to approve of independence, because, by separating ourselves from
the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, it affords an opportunity never
given to man before of carrying their favourite principle of peace
into general practice, by establishing governments that shall
hereafter exist without wars. O! ye fallen, cringing,
priest-and-Pemberton-ridden people! What more can we say of ye than
that a religious Quaker is a valuable character, and a political
Quaker a real Jesuit.

Having thus gone over some of the principal points in support of
independence, I must now request the reader to return back with me to
the period when it first began to be a public doctrine, and to
examine the progress it has made among the various classes of men.
The area I mean to begin at, is the breaking out of hostilities,
April 19th, 1775. Until this event happened, the continent seemed to
view the dispute as a kind of law-suit for a matter of right,
litigating between the old country and the new; and she felt the same
kind and degree of horror, as if she had seen an oppressive
plaintiff, at the head of a band of ruffians, enter the court, while
the cause was before it, and put the judge, the jury, the defendant
and his counsel, to the sword. Perhaps a more heart-felt convulsion
never reached a country with the same degree of power and rapidity
before, and never may again. Pity for the sufferers, mixed with
indignation at the violence, and heightened with apprehensions of
undergoing the same fate, made the affair of Lexington the affair of
the continent. Every part of it felt the shock, and all vibrated
together. A general promotion of sentiment took place: those who had
drank deeply into Whiggish principles, that is, the right and
necessity not only of opposing, but wholly setting aside the power of
the crown as soon as it became practically dangerous (for in theory
it was always so), stepped into the first stage of independence;
while another class of Whigs, equally sound in principle, but not so
sanguine in enterprise, attached themselves the stronger to the
cause, and fell close in with the rear of the former; their partition
was a mere point. Numbers of the moderate men, whose chief fault, at
that time, arose from entertaining a better opinion of Britain than
she deserved, convinced now of their mistake, gave her up, and
publicly declared themselves good Whigs. While the Tories, seeing it
was no longer a laughing matter, either sank into silent obscurity,
or contented themselves with coming forth and abusing General Gage:
not a single advocate appeared to justify the action of that day; it
seemed to appear to every one with the same magnitude, struck every
one with the same force, and created in every one the same
abhorrence. From this period we may date the growth of independence.

If the many circumstances which happened at this memorable time, be
taken in one view, and compared with each other, they will justify a
conclusion which seems not to have been attended to, I mean a fixed
design in the king and ministry of driving America into arms, in
order that they might be furnished with a pretence for seizing the
whole continent, as the immediate property of the crown. A noble
plunder for hungry courtiers!

It ought to be remembered, that the first petition from the Congress
was at this time unanswered on the part of the British king. That the
motion, called Lord North's motion, of the 20th of February, 1775,
arrived in America the latter end of March. This motion was to be
laid, by the several governors then in being, before, the assembly of
each province; and the first assembly before which it was laid, was
the assembly of Pennsylvania, in May following. This being a just
state of the case, I then ask, why were hostilities commenced between
the time of passing the resolve in the House of Commons, of the 20th
of February, and the time of the assemblies meeting to deliberate
upon it? Degrading and famous as that motion was, there is
nevertheless reason to believe that the king and his adherents were
afraid the colonies would agree to it, and lest they should, took
effectual care they should not, by provoking them with hostilities in
the interim. They had not the least doubt at that time of conquering
America at one blow; and what they expected to get by a conquest
being infinitely greater than any thing they could hope to get either
by taxation or accommodation, they seemed determined to prevent even
the possibility of hearing each other, lest America should disappoint
their greedy hopes of the whole, by listening even to their own
terms. On the one hand they refused to hear the petition of the
continent, and on the other hand took effectual care the continent
should not hear them.

That the motion of the 20th February and the orders for commencing
hostilities were both concerted by the same person or persons, and
not the latter by General Gage, as was falsely imagined at first, is
evident from an extract of a letter of his to the administration,
read among other papers in the House of Commons; in which he informs
his masters, "That though their idea of his disarming certain
counties was a right one, yet it required him to be master of the
country, in order to enable him to execute it." This was prior to the
commencement of hostilities, and consequently before the motion of
the 20th February could be deliberated on by the several assemblies.

Perhaps it may be asked, why was the motion passed, if there was at
the same time a plan to aggravate the Americans not to listen to it?
Lord North assigned one reason himself, which was a hope of dividing
them. This was publicly tempting them to reject it; that if, in case
the injury of arms should fail in provoking them sufficiently, the
insult of such a declaration might fill it up. But by passing the
motion and getting it afterwards rejected in America, it enabled
them, in their wicked idea of politics, among other things, to hold
up the colonies to foreign powers, with every possible mark of
disobedience and rebellion. They had applied to those powers not to
supply the continent with arms, ammunition, etc., and it was
necessary they should incense them against us, by assigning on their
own part some seeming reputable reason why. By dividing, it had a
tendency to weaken the States, and likewise to perplex the adherents
of America in England. But the principal scheme, and that which has
marked their character in every part of their conduct, was a design
of precipitating the colonies into a state which they might
afterwards deem rebellion, and, under that pretence, put an end to
all future complaints, petitions and remonstrances, by seizing the
whole at once. They had ravaged one part of the globe, till it could
glut them no longer; their prodigality required new plunder, and
through the East India article tea they hoped to transfer their
rapine from that quarter of the world to this. Every designed quarrel
had its pretence; and the same barbarian avarice accompanied the
plant to America, which ruined the country that produced it.

That men never turn rogues without turning fools is a maxim, sooner
or later, universally true. The commencement of hostilities, being in
the beginning of April, was, of all times the worst chosen: the
Congress were to meet the tenth of May following, and the distress
the continent felt at this unparalleled outrage gave a stability to
that body which no other circumstance could have done. It suppressed
too all inferior debates, and bound them together by a necessitous
affection, without giving them time to differ upon trifles. The
suffering likewise softened the whole body of the people into a
degree of pliability, which laid the principal foundation-stone of
union, order, and government; and which, at any other time, might
only have fretted and then faded away unnoticed and unimproved. But
Providence, who best knows how to time her misfortunes as well as her
immediate favors, chose this to be the time, and who dare dispute it?

It did not seem the disposition of the people, at this crisis, to
heap petition upon petition, while the former remained unanswered.
The measure however was carried in Congress, and a second petition
was sent; of which I shall only remark that it was submissive even to
a dangerous fault, because the prayer of it appealed solely to what
it called the prerogative of the crown, while the matter in dispute
was confessedly constitutional. But even this petition, flattering as
it was, was still not so harmonious as the chink of cash, and
consequently not sufficiently grateful to the tyrant and his
ministry. From every circumstance it is evident, that it was the
determination of the British court to have nothing to do with America
but to conquer her fully and absolutely. They were certain of
success, and the field of battle was the only place of treaty. I am
confident there are thousands and tens of thousands in America who
wonder now that they should ever have thought otherwise; but the sin
of that day was the sin of civility; yet it operated against our
present good in the same manner that a civil opinion of the devil
would against our future peace.

Independence was a doctrine scarce and rare, even towards the
conclusion of the year 1775; all our politics had been founded on the
hope of expectation of making the matter up- a hope, which, though
general on the side of America, had never entered the head or heart
of the British court. Their hope was conquest and confiscation. Good
heavens! what volumes of thanks does America owe to Britain? What
infinite obligation to the tool that fills, with paradoxical vacancy,
the throne! Nothing but the sharpest essence of villany, compounded
with the strongest distillation of folly, could have produced a
menstruum that would have effected a separation. The Congress in 1774
administered an abortive medicine to independence, by prohibiting the
importation of goods, and the succeeding Congress rendered the dose
still more dangerous by continuing it. Had independence been a
settled system with America, (as Britain has advanced,) she ought to
have doubled her importation, and prohibited in some degree her
exportation. And this single circumstance is sufficient to acquit
America before any jury of nations, of having a continental plan of
independence in view; a charge which, had it been true, would have
been honorable, but is so grossly false, that either the amazing
ignorance or the wilful dishonesty of the British court is
effectually proved by it.

The second petition, like the first, produced no answer; it was
scarcely acknowledged to have been received; the British court were
too determined in their villainy even to act it artfully, and in
their rage for conquest neglected the necessary subtleties for
obtaining it. They might have divided, distracted and played a
thousand tricks with us, had they been as cunning as they were cruel.

This last indignity gave a new spring to independence. Those who knew
the savage obstinacy of the king, and the jobbing, gambling spirit of
the court, predicted the fate of the petition, as soon as it was sent
from America; for the men being known, their measures were easily
foreseen. As politicians we ought not so much to ground our hopes on
the reasonableness of the thing we ask, as on the reasonableness of
the person of whom we ask it: who would expect discretion from a
fool, candor from a tyrant, or justice from a villain?

As every prospect of accommodation seemed now to fail fast, men began
to think seriously on the matter; and their reason being thus
stripped of the false hope which had long encompassed it, became
approachable by fair debate: yet still the bulk of the people
hesitated; they startled at the novelty of independence, without once
considering that our getting into arms at first was a more
extraordinary novelty, and that all other nations had gone through
the work of independence before us. They doubted likewise the ability
of the continent to support it, without reflecting that it required
the same force to obtain an accommodation by arms as an independence.
If the one was acquirable, the other was the same; because, to
accomplish either, it was necessary that our strength should be too
great for Britain to subdue; and it was too unreasonable to suppose,
that with the power of being masters, we should submit to be
servants.* Their caution at this time was exceedingly misplaced; for
if they were able to defend their property and maintain their rights
by arms, they, consequently, were able to defend and support their
independence; and in proportion as these men saw the necessity and
correctness of the measure, they honestly and openly declared and
adopted it, and the part that they had acted since has done them
honor and fully established their characters. Error in opinion has
this peculiar advantage with it, that the foremost point of the
contrary ground may at any time be reached by the sudden exertion of
a thought; and it frequently happens in sentimental differences, that
some striking circumstance, or some forcible reason quickly
conceived, will effect in an instant what neither argument nor
example could produce in an age.

* In this state of political suspense the pamphlet Common Sense made
its appearance, and the success it met with does not become me to
mention. Dr. Franklin, Mr. Samuel and John Adams, were severally
spoken of as the supposed author. I had not, at that time, the
pleasure either of personally knowing or being known to the two last
gentlemen. The favor of Dr. Franklin's friendship I possessed in
England, and my introduction to this part of the world was through
his patronage. I happened, when a school-boy, to pick up a pleasing
natural history of Virginia, and my inclination from that day of
seeing the western side of the Atlantic never left me. In October,
1775, Dr. Franklin proposed giving me such materials as were in his
hands, towards completing a history of the present transactions, and
seemed desirous of having the first volume out the next Spring. I had
then formed the outlines of Common Sense, and finished nearly the
first part; and as I supposed the doctor's design in getting out a
history was to open the new year with a new system, I expected to
surprise him with a production on that subject, much earlier than he
thought of; and without informing him what I was doing, got it ready
for the press as fast as I conveniently could, and sent him the first
pamphlet that was printed off.

I find it impossible in the small compass I am limited to, to trace
out the progress which independence has made on the minds of the
different classes of men, and the several reasons by which they were
moved. With some, it was a passionate abhorrence against the king of
England and his ministry, as a set of savages and brutes; and these
men, governed by the agony of a wounded mind, were for trusting every
thing to hope and heaven, and bidding defiance at once. With others,
it was a growing conviction that the scheme of the British court was
to create, ferment and drive on a quarrel, for the sake of
confiscated plunder: and men of this class ripened into independence
in proportion as the evidence increased. While a third class
conceived it was the true interest of America, internally and
externally, to be her own master, and gave their support to
independence, step by step, as they saw her abilities to maintain it
enlarge. With many, it was a compound of all these reasons; while
those who were too callous to be reached by either, remained, and
still remain Tories.

The legal necessity of being independent, with several collateral
reasons, is pointed out in an elegant masterly manner, in a charge to
the grand jury for the district of Charleston, by the Hon. William
Henry Drayton, chief justice of South Carolina, [April 23, 1776].
This performance, and the address of the convention of New York, are
pieces, in my humble opinion, of the first rank in America.

The principal causes why independence has not been so universally
supported as it ought, are fear and indolence, and the causes why it
has been opposed, are, avarice, down-right villany, and lust of
personal power. There is not such a being in America as a Tory from
conscience; some secret defect or other is interwoven in the
character of all those, be they men or women, who can look with
patience on the brutality, luxury and debauchery of the British
court, and the violations of their army here. A woman's virtue must
sit very lightly on her who can even hint a favorable sentiment in
their behalf. It is remarkable that the whole race of prostitutes in
New York were tories; and the schemes for supporting the Tory cause
in this city, for which several are now in jail, and one hanged, were
concerted and carried on in common bawdy-houses, assisted by those
who kept them.

The connection between vice and meanness is a fit subject for satire,
but when the satire is a fact, it cuts with the irresistible power of
a diamond. If a Quaker, in defence of his just rights, his property,
and the chastity of his house, takes up a musket, he is expelled the
meeting; but the present king of England, who seduced and took into
keeping a sister of their society, is reverenced and supported by
repeated Testimonies, while, the friendly noodle from whom she was
taken (and who is now in this city) continues a drudge in the service
of his rival, as if proud of being cuckolded by a creature called a
king.

Our support and success depend on such a variety of men and
circumstances, that every one who does but wish well, is of some use:
there are men who have a strange aversion to arms, yet have hearts to
risk every shilling in the cause, or in support of those who have
better talents for defending it. Nature, in the arrangement of
mankind, has fitted some for every service in life: were all
soldiers, all would starve and go naked, and were none soldiers, all
would be slaves. As disaffection to independence is the badge of a
Tory, so affection to it is the mark of a Whig; and the different
services of the Whigs, down from those who nobly contribute every
thing, to those who have nothing to render but their wishes, tend all
to the same center, though with different degrees of merit and
ability. The larger we make the circle, the more we shall harmonize,
and the stronger we shall be. All we want to shut out is
disaffection, and, that excluded, we must accept from each other such
duties as we are best fitted to bestow. A narrow system of politics,
like a narrow system of religion, is calculated only to sour the
temper, and be at variance with mankind.

All we want to know in America is simply this, who is for
independence, and who is not? Those who are for it, will support it,
and the remainder will undoubtedly see the reasonableness of paying
the charges; while those who oppose or seek to betray it, must expect
the more rigid fate of the jail and the gibbet. There is a bastard
kind of generosity, which being extended to all men, is as fatal to
society, on one hand, as the want of true generosity is on the other.
A lax manner of administering justice, falsely termed moderation, has
a tendency both to dispirit public virtue, and promote the growth of
public evils. Had the late committee of safety taken cognizance of
the last Testimony of the Quakers and proceeded against such
delinquents as were concerned therein, they had, probably, prevented
the treasonable plans which have been concerted since. When one
villain is suffered to escape, it encourages another to proceed,
either from a hope of escaping likewise, or an apprehension that we
dare not punish. It has been a matter of general surprise, that no
notice was taken of the incendiary publication of the Quakers, of the
20th of November last; a publication evidently intended to promote
sedition and treason, and encourage the enemy, who were then within a
day's march of this city, to proceed on and possess it. I here
present the reader with a memorial which was laid before the board of
safety a few days after the Testimony appeared. Not a member of that
board, that I conversed with, but expressed the highest detestation
of the perverted principles and conduct of the Quaker junto, and a
wish that the board would take the matter up; notwithstanding which,
it was suffered to pass away unnoticed, to the encouragement of new
acts of treason, the general danger of the cause, and the disgrace of
the state.



        To the honorable the Council of Safety of the State of
                            Pennsylvania.

At a meeting of a reputable number of the inhabitants of the city of
Philadelphia, impressed with a proper sense of the justice of the
cause which this continent is engaged in, and animated with a
generous fervor for supporting the same, it was resolved, that the
following be laid before the board of safety:

"We profess liberality of sentiment to all men; with this distinction
only, that those who do not deserve it would become wise and seek to
deserve it. We hold the pure doctrines of universal liberty of
conscience, and conceive it our duty to endeavor to secure that
sacred right to others, as well as to defend it for ourselves; for we
undertake not to judge of the religious rectitude of tenets, but
leave the whole matter to Him who made us.

"We persecute no man, neither will we abet in the persecution of any
man for religion's sake; our common relation to others being that of
fellow-citizens and fellow-subjects of one single community; and in
this line of connection we hold out the right hand of fellowship to
all men. But we should conceive ourselves to be unworthy members of
the free and independent States of America, were we unconcernedly to
see or to suffer any treasonable wound, public or private, directly
or indirectly, to be given against the peace and safety of the same.
We inquire not into the rank of the offenders, nor into their
religious persuasion; we have no business with either, our part being
only to find them out and exhibit them to justice.

"A printed paper, dated the 20th of November, and signed 'John
Pemberton,' whom we suppose to be an inhabitant of this city, has
lately been dispersed abroad, a copy of which accompanies this. Had
the framers and publishers of that paper conceived it their duty to
exhort the youth and others of their society, to a patient submission
under the present trying visitations, and humbly to wait the event of
heaven towards them, they had therein shown a Christian temper, and
we had been silent; but the anger and political virulence with which
their instructions are given, and the abuse with which they
stigmatize all ranks of men not thinking like themselves, leave no
doubt on our minds from what spirit their publication proceeded: and
it is disgraceful to the pure cause of truth, that men can dally with
words of the most sacred import, and play them off as mechanically as
if religion consisted only in contrivance. We know of no instance in
which the Quakers have been compelled to bear arms, or to do any
thing which might strain their conscience; wherefore their advice,
'to withstand and refuse to submit to the arbitrary instructions and
ordinances of men,' appear to us a false alarm, and could only be
treasonably calculated to gain favor with our enemies, when they are
seemingly on the brink of invading this State, or, what is still
worse, to weaken the hands of our defence, that their entrance into
this city might be made practicable and easy.

"We disclaim all tumult and disorder in the punishment of offenders;
and wish to be governed, not by temper but by reason, in the manner
of treating them. We are sensible that our cause has suffered by the
two following errors: first, by ill-judged lenity to traitorous
persons in some cases; and, secondly, by only a passionate treatment
of them in others. For the future we disown both, and wish to be
steady in our proceedings, and serious in our punishments.

"Every State in America has, by the repeated voice of its
inhabitants, directed and authorized the Continental Congress to
publish a formal Declaration of Independence of, and separation from,
the oppressive king and Parliament of Great Britain; and we look on
every man as an enemy, who does not in some line or other, give his
assistance towards supporting the same; at the same time we consider
the offence to be heightened to a degree of unpardonable guilt, when
such persons, under the show of religion, endeavor, either by
writing, speaking, or otherwise, to subvert, overturn, or bring
reproach upon the independence of this continent as declared by
Congress.

"The publishers of the paper signed 'John Pemberton,' have called in
a loud manner to their friends and connections, 'to withstand or
refuse' obedience to whatever 'instructions or ordinances' may be
published, not warranted by (what they call) 'that happy Constitution
under which they and others long enjoyed tranquillity and peace.' If
this be not treason, we know not what may properly be called by that
name.

"To us it is a matter of surprise and astonishment, that men with the
word 'peace, peace,' continually on their lips, should be so fond of
living under and supporting a government, and at the same time
calling it 'happy,' which is never better pleased than when a war-
that has filled India with carnage and famine, Africa with slavery,
and tampered with Indians and negroes to cut the throats of the
freemen of America. We conceive it a disgrace to this State, to
harbor or wink at such palpable hypocrisy. But as we seek not to hurt
the hair of any man's head, when we can make ourselves safe without,
we wish such persons to restore peace to themselves and us, by
removing themselves to some part of the king of Great Britain's
dominions, as by that means they may live unmolested by us and we by
them; for our fixed opinion is, that those who do not deserve a place
among us, ought not to have one.

"We conclude with requesting the Council of Safety to take into
consideration the paper signed 'John Pemberton,' and if it shall
appear to them to be of a dangerous tendency, or of a treasonable
nature, that they would commit the signer, together with such other
persons as they can discover were concerned therein, into custody,
until such time as some mode of trial shall ascertain the full degree
of their guilt and punishment; in the doing of which, we wish their
judges, whoever they may be, to disregard the man, his connections,
interest, riches, poverty, or principles of religion, and to attend
to the nature of his offence only."



The most cavilling sectarian cannot accuse the foregoing with
containing the least ingredient of persecution. The free spirit on
which the American cause is founded, disdains to mix with such an
impurity, and leaves it as rubbish fit only for narrow and suspicious
minds to grovel in. Suspicion and persecution are weeds of the same
dunghill, and flourish together. Had the Quakers minded their
religion and their business, they might have lived through this
dispute in enviable ease, and none would have molested them. The
common phrase with these people is, 'Our principles are peace.' To
which may be replied, and your practices are the reverse; for never
did the conduct of men oppose their own doctrine more notoriously
than the present race of the Quakers. They have artfully changed
themselves into a different sort of people to what they used to be,
and yet have the address to persuade each other that they are not
altered; like antiquated virgins, they see not the havoc deformity
has made upon them, but pleasantly mistaking wrinkles for dimples,
conceive themselves yet lovely and wonder at the stupid world for not
admiring them.

Did no injury arise to the public by this apostacy of the Quakers
from themselves, the public would have nothing to do with it; but as
both the design and consequences are pointed against a cause in which
the whole community are interested, it is therefore no longer a
subject confined to the cognizance of the meeting only, but comes, as
a matter of criminality, before the authority either of the
particular State in which it is acted, or of the continent against
which it operates. Every attempt, now, to support the authority of
the king and Parliament of Great Britain over America, is treason
against every State; therefore it is impossible that any one can
pardon or screen from punishment an offender against all.

But to proceed: while the infatuated Tories of this and other States
were last spring talking of commissioners, accommodation, making the
matter up, and the Lord knows what stuff and nonsense, their good
king and ministry were glutting themselves with the revenge of
reducing America to unconditional submission, and solacing each other
with the certainty of conquering it in one campaign. The following
quotations are from the parliamentary register of the debate's of the
House of Lords, March 5th, 1776:

"The Americans," says Lord Talbot,* "have been obstinate, undutiful,
and ungovernable from the very beginning, from their first early and
infant settlements; and I am every day more and more convinced that
this people never will be brought back to their duty, and the
subordinate relation they stand in to this country, till reduced to
unconditional, effectual submission; no concession on our part, no
lenity, no endurance, will have any other effect but that of
increasing their insolence."

* Steward of the king's household.

"The struggle," says Lord Townsend,* "is now a struggle for power;
the die is cast, and the only point which now remains to be
determined is, in what manner the war can be most effectually
prosecuted and speedily finished, in order to procure that
unconditional submission, which has been so ably stated by the noble
Earl with the white staff" (meaning Lord Talbot;) "and I have no
reason to doubt that the measures now pursuing will put an end to the
war in the course of a single campaign. Should it linger longer, we
shall then have reason to expect that some foreign power will
interfere, and take advantage of our domestic troubles and civil
distractions."

* Formerly General Townsend, at Quebec, and late lord-lieutenant of
Ireland.

Lord Littleton. "My sentiments are pretty well known. I shall only
observe now that lenient measures have had no other effect than to
produce insult after insult; that the more we conceded, the higher
America rose in her demands, and the more insolent she has grown. It
is for this reason that I am now for the most effective and decisive
measures; and am of opinion that no alternative is left us, but to
relinquish America for ever, or finally determine to compel her to
acknowledge the legislative authority of this country; and it is the
principle of an unconditional submission I would be for maintaining."

Can words be more expressive than these? Surely the Tories will
believe the Tory lords! The truth is, they do believe them and know
as fully as any Whig on the continent knows, that the king and
ministry never had the least design of an accommodation with America,
but an absolute, unconditional conquest. And the part which the
Tories were to act, was, by downright lying, to endeavor to put the
continent off its guard, and to divide and sow discontent in the
minds of such Whigs as they might gain an influence over. In short,
to keep up a distraction here, that the force sent from England might
be able to conquer in "one campaign." They and the ministry were, by
a different game, playing into each other's hands. The cry of the
Tories in England was, "No reconciliation, no accommodation," in
order to obtain the greater military force; while those in America
were crying nothing but "reconciliation and accommodation," that the
force sent might conquer with the less resistance.

But this "single campaign" is over, and America not conquered. The
whole work is yet to do, and the force much less to do it with. Their
condition is both despicable and deplorable: out of cash- out of
heart, and out of hope. A country furnished with arms and ammunition
as America now is, with three millions of inhabitants, and three
thousand miles distant from the nearest enemy that can approach her,
is able to look and laugh them in the face.

Howe appears to have two objects in view, either to go up the North
River, or come to Philadelphia.

By going up the North River, he secures a retreat for his army
through Canada, but the ships must return if they return at all, the
same way they went; as our army would be in the rear, the safety of
their passage down is a doubtful matter. By such a motion he shuts
himself from all supplies from Europe, but through Canada, and
exposes his army and navy to the danger of perishing. The idea of his
cutting off the communication between the eastern and southern
states, by means of the North River, is merely visionary. He cannot
do it by his shipping; because no ship can lay long at anchor in any
river within reach of the shore; a single gun would drive a first
rate from such a station. This was fully proved last October at Forts
Washington and Lee, where one gun only, on each side of the river,
obliged two frigates to cut and be towed off in an hour's time.
Neither can he cut it off by his army; because the several posts they
must occupy would divide them almost to nothing, and expose them to
be picked up by ours like pebbles on a river's bank; but admitting
that he could, where is the injury? Because, while his whole force is
cantoned out, as sentries over the water, they will be very
innocently employed, and the moment they march into the country the
communication opens.

The most probable object is Philadelphia, and the reasons are many.
Howe's business is to conquer it, and in proportion as he finds
himself unable to the task, he will employ his strength to distress
women and weak minds, in order to accomplish through their fears what
he cannot accomplish by his own force. His coming or attempting to
come to Philadelphia is a circumstance that proves his weakness: for
no general that felt himself able to take the field and attack his
antagonist would think of bringing his army into a city in the summer
time; and this mere shifting the scene from place to place, without
effecting any thing, has feebleness and cowardice on the face of it,
and holds him up in a contemptible light to all who can reason justly
and firmly. By several informations from New York, it appears that
their army in general, both officers and men, have given up the
expectation of conquering America; their eye now is fixed upon the
spoil. They suppose Philadelphia to be rich with stores, and as they
think to get more by robbing a town than by attacking an army, their
movement towards this city is probable. We are not now contending
against an army of soldiers, but against a band of thieves, who had
rather plunder than fight, and have no other hope of conquest than by
cruelty.

They expect to get a mighty booty, and strike another general panic,
by making a sudden movement and getting possession of this city; but
unless they can march out as well as in, or get the entire command of
the river, to remove off their plunder, they may probably be stopped
with the stolen goods upon them. They have never yet succeeded
wherever they have been opposed, but at Fort Washington. At
Charleston their defeat was effectual. At Ticonderoga they ran away.
In every skirmish at Kingsbridge and the White Plains they were
obliged to retreat, and the instant that our arms were turned upon
them in the Jerseys, they turned likewise, and those that turned not
were taken.

The necessity of always fitting our internal police to the
circumstances of the times we live in, is something so strikingly
obvious, that no sufficient objection can be made against it. The
safety of all societies depends upon it; and where this point is not
attended to, the consequences will either be a general languor or a
tumult. The encouragement and protection of the good subjects of any
state, and the suppression and punishment of bad ones, are the
principal objects for which all authority is instituted, and the line
in which it ought to operate. We have in this city a strange variety
of men and characters, and the circumstances of the times require
that they should be publicly known; it is not the number of Tories
that hurt us, so much as the not finding out who they are; men must
now take one side or the other, and abide by the consequences: the
Quakers, trusting to their short-sighted sagacity, have, most
unluckily for them, made their declaration in their last Testimony,
and we ought now to take them at their word. They have involuntarily
read themselves out of the continental meeting, and cannot hope to be
restored to it again but by payment and penitence. Men whose
political principles are founded on avarice, are beyond the reach of
reason, and the only cure of Toryism of this cast is to tax it. A
substantial good drawn from a real evil, is of the same benefit to
society, as if drawn from a virtue; and where men have not public
spirit to render themselves serviceable, it ought to be the study of
government to draw the best use possible from their vices. When the
governing passion of any man, or set of men, is once known, the
method of managing them is easy; for even misers, whom no public
virtue can impress, would become generous, could a heavy tax be laid
upon covetousness.

The Tories have endeavored to insure their property with the enemy,
by forfeiting their reputation with us; from which may be justly
inferred, that their governing passion is avarice. Make them as much
afraid of losing on one side as on the other, and you stagger their
Toryism; make them more so, and you reclaim them; for their principle
is to worship the power which they are most afraid of.

This method of considering men and things together, opens into a
large field for speculation, and affords me an opportunity of
offering some observations on the state of our currency, so as to
make the support of it go hand in hand with the suppression of
disaffection and the encouragement of public spirit.

The thing which first presents itself in inspecting the state of the
currency, is, that we have too much of it, and that there is a
necessity of reducing the quantity, in order to increase the value.
Men are daily growing poor by the very means that they take to get
rich; for in the same proportion that the prices of all goods on hand
are raised, the value of all money laid by is reduced. A simple case
will make this clear; let a man have 100 L. in cash, and as many
goods on hand as will to-day sell for 20 L.; but not content with the
present market price, he raises them to 40 L. and by so doing obliges
others, in their own defence, to raise cent. per cent. likewise; in
this case it is evident that his hundred pounds laid by, is reduced
fifty pounds in value; whereas, had the market lowered cent. per
cent., his goods would have sold but for ten, but his hundred pounds
would have risen in value to two hundred; because it would then
purchase as many goods again, or support his family as long again as
before. And, strange as it may seem, he is one hundred and fifty
pounds the poorer for raising his goods, to what he would have been
had he lowered them; because the forty pounds which his goods sold
for, is, by the general raise of the market cent. per cent., rendered
of no more value than the ten pounds would be had the market fallen
in the same proportion; and, consequently, the whole difference of
gain or loss is on the difference in value of the hundred pounds laid
by, viz. from fifty to two hundred. This rage for raising goods is
for several reasons much more the fault of the Tories than the Whigs;
and yet the Tories (to their shame and confusion ought they to be
told of it) are by far the most noisy and discontented. The greatest
part of the Whigs, by being now either in the army or employed in
some public service, are buyers only and not sellers, and as this
evil has its origin in trade, it cannot be charged on those who are
out of it.

But the grievance has now become too general to be remedied by
partial methods, and the only effectual cure is to reduce the
quantity of money: with half the quantity we should be richer than we
are now, because the value of it would be doubled, and consequently
our attachment to it increased; for it is not the number of dollars
that a man has, but how far they will go, that makes him either rich
or poor. These two points being admitted, viz. that the quantity of
money is too great, and that the prices of goods can only be
effectually reduced by, reducing the quantity of the money, the next
point to be considered is, the method how to reduce it.

The circumstances of the times, as before observed, require that the
public characters of all men should now be fully understood, and the
only general method of ascertaining it is by an oath or affirmation,
renouncing all allegiance to the king of Great Britain, and to
support the independence of the United States, as declared by
Congress. Let, at the same time, a tax of ten, fifteen, or twenty per
cent. per annum, to be collected quarterly, be levied on all
property. These alternatives, by being perfectly voluntary, will take
in all sorts of people. Here is the test; here is the tax. He who
takes the former, conscientiously proves his affection to the cause,
and binds himself to pay his quota by the best services in his power,
and is thereby justly exempt from the latter; and those who choose
the latter, pay their quota in money, to be excused from the former,
or rather, it is the price paid to us for their supposed, though
mistaken, insurance with the enemy.

But this is only a part of the advantage which would arise by knowing
the different characters of men. The Whigs stake everything on the
issue of their arms, while the Tories, by their disaffection, are
sapping and undermining their strength; and, of consequence, the
property of the Whigs is the more exposed thereby; and whatever
injury their estates may sustain by the movements of the enemy, must
either be borne by themselves, who have done everything which has yet
been done, or by the Tories, who have not only done nothing, but
have, by their disaffection, invited the enemy on.

In the present crisis we ought to know, square by square and house by
house, who are in real allegiance with the United Independent States,
and who are not. Let but the line be made clear and distinct, and all
men will then know what they are to trust to. It would not only be
good policy but strict justice, to raise fifty or one hundred
thousand pounds, or more, if it is necessary, out of the estates and
property of the king of England's votaries, resident in Philadelphia,
to be distributed, as a reward to those inhabitants of the city and
State, who should turn out and repulse the enemy, should they attempt
to march this way; and likewise, to bind the property of all such
persons to make good the damages which that of the Whigs might
sustain. In the undistinguishable mode of conducting a war, we
frequently make reprisals at sea, on the vessels of persons in
England, who are friends to our cause compared with the resident
Tories among us.

In every former publication of mine, from Common Sense down to the
last Crisis, I have generally gone on the charitable supposition,
that the Tories were rather a mistaken than a criminal people, and
have applied argument after argument, with all the candor and temper
which I was capable of, in order to set every part of the case
clearly and fairly before them, and if possible to reclaim them from
ruin to reason. I have done my duty by them and have now done with
that doctrine, taking it for granted, that those who yet hold their
disaffection are either a set of avaricious miscreants, who would
sacrifice the continent to save themselves, or a banditti of hungry
traitors, who are hoping for a division of the spoil. To which may be
added, a list of crown or proprietary dependants, who, rather than go
without a portion of power, would be content to share it with the
devil. Of such men there is no hope; and their obedience will only be
according to the danger set before them, and the power that is
exercised over them.

A time will shortly arrive, in which, by ascertaining the characters
of persons now, we shall be guarded against their mischiefs then; for
in proportion as the enemy despair of conquest, they will be trying
the arts of seduction and the force of fear by all the mischiefs
which they can inflict. But in war we may be certain of these two
things, viz. that cruelty in an enemy, and motions made with more
than usual parade, are always signs of weakness. He that can conquer,
finds his mind too free and pleasant to be brutish; and he that
intends to conquer, never makes too much show of his strength.

We now know the enemy we have to do with. While drunk with the
certainty of victory, they disdained to be civil; and in proportion
as disappointment makes them sober, and their apprehensions of an
European war alarm them, they will become cringing and artful; honest
they cannot be. But our answer to them, in either condition they may
be in, is short and full- "As free and independent States we are
willing to make peace with you to-morrow, but we neither can hear nor
reply in any other character."

If Britain cannot conquer us, it proves that she is neither able to
govern nor protect us, and our particular situation now is such, that
any connection with her would be unwisely exchanging a half-defeated
enemy for two powerful ones. Europe, by every appearance, is now on
the eve, nay, on the morning twilight of a war, and any alliance with
George the Third brings France and Spain upon our backs; a separation
from him attaches them to our side; therefore, the only road to
peace, honor and commerce is Independence.

    PHILADELPHIA, April 19, 1777.


                            The Crisis 

                                  IV.

THOSE who expect to reap the blessings of freedom, must, like men,
undergo the fatigues of supporting it. The event of yesterday was one
of those kind of alarms which is just sufficient to rouse us to duty,
without being of consequence enough to depress our fortitude. It is
not a field of a few acres of ground, but a cause, that we are
defending, and whether we defeat the enemy in one battle, or by
degrees, the consequences will be the same.

Look back at the events of last winter and the present year, there
you will find that the enemy's successes always contributed to reduce
them. What they have gained in ground, they paid so dearly for in
numbers, that their victories have in the end amounted to defeats. We
have always been masters at the last push, and always shall be while
we do our duty. Howe has been once on the banks of the Delaware, and
from thence driven back with loss and disgrace: and why not be again
driven from the Schuylkill? His condition and ours are very
different. He has everybody to fight, we have only his one army to
cope with, and which wastes away at every engagement: we can not only
reinforce, but can redouble our numbers; he is cut off from all
supplies, and must sooner or later inevitably fall into our hands.

Shall a band of ten or twelve thousand robbers, who are this day
fifteen hundred or two thousand men less in strength than they were
yesterday, conquer America, or subdue even a single state? The thing
cannot be, unless we sit down and suffer them to do it. Another such
a brush, notwithstanding we lost the ground, would, by still reducing
the enemy, put them in a condition to be afterwards totally defeated.
Could our whole army have come up to the attack at one time, the
consequences had probably been otherwise; but our having different
parts of the Brandywine creek to guard, and the uncertainty which
road to Philadelphia the enemy would attempt to take, naturally
afforded them an opportunity of passing with their main body at a
place where only a part of ours could be posted; for it must strike
every thinking man with conviction, that it requires a much greater
force to oppose an enemy in several places, than is sufficient to
defeat him in any one place.

Men who are sincere in defending their freedom, will always feel
concern at every circumstance which seems to make against them; it is
the natural and honest consequence of all affectionate attachments,
and the want of it is a vice. But the dejection lasts only for a
moment; they soon rise out of it with additional vigor; the glow of
hope, courage and fortitude, will, in a little time, supply the place
of every inferior passion, and kindle the whole heart into heroism.

There is a mystery in the countenance of some causes, which we have
not always present judgment enough to explain. It is distressing to
see an enemy advancing into a country, but it is the only place in
which we can beat them, and in which we have always beaten them,
whenever they made the attempt. The nearer any disease approaches to
a crisis, the nearer it is to a cure. Danger and deliverance make
their advances together, and it is only the last push, in which one
or the other takes the lead.

There are many men who will do their duty when it is not wanted; but
a genuine public spirit always appears most when there is most
occasion for it. Thank God! our army, though fatigued, is yet entire.
The attack made by us yesterday, was under many disadvantages,
naturally arising from the uncertainty of knowing which route the
enemy would take; and, from that circumstance, the whole of our force
could not be brought up together time enough to engage all at once.
Our strength is yet reserved; and it is evident that Howe does not
think himself a gainer by the affair, otherwise he would this morning
have moved down and attacked General Washington.

Gentlemen of the city and country, it is in your power, by a spirited
improvement of the present circumstance, to turn it to a real
advantage. Howe is now weaker than before, and every shot will
contribute to reduce him. You are more immediately interested than
any other part of the continent: your all is at stake; it is not so
with the general cause; you are devoted by the enemy to plunder and
destruction: it is the encouragement which Howe, the chief of
plunderers, has promised his army. Thus circumstanced, you may save
yourselves by a manly resistance, but you can have no hope in any
other conduct. I never yet knew our brave general, or any part of the
army, officers or men, out of heart, and I have seen them in
circumstances a thousand times more trying than the present. It is
only those that are not in action, that feel languor and heaviness,
and the best way to rub it off is to turn out, and make sure work of
it.

Our army must undoubtedly feel fatigue, and want a reinforcement of
rest though not of valor. Our own interest and happiness call upon us
to give them every support in our power, and make the burden of the
day, on which the safety of this city depends, as light as possible.
Remember, gentlemen, that we have forces both to the northward and
southward of Philadelphia, and if the enemy be but stopped till those
can arrive, this city will be saved, and the enemy finally routed.
You have too much at stake to hesitate. You ought not to think an
hour upon the matter, but to spring to action at once. Other states
have been invaded, have likewise driven off the invaders. Now our
time and turn is come, and perhaps the finishing stroke is reserved
for us. When we look back on the dangers we have been saved from, and
reflect on the success we have been blessed with, it would be sinful
either to be idle or to despair.

I close this paper with a short address to General Howe. You, sir,
are only lingering out the period that shall bring with it your
defeat. You have yet scarce began upon the war, and the further you
enter, the faster will your troubles thicken. What you now enjoy is
only a respite from ruin; an invitation to destruction; something
that will lead on to our deliverance at your expense. We know the
cause which we are engaged in, and though a passionate fondness for
it may make us grieve at every injury which threatens it, yet, when
the moment of concern is over, the determination to duty returns. We
are not moved by the gloomy smile of a worthless king, but by the
ardent glow of generous patriotism. We fight not to enslave, but to
set a country free, and to make room upon the earth for honest men to
live in. In such a case we are sure that we are right; and we leave
to you the despairing reflection of being the tool of a miserable
tyrant.

                                           COMMON SENSE.

    PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 12, 1777.


                             THE CRISIS.

                                  V.

                         TO GEN. SIR WILLIAM HOWE.

TO argue with a man who has renounced the use and authority of
reason, and whose philosophy consists in holding humanity in
contempt, is like administering medicine to the dead, or endeavoring
to convert an atheist by scripture. Enjoy, sir, your insensibility of
feeling and reflecting. It is the prerogative of animals. And no man
will envy you these honors, in which a savage only can be your rival
and a bear your master.

As the generosity of this country rewarded your brother's services in
the last war, with an elegant monument in Westminster Abbey, it is
consistent that she should bestow some mark of distinction upon you.
You certainly deserve her notice, and a conspicuous place in the
catalogue of extraordinary persons. Yet it would be a pity to pass
you from the world in state, and consign you to magnificent oblivion
among the tombs, without telling the future beholder why. Judas is as
much known as John, yet history ascribes their fame to very different
actions.

Sir William has undoubtedly merited a monument; but of what kind, or
with what inscription, where placed or how embellished, is a question
that would puzzle all the heralds of St. James's in the profoundest
mood of historical deliberation. We are at no loss, sir, to ascertain
your real character, but somewhat perplexed how to perpetuate its
identity, and preserve it uninjured from the transformations of time
or mistake. A statuary may give a false expression to your bust, or
decorate it with some equivocal emblems, by which you may happen to
steal into reputation and impose upon the hereafter traditionary
world. Ill nature or ridicule may conspire, or a variety of accidents
combine to lessen, enlarge, or change Sir William's fame; and no
doubt but he who has taken so much pains to be singular in his
conduct, would choose to be just as singular in his exit, his
monument and his epitaph.

The usual honors of the dead, to be sure, are not sufficiently
sublime to escort a character like you to the republic of dust and
ashes; for however men may differ in their ideas of grandeur or of
government here, the grave is nevertheless a perfect republic. Death
is not the monarch of the dead, but of the dying. The moment he
obtains a conquest he loses a subject, and, like the foolish king you
serve, will, in the end, war himself out of all his dominions.

As a proper preliminary towards the arrangement of your funeral
honors, we readily admit of your new rank of knighthood. The title is
perfectly in character, and is your own, more by merit than creation.
There are knights of various orders, from the knight of the windmill
to the knight of the post. The former is your patron for exploits,
and the latter will assist you in settling your accounts. No honorary
title could be more happily applied! The ingenuity is sublime! And
your royal master has discovered more genius in fitting you
therewith, than in generating the most finished figure for a button,
or descanting on the properties of a button mould.

But how, sir, shall we dispose of you? The invention of a statuary is
exhausted, and Sir William is yet unprovided with a monument. America
is anxious to bestow her funeral favors upon you, and wishes to do it
in a manner that shall distinguish you from all the deceased heroes
of the last war. The Egyptian method of embalming is not known to the
present age, and hieroglyphical pageantry hath outlived the science
of deciphering it. Some other method, therefore, must be thought of
to immortalize the new knight of the windmill and post. Sir William,
thanks to his stars, is not oppressed with very delicate ideas. He
has no ambition of being wrapped up and handed about in myrrh, aloes
and cassia. Less expensive odors will suffice; and it fortunately
happens that the simple genius of America has discovered the art of
preserving bodies, and embellishing them too, with much greater
frugality than the ancients. In balmage, sir, of humble tar, you will
be as secure as Pharaoh, and in a hieroglyphic of feathers, rival in
finery all the mummies of Egypt.

As you have already made your exit from the moral world, and by
numberless acts both of passionate and deliberate injustice engraved
an "here lieth" on your deceased honor, it must be mere affectation
in you to pretend concern at the humors or opinions of mankind
respecting you. What remains of you may expire at any time. The
sooner the better. For he who survives his reputation, lives out of
despite of himself, like a man listening to his own reproach.

Thus entombed and ornamented, I leave you to the inspection of the
curious, and return to the history of your yet surviving actions. The
character of Sir William has undergone some extraordinary
revolutions. since his arrival in America. It is now fixed and known;
and we have nothing to hope from your candor or to fear from your
capacity. Indolence and inability have too large a share in your
composition, ever to suffer you to be anything more than the hero of
little villainies and unfinished adventures. That, which to some
persons appeared moderation in you at first, was not produced by any
real virtue of your own, but by a contrast of passions, dividing and
holding you in perpetual irresolution. One vice will frequently expel
another, without the least merit in the man; as powers in contrary
directions reduce each other to rest.

It became you to have supported a dignified solemnity of character;
to have shown a superior liberality of soul; to have won respect by
an obstinate perseverance in maintaining order, and to have exhibited
on all occasions such an unchangeable graciousness of conduct, that
while we beheld in you the resolution of an enemy, we might admire in
you the sincerity of a man. You came to America under the high
sounding titles of commander and commissioner; not only to suppress
what you call rebellion, by arms, but to shame it out of countenance
by the excellence of your example. Instead of which, you have been
the patron of low and vulgar frauds, the encourager of Indian
cruelties; and have imported a cargo of vices blacker than those
which you pretend to suppress.

Mankind are not universally agreed in their determination of right
and wrong; but there are certain actions which the consent of all
nations and individuals has branded with the unchangeable name of
meanness. In the list of human vices we find some of such a refined
constitution, they cannot be carried into practice without seducing
some virtue to their assistance; but meanness has neither alliance
nor apology. It is generated in the dust and sweepings of other
vices, and is of such a hateful figure that all the rest conspire to
disown it. Sir William, the commissioner of George the Third, has at
last vouchsafed to give it rank and pedigree. He has placed the
fugitive at the council board, and dubbed it companion of the order
of knighthood.

The particular act of meanness which I allude to in this description,
is forgery. You, sir, have abetted and patronized the forging and
uttering counterfeit continental bills. In the same New York
newspapers in which your own proclamation under your master's
authority was published, offering, or pretending to offer, pardon and
protection to these states, there were repeated advertisements of
counterfeit money for sale, and persons who have come officially from
you, and under the sanction of your flag, have been taken up in
attempting to put them off.

A conduct so basely mean in a public character is without precedent
or pretence. Every nation on earth, whether friends or enemies, will
unite in despising you. 'Tis an incendiary war upon society, which
nothing can excuse or palliate,- an improvement upon beggarly
villany- and shows an inbred wretchedness of heart made up between
the venomous malignity of a serpent and the spiteful imbecility of an
inferior reptile.

The laws of any civilized country would condemn you to the gibbet
without regard to your rank or titles, because it is an action
foreign to the usage and custom of war; and should you fall into our
hands, which pray God you may, it will be a doubtful matter whether
we are to consider you as a military prisoner or a prisoner for
felony.

Besides, it is exceedingly unwise and impolitic in you, or any other
persons in the English service, to promote or even encourage, or wink
at the crime of forgery, in any case whatever. Because, as the riches
of England, as a nation, are chiefly in paper, and the far greater
part of trade among individuals is carried on by the same medium,
that is, by notes and drafts on one another, they, therefore, of all
people in the world, ought to endeavor to keep forgery out of sight,
and, if possible, not to revive the idea of it. It is dangerous to
make men familiar with a crime which they may afterwards practise to
much greater advantage against those who first taught them. Several
officers in the English army have made their exit at the gallows for
forgery on their agents; for we all know, who know any thing of
England, that there is not a more necessitous body of men, taking
them generally, than what the English officers are. They contrive to
make a show at the expense of the tailors, and appear clean at the
charge of the washer-women.

England, has at this time, nearly two hundred million pounds sterling
of public money in paper, for which she has no real property: besides
a large circulation of bank notes, bank post bills, and promissory
notes and drafts of private bankers, merchants and tradesmen. She has
the greatest quantity of paper currency and the least quantity of
gold and silver of any nation in Europe; the real specie, which is
about sixteen millions sterling, serves only as change in large sums,
which are always made in paper, or for payment in small ones. Thus
circumstanced, the nation is put to its wit's end, and obliged to be
severe almost to criminality, to prevent the practice and growth of
forgery. Scarcely a session passes at the Old Bailey, or an execution
at Tyburn, but witnesses this truth, yet you, sir, regardless of the
policy which her necessity obliges her to adopt, have made your whole
army intimate with the crime. And as all armies at the conclusion of
a war, are too apt to carry into practice the vices of the campaign,
it will probably happen, that England will hereafter abound in
forgeries, to which art the practitioners were first initiated under
your authority in America. You, sir, have the honor of adding a new
vice to the military catalogue; and the reason, perhaps, why the
invention was reserved for you, is, because no general before was
mean enough even to think of it.

That a man whose soul is absorbed in the low traffic of vulgar vice,
is incapable of moving in any superior region, is clearly shown in
you by the event of every campaign. Your military exploits have been
without plan, object or decision. Can it be possible that you or your
employers suppose that the possession of Philadelphia will be any
ways equal to the expense or expectation of the nation which supports
you? What advantages does England derive from any achievements of
yours? To her it is perfectly indifferent what place you are in, so
long as the business of conquest is unperformed and the charge of
maintaining you remains the same.

If the principal events of the three campaigns be attended to, the
balance will appear against you at the close of each; but the last,
in point of importance to us, has exceeded the former two. It is
pleasant to look back on dangers past, and equally as pleasant to
meditate on present ones when the way out begins to appear. That
period is now arrived, and the long doubtful winter of war is
changing to the sweeter prospects of victory and joy. At the close of
the campaign, in 1775, you were obliged to retreat from Boston. In
the summer of 1776, you appeared with a numerous fleet and army in
the harbor of New York. By what miracle the continent was preserved
in that season of danger is a subject of admiration! If instead of
wasting your time against Long Island you had run up the North River,
and landed any where above New York, the consequence must have been,
that either you would have compelled General Washington to fight you
with very unequal numbers, or he must have suddenly evacuated the
city with the loss of nearly all the stores of his army, or have
surrendered for want of provisions; the situation of the place
naturally producing one or the other of these events.

The preparations made to defend New York were, nevertheless, wise and
military; because your forces were then at sea, their numbers
uncertain; storms, sickness, or a variety of accidents might have
disabled their coming, or so diminished them on their passage, that
those which survived would have been incapable of opening the
campaign with any prospect of success; in which case the defence
would have been sufficient and the place preserved; for cities that
have been raised from nothing with an infinitude of labor and
expense, are not to be thrown away on the bare probability of their
being taken. On these grounds the preparations made to maintain New
York were as judicious as the retreat afterwards. While you, in the
interim, let slip the very opportunity which seemed to put conquest
in your power.

Through the whole of that campaign you had nearly double the forces
which General Washington immediately commanded. The principal plan at
that time, on our part, was to wear away the season with as little
loss as possible, and to raise the army for the next year. Long
Island, New York, Forts Washington and Lee were not defended after
your superior force was known under any expectation of their being
finally maintained, but as a range of outworks, in the attacking of
which your time might be wasted, your numbers reduced, and your
vanity amused by possessing them on our retreat. It was intended to
have withdrawn the garrison from Fort Washington after it had
answered the former of those purposes, but the fate of that day put a
prize into your hands without much honor to yourselves.

Your progress through the Jerseys was accidental; you had it not even
in contemplation, or you would not have sent a principal part of your
forces to Rhode Island beforehand. The utmost hope of America in the
year 1776, reached no higher than that she might not then be
conquered. She had no expectation of defeating you in that campaign.
Even the most cowardly Tory allowed, that, could she withstand the
shock of that summer, her independence would be past a doubt. You had
then greatly the advantage of her. You were formidable. Your military
knowledge was supposed to be complete. Your fleets and forces arrived
without an accident. You had neither experience nor reinforcements to
wait for. You had nothing to do but to begin, and your chance lay in
the first vigorous onset.

America was young and unskilled. She was obliged to trust her defence
to time and practice; and has, by mere dint of perseverance,
maintained her cause, and brought the enemy to a condition, in which
she is now capable of meeting him on any grounds.

It is remarkable that in the campaign of 1776 you gained no more,
notwithstanding your great force, than what was given you by consent
of evacuation, except Fort Washington; while every advantage obtained
by us was by fair and hard fighting. The defeat of Sir Peter Parker
was complete. The conquest of the Hessians at Trenton, by the remains
of a retreating army, which but a few days before you affected to
despise, is an instance of their heroic perseverance very seldom to
be met with. And the victory over the British troops at Princeton, by
a harassed and wearied party, who had been engaged the day before and
marched all night without refreshment, is attended with such a scene
of circumstances and superiority of generalship, as will ever give it
a place in the first rank in the history of great actions.

When I look back on the gloomy days of last winter, and see America
suspended by a thread, I feel a triumph of joy at the recollection of
her delivery, and a reverence for the characters which snatched her
from destruction. To doubt now would be a species of infidelity, and
to forget the instruments which saved us then would be ingratitude.

The close of that campaign left us with the spirit of conquerors. The
northern districts were relieved by the retreat of General Carleton
over the lakes. The army under your command were hunted back and had
their bounds prescribed. The continent began to feel its military
importance, and the winter passed pleasantly away in preparations for
the next campaign.

However confident you might be on your first arrival, the result of
the year 1776 gave you some idea of the difficulty, if not
impossibility of conquest. To this reason I ascribe your delay in
opening the campaign of 1777. The face of matters, on the close of
the former year, gave you no encouragement to pursue a discretionary
war as soon as the spring admitted the taking the field; for though
conquest, in that case, would have given you a double portion of
fame, yet the experiment was too hazardous. The ministry, had you
failed, would have shifted the whole blame upon you, charged you with
having acted without orders, and condemned at once both your plan and
execution.

To avoid the misfortunes, which might have involved you and your
money accounts in perplexity and suspicion, you prudently waited the
arrival of a plan of operations from England, which was that you
should proceed for Philadelphia by way of the Chesapeake, and that
Burgoyne, after reducing Ticonderoga, should take his route by
Albany, and, if necessary, join you.

The splendid laurels of the last campaign have flourished in the
north. In that quarter America has surprised the world, and laid the
foundation of this year's glory. The conquest of Ticonderoga, (if it
may be called a conquest) has, like all your other victories, led on
to ruin. Even the provisions taken in that fortress (which by General
Burgoyne's return was sufficient in bread and flour for nearly 5000
men for ten weeks, and in beef and pork for the same number of men
for one month) served only to hasten his overthrow, by enabling him
to proceed to Saratoga, the place of his destruction. A short review
of the operations of the last campaign will show the condition of
affairs on both sides.

You have taken Ticonderoga and marched into Philadelphia. These are
all the events which the year has produced on your part. A trifling
campaign indeed, compared with the expenses of England and the
conquest of the continent. On the other side, a considerable part of
your northern force has been routed by the New York militia under
General Herkemer. Fort Stanwix has bravely survived a compound attack
of soldiers and savages, and the besiegers have fled. The Battle of
Bennington has put a thousand prisoners into our hands, with all
their arms, stores, artillery and baggage. General Burgoyne, in two
engagements, has been defeated; himself, his army, and all that were
his and theirs are now ours. Ticonderoga and Independence [forts] are
retaken, and not the shadow of an enemy remains in all the northern
districts. At this instant we have upwards of eleven thousand
prisoners, between sixty and seventy [captured] pieces of brass
ordnance, besides small arms, tents, stores, etc.

In order to know the real value of those advantages, we must reverse
the scene, and suppose General Gates and the force he commanded to be
at your mercy as prisoners, and General Burgoyne, with his army of
soldiers and savages, to be already joined to you in Pennsylvania. So
dismal a picture can scarcely be looked at. It has all the tracings
and colorings of horror and despair; and excites the most swelling
emotions of gratitude by exhibiting the miseries we are so graciously
preserved from.

I admire the distribution of laurels around the continent. It is the
earnest of future union. South Carolina has had her day of sufferings
and of fame; and the other southern States have exerted themselves in
proportion to the force that invaded or insulted them. Towards the
close of the campaign, in 1776, these middle States were called upon
and did their duty nobly. They were witnesses to the almost expiring
flame of human freedom. It was the close struggle of life and death,
the line of invisible division; and on which the unabated fortitude
of a Washington prevailed, and saved the spark that has since blazed
in the north with unrivalled lustre.

Let me ask, sir, what great exploits have you performed? Through all
the variety of changes and opportunities which the war has produced,
I know no one action of yours that can be styled masterly. You have
moved in and out, backward and forward, round and round, as if valor
consisted in a military jig. The history and figure of your movements
would be truly ridiculous could they be justly delineated. They
resemble the labors of a puppy pursuing his tail; the end is still at
the same distance, and all the turnings round must be done over again.

The first appearance of affairs at Ticonderoga wore such an
unpromising aspect, that it was necessary, in July, to detach a part
of the forces to the support of that quarter, which were otherwise
destined or intended to act against you; and this, perhaps, has been
the means of postponing your downfall to another campaign. The
destruction of one army at a time is work enough. We know, sir, what
we are about, what we have to do, and how to do it.

Your progress from the Chesapeake, was marked by no capital stroke of
policy or heroism. Your principal aim was to get General Washington
between the Delaware and Schuylkill, and between Philadelphia and
your army. In that situation, with a river on each of his flanks,
which united about five miles below the city, and your army above
him, you could have intercepted his reinforcements and supplies, cut
off all his communication with the country, and, if necessary, have
despatched assistance to open a passage for General Burgoyne. This
scheme was too visible to succeed: for had General Washington
suffered you to command the open country above him, I think it a very
reasonable conjecture that the conquest of Burgoyne would not have
taken place, because you could, in that case, have relieved him. It
was therefore necessary, while that important victory was in
suspense, to trepan you into a situation in which you could only be
on the defensive, without the power of affording him assistance. The
manoeuvre had its effect, and Burgoyne was conquered.

There has been something unmilitary and passive in you from the time
of your passing the Schuylkill and getting possession of
Philadelphia, to the close of the campaign. You mistook a trap for a
conquest, the probability of which had been made known to Europe, and
the edge of your triumph taken off by our own information long before.

Having got you into this situation, a scheme for a general attack
upon you at Germantown was carried into execution on the 4th of
October, and though the success was not equal to the excellence of
the plan, yet the attempting it proved the genius of America to be on
the rise, and her power approaching to superiority. The obscurity of
the morning was your best friend, for a fog is always favorable to a
hunted enemy. Some weeks after this you likewise planned an attack on
General Washington while at Whitemarsh. You marched out with infinite
parade, but on finding him preparing to attack you next morning, you
prudently turned about, and retreated to Philadelphia with all the
precipitation of a man conquered in imagination.

Immediately after the battle of Germantown, the probability of
Burgoyne's defeat gave a new policy to affairs in Pennsylvania, and
it was judged most consistent with the general safety of America, to
wait the issue of the northern campaign. Slow and sure is sound work.
The news of that victory arrived in our camp on the 18th of October,
and no sooner did that shout of joy, and the report of the thirteen
cannon reach your ears, than you resolved upon a retreat, and the
next day, that is, on the 19th, you withdrew your drooping army into
Philadelphia. This movement was evidently dictated by fear; and
carried with it a positive confession that you dreaded a second
attack. It was hiding yourself among women and children, and sleeping
away the choicest part of the campaign in expensive inactivity. An
army in a city can never be a conquering army. The situation admits
only of defence. It is mere shelter: and every military power in
Europe will conclude you to be eventually defeated.

The time when you made this retreat was the very time you ought to
have fought a battle, in order to put yourself in condition of
recovering in Pennsylvania what you had lost in Saratoga. And the
reason why you did not, must be either prudence or cowardice; the
former supposes your inability, and the latter needs no explanation.
I draw no conclusions, sir, but such as are naturally deduced from
known and visible facts, and such as will always have a being while
the facts which produced them remain unaltered.

After this retreat a new difficulty arose which exhibited the power
of Britain in a very contemptible light; which was the attack and
defence of Mud Island. For several weeks did that little unfinished
fortress stand out against all the attempts of Admiral and General
Howe. It was the fable of Bender realized on the Delaware. Scheme
after scheme, and force upon force were tried and defeated. The
garrison, with scarce anything to cover them but their bravery,
survived in the midst of mud, shot and shells, and were at last
obliged to give it up more to the powers of time and gunpowder than
to military superiority of the besiegers.

It is my sincere opinion that matters are in much worse condition
with you than what is generally known. Your master's speech at the
opening of Parliament, is like a soliloquy on ill luck. It shows him
to be coming a little to his reason, for sense of pain is the first
symptom of recovery, in profound stupefaction. His condition is
deplorable. He is obliged to submit to all the insults of France and
Spain, without daring to know or resent them; and thankful for the
most trivial evasions to the most humble remonstrances. The time was
when he could not deign an answer to a petition from America, and the
time now is when he dare not give an answer to an affront from
France. The capture of Burgoyne's army will sink his consequence as
much in Europe as in America. In his speech he expresses his
suspicions at the warlike preparations of France and Spain, and as he
has only the one army which you command to support his character in
the world with, it remains very uncertain when, or in what quarter it
will be most wanted, or can be best employed; and this will partly
account for the great care you take to keep it from action and
attacks, for should Burgoyne's fate be yours, which it probably will,
England may take her endless farewell not only of all America but of
all the West Indies.

Never did a nation invite destruction upon itself with the eagerness
and the ignorance with which Britain has done. Bent upon the ruin of
a young and unoffending country, she has drawn the sword that has
wounded herself to the heart, and in the agony of her resentment has
applied a poison for a cure. Her conduct towards America is a
compound of rage and lunacy; she aims at the government of it, yet
preserves neither dignity nor character in her methods to obtain it.
Were government a mere manufacture or article of commerce, immaterial
by whom it should be made or sold, we might as well employ her as
another, but when we consider it as the fountain from whence the
general manners and morality of a country take their rise, that the
persons entrusted with the execution thereof are by their serious
example an authority to support these principles, how abominably
absurd is the idea of being hereafter governed by a set of men who
have been guilty of forgery, perjury, treachery, theft and every
species of villany which the lowest wretches on earth could practise
or invent. What greater public curse can befall any country than to
be under such authority, and what greater blessing than to be
delivered therefrom. The soul of any man of sentiment would rise in
brave rebellion against them, and spurn them from the earth.

The malignant and venomous tempered General Vaughan has amused his
savage fancy in burning the whole town of Kingston, in York
government, and the late governor of that state, Mr. Tryon, in his
letter to General Parsons, has endeavored to justify it and declared
his wish to burn the houses of every committeeman in the country.
Such a confession from one who was once intrusted with the powers of
civil government, is a reproach to the character. But it is the wish
and the declaration of a man whom anguish and disappointment have
driven to despair, and who is daily decaying into the grave with
constitutional rottenness.

There is not in the compass of language a sufficiency of words to
express the baseness of your king, his ministry and his army. They
have refined upon villany till it wants a name. To the fiercer vices
of former ages they have added the dregs and scummings of the most
finished rascality, and are so completely sunk in serpentine deceit,
that there is not left among them one generous enemy.

From such men and such masters, may the gracious hand of Heaven
preserve America! And though the sufferings she now endures are
heavy, and severe, they are like straws in the wind compared to the
weight of evils she would feel under the government of your king, and
his pensioned Parliament.

There is something in meanness which excites a species of resentment
that never subsides, and something in cruelty which stirs up the
heart to the highest agony of human hatred; Britain has filled up
both these characters till no addition can be made, and has not
reputation left with us to obtain credit for the slightest promise.
The will of God has parted us, and the deed is registered for
eternity. When she shall be a spot scarcely visible among the
nations, America shall flourish the favorite of heaven, and the
friend of mankind.

For the domestic happiness of Britain and the peace of the world, I
wish she had not a foot of land but what is circumscribed within her
own island. Extent of dominion has been her ruin, and instead of
civilizing others has brutalized herself. Her late reduction of
India, under Clive and his successors, was not so properly a conquest
as an extermination of mankind. She is the only power who could
practise the prodigal barbarity of tying men to mouths of loaded
cannon and blowing them away. It happens that General Burgoyne, who
made the report of that horrid transaction, in the House of Commons,
is now a prisoner with us, and though an enemy, I can appeal to him
for the truth of it, being confident that he neither can nor will
deny it. Yet Clive received the approbation of the last Parliament.

When we take a survey of mankind, we cannot help cursing the wretch,
who, to the unavoidable misfortunes of nature, shall wilfully add the
calamities of war. One would think there were evils enough in the
world without studying to increase them, and that life is
sufficiently short without shaking the sand that measures it. The
histories of Alexander, and Charles of Sweden, are the histories of
human devils; a good man cannot think of their actions without
abhorrence, nor of their deaths without rejoicing. To see the
bounties of heaven destroyed, the beautiful face of nature laid
waste, and the choicest works of creation and art tumbled into ruin,
would fetch a curse from the soul of piety itself. But in this
country the aggravation is heightened by a new combination of
affecting circumstances. America was young, and, compared with other
countries, was virtuous. None but a Herod of uncommon malice would
have made war upon infancy and innocence: and none but a people of
the most finished fortitude, dared under those circumstances, have
resisted the tyranny. The natives, or their ancestors, had fled from
the former oppressions of England, and with the industry of bees had
changed a wilderness into a habitable world. To Britain they were
indebted for nothing. The country was the gift of heaven, and God
alone is their Lord and Sovereign.

The time, sir, will come when you, in a melancholy hour, shall reckon
up your miseries by your murders in America. Life, with you, begins
to wear a clouded aspect. The vision of pleasurable delusion is
wearing away, and changing to the barren wild of age and sorrow. The
poor reflection of having served your king will yield you no
consolation in your parting moments. He will crumble to the same
undistinguished ashes with yourself, and have sins enough of his own
to answer for. It is not the farcical benedictions of a bishop, nor
the cringing hypocrisy of a court of chaplains, nor the formality of
an act of Parliament, that can change guilt into innocence, or make
the punishment one pang the less. You may, perhaps, be unwilling to
be serious, but this destruction of the goods of Providence, this
havoc of the human race, and this sowing the world with mischief,
must be accounted for to him who made and governs it. To us they are
only present sufferings, but to him they are deep rebellions.

If there is a sin superior to every other, it is that of wilful and
offensive war. Most other sins are circumscribed within narrow
limits, that is, the power of one man cannot give them a very general
extension, and many kinds of sins have only a mental existence from
which no infection arises; but he who is the author of a war, lets
loose the whole contagion of hell, and opens a vein that bleeds a
nation to death. We leave it to England and Indians to boast of these
honors; we feel no thirst for such savage glory; a nobler flame, a
purer spirit animates America. She has taken up the sword of virtuous
defence; she has bravely put herself between Tyranny and Freedom,
between a curse and a blessing, determined to expel the one and
protect the other.

It is the object only of war that makes it honorable. And if there
was ever a just war since the world began, it is this in which
America is now engaged. She invaded no land of yours. She hired no
mercenaries to burn your towns, nor Indians to massacre their
inhabitants. She wanted nothing from you, and was indebted for
nothing to you: and thus circumstanced, her defence is honorable and
her prosperity is certain.

Yet it is not on the justice only, but likewise on the importance of
this cause that I ground my seeming enthusiastical confidence of our
success. The vast extension of America makes her of too much value in
the scale of Providence, to be cast like a pearl before swine, at the
feet of an European island; and of much less consequence would it be
that Britain were sunk in the sea than that America should miscarry.
There has been such a chain of extraordinary events in the discovery
of this country at first, in the peopling and planting it afterwards,
in the rearing and nursing it to its present state, and in the
protection of it through the present war, that no man can doubt, but
Providence has some nobler end to accomplish than the gratification
of the petty elector of Hanover, or the ignorant and insignificant
king of Britain.

As the blood of the martyrs has been the seed of the Christian
church, so the political persecutions of England will and have
already enriched America with industry, experience, union, and
importance. Before the present era she was a mere chaos of uncemented
colonies, individually exposed to the ravages of the Indians and the
invasion of any power that Britain should be at war with. She had
nothing that she could call her own. Her felicity depended upon
accident. The convulsions of Europe might have thrown her from one
conqueror to another, till she had been the slave of all, and ruined
by every one; for until she had spirit enough to become her own
master, there was no knowing to which master she should belong. That
period, thank God, is past, and she is no longer the dependent,
disunited colonies of Britain, but the independent and United States
of America, knowing no master but heaven and herself. You, or your
king, may call this "delusion," "rebellion," or what name you please.
To us it is perfectly indifferent. The issue will determine the
character, and time will give it a name as lasting as his own.

You have now, sir, tried the fate of three campaigns, and can fully
declare to England, that nothing is to be got on your part, but blows
and broken bones, and nothing on hers but waste of trade and credit,
and an increase of poverty and taxes. You are now only where you
might have been two years ago, without the loss of a single ship, and
yet not a step more forward towards the conquest of the continent;
because, as I have already hinted, "an army in a city can never be a
conquering army." The full amount of your losses, since the beginning
of the war, exceeds twenty thousand men, besides millions of
treasure, for which you have nothing in exchange. Our expenses,
though great, are circulated within ourselves. Yours is a direct
sinking of money, and that from both ends at once; first, in hiring
troops out of the nation, and in paying them afterwards, because the
money in neither case can return to Britain. We are already in
possession of the prize, you only in pursuit of it. To us it is a
real treasure, to you it would be only an empty triumph. Our expenses
will repay themselves with tenfold interest, while yours entail upon
you everlasting poverty.

Take a review, sir, of the ground which you have gone over, and let
it teach you policy, if it cannot honesty. You stand but on a very
tottering foundation. A change of the ministry in England may
probably bring your measures into question, and your head to the
block. Clive, with all his successes, had some difficulty in
escaping, and yours being all a war of losses, will afford you less
pretensions, and your enemies more grounds for impeachment.

Go home, sir, and endeavor to save the remains of your ruined
country, by a just representation of the madness of her measures. A
few moments, well applied, may yet preserve her from political
destruction. I am not one of those who wish to see Europe in a flame,
because I am persuaded that such an event will not shorten the war.
The rupture, at present, is confined between the two powers of
America and England. England finds that she cannot conquer America,
and America has no wish to conquer England. You are fighting for what
you can never obtain, and we defending what we never mean to part
with. A few words, therefore, settle the bargain. Let England mind
her own business and we will mind ours. Govern yourselves, and we
will govern ourselves. You may then trade where you please unmolested
by us, and we will trade where we please unmolested by you; and such
articles as we can purchase of each other better than elsewhere may
be mutually done. If it were possible that you could carry on the war
for twenty years you must still come to this point at last, or worse,
and the sooner you think of it the better it will be for you.

My official situation enables me to know the repeated insults which
Britain is obliged to put up with from foreign powers, and the
wretched shifts that she is driven to, to gloss them over. Her
reduced strength and exhausted coffers in a three years' war with
America, has given a powerful superiority to France and Spain. She is
not now a match for them. But if neither councils can prevail on her
to think, nor sufferings awaken her to reason, she must e'en go on,
till the honor of England becomes a proverb of contempt, and Europe
dub her the Land of Fools.

I am, Sir, with every wish for an honorable peace,

            Your friend, enemy, and countryman,

                                       COMMON SENSE.
             
                    TO THE INHABITANTS OF AMERICA.

WITH all the pleasure with which a man exchanges bad company for
good, I take my leave of Sir William and return to you. It is now
nearly three years since the tyranny of Britain received its first
repulse by the arms of America. A period which has given birth to a
new world, and erected a monument to the folly of the old.

I cannot help being sometimes surprised at the complimentary
references which I have seen and heard made to ancient histories and
transactions. The wisdom, civil governments, and sense of honor of
the states of Greece and Rome, are frequently held up as objects of
excellence and imitation. Mankind have lived to very little purpose,
if, at this period of the world, they must go two or three thousand
years back for lessons and examples. We do great injustice to
ourselves by placing them in such a superior line. We have no just
authority for it, neither can we tell why it is that we should
suppose ourselves inferior.

Could the mist of antiquity be cleared away, and men and things be
viewed as they really were, it is more than probable that they would
admire us, rather than we them. America has surmounted a greater
variety and combination of difficulties, than, I believe, ever fell
to the share of any one people, in the same space of time, and has
replenished the world with more useful knowledge and sounder maxims
of civil government than were ever produced in any age before. Had it
not been for America, there had been no such thing as freedom left
throughout the whole universe. England has lost hers in a long chain
of right reasoning from wrong principles, and it is from this
country, now, that she must learn the resolution to redress herself,
and the wisdom how to accomplish it.

The Grecians and Romans were strongly possessed of the spirit of
liberty but not the principle, for at the time that they were
determined not to be slaves themselves, they employed their power to
enslave the rest of mankind. But this distinguished era is blotted by
no one misanthropical vice. In short, if the principle on which the
cause is founded, the universal blessings that are to arise from it,
the difficulties that accompanied it, the wisdom with which it has
been debated, the fortitude by which it has been supported, the
strength of the power which we had to oppose, and the condition in
which we undertook it, be all taken in one view, we may justly style
it the most virtuous and illustrious revolution that ever graced the
history of mankind.

A good opinion of ourselves is exceedingly necessary in private life,
but absolutely necessary in public life, and of the utmost importance
in supporting national character. I have no notion of yielding the
palm of the United States to any Grecians or Romans that were ever
born. We have equalled the bravest in times of danger, and excelled
the wisest in construction of civil governments.

From this agreeable eminence let us take a review of present affairs.
The spirit of corruption is so inseparably interwoven with British
politics, that their ministry suppose all mankind are governed by the
same motives. They have no idea of a people submitting even to
temporary inconvenience from an attachment to rights and privileges.
Their plans of business are calculated by the hour and for the hour,
and are uniform in nothing but the corruption which gives them birth.
They never had, neither have they at this time, any regular plan for
the conquest of America by arms. They know not how to go about it,
neither have they power to effect it if they did know. The thing is
not within the compass of human practicability, for America is too
extensive either to be fully conquered or passively defended. But she
may be actively defended by defeating or making prisoners of the army
that invades her. And this is the only system of defence that can be
effectual in a large country.

There is something in a war carried on by invasion which makes it
differ in circumstances from any other mode of war, because he who
conducts it cannot tell whether the ground he gains be for him, or
against him, when he first obtains it. In the winter of 1776, General
Howe marched with an air of victory through the Jerseys, the
consequence of which was his defeat; and General Burgoyne at Saratoga
experienced the same fate from the same cause. The Spaniards, about
two years ago, were defeated by the Algerines in the same manner,
that is, their first triumphs became a trap in which they were
totally routed. And whoever will attend to the circumstances and
events of a war carried on by invasion, will find, that any invader,
in order to be finally conquered must first begin to conquer.

I confess myself one of those who believe the loss of Philadelphia to
be attended with more advantages than injuries. The case stood thus:
The enemy imagined Philadelphia to be of more importance to us than
it really was; for we all know that it had long ceased to be a port:
not a cargo of goods had been brought into it for near a twelvemonth,
nor any fixed manufactories, nor even ship-building, carried on in
it; yet as the enemy believed the conquest of it to be practicable,
and to that belief added the absurd idea that the soul of all America
was centred there, and would be conquered there, it naturally follows
that their possession of it, by not answering the end proposed, must
break up the plans they had so foolishly gone upon, and either oblige
them to form a new one, for which their present strength is not
sufficient, or to give over the attempt.

We never had so small an army to fight against, nor so fair an
opportunity of final success as now. The death wound is already
given. The day is ours if we follow it up. The enemy, by his
situation, is within our reach, and by his reduced strength is within
our power. The ministers of Britain may rage as they please, but our
part is to conquer their armies. Let them wrangle and welcome, but
let, it not draw our attention from the one thing needful. Here, in
this spot is our own business to be accomplished, our felicity
secured. What we have now to do is as clear as light, and the way to
do it is as straight as a line. It needs not to be commented upon,
yet, in order to be perfectly understood I will put a case that
cannot admit of a mistake.

Had the armies under Generals Howe and Burgoyne been united, and
taken post at Germantown, and had the northern army under General
Gates been joined to that under General Washington, at Whitemarsh,
the consequence would have been a general action; and if in that
action we had killed and taken the same number of officers and men,
that is, between nine and ten thousand, with the same quantity of
artillery, arms, stores, etc., as have been taken at the northward,
and obliged General Howe with the remains of his army, that is, with
the same number he now commands, to take shelter in Philadelphia, we
should certainly have thought ourselves the greatest heroes in the
world; and should, as soon as the season permitted, have collected
together all the force of the continent and laid siege to the city,
for it requires a much greater force to besiege an enemy in a town
than to defeat him in the field. The case now is just the same as if
it had been produced by the means I have here supposed. Between nine
and ten thousand have been killed and taken, all their stores are in
our possession, and General Howe, in consequence of that victory, has
thrown himself for shelter into Philadelphia. He, or his trifling
friend Galloway, may form what pretences they please, yet no just
reason can be given for their going into winter quarters so early as
the 19th of October, but their apprehensions of a defeat if they
continued out, or their conscious inability of keeping the field with
safety. I see no advantage which can arise to America by hunting the
enemy from state to state. It is a triumph without a prize, and
wholly unworthy the attention of a people determined to conquer.
Neither can any state promise itself security while the enemy remains
in a condition to transport themselves from one part of the continent
to another. Howe, likewise, cannot conquer where we have no army to
oppose, therefore any such removals in him are mean and cowardly, and
reduces Britain to a common pilferer. If he retreats from
Philadelphia, he will be despised; if he stays, he may be shut up and
starved out, and the country, if he advances into it, may become his
Saratoga. He has his choice of evils and we of opportunities. If he
moves early, it is not only a sign but a proof that he expects no
reinforcement, and his delay will prove that he either waits for the
arrival of a plan to go upon, or force to execute it, or both; in
which case our strength will increase more than his, therefore in any
case we cannot be wrong if we do but proceed.

The particular condition of Pennsylvania deserves the attention of
all the other States. Her military strength must not be estimated by
the number of inhabitants. Here are men of all nations, characters,
professions and interests. Here are the firmest Whigs, surviving,
like sparks in the ocean, unquenched and uncooled in the midst of
discouragement and disaffection. Here are men losing their all with
cheerfulness, and collecting fire and fortitude from the flames of
their own estates. Here are others skulking in secret, many making a
market of the times, and numbers who are changing to Whig or Tory
with the circumstances of every day.

It is by a mere dint of fortitude and perseverance that the Whigs of
this State have been able to maintain so good a countenance, and do
even what they have done. We want help, and the sooner it can arrive
the more effectual it will be. The invaded State, be it which it may,
will always feel an additional burden upon its back, and be hard set
to support its civil power with sufficient authority; and this
difficulty will rise or fall, in proportion as the other states throw
in their assistance to the common cause.

The enemy will most probably make many manoeuvres at the opening of
this campaign, to amuse and draw off the attention of the several
States from the one thing needful. We may expect to hear of alarms
and pretended expeditions to this place and that place, to the
southward, the eastward, and the northward, all intended to prevent
our forming into one formidable body. The less the enemy's strength
is, the more subtleties of this kind will they make use of. Their
existence depends upon it, because the force of America, when
collected, is sufficient to swallow their present army up. It is
therefore our business to make short work of it, by bending our whole
attention to this one principal point, for the instant that the main
body under General Howe is defeated, all the inferior alarms
throughout the continent, like so many shadows, will follow his
downfall.

The only way to finish a war with the least possible bloodshed, or
perhaps without any, is to collect an army, against the power of
which the enemy shall have no chance. By not doing this, we prolong
the war, and double both the calamities and expenses of it. What a
rich and happy country would America be, were she, by a vigorous
exertion, to reduce Howe as she has reduced Burgoyne. Her currency
would rise to millions beyond its present value. Every man would be
rich, and every man would have it in his power to be happy. And why
not do these things? What is there to hinder? America is her own
mistress and can do what she pleases.

If we had not at this time a man in the field, we could,
nevertheless, raise an army in a few weeks sufficient to overwhelm
all the force which General Howe at present commands. Vigor and
determination will do anything and everything. We began the war with
this kind of spirit, why not end it with the same? Here, gentlemen,
is the enemy. Here is the army. The interest, the happiness of all
America, is centred in this half ruined spot. Come and help us. Here
are laurels, come and share them. Here are Tories, come and help us
to expel them. Here are Whigs that will make you welcome, and enemies
that dread your coming.

The worst of all policies is that of doing things by halves.
Penny-wise and pound-foolish, has been the ruin of thousands. The
present spring, if rightly improved, will free us from our troubles,
and save us the expense of millions. We have now only one army to
cope with. No opportunity can be fairer; no prospect more promising.
I shall conclude this paper with a few outlines of a plan, either for
filling up the battalions with expedition, or for raising an
additional force, for any limited time, on any sudden emergency.

That in which every man is interested, is every man's duty to
support. And any burden which falls equally on all men, and from
which every man is to receive an equal benefit, is consistent with
the most perfect ideas of liberty. I would wish to revive something
of that virtuous ambition which first called America into the field.
Then every man was eager to do his part, and perhaps the principal
reason why we have in any degree fallen therefrom, is because we did
not set a right value by it at first, but left it to blaze out of
itself, instead of regulating and preserving it by just proportions
of rest and service.

Suppose any State whose number of effective inhabitants was 80,000,
should be required to furnish 3,200 men towards the defence of the
continent on any sudden emergency.

1st, Let the whole number of effective inhabitants be divided into
hundreds; then if each of those hundreds turn out four men, the whole
number of 3,200 will be had.

2d, Let the name of each hundred men be entered in a book, and let
four dollars be collected from each man, with as much more as any of
the gentlemen, whose abilities can afford it, shall please to throw
in, which gifts likewise shall be entered against the names of the
donors.

3d, Let the sums so collected be offered as a present, over and above
the bounty of twenty dollars, to any four who may be inclined to
propose themselves as volunteers: if more than four offer, the
majority of the subscribers present shall determine which; if none
offer, then four out of the hundred shall be taken by lot, who shall
be entitled to the said sums, and shall either go, or provide others
that will, in the space of six days.

4th, As it will always happen that in the space of ground on which a
hundred men shall live, there will be always a number of persons who,
by age and infirmity, are incapable of doing personal service, and as
such persons are generally possessed of the greatest part of property
in any country, their portion of service, therefore, will be to
furnish each man with a blanket, which will make a regimental coat,
jacket, and breeches, or clothes in lieu thereof, and another for a
watch cloak, and two pair of shoes; for however choice people may be
of these things matters not in cases of this kind; those who live
always in houses can find many ways to keep themselves warm, but it
is a shame and a sin to suffer a soldier in the field to want a
blanket while there is one in the country.

Should the clothing not be wanted, the superannuated or infirm
persons possessing property, may, in lieu thereof, throw in their
money subscriptions towards increasing the bounty; for though age
will naturally exempt a person from personal service, it cannot
exempt him from his share of the charge, because the men are raised
for the defence of property and liberty jointly.

There never was a scheme against which objections might not be
raised. But this alone is not a sufficient reason for rejection. The
only line to judge truly upon is to draw out and admit all the
objections which can fairly be made, and place against them all the
contrary qualities, conveniences and advantages, then by striking a
balance you come at the true character of any scheme, principle or
position.

The most material advantages of the plan here proposed are, ease,
expedition, and cheapness; yet the men so raised get a much larger
bounty than is any where at present given; because all the expenses,
extravagance, and consequent idleness of recruiting are saved or
prevented. The country incurs no new debt nor interest thereon; the
whole matter being all settled at once and entirely done with. It is
a subscription answering all the purposes of a tax, without either
the charge or trouble of collecting. The men are ready for the field
with the greatest possible expedition, because it becomes the duty of
the inhabitants themselves, in every part of the country, to find
their proportion of men instead of leaving it to a recruiting
sergeant, who, be he ever so industrious, cannot know always where to
apply.

I do not propose this as a regular digested plan, neither will the
limits of this paper admit of any further remarks upon it. I believe
it to be a hint capable of much improvement, and as such submit it to
the public.

                                       COMMON SENSE.

LANCASTER, March 21, 1778.



                            The Crisis 

                                  VI.

            TO THE EARL OF CARLISLE, GENERAL CLINTON, AND
              WILLIAM EDEN, ESQ., BRITISH COMMISSIONERS
                             AT NEW YORK.

THERE is a dignity in the warm passions of a Whig, which is never to
be found in the cold malice of a Tory. In the one nature is only
heated- in the other she is poisoned. The instant the former has it
in his power to punish, he feels a disposition to forgive; but the
canine venom of the latter knows no relief but revenge. This general
distinction will, I believe, apply in all cases, and suits as well
the meridian of England as America.

As I presume your last proclamation will undergo the strictures of
other pens, I shall confine my remarks to only a few parts thereof.
All that you have said might have been comprised in half the compass.
It is tedious and unmeaning, and only a repetition of your former
follies, with here and there an offensive aggravation. Your cargo of
pardons will have no market. It is unfashionable to look at them-
even speculation is at an end. They have become a perfect drug, and
no way calculated for the climate.

In the course of your proclamation you say, "The policy as well as
the benevolence of Great Britain have thus far checked the extremes
of war, when they tended to distress a people still considered as
their fellow subjects, and to desolate a country shortly to become
again a source of mutual advantage." What you mean by "the
benevolence of Great Britain" is to me inconceivable. To put a plain
question; do you consider yourselves men or devils? For until this
point is settled, no determinate sense can be put upon the
expression. You have already equalled and in many cases excelled, the
savages of either Indies; and if you have yet a cruelty in store you
must have imported it, unmixed with every human material, from the
original warehouse of hell.

To the interposition of Providence, and her blessings on our
endeavors, and not to British benevolence are we indebted for the
short chain that limits your ravages. Remember you do not, at this
time, command a foot of land on the continent of America. Staten
Island, York Island, a small part of Long Island, and Rhode Island,
circumscribe your power; and even those you hold at the expense of
the West Indies. To avoid a defeat, or prevent a desertion of your
troops, you have taken up your quarters in holes and corners of
inaccessible security; and in order to conceal what every one can
perceive, you now endeavor to impose your weakness upon us for an act
of mercy. If you think to succeed by such shadowy devices, you are
but infants in the political world; you have the A, B, C, of
stratagem yet to learn, and are wholly ignorant of the people you
have to contend with. Like men in a state of intoxication, you forget
that the rest of the world have eyes, and that the same stupidity
which conceals you from yourselves exposes you to their satire and
contempt.

The paragraph which I have quoted, stands as an introduction to the
following: "But when that country [America] professes the unnatural
design, not only of estranging herself from us, but of mortgaging
herself and her resources to our enemies, the whole contest is
changed: and the question is how far Great Britain may, by every
means in her power, destroy or render useless, a connection contrived
for her ruin, and the aggrandizement of France. Under such
circumstances, the laws of self-preservation must direct the conduct
of Britain, and, if the British colonies are to become an accession
to France, will direct her to render that accession of as little
avail as possible to her enemy."

I consider you in this declaration, like madmen biting in the hour of
death. It contains likewise a fraudulent meanness; for, in order to
justify a barbarous conclusion, you have advanced a false position.
The treaty we have formed with France is open, noble, and generous.
It is true policy, founded on sound philosophy, and neither a
surrender or mortgage, as you would scandalously insinuate. I have
seen every article, and speak from positive knowledge. In France, we
have found an affectionate friend and faithful ally; in Britain, we
have found nothing but tyranny, cruelty, and infidelity.

But the happiness is, that the mischief you threaten, is not in your
power to execute; and if it were, the punishment would return upon
you in a ten-fold degree. The humanity of America has hitherto
restrained her from acts of retaliation, and the affection she
retains for many individuals in England, who have fed, clothed and
comforted her prisoners, has, to the present day, warded off her
resentment, and operated as a screen to the whole. But even these
considerations must cease, when national objects interfere and oppose
them. Repeated aggravations will provoke a retort, and policy justify
the measure. We mean now to take you seriously up upon your own
ground and principle, and as you do, so shall you be done by.

You ought to know, gentlemen, that England and Scotland, are far more
exposed to incendiary desolation than America, in her present state,
can possibly be. We occupy a country, with but few towns, and whose
riches consist in land and annual produce. The two last can suffer
but little, and that only within a very limited compass. In Britain
it is otherwise. Her wealth lies chiefly in cities and large towns,
the depositories of manufactures and fleets of merchantmen. There is
not a nobleman's country seat but may be laid in ashes by a single
person. Your own may probably contribute to the proof: in short,
there is no evil which cannot be returned when you come to incendiary
mischief. The ships in the Thames, may certainly be as easily set on
fire, as the temporary bridge was a few years ago; yet of that affair
no discovery was ever made; and the loss you would sustain by such an
event, executed at a proper season, is infinitely greater than any
you can inflict. The East India House and the Bank, neither are nor
can be secure from this sort of destruction, and, as Dr. Price justly
observes, a fire at the latter would bankrupt the nation. It has
never been the custom of France and England when at war, to make
those havocs on each other, because the ease with which they could
retaliate rendered it as impolitic as if each had destroyed his own.

But think not, gentlemen, that our distance secures you, or our
invention fails us. We can much easier accomplish such a point than
any nation in Europe. We talk the same language, dress in the same
habit, and appear with the same manners as yourselves. We can pass
from one part of England to another unsuspected; many of us are as
well acquainted with the country as you are, and should you
impolitically provoke us, you will most assuredly lament the effects
of it. Mischiefs of this kind require no army to execute them. The
means are obvious, and the opportunities unguardable. I hold up a
warning to our senses, if you have any left, and "to the unhappy
people likewise, whose affairs are committed to you."* I call not
with the rancor of an enemy, but the earnestness of a friend, on the
deluded people of England, lest, between your blunders and theirs,
they sink beneath the evils contrived for us.

* General [Sir H.] Clinton's letter to Congress.

"He who lives in a glass house," says a Spanish proverb, "should
never begin throwing stones." This, gentlemen, is exactly your case,
and you must be the most ignorant of mankind, or suppose us so, not
to see on which side the balance of accounts will fall. There are
many other modes of retaliation, which, for several reasons, I choose
not to mention. But be assured of this, that the instant you put your
threat into execution, a counter-blow will follow it. If you openly
profess yourselves savages, it is high time we should treat you as
such, and if nothing but distress can recover you to reason, to
punish will become an office of charity.

While your fleet lay last winter in the Delaware, I offered my
service to the Pennsylvania Navy Board then at Trenton, as one who
would make a party with them, or any four or five gentlemen, on an
expedition down the river to set fire to it, and though it was not
then accepted, nor the thing personally attempted, it is more than
probable that your own folly will provoke a much more ruinous act.
Say not when mischief is done, that you had not warning, and remember
that we do not begin it, but mean to repay it. Thus much for your
savage and impolitic threat.

In another part of your proclamation you say, "But if the honors of a
military life are become the object of the Americans, let them seek
those honors under the banners of their rightful sovereign, and in
fighting the battles of the united British Empire, against our late
mutual and natural enemies." Surely! the union of absurdity with
madness was never marked in more distinguishable lines than these.
Your rightful sovereign, as you call him, may do well enough for you,
who dare not inquire into the humble capacities of the man; but we,
who estimate persons and things by their real worth, cannot suffer
our judgments to be so imposed upon; and unless it is your wish to
see him exposed, it ought to be your endeavor to keep him out of
sight. The less you have to say about him the better. We have done
with him, and that ought to be answer enough. You have been often
told so. Strange! that the answer must be so often repeated. You go
a-begging with your king as with a brat, or with some unsaleable
commodity you were tired of; and though every body tells you no, no,
still you keep hawking him about. But there is one that will have him
in a little time, and as we have no inclination to disappoint you of
a customer, we bid nothing for him.

The impertinent folly of the paragraph that I have just quoted,
deserves no other notice than to be laughed at and thrown by, but the
principle on which it is founded is detestable. We are invited to
submit to a man who has attempted by every cruelty to destroy us, and
to join him in making war against France, who is already at war
against him for our support.

Can Bedlam, in concert with Lucifer, form a more mad and devilish
request? Were it possible a people could sink into such apostacy they
would deserve to be swept from the earth like the inhabitants of
Sodom and Gomorrah. The proposition is an universal affront to the
rank which man holds in the creation, and an indignity to him who
placed him there. It supposes him made up without a spark of honor,
and under no obligation to God or man.

What sort of men or Christians must you suppose the Americans to be,
who, after seeing their most humble petitions insultingly rejected;
the most grievous laws passed to distress them in every quarter; an
undeclared war let loose upon them, and Indians and negroes invited
to the slaughter; who, after seeing their kinsmen murdered, their
fellow citizens starved to death in prisons, and their houses and
property destroyed and burned; who, after the most serious appeals to
heaven, the most solemn abjuration by oath of all government
connected with you, and the most heart-felt pledges and protestations
of faith to each other; and who, after soliciting the friendship, and
entering into alliances with other nations, should at last break
through all these obligations, civil and divine, by complying with
your horrid and infernal proposal. Ought we ever after to be
considered as a part of the human race? Or ought we not rather to be
blotted from the society of mankind, and become a spectacle of misery
to the world? But there is something in corruption, which, like a
jaundiced eye, transfers the color of itself to the object it looks
upon, and sees every thing stained and impure; for unless you were
capable of such conduct yourselves, you would never have supposed
such a character in us. The offer fixes your infamy. It exhibits you
as a nation without faith; with whom oaths and treaties are
considered as trifles, and the breaking them as the breaking of a
bubble. Regard to decency, or to rank, might have taught you better;
or pride inspired you, though virtue could not. There is not left a
step in the degradation of character to which you can now descend;
you have put your foot on the ground floor, and the key of the
dungeon is turned upon you.

That the invitation may want nothing of being a complete monster, you
have thought proper to finish it with an assertion which has no
foundation, either in fact or philosophy; and as Mr. Ferguson, your
secretary, is a man of letters, and has made civil society his study,
and published a treatise on that subject, I address this part to him.

In the close of the paragraph which I last quoted, France is styled
the "natural enemy" of England, and by way of lugging us into some
strange idea, she is styled "the late mutual and natural enemy" of
both countries. I deny that she ever was the natural enemy of either;
and that there does not exist in nature such a principle. The
expression is an unmeaning barbarism, and wholly unphilosophical,
when applied to beings of the same species, let their station in the
creation be what it may. We have a perfect idea of a natural enemy
when we think of the devil, because the enmity is perpetual,
unalterable and unabateable. It admits, neither of peace, truce, or
treaty; consequently the warfare is eternal, and therefore it is
natural. But man with man cannot arrange in the same opposition.
Their quarrels are accidental and equivocally created. They become
friends or enemies as the change of temper, or the cast of interest
inclines them. The Creator of man did not constitute them the natural
enemy of each other. He has not made any one order of beings so. Even
wolves may quarrel, still they herd together. If any two nations are
so, then must all nations be so, otherwise it is not nature but
custom, and the offence frequently originates with the accuser.
England is as truly the natural enemy of France, as France is of
England, and perhaps more so. Separated from the rest of Europe, she
has contracted an unsocial habit of manners, and imagines in others
the jealousy she creates in herself. Never long satisfied with peace,
she supposes the discontent universal, and buoyed up with her own
importance, conceives herself the only object pointed at. The
expression has been often used, and always with a fraudulent design;
for when the idea of a natural enemy is conceived, it prevents all
other inquiries, and the real cause of the quarrel is hidden in the
universality of the conceit. Men start at the notion of a natural
enemy, and ask no other question. The cry obtains credit like the
alarm of a mad dog, and is one of those kind of tricks, which, by
operating on the common passions, secures their interest through
their folly.

But we, sir, are not to be thus imposed upon. We live in a large
world, and have extended our ideas beyond the limits and prejudices
of an island. We hold out the right hand of friendship to all the
universe, and we conceive that there is a sociality in the manners of
France, which is much better disposed to peace and negotiation than
that of England, and until the latter becomes more civilized, she
cannot expect to live long at peace with any power. Her common
language is vulgar and offensive, and children suck in with their
milk the rudiments of insult- "The arm of Britain! The mighty arm of
Britain! Britain that shakes the earth to its center and its poles!
The scourge of France! The terror of the world! That governs with a
nod, and pours down vengeance like a God." This language neither
makes a nation great or little; but it shows a savageness of manners,
and has a tendency to keep national animosity alive. The
entertainments of the stage are calculated to the same end, and
almost every public exhibition is tinctured with insult. Yet England
is always in dread of France,- terrified at the apprehension of an
invasion, suspicious of being outwitted in a treaty, and privately
cringing though she is publicly offending. Let her, therefore, reform
her manners and do justice, and she will find the idea of a natural
enemy to be only a phantom of her own imagination.

Little did I think, at this period of the war, to see a proclamation
which could promise you no one useful purpose whatever, and tend only
to expose you. One would think that you were just awakened from a
four years' dream, and knew nothing of what had passed in the
interval. Is this a time to be offering pardons, or renewing the long
forgotten subjects of charters and taxation? Is it worth your while,
after every force has failed you, to retreat under the shelter of
argument and persuasion? Or can you think that we, with nearly half
your army prisoners, and in alliance with France, are to be begged or
threatened into submission by a piece of paper? But as commissioners
at a hundred pounds sterling a week each, you conceive yourselves
bound to do something, and the genius of ill-fortune told you, that
you must write.

For my own part, I have not put pen to paper these several months.
Convinced of our superiority by the issue of every campaign, I was
inclined to hope, that that which all the rest of the world now see,
would become visible to you, and therefore felt unwilling to ruffle
your temper by fretting you with repetitions and discoveries. There
have been intervals of hesitation in your conduct, from which it
seemed a pity to disturb you, and a charity to leave you to
yourselves. You have often stopped, as if you intended to think, but
your thoughts have ever been too early or too late.

There was a time when Britain disdained to answer, or even hear a
petition from America. That time is past and she in her turn is
petitioning our acceptance. We now stand on higher ground, and offer
her peace; and the time will come when she, perhaps in vain, will ask
it from us. The latter case is as probable as the former ever was.
She cannot refuse to acknowledge our independence with greater
obstinacy than she before refused to repeal her laws; and if America
alone could bring her to the one, united with France she will reduce
her to the other. There is something in obstinacy which differs from
every other passion; whenever it fails it never recovers, but either
breaks like iron, or crumbles sulkily away like a fractured arch.
Most other passions have their periods of fatigue and rest; their
suffering and their cure; but obstinacy has no resource, and the
first wound is mortal. You have already begun to give it up, and you
will, from the natural construction of the vice, find yourselves both
obliged and inclined to do so.

If you look back you see nothing but loss and disgrace. If you look
forward the same scene continues, and the close is an impenetrable
gloom. You may plan and execute little mischiefs, but are they worth
the expense they cost you, or will such partial evils have any effect
on the general cause? Your expedition to Egg Harbor, will be felt at
a distance like an attack upon a hen-roost, and expose you in Europe,
with a sort of childish frenzy. Is it worth while to keep an army to
protect you in writing proclamations, or to get once a year into
winter quarters? Possessing yourselves of towns is not conquest, but
convenience, and in which you will one day or other be trepanned.
Your retreat from Philadelphia, was only a timely escape, and your
next expedition may be less fortunate.

It would puzzle all the politicians in the universe to conceive what
you stay for, or why you should have stayed so long. You are
prosecuting a war in which you confess you have neither object nor
hope, and that conquest, could it be effected, would not repay the
charges: in the mean while the rest of your affairs are running to
ruin, and a European war kindling against you. In such a situation,
there is neither doubt nor difficulty; the first rudiments of reason
will determine the choice, for if peace can be procured with more
advantages than even a conquest can be obtained, he must be an idiot
indeed that hesitates.

But you are probably buoyed up by a set of wretched mortals, who,
having deceived themselves, are cringing, with the duplicity of a
spaniel, for a little temporary bread. Those men will tell you just
what you please. It is their interest to amuse, in order to lengthen
out their protection. They study to keep you amongst them for that
very purpose; and in proportion as you disregard their advice, and
grow callous to their complaints, they will stretch into
improbability, and season their flattery the higher. Characters like
these are to be found in every country, and every country will
despise them.

                                            COMMON SENSE.

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 20, 1778.

                              THE CRISIS

                                VII.

                      TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.

THERE are stages in the business of serious life in which to amuse is
cruel, but to deceive is to destroy; and it is of little consequence,
in the conclusion, whether men deceive themselves, or submit, by a
kind of mutual consent, to the impositions of each other. That
England has long been under the influence of delusion or mistake,
needs no other proof than the unexpected and wretched situation that
she is now involved in: and so powerful has been the influence, that
no provision was ever made or thought of against the misfortune,
because the possibility of its happening was never conceived.

The general and successful resistance of America, the conquest of
Burgoyne, and a war in France, were treated in parliament as the
dreams of a discontented opposition, or a distempered imagination.
They were beheld as objects unworthy of a serious thought, and the
bare intimation of them afforded the ministry a triumph of laughter.
Short triumph indeed! For everything which has been predicted has
happened, and all that was promised has failed. A long series of
politics so remarkably distinguished by a succession of misfortunes,
without one alleviating turn, must certainly have something in it
systematically wrong. It is sufficient to awaken the most credulous
into suspicion, and the most obstinate into thought. Either the means
in your power are insufficient, or the measures ill planned; either
the execution has been bad, or the thing attempted impracticable; or,
to speak more emphatically, either you are not able or heaven is not
willing. For, why is it that you have not conquered us? Who, or what
has prevented you? You have had every opportunity that you could
desire, and succeeded to your utmost wish in every preparatory means.
Your fleets and armies have arrived in America without an accident.
No uncommon fortune has intervened. No foreign nation has interfered
until the time which you had allotted for victory was passed. The
opposition, either in or out of parliament, neither disconcerted your
measures, retarded or diminished your force. They only foretold your
fate. Every ministerial scheme was carried with as high a hand as if
the whole nation had been unanimous. Every thing wanted was asked
for, and every thing asked for was granted.

A greater force was not within the compass of your abilities to send,
and the time you sent it was of all others the most favorable. You
were then at rest with the whole world beside. You had the range of
every court in Europe uncontradicted by us. You amused us with a tale
of commissioners of peace, and under that disguise collected a
numerous army and came almost unexpectedly upon us. The force was
much greater than we looked for; and that which we had to oppose it
with, was unequal in numbers, badly armed, and poorly disciplined;
beside which, it was embodied only for a short time, and expired
within a few months after your arrival. We had governments to form;
measures to concert; an army to train, and every necessary article to
import or to create. Our non-importation scheme had exhausted our
stores, and your command by sea intercepted our supplies. We were a
people unknown, and unconnected with the political world, and
strangers to the disposition of foreign powers. Could you possibly
wish for a more favorable conjunction of circumstances? Yet all these
have happened and passed away, and, as it were, left you with a
laugh. There are likewise, events of such an original nativity as can
never happen again, unless a new world should arise from the ocean.

If any thing can be a lesson to presumption, surely the circumstances
of this war will have their effect. Had Britain been defeated by any
European power, her pride would have drawn consolation from the
importance of her conquerors; but in the present case, she is
excelled by those that she affected to despise, and her own opinions
retorting upon herself, become an aggravation of her disgrace.
Misfortune and experience are lost upon mankind, when they produce
neither reflection nor reformation. Evils, like poisons, have their
uses, and there are diseases which no other remedy can reach. It has
been the crime and folly of England to suppose herself invincible,
and that, without acknowledging or perceiving that a full third of
her strength was drawn from the country she is now at war with. The
arm of Britain has been spoken of as the arm of the Almighty, and she
has lived of late as if she thought the whole world created for her
diversion. Her politics, instead of civilizing, has tended to
brutalize mankind, and under the vain, unmeaning title of "Defender
of the Faith," she has made war like an Indian against the religion
of humanity. Her cruelties in the East Indies will never be
forgotten, and it is somewhat remarkable that the produce of that
ruined country, transported to America, should there kindle up a war
to punish the destroyer. The chain is continued, though with a
mysterious kind of uniformity both in the crime and the punishment.
The latter runs parallel with the former, and time and fate will give
it a perfect illustration.

When information is withheld, ignorance becomes a reasonable excuse;
and one would charitably hope that the people of England do not
encourage cruelty from choice but from mistake. Their recluse
situation, surrounded by the sea, preserves them from the calamities
of war, and keeps them in the dark as to the conduct of their own
armies. They see not, therefore they feel not. They tell the tale
that is told them and believe it, and accustomed to no other news
than their own, they receive it, stripped of its horrors and prepared
for the palate of the nation, through the channel of the London
Gazette. They are made to believe that their generals and armies
differ from those of other nations, and have nothing of rudeness or
barbarity in them. They suppose them what they wish them to be. They
feel a disgrace in thinking otherwise, and naturally encourage the
belief from a partiality to themselves. There was a time when I felt
the same prejudices, and reasoned from the same errors; but
experience, sad and painful experience, has taught me better. What
the conduct of former armies was, I know not, but what the conduct of
the present is, I well know. It is low, cruel, indolent and
profligate; and had the people of America no other cause for
separation than what the army has occasioned, that alone is cause
sufficient.

The field of politics in England is far more extensive than that of
news. Men have a right to reason for themselves, and though they
cannot contradict the intelligence in the London Gazette, they may
frame upon it what sentiments they please. But the misfortune is,
that a general ignorance has prevailed over the whole nation
respecting America. The ministry and the minority have both been
wrong. The former was always so, the latter only lately so. Politics,
to be executively right, must have a unity of means and time, and a
defect in either overthrows the whole. The ministry rejected the
plans of the minority while they were practicable, and joined in them
when they became impracticable. From wrong measures they got into
wrong time, and have now completed the circle of absurdity by closing
it upon themselves.

I happened to come to America a few months before the breaking out of
hostilities. I found the disposition of the people such, that they
might have been led by a thread and governed by a reed. Their
suspicion was quick and penetrating, but their attachment to Britain
was obstinate, and it was at that time a kind of treason to speak
against it. They disliked the ministry, but they esteemed the nation.
Their idea of grievance operated without resentment, and their single
object was reconciliation. Bad as I believed the ministry to be, I
never conceived them capable of a measure so rash and wicked as the
commencing of hostilities; much less did I imagine the nation would
encourage it. I viewed the dispute as a kind of law-suit, in which I
supposed the parties would find a way either to decide or settle it.
I had no thoughts of independence or of arms. The world could not
then have persuaded me that I should be either a soldier or an
author. If I had any talents for either, they were buried in me, and
might ever have continued so, had not the necessity of the times
dragged and driven them into action. I had formed my plan of life,
and conceiving myself happy, wished every body else so. But when the
country, into which I had just set my foot, was set on fire about my
ears, it was time to stir. It was time for every man to stir. Those
who had been long settled had something to defend; those who had just
come had something to pursue; and the call and the concern was equal
and universal. For in a country where all men were once adventurers,
the difference of a few years in their arrival could make none in
their right.

The breaking out of hostilities opened a new suspicion in the
politics of America, which, though at that time very rare, has since
been proved to be very right. What I allude to is, "a secret and
fixed determination in the British Cabinet to annex America to the
crown of England as a conquered country." If this be taken as the
object, then the whole line of conduct pursued by the ministry,
though rash in its origin and ruinous in its consequences, is
nevertheless uniform and consistent in its parts. It applies to every
case and resolves every difficulty. But if taxation, or any thing
else, be taken in its room, there is no proportion between the object
and the charge. Nothing but the whole soil and property of the
country can be placed as a possible equivalent against the millions
which the ministry expended. No taxes raised in America could
possibly repay it. A revenue of two millions sterling a year would
not discharge the sum and interest accumulated thereon, in twenty
years.

Reconciliation never appears to have been the wish or the object of
the administration; they looked on conquest as certain and
infallible, and, under that persuasion, sought to drive the Americans
into what they might style a general rebellion, and then, crushing
them with arms in their hands, reap the rich harvest of a general
confiscation, and silence them for ever. The dependents at court were
too numerous to be provided for in England. The market for plunder in
the East Indies was over; and the profligacy of government required
that a new mine should be opened, and that mine could be no other
than America, conquered and forfeited. They had no where else to go.
Every other channel was drained; and extravagance, with the thirst of
a drunkard, was gaping for supplies.

If the ministry deny this to have been their plan, it becomes them to
explain what was their plan. For either they have abused us in
coveting property they never labored for, or they have abused you in
expending an amazing sum upon an incompetent object. Taxation, as I
mentioned before, could never be worth the charge of obtaining it by
arms; and any kind of formal obedience which America could have made,
would have weighed with the lightness of a laugh against such a load
of expense. It is therefore most probable that the ministry will at
last justify their policy by their dishonesty, and openly declare,
that their original design was conquest: and, in this case, it well
becomes the people of England to consider how far the nation would
have been benefited by the success.

In a general view, there are few conquests that repay the charge of
making them, and mankind are pretty well convinced that it can never
be worth their while to go to war for profit's sake. If they are made
war upon, their country invaded, or their existence at stake, it is
their duty to defend and preserve themselves, but in every other
light, and from every other cause, is war inglorious and detestable.
But to return to the case in question-

When conquests are made of foreign countries, it is supposed that the
commerce and dominion of the country which made them are extended.
But this could neither be the object nor the consequence of the
present war. You enjoyed the whole commerce before. It could receive
no possible addition by a conquest, but on the contrary, must
diminish as the inhabitants were reduced in numbers and wealth. You
had the same dominion over the country which you used to have, and
had no complaint to make against her for breach of any part of the
contract between you or her, or contending against any established
custom, commercial, political or territorial. The country and
commerce were both your own when you began to conquer, in the same
manner and form as they had been your own a hundred years before.
Nations have sometimes been induced to make conquests for the sake of
reducing the power of their enemies, or bringing it to a balance with
their own. But this could be no part of your plan. No foreign
authority was claimed here, neither was any such authority suspected
by you, or acknowledged or imagined by us. What then, in the name of
heaven, could you go to war for? Or what chance could you possibly
have in the event, but either to hold the same country which you held
before, and that in a much worse condition, or to lose, with an
amazing expense, what you might have retained without a farthing of
charges?

War never can be the interest of a trading nation, any more than
quarrelling can be profitable to a man in business. But to make war
with those who trade with us, is like setting a bull-dog upon a
customer at the shop-door. The least degree of common sense shows the
madness of the latter, and it will apply with the same force of
conviction to the former. Piratical nations, having neither commerce
or commodities of their own to lose, may make war upon all the world,
and lucratively find their account in it; but it is quite otherwise
with Britain: for, besides the stoppage of trade in time of war, she
exposes more of her own property to be lost, than she has the chance
of taking from others. Some ministerial gentlemen in parliament have
mentioned the greatness of her trade as an apology for the greatness
of her loss. This is miserable politics indeed! Because it ought to
have been given as a reason for her not engaging in a war at first.
The coast of America commands the West India trade almost as
effectually as the coast of Africa does that of the Straits; and
England can no more carry on the former without the consent of
America, than she can the latter without a Mediterranean pass.

In whatever light the war with America is considered upon commercial
principles, it is evidently the interest of the people of England not
to support it; and why it has been supported so long, against the
clearest demonstrations of truth and national advantage, is, to me,
and must be to all the reasonable world, a matter of astonishment.
Perhaps it may be said that I live in America, and write this from
interest. To this I reply, that my principle is universal. My
attachment is to all the world, and not to any particular part, and
if what I advance is right, no matter where or who it comes from. We
have given the proclamation of your commissioners a currency in our
newspapers, and I have no doubt you will give this a place in yours.
To oblige and be obliged is fair.

Before I dismiss this part of my address, I shall mention one more
circumstance in which I think the people of England have been equally
mistaken: and then proceed to other matters.

There is such an idea existing in the world, as that of national
honor, and this, falsely understood, is oftentimes the cause of war.
In a Christian and philosophical sense, mankind seem to have stood
still at individual civilization, and to retain as nations all the
original rudeness of nature. Peace by treaty is only a cessation of
violence for a reformation of sentiment. It is a substitute for a
principle that is wanting and ever will be wanting till the idea of
national honor be rightly understood. As individuals we profess
ourselves Christians, but as nations we are heathens, Romans, and
what not. I remember the late Admiral Saunders declaring in the House
of Commons, and that in the time of peace, "That the city of Madrid
laid in ashes was not a sufficient atonement for the Spaniards taking
off the rudder of an English sloop of war." I do not ask whether this
is Christianity or morality, I ask whether it is decency? whether it
is proper language for a nation to use? In private life we call it by
the plain name of bullying, and the elevation of rank cannot alter
its character. It is, I think, exceedingly easy to define what ought
to be understood by national honor; for that which is the best
character for an individual is the best character for a nation; and
wherever the latter exceeds or falls beneath the former, there is a
departure from the line of true greatness.

I have thrown out this observation with a design of applying it to
Great Britain. Her ideas of national honor seem devoid of that
benevolence of heart, that universal expansion of philanthropy, and
that triumph over the rage of vulgar prejudice, without which man is
inferior to himself, and a companion of common animals. To know who
she shall regard or dislike, she asks what country they are of, what
religion they profess, and what property they enjoy. Her idea of
national honor seems to consist in national insult, and that to be a
great people, is to be neither a Christian, a philosopher, or a
gentleman, but to threaten with the rudeness of a bear, and to devour
with the ferocity of a lion. This perhaps may sound harsh and
uncourtly, but it is too true, and the more is the pity.

I mention this only as her general character. But towards America she
has observed no character at all; and destroyed by her conduct what
she assumed in her title. She set out with the title of parent, or
mother country. The association of ideas which naturally accompany
this expression, are filled with everything that is fond, tender and
forbearing. They have an energy peculiar to themselves, and,
overlooking the accidental attachment of common affections, apply
with infinite softness to the first feelings of the heart. It is a
political term which every mother can feel the force of, and every
child can judge of. It needs no painting of mine to set it off, for
nature only can do it justice.

But has any part of your conduct to America corresponded with the
title you set up? If in your general national character you are
unpolished and severe, in this you are inconsistent and unnatural,
and you must have exceeding false notions of national honor to
suppose that the world can admire a want of humanity or that national
honor depends on the violence of resentment, the inflexibility of
temper, or the vengeance of execution.

I would willingly convince you, and that with as much temper as the
times will suffer me to do, that as you opposed your own interest by
quarrelling with us, so likewise your national honor, rightly
conceived and understood, was no ways called upon to enter into a war
with America; had you studied true greatness of heart, the first and
fairest ornament of mankind, you would have acted directly contrary
to all that you have done, and the world would have ascribed it to a
generous cause. Besides which, you had (though with the assistance of
this country) secured a powerful name by the last war. You were known
and dreaded abroad; and it would have been wise in you to have
suffered the world to have slept undisturbed under that idea. It was
to you a force existing without expense. It produced to you all the
advantages of real power; and you were stronger through the
universality of that charm, than any future fleets and armies may
probably make you. Your greatness was so secured and interwoven with
your silence that you ought never to have awakened mankind, and had
nothing to do but to be quiet. Had you been true politicians you
would have seen all this, and continued to draw from the magic of a
name, the force and authority of a nation.

Unwise as you were in breaking the charm, you were still more unwise
in the manner of doing it. Samson only told the secret, but you have
performed the operation; you have shaven your own head, and wantonly
thrown away the locks. America was the hair from which the charm was
drawn that infatuated the world. You ought to have quarrelled with no
power; but with her upon no account. You had nothing to fear from any
condescension you might make. You might have humored her, even if
there had been no justice in her claims, without any risk to your
reputation; for Europe, fascinated by your fame, would have ascribed
it to your benevolence, and America, intoxicated by the grant, would
have slumbered in her fetters.

But this method of studying the progress of the passions, in order to
ascertain the probable conduct of mankind, is a philosophy in
politics which those who preside at St. James's have no conception
of. They know no other influence than corruption and reckon all their
probabilities from precedent. A new case is to them a new world, and
while they are seeking for a parallel they get lost. The talents of
Lord Mansfield can be estimated at best no higher than those of a
sophist. He understands the subtleties but not the elegance of
nature; and by continually viewing mankind through the cold medium of
the law, never thinks of penetrating into the warmer region of the
mind. As for Lord North, it is his happiness to have in him more
philosophy than sentiment, for he bears flogging like a top, and
sleeps the better for it. His punishment becomes his support, for
while he suffers the lash for his sins, he keeps himself up by
twirling about. In politics, he is a good arithmetician, and in every
thing else nothing at all.

There is one circumstance which comes so much within Lord North's
province as a financier, that I am surprised it should escape him,
which is, the different abilities of the two countries in supporting
the expense; for, strange as it may seem, England is not a match for
America in this particular. By a curious kind of revolution in
accounts, the people of England seem to mistake their poverty for
their riches; that is, they reckon their national debt as a part of
their national wealth. They make the same kind of error which a man
would do, who after mortgaging his estate, should add the money
borrowed, to the full value of the estate, in order to count up his
worth, and in this case he would conceive that he got rich by running
into debt. Just thus it is with England. The government owed at the
beginning of this war one hundred and thirty-five millions sterling,
and though the individuals to whom it was due had a right to reckon
their shares as so much private property, yet to the nation
collectively it was so much poverty. There are as effectual limits to
public debts as to private ones, for when once the money borrowed is
so great as to require the whole yearly revenue to discharge the
interest thereon, there is an end to further borrowing; in the same
manner as when the interest of a man's debts amounts to the yearly
income of his estate, there is an end to his credit. This is nearly
the case with England, the interest of her present debt being at
least equal to one half of her yearly revenue, so that out of ten
millions annually collected by taxes, she has but five that she can
call her own.

The very reverse of this was the case with America; she began the war
without any debt upon her, and in order to carry it on, she neither
raised money by taxes, nor borrowed it upon interest, but created it;
and her situation at this time continues so much the reverse of yours
that taxing would make her rich, whereas it would make you poor. When
we shall have sunk the sum which we have created, we shall then be
out of debt, be just as rich as when we began, and all the while we
are doing it shall feel no difference, because the value will rise as
the quantity decreases.

There was not a country in the world so capable of bearing the
expense of a war as America; not only because she was not in debt
when she began, but because the country is young and capable of
infinite improvement, and has an almost boundless tract of new lands
in store; whereas England has got to her extent of age and growth,
and has not unoccupied land or property in reserve. The one is like a
young heir coming to a large improvable estate; the other like an old
man whose chances are over, and his estate mortgaged for half its
worth.

In the second number of the Crisis, which I find has been republished
in England, I endeavored to set forth the impracticability of
conquering America. I stated every case, that I conceived could
possibly happen, and ventured to predict its consequences. As my
conclusions were drawn not artfully, but naturally, they have all
proved to be true. I was upon the spot; knew the politics of America,
her strength and resources, and by a train of services, the best in
my power to render, was honored with the friendship of the congress,
the army and the people. I considered the cause a just one. I know
and feel it a just one, and under that confidence never made my own
profit or loss an object. My endeavor was to have the matter well
understood on both sides, and I conceived myself tendering a general
service, by setting forth to the one the impossibility of being
conquered, and to the other the impossibility of conquering. Most of
the arguments made use of by the ministry for supporting the war, are
the very arguments that ought to have been used against supporting
it; and the plans, by which they thought to conquer, are the very
plans in which they were sure to be defeated. They have taken every
thing up at the wrong end. Their ignorance is astonishing, and were
you in my situation you would see it. They may, perhaps, have your
confidence, but I am persuaded that they would make very indifferent
members of Congress. I know what England is, and what America is, and
from the compound of knowledge, am better enabled to judge of the
issue than what the king or any of his ministers can be.

In this number I have endeavored to show the ill policy and
disadvantages of the war. I believe many of my remarks are new. Those
which are not so, I have studied to improve and place in a manner
that may be clear and striking. Your failure is, I am persuaded, as
certain as fate. America is above your reach. She is at least your
equal in the world, and her independence neither rests upon your
consent, nor can it be prevented by your arms. In short, you spend
your substance in vain, and impoverish yourselves without a hope.

But suppose you had conquered America, what advantages, collectively
or individually, as merchants, manufacturers, or conquerors, could
you have looked for? This is an object you seemed never to have
attended to. Listening for the sound of victory, and led away by the
frenzy of arms, you neglected to reckon either the cost or the
consequences. You must all pay towards the expense; the poorest among
you must bear his share, and it is both your right and your duty to
weigh seriously the matter. Had America been conquered, she might
have been parcelled out in grants to the favorites at court, but no
share of it would have fallen to you. Your taxes would not have been
lessened, because she would have been in no condition to have paid
any towards your relief. We are rich by contrivance of our own, which
would have ceased as soon as you became masters. Our paper money will
be of no use in England, and silver and gold we have none. In the
last war you made many conquests, but were any of your taxes lessened
thereby? On the contrary, were you not taxed to pay for the charge of
making them, and has not the same been the case in every war?

To the Parliament I wish to address myself in a more particular
manner. They appear to have supposed themselves partners in the
chase, and to have hunted with the lion from an expectation of a
right in the booty; but in this it is most probable they would, as
legislators, have been disappointed. The case is quite a new one, and
many unforeseen difficulties would have arisen thereon. The
Parliament claimed a legislative right over America, and the war
originated from that pretence. But the army is supposed to belong to
the crown, and if America had been conquered through their means, the
claim of the legislature would have been suffocated in the conquest.
Ceded, or conquered, countries are supposed to be out of the
authority of Parliament. Taxation is exercised over them by
prerogative and not by law. It was attempted to be done in the
Grenadas a few years ago, and the only reason why it was not done was
because the crown had made a prior relinquishment of its claim.
Therefore, Parliament have been all this while supporting measures
for the establishment of their authority, in the issue of which, they
would have been triumphed over by the prerogative. This might have
opened a new and interesting opposition between the Parliament and
the crown. The crown would have said that it conquered for itself,
and that to conquer for Parliament was an unknown case. The
Parliament might have replied, that America not being a foreign
country, but a country in rebellion, could not be said to be
conquered, but reduced; and thus continued their claim by disowning
the term. The crown might have rejoined, that however America might
be considered at first, she became foreign at last by a declaration
of independence, and a treaty with France; and that her case being,
by that treaty, put within the law of nations, was out of the law of
Parliament, who might have maintained, that as their claim over
America had never been surrendered, so neither could it be taken
away. The crown might have insisted, that though the claim of
Parliament could not be taken away, yet, being an inferior, it might
be superseded; and that, whether the claim was withdrawn from the
object, or the object taken from the claim, the same separation
ensued; and that America being subdued after a treaty with France,
was to all intents and purposes a regal conquest, and of course the
sole property of the king. The Parliament, as the legal delegates of
the people, might have contended against the term "inferior," and
rested the case upon the antiquity of power, and this would have
brought on a set of very interesting and rational questions.

1st, What is the original fountain of power and honor in any country?
2d, Whether the prerogative does not belong to the people?
3d, Whether there is any such thing as the English constitution?
4th, Of what use is the crown to the people?
5th, Whether he who invented a crown was not an enemy to mankind?
6th, Whether it is not a shame for a man to spend a million a year
and do no good for it, and whether the money might not be better
applied? 7th, Whether such a man is not better dead than alive?
8th, Whether a Congress, constituted like that of America, is not the
most happy and consistent form of government in the world?- With a
number of others of the same import.

In short, the contention about the dividend might have distracted the
nation; for nothing is more common than to agree in the conquest and
quarrel for the prize; therefore it is, perhaps, a happy
circumstance, that our successes have prevented the dispute.

If the Parliament had been thrown out in their claim, which it is
most probable they would, the nation likewise would have been thrown
out in their expectation; for as the taxes would have been laid on by
the crown without the Parliament, the revenue arising therefrom, if
any could have arisen, would not have gone into the exchequer, but
into the privy purse, and so far from lessening the taxes, would not
even have been added to them, but served only as pocket money to the
crown. The more I reflect on this matter, the more I am satisfied at
the blindness and ill policy of my countrymen, whose wisdom seems to
operate without discernment, and their strength without an object.

To the great bulwark of the nation, I mean the mercantile and
manufacturing part thereof, I likewise present my address. It is your
interest to see America an independent, and not a conquered country.
If conquered, she is ruined; and if ruined, poor; consequently the
trade will be a trifle, and her credit doubtful. If independent, she
flourishes, and from her flourishing must your profits arise. It
matters nothing to you who governs America, if your manufactures find
a consumption there. Some articles will consequently be obtained from
other places, and it is right that they should; but the demand for
others will increase, by the great influx of inhabitants which a
state of independence and peace will occasion, and in the final event
you may be enriched. The commerce of America is perfectly free, and
ever will be so. She will consign away no part of it to any nation.
She has not to her friends, and certainly will not to her enemies;
though it is probable that your narrow-minded politicians, thinking
to please you thereby, may some time or other unnecessarily make such
a proposal. Trade flourishes best when it is free, and it is weak
policy to attempt to fetter it. Her treaty with France is on the most
liberal and generous principles, and the French, in their conduct
towards her, have proved themselves to be philosophers, politicians,
and gentlemen.

To the ministry I likewise address myself. You, gentlemen, have
studied the ruin of your country, from which it is not within your
abilities to rescue her. Your attempts to recover her are as
ridiculous as your plans which involved her are detestable. The
commissioners, being about to depart, will probably bring you this,
and with it my sixth number, addressed to them; and in so doing they
carry back more Common Sense than they brought, and you likewise will
have more than when you sent them.

Having thus addressed you severally, I conclude by addressing you
collectively. It is a long lane that has no turning. A period of
sixteen years of misconduct and misfortune, is certainly long enough
for any one nation to suffer under; and upon a supposition that war
is not declared between France and you, I beg to place a line of
conduct before you that will easily lead you out of all your
troubles. It has been hinted before, and cannot be too much attended
to.

Suppose America had remained unknown to Europe till the present year,
and that Mr. Banks and Dr. Solander, in another voyage round the
world, had made the first discovery of her, in the same condition
that she is now in, of arts, arms, numbers, and civilization. What, I
ask, in that case, would have been your conduct towards her? For that
will point out what it ought to be now. The problems and their
solutions are equal, and the right line of the one is the parallel of
the other. The question takes in every circumstance that can possibly
arise. It reduces politics to a simple thought, and is moreover a
mode of investigation, in which, while you are studying your interest
the simplicity of the case will cheat you into good temper. You have
nothing to do but to suppose that you have found America, and she
appears found to your hand, and while in the joy of your heart you
stand still to admire her, the path of politics rises straight before
you.

Were I disposed to paint a contrast, I could easily set off what you
have done in the present case, against what you would have done in
that case, and by justly opposing them, conclude a picture that would
make you blush. But, as, when any of the prouder passions are hurt,
it is much better philosophy to let a man slip into a good temper
than to attack him in a bad one, for that reason, therefore, I only
state the case, and leave you to reflect upon it.

To go a little back into politics, it will be found that the true
interest of Britain lay in proposing and promoting the independence
of America immediately after the last peace; for the expense which
Britain had then incurred by defending America as her own dominions,
ought to have shown her the policy and necessity of changing the
style of the country, as the best probable method of preventing
future wars and expense, and the only method by which she could hold
the commerce without the charge of sovereignty. Besides which, the
title which she assumed, of parent country, led to, and pointed out
the propriety, wisdom and advantage of a separation; for, as in
private life, children grow into men, and by setting up for
themselves, extend and secure the interest of the whole family, so in
the settlement of colonies large enough to admit of maturity, the
same policy should be pursued, and the same consequences would
follow. Nothing hurts the affections both of parents and children so
much, as living too closely connected, and keeping up the distinction
too long. Domineering will not do over those, who, by a progress in
life, have become equal in rank to their parents, that is, when they
have families of their own; and though they may conceive themselves
the subjects of their advice, will not suppose them the objects of
their government. I do not, by drawing this parallel, mean to admit
the title of parent country, because, if it is due any where, it is
due to Europe collectively, and the first settlers from England were
driven here by persecution. I mean only to introduce the term for the
sake of policy and to show from your title the line of your interest.

When you saw the state of strength and opulence, and that by her own
industry, which America arrived at, you ought to have advised her to
set up for herself, and proposed an alliance of interest with her,
and in so doing you would have drawn, and that at her own expense,
more real advantage, and more military supplies and assistance, both
of ships and men, than from any weak and wrangling government that
you could exercise over her. In short, had you studied only the
domestic politics of a family, you would have learned how to govern
the state; but, instead of this easy and natural line, you flew out
into every thing which was wild and outrageous, till, by following
the passion and stupidity of the pilot, you wrecked the vessel within
sight of the shore.

Having shown what you ought to have done, I now proceed to show why
it was not done. The caterpillar circle of the court had an interest
to pursue, distinct from, and opposed to yours; for though by the
independence of America and an alliance therewith, the trade would
have continued, if not increased, as in many articles neither country
can go to a better market, and though by defending and protecting
herself, she would have been no expense to you, and consequently your
national charges would have decreased, and your taxes might have been
proportionably lessened thereby; yet the striking off so many places
from the court calendar was put in opposition to the interest of the
nation. The loss of thirteen government ships, with their appendages,
here and in England, is a shocking sound in the ear of a hungry
courtier. Your present king and ministry will be the ruin of you; and
you had better risk a revolution and call a Congress, than be thus
led on from madness to despair, and from despair to ruin. America has
set you the example, and you may follow it and be free.

I now come to the last part, a war with France. This is what no man
in his senses will advise you to, and all good men would wish to
prevent. Whether France will declare war against you, is not for me
in this place to mention, or to hint, even if I knew it; but it must
be madness in you to do it first. The matter is come now to a full
crisis, and peace is easy if willingly set about. Whatever you may
think, France has behaved handsomely to you. She would have been
unjust to herself to have acted otherwise than she did; and having
accepted our offer of alliance she gave you genteel notice of it.
There was nothing in her conduct reserved or indelicate, and while
she announced her determination to support her treaty, she left you
to give the first offence. America, on her part, has exhibited a
character of firmness to the world. Unprepared and unarmed, without
form or government, she, singly opposed a nation that domineered over
half the globe. The greatness of the deed demands respect; and though
you may feel resentment, you are compelled both to wonder and admire.

Here I rest my arguments and finish my address. Such as it is, it is
a gift, and you are welcome. It was always my design to dedicate a
Crisis to you, when the time should come that would properly make it
a Crisis; and when, likewise, I should catch myself in a temper to
write it, and suppose you in a condition to read it. That time has
now arrived, and with it the opportunity for conveyance. For the
commissioners- poor commissioners! having proclaimed, that "yet forty
days and Nineveh shall be overthrown," have waited out the date, and,
discontented with their God, are returning to their gourd. And all
the harm I wish them is, that it may not wither about their ears, and
that they may not make their exit in the belly of a whale.

COMMON SENSE.

PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 21, 1778.

P.S.- Though in the tranquillity of my mind I have concluded with a
laugh, yet I have something to mention to the commissioners, which,
to them, is serious and worthy their attention. Their authority is
derived from an Act of Parliament, which likewise describes and
limits their official powers. Their commission, therefore, is only a
recital, and personal investiture, of those powers, or a nomination
and description of the persons who are to execute them. Had it
contained any thing contrary to, or gone beyond the line of, the
written law from which it is derived, and by which it is bound, it
would, by the English constitution, have been treason in the crown,
and the king been subject to an impeachment. He dared not, therefore,
put in his commission what you have put in your proclamation, that
is, he dared not have authorised you in that commission to burn and
destroy any thing in America. You are both in the act and in the
commission styled commissioners for restoring peace, and the methods
for doing it are there pointed out. Your last proclamation is signed
by you as commissioners under that act. You make Parliament the
patron of its contents. Yet, in the body of it, you insert matters
contrary both to the spirit and letter of the act, and what likewise
your king dared not have put in his commission to you. The state of
things in England, gentlemen, is too ticklish for you to run hazards.
You are accountable to Parliament for the execution of that act
according to the letter of it. Your heads may pay for breaking it,
for you certainly have broke it by exceeding it. And as a friend, who
would wish you to escape the paw of the lion, as well as the belly of
the whale, I civilly hint to you, to keep within compass.

Sir Harry Clinton, strictly speaking, is as accountable as the rest;
for though a general, he is likewise a commissioner, acting under a
superior authority. His first obedience is due to the act; and his
plea of being a general, will not and cannot clear him as a
commissioner, for that would suppose the crown, in its single
capacity, to have a power of dispensing with an Act of Parliament.
Your situation, gentlemen, is nice and critical, and the more so
because England is unsettled. Take heed! Remember the times of
Charles the First! For Laud and Stafford fell by trusting to a hope
like yours.

Having thus shown you the danger of your proclamation, I now show you
the folly of it. The means contradict your design: you threaten to
lay waste, in order to render America a useless acquisition of
alliance to France. I reply, that the more destruction you commit (if
you could do it) the more valuable to France you make that alliance.
You can destroy only houses and goods; and by so doing you increase
our demand upon her for materials and merchandise; for the wants of
one nation, provided it has freedom and credit, naturally produce
riches to the other; and, as you can neither ruin the land nor
prevent the vegetation, you would increase the exportation of our
produce in payment, which would be to her a new fund of wealth. In
short, had you cast about for a plan on purpose to enrich your
enemies, you could not have hit upon a better.

                           The Crisis 

                                VIII.

                  ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.

"TRUSTING (says the king of England in his speech of November last,)
in the divine providence, and in the justice of my cause, I am firmly
resolved to prosecute the war with vigor, and to make every exertion
in order to compel our enemies to equitable terms of peace and
accommodation." To this declaration the United States of America, and
the confederated powers of Europe will reply, if Britain will have
war, she shall have enough of it.

Five years have nearly elapsed since the commencement of hostilities,
and every campaign, by a gradual decay, has lessened your ability to
conquer, without producing a serious thought on your condition or
your fate. Like a prodigal lingering in an habitual consumption, you
feel the relics of life, and mistake them for recovery. New schemes,
like new medicines, have administered fresh hopes, and prolonged the
disease instead of curing it. A change of generals, like a change of
physicians, served only to keep the flattery alive, and furnish new
pretences for new extravagance.

"Can Britain fail?"* has been proudly asked at the undertaking of
every enterprise; and that "whatever she wills is fate,"*(2) has been
given with the solemnity of prophetic confidence; and though the
question has been constantly replied to by disappointment, and the
prediction falsified by misfortune, yet still the insult continued,
and your catalogue of national evils increased therewith. Eager to
persuade the world of her power, she considered destruction as the
minister of greatness, and conceived that the glory of a nation like
that of an [American] Indian, lay in the number of its scalps and the
miseries which it inflicts.

* Whitehead's New Year's ode for 1776.
*(2) Ode at the installation of Lord North, for Chancellor of the
University of Oxford.

Fire, sword and want, as far as the arms of Britain could extend
them, have been spread with wanton cruelty along the coast of
America; and while you, remote from the scene of suffering, had
nothing to lose and as little to dread, the information reached you
like a tale of antiquity, in which the distance of time defaces the
conception, and changes the severest sorrows into conversable
amusement.

This makes the second paper, addressed perhaps in vain, to the people
of England. That advice should be taken wherever example has failed,
or precept be regarded where warning is ridiculed, is like a picture
of hope resting on despair: but when time shall stamp with universal
currency the facts you have long encountered with a laugh, and the
irresistible evidence of accumulated losses, like the handwriting on
the wall, shall add terror to distress, you will then, in a conflict
of suffering, learn to sympathize with others by feeling for
yourselves.

The triumphant appearance of the combined fleets in the channel and
at your harbor's mouth, and the expedition of Captain Paul Jones, on
the western and eastern coasts of England and Scotland, will, by
placing you in the condition of an endangered country, read to you a
stronger lecture on the calamities of invasion, and bring to your
minds a truer picture of promiscuous distress, than the most finished
rhetoric can describe or the keenest imagination conceive.

Hitherto you have experienced the expenses, but nothing of the
miseries of war. Your disappointments have been accompanied with no
immediate suffering, and your losses came to you only by
intelligence. Like fire at a distance you heard not even the cry; you
felt not the danger, you saw not the confusion. To you every thing
has been foreign but the taxes to support it. You knew not what it
was to be alarmed at midnight with an armed enemy in the streets. You
were strangers to the distressing scene of a family in flight, and to
the thousand restless cares and tender sorrows that incessantly
arose. To see women and children wandering in the severity of winter,
with the broken remains of a well furnished house, and seeking
shelter in every crib and hut, were matters that you had no
conception of. You knew not what it was to stand by and see your
goods chopped for fuel, and your beds ripped to pieces to make
packages for plunder. The misery of others, like a tempestuous night,
added to the pleasures of your own security. You even enjoyed the
storm, by contemplating the difference of conditions, and that which
carried sorrow into the breasts of thousands served but to heighten
in you a species of tranquil pride. Yet these are but the fainter
sufferings of war, when compared with carnage and slaughter, the
miseries of a military hospital, or a town in flames.

The people of America, by anticipating distress, had fortified their
minds against every species you could inflict. They had resolved to
abandon their homes, to resign them to destruction, and to seek new
settlements rather than submit. Thus familiarized to misfortune,
before it arrived, they bore their portion with the less regret: the
justness of their cause was a continual source of consolation, and
the hope of final victory, which never left them, served to lighten
the load and sweeten the cup allotted them to drink.

But when their troubles shall become yours, and invasion be
transferred upon the invaders, you will have neither their extended
wilderness to fly to, their cause to comfort you, nor their hope to
rest upon. Distress with them was sharpened by no self-reflection.
They had not brought it on themselves. On the contrary, they had by
every proceeding endeavored to avoid it, and had descended even below
the mark of congressional character, to prevent a war. The national
honor or the advantages of independence were matters which, at the
commencement of the dispute, they had never studied, and it was only
at the last moment that the measure was resolved on. Thus
circumstanced, they naturally and conscientiously felt a dependence
upon providence. They had a clear pretension to it, and had they
failed therein, infidelity had gained a triumph.

But your condition is the reverse of theirs. Every thing you suffer
you have sought: nay, had you created mischiefs on purpose to inherit
them, you could not have secured your title by a firmer deed. The
world awakens with no pity it your complaints. You felt none for
others; you deserve none for yourselves. Nature does not interest
herself in cases like yours, but, on the contrary, turns from them
with dislike, and abandons them to punishment. You may now present
memorials to what court you please, but so far as America is the
object, none will listen. The policy of Europe, and the propensity
there in every mind to curb insulting ambition, and bring cruelty to
judgment, are unitedly against you; and where nature and interest
reinforce with each other, the compact is too intimate to be
dissolved.

Make but the case of others your own, and your own theirs, and you
will then have a clear idea of the whole. Had France acted towards
her colonies as you have done, you would have branded her with every
epithet of abhorrence; and had you, like her, stepped in to succor a
struggling people, all Europe must have echoed with your own
applauses. But entangled in the passion of dispute you see it not as
you ought, and form opinions thereon which suit with no interest but
your own. You wonder that America does not rise in union with you to
impose on herself a portion of your taxes and reduce herself to
unconditional submission. You are amazed that the southern powers of
Europe do not assist you in conquering a country which is afterwards
to be turned against themselves; and that the northern ones do not
contribute to reinstate you in America who already enjoy the market
for naval stores by the separation. You seem surprised that Holland
does not pour in her succors to maintain you mistress of the seas,
when her own commerce is suffering by your act of navigation; or that
any country should study her own interest while yours is on the
carpet.

Such excesses of passionate folly, and unjust as well as unwise
resentment, have driven you on, like Pharaoh, to unpitied miseries,
and while the importance of the quarrel shall perpetuate your
disgrace, the flag of America will carry it round the world. The
natural feelings of every rational being will be against you, and
wherever the story shall be told, you will have neither excuse nor
consolation left. With an unsparing hand, and an insatiable mind, you
have desolated the world, to gain dominion and to lose it; and while,
in a frenzy of avarice and ambition, the east and the west are doomed
to tributary bondage, you rapidly earned destruction as the wages of
a nation.

At the thoughts of a war at home, every man amongst you ought to
tremble. The prospect is far more dreadful there than in America.
Here the party that was against the measures of the continent were in
general composed of a kind of neutrals, who added strength to neither
army. There does not exist a being so devoid of sense and sentiment
as to covet "unconditional submission," and therefore no man in
America could be with you in principle. Several might from a
cowardice of mind, prefer it to the hardships and dangers of opposing
it; but the same disposition that gave them such a choice, unfitted
them to act either for or against us. But England is rent into
parties, with equal shares of resolution. The principle which
produced the war divides the nation. Their animosities are in the
highest state of fermentation, and both sides, by a call of the
militia, are in arms. No human foresight can discern, no conclusion
can be formed, what turn a war might take, if once set on foot by an
invasion. She is not now in a fit disposition to make a common cause
of her own affairs, and having no conquests to hope for abroad, and
nothing but expenses arising at home, her everything is staked upon a
defensive combat, and the further she goes the worse she is off.

There are situations that a nation may be in, in which peace or war,
abstracted from every other consideration, may be politically right
or wrong. When nothing can be lost by a war, but what must be lost
without it, war is then the policy of that country; and such was the
situation of America at the commencement of hostilities: but when no
security can be gained by a war, but what may be accomplished by a
peace, the case becomes reversed, and such now is the situation of
England.

That America is beyond the reach of conquest, is a fact which
experience has shown and time confirmed, and this admitted, what, I
ask, is now the object of contention? If there be any honor in
pursuing self-destruction with inflexible passion- if national
suicide be the perfection of national glory, you may, with all the
pride of criminal happiness, expire unenvied and unrivalled. But when
the tumult of war shall cease, and the tempest of present passions be
succeeded by calm reflection, or when those, who, surviving its fury,
shall inherit from you a legacy of debts and misfortunes, when the
yearly revenue scarcely be able to discharge the interest of the one,
and no possible remedy be left for the other, ideas far different
from the present will arise, and embitter the remembrance of former
follies. A mind disarmed of its rage feels no pleasure in
contemplating a frantic quarrel. Sickness of thought, the sure
consequence of conduct like yours, leaves no ability for enjoyment,
no relish for resentment; and though, like a man in a fit, you feel
not the injury of the struggle, nor distinguish between strength and
disease, the weakness will nevertheless be proportioned to the
violence, and the sense of pain increase with the recovery.

To what persons or to whose system of politics you owe your present
state of wretchedness, is a matter of total indifference to America.
They have contributed, however unwillingly, to set her above
themselves, and she, in the tranquillity of conquest, resigns the
inquiry. The case now is not so properly who began the war, as who
continues it. That there are men in all countries to whom a state of
war is a mine of wealth, is a fact never to be doubted. Characters
like these naturally breed in the putrefaction of distempered times,
and after fattening on the disease, they perish with it, or,
impregnated with the stench, retreat into obscurity.

But there are several erroneous notions to which you likewise owe a
share of your misfortunes, and which, if continued, will only
increase your trouble and your losses. An opinion hangs about the
gentlemen of the minority, that America would relish measures under
their administration, which she would not from the present cabinet.
On this rock Lord Chatham would have split had he gained the helm,
and several of his survivors are steering the same course. Such
distinctions in the infancy of the argument had some degree of
foundation, but they now serve no other purpose than to lengthen out
a war, in which the limits of a dispute, being fixed by the fate of
arms, and guaranteed by treaties, are not to be changed or altered by
trivial circumstances.

The ministry, and many of the minority, sacrifice their time in
disputing on a question with which they have nothing to do, namely,
whether America shall be independent or not. Whereas the only
question that can come under their determination is, whether they
will accede to it or not. They confound a military question with a
political one, and undertake to supply by a vote what they lost by a
battle. Say she shall not be independent, and it will signify as much
as if they voted against a decree of fate, or say that she shall, and
she will be no more independent than before. Questions which, when
determined, cannot be executed, serve only to show the folly of
dispute and the weakness of disputants.

From a long habit of calling America your own, you suppose her
governed by the same prejudices and conceits which govern yourselves.
Because you have set up a particular denomination of religion to the
exclusion of all others, you imagine she must do the same, and
because you, with an unsociable narrowness of mind, have cherished
enmity against France and Spain, you suppose her alliance must be
defective in friendship. Copying her notions of the world from you,
she formerly thought as you instructed, but now feeling herself free,
and the prejudice removed, she thinks and acts upon a different
system. It frequently happens that in proportion as we are taught to
dislike persons and countries, not knowing why, we feel an ardor of
esteem upon the removal of the mistake: it seems as if something was
to be made amends for, and we eagerly give in to every office of
friendship, to atone for the injury of the error. But, perhaps, there
is something in the extent of countries, which, among the generality
of people, insensibly communicates extension of the mind. The soul of
an islander, in its native state, seems bounded by the foggy confines
of the water's edge, and all beyond affords to him matters only for
profit or curiosity, not for friendship. His island is to him his
world, and fixed to that, his every thing centers in it; while those
who are inhabitants of a continent, by casting their eye over a
larger field, take in likewise a larger intellectual circuit, and
thus approaching nearer to an acquaintance with the universe, their
atmosphere of thought is extended, and their liberality fills a wider
space. In short, our minds seem to be measured by countries when we
are men, as they are by places when we are children, and until
something happens to disentangle us from the prejudice, we serve
under it without perceiving it.

In addition to this, it may be remarked, that men who study any
universal science, the principles of which are universally known, or
admitted, and applied without distinction to the common benefit of
all countries, obtain thereby a larger share of philanthropy than
those who only study national arts and improvements. Natural
philosophy, mathematics and astronomy, carry the mind from the
country to the creation, and give it a fitness suited to the extent.
It was not Newton's honor, neither could it be his pride, that he was
an Englishman, but that he was a philosopher, the heavens had
liberated him from the prejudices of an island, and science had
expanded his soul as boundless as his studies.

PHILADELPHIA, March, 1780.


                            The Crisis 

                                  IX.

HAD America pursued her advantages with half the spirit that she
resisted her misfortunes, she would, before now, have been a
conquering and a peaceful people; but lulled in the lap of soft
tranquillity, she rested on her hopes, and adversity only has
convulsed her into action. Whether subtlety or sincerity at the close
of the last year induced the enemy to an appearance for peace, is a
point not material to know; it is sufficient that we see the effects
it has had on our politics, and that we sternly rise to resent the
delusion.

The war, on the part of America, has been a war of natural feelings.
Brave in distress; serene in conquest; drowsy while at rest; and in
every situation generously disposed to peace; a dangerous calm, and a
most heightened zeal have, as circumstances varied, succeeded each
other. Every passion but that of despair has been called to a tour of
duty; and so mistaken has been the enemy, of our abilities and
disposition, that when she supposed us conquered, we rose the
conquerors. The extensiveness of the United States, and the variety
of their resources; the universality of their cause, the quick
operation of their feelings, and the similarity of their sentiments,
have, in every trying situation, produced a something, which, favored
by providence, and pursued with ardor, has accomplished in an instant
the business of a campaign. We have never deliberately sought
victory, but snatched it; and bravely undone in an hour the blotted
operations of a season.

The reported fate of Charleston, like the misfortunes of 1776, has at
last called forth a spirit, and kindled up a flame, which perhaps no
other event could have produced. If the enemy has circulated a
falsehood, they have unwisely aggravated us into life, and if they
have told us the truth, they have unintentionally done us a service.
We were returning with folded arms from the fatigues of war, and
thinking and sitting leisurely down to enjoy repose. The dependence
that has been put upon Charleston threw a drowsiness over America. We
looked on the business done- the conflict over- the matter settled-
or that all which remained unfinished would follow of itself. In this
state of dangerous relaxation, exposed to the poisonous infusions of
the enemy, and having no common danger to attract our attention, we
were extinguishing, by stages, the ardor we began with, and
surrendering by piece-meal the virtue that defended us.

Afflicting as the loss of Charleston may be, yet if it universally
rouse us from the slumber of twelve months past, and renew in us the
spirit of former days, it will produce an advantage more important
than its loss. America ever is what she thinks herself to be.
Governed by sentiment, and acting her own mind, she becomes, as she
pleases, the victor or the victim.

It is not the conquest of towns, nor the accidental capture of
garrisons, that can reduce a country so extensive as this. The
sufferings of one part can never be relieved by the exertions of
another, and there is no situation the enemy can be placed in that
does not afford to us the same advantages which he seeks himself. By
dividing his force, he leaves every post attackable. It is a mode of
war that carries with it a confession of weakness, and goes on the
principle of distress rather than conquest.

The decline of the enemy is visible, not only in their operations,
but in their plans; Charleston originally made but a secondary object
in the system of attack, and it is now become their principal one,
because they have not been able to succeed elsewhere. It would have
carried a cowardly appearance in Europe had they formed their grand
expedition, in 1776, against a part of the continent where there was
no army, or not a sufficient one to oppose them; but failing year
after year in their impressions here, and to the eastward and
northward, they deserted their capital design, and prudently
contenting themselves with what they can get, give a flourish of
honor to conceal disgrace.

But this piece-meal work is not conquering the continent. It is a
discredit in them to attempt it, and in us to suffer it. It is now
full time to put an end to a war of aggravations, which, on one side,
has no possible object, and on the other has every inducement which
honor, interest, safety and happiness can inspire. If we suffer them
much longer to remain among us, we shall become as bad as themselves.
An association of vice will reduce us more than the sword. A nation
hardened in the practice of iniquity knows better how to profit by
it, than a young country newly corrupted. We are not a match for them
in the line of advantageous guilt, nor they for us on the principles
which we bravely set out with. Our first days were our days of honor.
They have marked the character of America wherever the story of her
wars are told; and convinced of this, we have nothing to do but
wisely and unitedly to tread the well known track. The progress of a
war is often as ruinous to individuals, as the issue of it is to a
nation; and it is not only necessary that our forces be such that we
be conquerors in the end, but that by timely exertions we be secure
in the interim. The present campaign will afford an opportunity which
has never presented itself before, and the preparations for it are
equally necessary, whether Charleston stand or fall. Suppose the
first, it is in that case only a failure of the enemy, not a defeat.
All the conquest that a besieged town can hope for, is, not to be
conquered; and compelling an enemy to raise the siege, is to the
besieged a victory. But there must be a probability amounting almost
to a certainty, that would justify a garrison marching out to attack
a retreat. Therefore should Charleston not be taken, and the enemy
abandon the siege, every other part of the continent should prepare
to meet them; and, on the contrary, should it be taken, the same
preparations are necessary to balance the loss, and put ourselves in
a position to co-operate with our allies, immediately on their
arrival.

We are not now fighting our battles alone, as we were in 1776;
England, from a malicious disposition to America, has not only not
declared war against France and Spain, but, the better to prosecute
her passions here, has afforded those powers no military object, and
avoids them, to distress us. She will suffer her West India islands
to be overrun by France, and her southern settlements to be taken by
Spain, rather than quit the object that gratifies her revenge. This
conduct, on the part of Britain, has pointed out the propriety of
France sending a naval and land force to co-operate with America on
the spot. Their arrival cannot be very distant, nor the ravages of
the enemy long. The recruiting the army, and procuring the supplies,
are the two things most necessary to be accomplished, and a capture
of either of the enemy's divisions will restore to America peace and
plenty.

At a crisis, big, like the present, with expectation and events, the
whole country is called to unanimity and exertion. Not an ability
ought now to sleep, that can produce but a mite to the general good,
nor even a whisper to pass that militates against it. The necessity
of the case, and the importance of the consequences, admit no delay
from a friend, no apology from an enemy. To spare now, would be the
height of extravagance, and to consult present ease, would be to
sacrifice it perhaps forever.

America, rich in patriotism and produce, can want neither men nor
supplies, when a serious necessity calls them forth. The slow
operation of taxes, owing to the extensiveness of collection, and
their depreciated value before they arrived in the treasury, have, in
many instances, thrown a burden upon government, which has been
artfully interpreted by the enemy into a general decline throughout
the country. Yet this, inconvenient as it may at first appear, is not
only remediable, but may be turned to an immediate advantage; for it
makes no real difference, whether a certain number of men, or company
of militia (and in this country every man is a militia-man), are
directed by law to send a recruit at their own expense, or whether a
tax is laid on them for that purpose, and the man hired by government
afterwards. The first, if there is any difference, is both cheapest
and best, because it saves the expense which would attend collecting
it as a tax, and brings the man sooner into the field than the modes
of recruiting formerly used; and, on this principle, a law has been
passed in this state, for recruiting two men from each company of
militia, which will add upwards of a thousand to the force of the
country.

But the flame which has broken forth in this city since the report
from New York, of the loss of Charleston, not only does honor to the
place, but, like the blaze of 1776, will kindle into action the
scattered sparks throughout America. The valor of a country may be
learned by the bravery of its soldiery, and the general cast of its
inhabitants, but confidence of success is best discovered by the
active measures pursued by men of property; and when the spirit of
enterprise becomes so universal as to act at once on all ranks of
men, a war may then, and not till then, be styled truly popular.

In 1776, the ardor of the enterprising part was considerably checked
by the real revolt of some, and the coolness of others. But in the
present case, there is a firmness in the substance and property of
the country to the public cause. An association has been entered into
by the merchants, tradesmen, and principal inhabitants of the city
[Philadelphia], to receive and support the new state money at the
value of gold and silver; a measure which, while it does them honor,
will likewise contribute to their interest, by rendering the
operations of the campaign convenient and effectual.

Nor has the spirit of exertion stopped here. A voluntary subscription
is likewise begun, to raise a fund of hard money, to be given as
bounties, to fill up the full quota of the Pennsylvania line. It has
been the remark of the enemy, that every thing in America has been
done by the force of government; but when she sees individuals
throwing in their voluntary aid, and facilitating the public measures
in concert with the established powers of the country, it will
convince her that the cause of America stands not on the will of a
few but on the broad foundation of property and popularity.

Thus aided and thus supported, disaffection will decline, and the
withered head of tyranny expire in America. The ravages of the enemy
will be short and limited, and like all their former ones, will
produce a victory over themselves.

                                       COMMON SENSE.

PHILADELPHIA, June 9, 1780.

P. S. At the time of writing this number of the Crisis, the loss of
Charleston, though believed by some, was more confidently disbelieved
by others. But there ought to be no longer a doubt upon the matter.
Charleston is gone, and I believe for the want of a sufficient supply
of provisions. The man that does not now feel for the honor of the
best and noblest cause that ever a country engaged in, and exert
himself accordingly, is no longer worthy of a peaceable residence
among a people determined to be free.

                                             C. S.

                       THE CRISIS EXTRAORDINARY

                      ON THE SUBJECT OF TAXATION.

IT IS impossible to sit down and think seriously on the affairs of
America, but the original principles upon which she resisted, and the
glow and ardor which they inspired, will occur like the undefaced
remembrance of a lovely scene. To trace over in imagination the
purity of the cause, the voluntary sacrifices that were made to
support it, and all the various turnings of the war in its defence,
is at once both paying and receiving respect. The principles deserve
to be remembered, and to remember them rightly is repossessing them.
In this indulgence of generous recollection, we become gainers by
what we seem to give, and the more we bestow the richer we become.

So extensively right was the ground on which America proceeded, that
it not only took in every just and liberal sentiment which could
impress the heart, but made it the direct interest of every class and
order of men to defend the country. The war, on the part of Britain,
was originally a war of covetousness. The sordid and not the splendid
passions gave it being. The fertile fields and prosperous infancy of
America appeared to her as mines for tributary wealth. She viewed the
hive, and disregarding the industry that had enriched it, thirsted
for the honey. But in the present stage of her affairs, the violence
of temper is added to the rage of avarice; and therefore, that which
at the first setting out proceeded from purity of principle and
public interest, is now heightened by all the obligations of
necessity; for it requires but little knowledge of human nature to
discern what would be the consequence, were America again reduced to
the subjection of Britain. Uncontrolled power, in the hands of an
incensed, imperious, and rapacious conqueror, is an engine of
dreadful execution, and woe be to that country over which it can be
exercised. The names of Whig and Tory would then be sunk in the
general term of rebel, and the oppression, whatever it might be,
would, with very few instances of exception, light equally on all.

Britain did not go to war with America for the sake of dominion,
because she was then in possession; neither was it for the extension
of trade and commerce, because she had monopolized the whole, and the
country had yielded to it; neither was it to extinguish what she
might call rebellion, because before she began no resistance existed.
It could then be from no other motive than avarice, or a design of
establishing, in the first instance, the same taxes in America as are
paid in England (which, as I shall presently show, are above eleven
times heavier than the taxes we now pay for the present year, 1780)
or, in the second instance, to confiscate the whole property of
America, in case of resistance and conquest of the latter, of which
she had then no doubt.

I shall now proceed to show what the taxes in England are, and what
the yearly expense of the present war is to her- what the taxes of
this country amount to, and what the annual expense of defending it
effectually will be to us; and shall endeavor concisely to point out
the cause of our difficulties, and the advantages on one side, and
the consequences on the other, in case we do, or do not, put
ourselves in an effectual state of defence. I mean to be open,
candid, and sincere. I see a universal wish to expel the enemy from
the country, a murmuring because the war is not carried on with more
vigor, and my intention is to show, as shortly as possible, both the
reason and the remedy.

The number of souls in England (exclusive of Scotland and Ireland) is
seven millions,* and the number of souls in America is three
millions.

* This is taking the highest number that the people of England have
been, or can be rated at.

The amount of taxes in England (exclusive of Scotland and Ireland)
was, before the present war commenced, eleven millions six hundred
and forty-two thousand six hundred and fifty-three pounds sterling;
which, on an average, is no less a sum than one pound thirteen
shillings and three-pence sterling per head per annum, men, women,
and children; besides county taxes, taxes for the support of the
poor, and a tenth of all the produce of the earth for the support of
the bishops and clergy.* Nearly five millions of this sum went
annually to pay the interest of the national debt, contracted by
former wars, and the remaining sum of six millions six hundred and
forty-two thousand six hundred pounds was applied to defray the
yearly expense of government, the peace establishment of the army and
navy, placemen, pensioners, etc.; consequently the whole of the
enormous taxes being thus appropriated, she had nothing to spare out
of them towards defraying the expenses of the present war or any
other. Yet had she not been in debt at the beginning of the war, as
we were not, and, like us, had only a land and not a naval war to
carry on, her then revenue of eleven millions and a half pounds
sterling would have defrayed all her annual expenses of war and
government within each year.
* The following is taken from Dr. Price's state of the taxes of
England.

But this not being the case with her, she is obliged to borrow about
ten millions pounds sterling, yearly, to prosecute the war that she
is now engaged in, (this year she borrowed twelve) and lay on new
taxes to discharge the interest; allowing that the present war has
cost her only fifty millions sterling, the interest thereon, at five
per cent., will be two millions and an half; therefore the amount of
her taxes now must be fourteen millions, which on an average is no
less than forty shillings sterling, per head, men, women and
children, throughout the nation. Now as this expense of fifty
millions was borrowed on the hopes of conquering America, and as it
was avarice which first induced her to commence the war, how truly
wretched and deplorable would the condition of this country be, were
she, by her own remissness, to suffer an enemy of such a disposition,
and so circumstanced, to reduce her to subjection.

I now proceed to the revenues of America.

I have already stated the number of souls in America to be three
millions, and by a calculation that I have made, which I have every
reason to believe is sufficiently correct, the whole expense of the
war, and the support of the several governments, may be defrayed for
two million pounds sterling annually; which, on an average, is
thirteen shillings and four pence per head, men, women, and children,
and the peace establishment at the end of the war will be but three
quarters of a million, or five shillings sterling per head. Now,
throwing out of the question everything of honor, principle,
happiness, freedom, and reputation in the world, and taking it up on
the simple ground of interest, I put the following case:

Suppose Britain was to conquer America, and, as a conqueror, was to
lay her under no other conditions than to pay the same proportion
towards her annual revenue which the people of England pay: our
share, in that case, would be six million pounds sterling yearly. Can
it then be a question, whether it is best to raise two millions to
defend the country, and govern it ourselves, and only three quarters
of a million afterwards, or pay six millions to have it conquered,
and let the enemy govern it?

Can it be supposed that conquerors would choose to put themselves in
a worse condition than what they granted to the conquered? In
England, the tax on rum is five shillings and one penny sterling per
gallon, which is one silver dollar and fourteen coppers. Now would it
not be laughable to imagine, that after the expense they have been
at, they would let either Whig or Tory drink it cheaper than
themselves? Coffee, which is so inconsiderable an article of
consumption and support here, is there loaded with a duty which makes
the price between five and six shillings per pound, and a penalty of
fifty pounds sterling on any person detected in roasting it in his
own house. There is scarcely a necessary of life that you can eat,
drink, wear, or enjoy, that is not there loaded with a tax; even the
light from heaven is only permitted to shine into their dwellings by
paying eighteen pence sterling per window annually; and the humblest
drink of life, small beer, cannot there be purchased without a tax of
nearly two coppers per gallon, besides a heavy tax upon the malt, and
another on the hops before it is brewed, exclusive of a land-tax on
the earth which produces them. In short, the condition of that
country, in point of taxation, is so oppressive, the number of her
poor so great, and the extravagance and rapaciousness of the court so
enormous, that, were they to effect a conquest of America, it is then
only that the distresses of America would begin. Neither would it
signify anything to a man whether he be Whig or Tory. The people of
England, and the ministry of that country, know us by no such
distinctions. What they want is clear, solid revenue, and the modes
which they would take to procure it, would operate alike on all.
Their manner of reasoning would be short, because they would
naturally infer, that if we were able to carry on a war of five or
six years against them, we were able to pay the same taxes which they
do.

I have already stated that the expense of conducting the present war,
and the government of the several states, may be done for two
millions sterling, and the establishment in the time of peace, for
three quarters of a million.*

* I have made the calculations in sterling, because it is a rate
generally known in all the states, and because, likewise, it admits
of an easy comparison between our expenses to support the war, and
those of the enemy. Four silver dollars and a half is one pound
sterling, and three pence over.

As to navy matters, they flourish so well, and are so well attended
to by individuals, that I think it consistent on every principle of
real use and economy, to turn the navy into hard money (keeping only
three or four packets) and apply it to the service of the army. We
shall not have a ship the less; the use of them, and the benefit from
them, will be greatly increased, and their expense saved. We are now
allied with a formidable naval power, from whom we derive the
assistance of a navy. And the line in which we can prosecute the war,
so as to reduce the common enemy and benefit the alliance most
effectually, will be by attending closely to the land service.

I estimate the charge of keeping up and maintaining an army,
officering them, and all expenses included, sufficient for the
defence of the country, to be equal to the expense of forty thousand
men at thirty pounds sterling per head, which is one million two
hundred thousand pounds.

I likewise allow four hundred thousand pounds for continental
expenses at home and abroad.

And four hundred thousand pounds for the support of the several state
governments- the amount will then be:

    For the army                                         1,200,000 L.
    Continental expenses at home and abroad                400,000
    Government of the several states                       400,000

                                                   Total 2,000,000 L.

I take the proportion of this state, Pennsylvania, to be an eighth
part of the thirteen United States; the quota then for us to raise
will be two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling; two hundred
thousand of which will be our share for the support and pay of the
army, and continental expenses at home and abroad, and fifty thousand
pounds for the support of the state government.

In order to gain an idea of the proportion in which the raising such
a sum will fall, I make the following calculation:

Pennsylvania contains three hundred and seventy-five thousand
inhabitants, men, women and children; which is likewise an eighth of
the number of inhabitants of the whole United States: therefore, two
hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling to be raised among three
hundred and seventy-five thousand persons, is, on an average,
thirteen shillings and four pence per head, per annum, or something
more than one shilling sterling per month. And our proportion of
three quarters of a million for the government of the country, in
time of peace, will be ninety-three thousand seven hundred and fifty
pounds sterling; fifty thousand of which will be for the government
expenses of the state, and forty-three thousand seven hundred and
fifty pounds for continental expenses at home and abroad.

The peace establishment then will, on an average, be five shillings
sterling per head. Whereas, was England now to stop, and the war
cease, her peace establishment would continue the same as it is now,
viz. forty shillings per head; therefore was our taxes necessary for
carrying on the war, as much per head as hers now is, and the
difference to be only whether we should, at the end of the war, pay
at the rate of five shillings per head, or forty shillings per head,
the case needs no thinking of. But as we can securely defend and keep
the country for one third less than what our burden would be if it
was conquered, and support the governments afterwards for one eighth
of what Britain would levy on us, and could I find a miser whose
heart never felt the emotion of a spark of principle, even that man,
uninfluenced by every love but the love of money, and capable of no
attachment but to his interest, would and must, from the frugality
which governs him, contribute to the defence of the country, or he
ceases to be a miser and becomes an idiot. But when we take in with
it every thing that can ornament mankind; when the line of our
interest becomes the line of our happiness; when all that can cheer
and animate the heart, when a sense of honor, fame, character, at
home and abroad, are interwoven not only with the security but the
increase of property, there exists not a man in America, unless he be
an hired emissary, who does not see that his good is connected with
keeping up a sufficient defence.

I do not imagine that an instance can be produced in the world, of a
country putting herself to such an amazing charge to conquer and
enslave another, as Britain has done. The sum is too great for her to
think of with any tolerable degree of temper; and when we consider
the burden she sustains, as well as the disposition she has shown, it
would be the height of folly in us to suppose that she would not
reimburse herself by the most rapid means, had she America once more
within her power. With such an oppression of expense, what would an
empty conquest be to her! What relief under such circumstances could
she derive from a victory without a prize? It was money, it was
revenue she first went to war for, and nothing but that would satisfy
her. It is not the nature of avarice to be satisfied with any thing
else. Every passion that acts upon mankind has a peculiar mode of
operation. Many of them are temporary and fluctuating; they admit of
cessation and variety. But avarice is a fixed, uniform passion. It
neither abates of its vigor nor changes its object; and the reason
why it does not, is founded in the nature of things, for wealth has
not a rival where avarice is a ruling passion. One beauty may excel
another, and extinguish from the mind of man the pictured remembrance
of a former one: but wealth is the phoenix of avarice, and therefore
it cannot seek a new object, because there is not another in the
world.

I now pass on to show the value of the present taxes, and compare
them with the annual expense; but this I shall preface with a few
explanatory remarks.

There are two distinct things which make the payment of taxes
difficult; the one is the large and real value of the sum to be paid,
and the other is the scarcity of the thing in which the payment is to
be made; and although these appear to be one and the same, they are
in several instances riot only different, but the difficulty springs
from different causes.

Suppose a tax to be laid equal to one half of what a man's yearly
income is, such a tax could not be paid, because the property could
not be spared; and on the other hand, suppose a very trifling tax was
laid, to be collected in pearls, such a tax likewise could not be
paid, because they could not be had. Now any person may see that
these are distinct cases, and the latter of them is a representation
of our own.

That the difficulty cannot proceed from the former, that is, from the
real value or weight of the tax, is evident at the first view to any
person who will consider it.

The amount of the quota of taxes for this State for the year, 1780,
(and so in proportion for every other State,) is twenty millions of
dollars, which at seventy for one, is but sixty-four thousand two
hundred and eighty pounds three shillings sterling, and on an
average, is no more than three shillings and five pence sterling per
head, per annum, per man, woman and child, or threepence two-fifths
per head per month. Now here is a clear, positive fact, that cannot
be contradicted, and which proves that the difficulty cannot be in
the weight of the tax, for in itself it is a trifle, and far from
being adequate to our quota of the expense of the war. The quit-rents
of one penny sterling per acre on only one half of the state, come to
upwards of fifty thousand pounds, which is almost as much as all the
taxes of the present year, and as those quit-rents made no part of
the taxes then paid, and are now discontinued, the quantity of money
drawn for public-service this year, exclusive of the militia fines,
which I shall take notice of in the process of this work, is less
than what was paid and payable in any year preceding the revolution,
and since the last war; what I mean is, that the quit-rents and taxes
taken together came to a larger sum then, than the present taxes
without the quit-rents do now.

My intention by these arguments and calculations is to place the
difficulty to the right cause, and show that it does not proceed from
the weight or worth of the tax, but from the scarcity of the medium
in which it is paid; and to illustrate this point still further, I
shall now show, that if the tax of twenty millions of dollars was of
four times the real value it now is, or nearly so, which would be
about two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, and would be
our full quota, this sum would have been raised with more ease, and
have been less felt, than the present sum of only sixty-four thousand
two hundred and eighty pounds.

The convenience or inconvenience of paying a tax in money arises from
the quantity of money that can be spared out of trade.

When the emissions stopped, the continent was left in possession of
two hundred millions of dollars, perhaps as equally dispersed as it
was possible for trade to do it. And as no more was to be issued, the
rise or fall of prices could neither increase nor diminish the
quantity. It therefore remained the same through all the fluctuations
of trade and exchange.

Now had the exchange stood at twenty for one, which was the rate
Congress calculated upon when they arranged the quota of the several
states, the latter end of last year, trade would have been carried on
for nearly four times less money than it is now, and consequently the
twenty millions would have been spared with much greater ease, and
when collected would have been of almost four times the value that
they now are. And on the other hand, was the depreciation to be
ninety or one hundred for one, the quantity required for trade would
be more than at sixty or seventy for one, and though the value of
them would be less, the difficulty of sparing the money out of trade
would be greater. And on these facts and arguments I rest the matter,
to prove that it is not the want of property, but the scarcity of the
medium by which the proportion of property for taxation is to be
measured out, that makes the embarrassment which we lie under. There
is not money enough, and, what is equally as true, the people will
not let there be money enough.

While I am on the subject of the currency, I shall offer one remark
which will appear true to everybody, and can be accounted for by
nobody, which is, that the better the times were, the worse the money
grew; and the worse the times were, the better the money stood. It
never depreciated by any advantage obtained by the enemy. The
troubles of 1776, and the loss of Philadelphia in 1777, made no
sensible impression on it, and every one knows that the surrender of
Charleston did not produce the least alteration in the rate of
exchange, which, for long before, and for more than three months
after, stood at sixty for one. It seems as if the certainty of its
being our own, made us careless of its value, and that the most
distant thoughts of losing it made us hug it the closer, like
something we were loth to part with; or that we depreciate it for our
pastime, which, when called to seriousness by the enemy, we leave off
to renew again at our leisure. In short, our good luck seems to break
us, and our bad makes us whole.

Passing on from this digression, I shall now endeavor to bring into
one view the several parts which I have already stated, and form
thereon some propositions, and conclude.

I have placed before the reader, the average tax per head, paid by
the people of England; which is forty shillings sterling.

And I have shown the rate on an average per head, which will defray
all the expenses of the war to us, and support the several
governments without running the country into debt, which is thirteen
shillings and four pence.

I have shown what the peace establishment may be conducted for, viz.,
an eighth part of what it would be, if under the government of
Britain.

And I have likewise shown what the average per head of the present
taxes is, namely, three shillings and fivepence sterling, or
threepence two-fifths per month; and that their whole yearly value,
in sterling, is only sixty-four thousand two hundred and eighty
pounds. Whereas our quota, to keep the payments equal with the
expenses, is two hundred and fifty thousand pounds. Consequently,
there is a deficiency of one hundred and eighty-five thousand seven
hundred and twenty pounds, and the same proportion of defect,
according to the several quotas, happens in every other state. And
this defect is the cause why the army has been so indifferently fed,
clothed and paid. It is the cause, likewise, of the nerveless state
of the campaign, and the insecurity of the country. Now, if a tax
equal to thirteen and fourpence per head, will remove all these
difficulties, and make people secure in their homes, leave them to
follow the business of their stores and farms unmolested, and not
only drive out but keep out the enemy from the country; and if the
neglect of raising this sum will let them in, and produce the evils
which might be prevented- on which side, I ask, does the wisdom,
interest and policy lie? Or, rather, would it not be an insult to
reason, to put the question? The sum, when proportioned out according
to the several abilities of the people, can hurt no one, but an
inroad from the enemy ruins hundreds of families.

Look at the destruction done in this city [Philadelphia]. The many
houses totally destroyed, and others damaged; the waste of fences in
the country round it, besides the plunder of furniture, forage, and
provisions. I do not suppose that half a million sterling would
reinstate the sufferers; and, does this, I ask, bear any proportion
to the expense that would make us secure? The damage, on an average,
is at least ten pounds sterling per head, which is as much as
thirteen shillings and fourpence per head comes to for fifteen years.
The same has happened on the frontiers, and in the Jerseys, New York,
and other places where the enemy has been- Carolina and Georgia are
likewise suffering the same fate.

That the people generally do not understand the insufficiency of the
taxes to carry on the war, is evident, not only from common
observation, but from the construction of several petitions which
were presented to the Assembly of this state, against the
recommendation of Congress of the 18th of March last, for taking up
and funding the present currency at forty to one, and issuing new
money in its stead. The prayer of the petition was, that the currency
might be appreciated by taxes (meaning the present taxes) and that
part of the taxes be applied to the support of the army, if the army
could not be otherwise supported. Now it could not have been possible
for such a petition to have been presented, had the petitioners
known, that so far from part of the taxes being sufficient for the
support of the whole of them falls three-fourths short of the year's
expenses.

Before I proceed to propose methods by which a sufficiency of money
may be raised, I shall take a short view of the general state of the
country.

Notwithstanding the weight of the war, the ravages of the enemy, and
the obstructions she has thrown in the way of trade and commerce, so
soon does a young country outgrow misfortune, that America has
already surmounted many that heavily oppressed her. For the first
year or two of the war, we were shut up within our ports, scarce
venturing to look towards the ocean. Now our rivers are beautified
with large and valuable vessels, our stores filled with merchandise,
and the produce of the country has a ready market, and an
advantageous price. Gold and silver, that for a while seemed to have
retreated again within the bowels of the earth, have once more risen
into circulation, and every day adds new strength to trade, commerce
and agriculture. In a pamphlet, written by Sir John Dalrymple, and
dispersed in America in the year 1775, he asserted that two
twenty-gun ships, nay, says he, tenders of those ships, stationed
between Albermarle sound and Chesapeake bay, would shut up the trade
of America for 600 miles. How little did Sir John Dalrymple know of
the abilities of America!

While under the government of Britain, the trade of this country was
loaded with restrictions. It was only a few foreign ports which we
were allowed to sail to. Now it is otherwise; and allowing that the
quantity of trade is but half what it was before the war, the case
must show the vast advantage of an open trade, because the present
quantity under her restrictions could not support itself; from which
I infer, that if half the quantity without the restrictions can bear
itself up nearly, if not quite, as well as the whole when subject to
them, how prosperous must the condition of America be when the whole
shall return open with all the world. By the trade I do not mean the
employment of a merchant only, but the whole interest and business of
the country taken collectively.

It is not so much my intention, by this publication, to propose
particular plans for raising money, as it is to show the necessity
and the advantages to be derived from it. My principal design is to
form the disposition of the people to the measures which I am fully
persuaded it is their interest and duty to adopt, and which need no
other force to accomplish them than the force of being felt. But as
every hint may be useful, I shall throw out a sketch, and leave
others to make such improvements upon it as to them may appear
reasonable.

The annual sum wanted is two millions, and the average rate in which
it falls, is thirteen shillings and fourpence per head.

Suppose, then, that we raise half the sum and sixty thousand pounds
over. The average rate thereof will be seven shillings per head.

In this case we shall have half the supply that we want, and an
annual fund of sixty thousand pounds whereon to borrow the other
million; because sixty thousand pounds is the interest of a million
at six per cent.; and if at the end of another year we should be
obliged, by the continuance of the war, to borrow another million,
the taxes will be increased to seven shillings and sixpence; and thus
for every million borrowed, an additional tax, equal to sixpence per
head, must be levied.

The sum to be raised next year will be one million and sixty thousand
pounds: one half of which I would propose should be raised by duties
on imported goods, and prize goods, and the other half by a tax on
landed property and houses, or such other means as each state may
devise.

But as the duties on imports and prize goods must be the same in all
the states, therefore the rate per cent., or what other form the duty
shall be laid, must be ascertained and regulated by Congress, and
ingrafted in that form into the law of each state; and the monies
arising therefrom carried into the treasury of each state. The duties
to be paid in gold or silver.

There are many reasons why a duty on imports is the most convenient
duty or tax that can be collected; one of which is, because the whole
is payable in a few places in a country, and it likewise operates
with the greatest ease and equality, because as every one pays in
proportion to what he consumes, so people in general consume in
proportion to what they can afford; and therefore the tax is
regulated by the abilities which every man supposes himself to have,
or in other words, every man becomes his own assessor, and pays by a
little at a time, when it suits him to buy. Besides, it is a tax
which people may pay or let alone by not consuming the articles; and
though the alternative may have no influence on their conduct, the
power of choosing is an agreeable thing to the mind. For my own part,
it would be a satisfaction to me was there a duty on all sorts of
liquors during the war, as in my idea of things it would be an
addition to the pleasures of society to know, that when the health of
the army goes round, a few drops, from every glass becomes theirs.
How often have I heard an emphatical wish, almost accompanied by a
tear, "Oh, that our poor fellows in the field had some of this!" Why
then need we suffer under a fruitless sympathy, when there is a way
to enjoy both the wish and the entertainment at once.

But the great national policy of putting a duty upon imports is, that
it either keeps the foreign trade in our own hands, or draws
something for the defence of the country from every foreigner who
participates in it with us.

Thus much for the first half of the taxes, and as each state will
best devise means to raise the other half, I shall confine my remarks
to the resources of this state.

The quota, then, of this state, of one million and sixty thousand
pounds, will be one hundred and thirty-three thousand two hundred and
fifty pounds, the half of which is sixty-six thousand six hundred and
twenty-five pounds; and supposing one fourth part of Pennsylvania
inhabited, then a tax of one bushel of wheat on every twenty acres of
land, one with another, would produce the sum, and all the present
taxes to cease. Whereas, the tithes of the bishops and clergy in
England, exclusive of the taxes, are upwards of half a bushel of
wheat on every single acre of land, good and bad, throughout the
nation.

In the former part of this paper, I mentioned the militia fines, but
reserved speaking of the matter, which I shall now do. The ground I
shall put it upon is, that two millions sterling a year will support
a sufficient army, and all the expenses of war and government,
without having recourse to the inconvenient method of continually
calling men from their employments, which, of all others, is the most
expensive and the least substantial. I consider the revenues created
by taxes as the first and principal thing, and fines only as
secondary and accidental things. It was not the intention of the
militia law to apply the fines to anything else but the support of
the militia, neither do they produce any revenue to the state, yet
these fines amount to more than all the taxes: for taking the
muster-roll to be sixty thousand men, the fine on forty thousand who
may not attend, will be sixty thousand pounds sterling, and those who
muster, will give up a portion of time equal to half that sum, and if
the eight classes should be called within the year, and one third
turn out, the fine on the remaining forty thousand would amount to
seventy-two millions of dollars, besides the fifteen shillings on
every hundred pounds of property, and the charge of seven and a half
per cent. for collecting, in certain instances which, on the whole,
would be upwards of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling.

Now if those very fines disable the country from raising a sufficient
revenue without producing an equivalent advantage, would it not be
for the ease and interest of all parties to increase the revenue, in
the manner I have proposed, or any better, if a better can be
devised, and cease the operation of the fines? I would still keep the
militia as an organized body of men, and should there be a real
necessity to call them forth, pay them out of the proper revenues of
the state, and increase the taxes a third or fourth per cent. on
those who do not attend. My limits will not allow me to go further
into this matter, which I shall therefore close with this remark;
that fines are, of all modes of revenue, the most unsuited to the
minds of a free country. When a man pays a tax, he knows that the
public necessity requires it, and therefore feels a pride in
discharging his duty; but a fine seems an atonement for neglect of
duty, and of consequence is paid with discredit, and frequently
levied with severity.

I have now only one subject more to speak of, with which I shall
conclude, which is, the resolve of Congress of the 18th of March
last, for taking up and funding the present currency at forty for
one, and issuing new money in its stead.

Every one knows that I am not the flatterer of Congress, but in this
instance they are right; and if that measure is supported, the
currency will acquire a value, which, without it, it will not. But
this is not all: it will give relief to the finances until such time
as they can be properly arranged, and save the country from being
immediately doubled taxed under the present mode. In short, support
that measure, and it will support you.

I have now waded through a tedious course of difficult business, and
over an untrodden path. The subject, on every point in which it could
be viewed, was entangled with perplexities, and enveloped in
obscurity, yet such are the resources of America, that she wants
nothing but system to secure success.

                                          COMMON SENSE.

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 4, 1780.

                           THE CRISIS

                                  X.

                   ON THE KING OF ENGLAND'S SPEECH.

OF all the innocent passions which actuate the human mind there is
none more universally prevalent than curiosity. It reaches all
mankind, and in matters which concern us, or concern us not, it alike
provokes in us a desire to know them.

Although the situation of America, superior to every effort to
enslave her, and daily rising to importance and opulence, has placed
her above the region of anxiety, it has still left her within the
circle of curiosity; and her fancy to see the speech of a man who had
proudly threatened to bring her to his feet, was visibly marked with
that tranquil confidence which cared nothing about its contents. It
was inquired after with a smile, read with a laugh, and dismissed
with disdain.

But, as justice is due, even to an enemy, it is right to say, that
the speech is as well managed as the embarrassed condition of their
affairs could well admit of; and though hardly a line of it is true,
except the mournful story of Cornwallis, it may serve to amuse the
deluded commons and people of England, for whom it was calculated.

"The war," says the speech, "is still unhappily prolonged by that
restless ambition which first excited our enemies to commence it, and
which still continues to disappoint my earnest wishes and diligent
exertions to restore the public tranquillity."

How easy it is to abuse truth and language, when men, by habitual
wickedness, have learned to set justice at defiance. That the very
man who began the war, who with the most sullen insolence refused to
answer, and even to hear the humblest of all petitions, who has
encouraged his officers and his army in the most savage cruelties,
and the most scandalous plunderings, who has stirred up the Indians
on one side, and the negroes on the other, and invoked every aid of
hell in his behalf, should now, with an affected air of pity, turn
the tables from himself, and charge to another the wickedness that is
his own, can only be equalled by the baseness of the heart that spoke
it.

To be nobly wrong is more manly than to be meanly right, is an
expression I once used on a former occasion, and it is equally
applicable now. We feel something like respect for consistency even
in error. We lament the virtue that is debauched into a vice, but the
vice that affects a virtue becomes the more detestable: and amongst
the various assumptions of character, which hypocrisy has taught, and
men have practised, there is none that raises a higher relish of
disgust, than to see disappointed inveteracy twisting itself, by the
most visible falsehoods, into an appearance of piety which it has no
pretensions to.

"But I should not," continues the speech, "answer the trust committed
to the sovereign of a free people, nor make a suitable return to my
subjects for their constant, zealous, and affectionate attachment to
my person, family and government, if I consented to sacrifice, either
to my own desire of peace, or to their temporary ease and relief,
those essential rights and permanent interests, upon the maintenance
and preservation of which, the future strength and security of this
country must principally depend."

That the man whose ignorance and obstinacy first involved and still
continues the nation in the most hopeless and expensive of all wars,
should now meanly flatter them with the name of a free people, and
make a merit of his crime, under the disguise of their essential
rights and permanent interests, is something which disgraces even the
character of perverseness. Is he afraid they will send him to
Hanover, or what does he fear? Why is the sycophant thus added to the
hypocrite, and the man who pretends to govern, sunk into the humble
and submissive memorialist?

What those essential rights and permanent interests are, on which the
future strength and security of England must principally depend, are
not so much as alluded to. They are words which impress nothing but
the ear, and are calculated only for the sound.

But if they have any reference to America, then do they amount to the
disgraceful confession, that England, who once assumed to be her
protectress, has now become her dependant. The British king and
ministry are constantly holding up the vast importance which America
is of to England, in order to allure the nation to carry on the war:
now, whatever ground there is for this idea, it ought to have
operated as a reason for not beginning it; and, therefore, they
support their present measures to their own disgrace, because the
arguments which they now use, are a direct reflection on their former
policy.

"The favorable appearance of affairs," continues the speech, "in the
East Indies, and the safe arrival of the numerous commercial fleets
of my kingdom, must have given you satisfaction."

That things are not quite so bad every where as in America may be
some cause of consolation, but can be none for triumph. One broken
leg is better than two, but still it is not a source of joy: and let
the appearance of affairs in the East Indies be ever so favorable,
they are nevertheless worse than at first, without a prospect of
their ever being better. But the mournful story of Cornwallis was yet
to be told, and it was necessary to give it the softest introduction
possible.

"But in the course of this year," continues the speech, "my assiduous
endeavors to guard the extensive dominions of my crown have not been
attended with success equal to the justice and uprightness of my
views."- What justice and uprightness there was in beginning a war
with America, the world will judge of, and the unequalled barbarity
with which it has been conducted, is not to be worn from the memory
by the cant of snivelling hypocrisy.

"And it is with great concern that I inform you that the events of
war have been very unfortunate to my arms in Virginia, having ended
in the loss of my forces in that province."- And our great concern is
that they are not all served in the same manner.

"No endeavors have been wanted on my part," says the speech, "to
extinguish that spirit of rebellion which our enemies have found
means to foment and maintain in the colonies; and to restore to my
deluded subjects in America that happy and prosperous condition which
they formerly derived from a due obedience to the laws."

The expression of deluded subjects is become so hacknied and
contemptible, and the more so when we see them making prisoners of
whole armies at a time, that the pride of not being laughed at would
induce a man of common sense to leave it off. But the most offensive
falsehood in the paragraph is the attributing the prosperity of
America to a wrong cause. It was the unremitted industry of the
settlers and their descendants, the hard labor and toil of
persevering fortitude, that were the true causes of the prosperity of
America. The former tyranny of England served to people it, and the
virtue of the adventurers to improve it. Ask the man, who, with his
axe, has cleared a way in the wilderness, and now possesses an
estate, what made him rich, and he will tell you the labor of his
hands, the sweat of his brow, and the blessing of heaven. Let Britain
but leave America to herself and she asks no more. She has risen into
greatness without the knowledge and against the will of England, and
has a right to the unmolested enjoyment of her own created wealth.

"I will order," says the speech, "the estimates of the ensuing year
to be laid before you. I rely on your wisdom and public spirit for
such supplies as the circumstances of our affairs shall be found to
require. Among the many ill consequences which attend the
continuation of the present war, I most sincerely regret the
additional burdens which it must unavoidably bring upon my faithful
subjects."

It is strange that a nation must run through such a labyrinth of
trouble, and expend such a mass of wealth to gain the wisdom which an
hour's reflection might have taught. The final superiority of America
over every attempt that an island might make to conquer her, was as
naturally marked in the constitution of things, as the future ability
of a giant over a dwarf is delineated in his features while an
infant. How far providence, to accomplish purposes which no human
wisdom could foresee, permitted such extraordinary errors, is still a
secret in the womb of time, and must remain so till futurity shall
give it birth.

"In the prosecution of this great and important contest," says the
speech, "in which we are engaged, I retain a firm confidence in the
protection of divine providence, and a perfect conviction in the
justice of my cause, and I have no doubt, but, that by the
concurrence and support of my Parliament, by the valour of my fleets
and armies, and by a vigorous, animated, and united exertion of the
faculties and resources of my people, I shall be enabled to restore
the blessings of a safe and honorable peace to all my dominions."

The King of England is one of the readiest believers in the world. In
the beginning of the contest he passed an act to put America out of
the protection of the crown of England, and though providence, for
seven years together, has put him out of her protection, still the
man has no doubt. Like Pharaoh on the edge of the Red Sea, he sees
not the plunge he is making, and precipitately drives across the
flood that is closing over his head.

I think it is a reasonable supposition, that this part of the speech
was composed before the arrival of the news of the capture of
Cornwallis: for it certainly has no relation to their condition at
the time it was spoken. But, be this as it may, it is nothing to us.
Our line is fixed. Our lot is cast; and America, the child of fate,
is arriving at maturity. We have nothing to do but by a spirited and
quick exertion, to stand prepared for war or peace. Too great to
yield, and too noble to insult; superior to misfortune, and generous
in success, let us untaintedly preserve the character which we have
gained, and show to future ages an example of unequalled magnanimity.
There is something in the cause and consequence of America that has
drawn on her the attention of all mankind. The world has seen her
brave. Her love of liberty; her ardour in supporting it; the justice
of her claims, and the constancy of her fortitude have won her the
esteem of Europe, and attached to her interest the first power in
that country.

Her situation now is such, that to whatever point, past, present or
to come, she casts her eyes, new matter rises to convince her that
she is right. In her conduct towards her enemy, no reproachful
sentiment lurks in secret. No sense of injustice is left upon the
mind. Untainted with ambition, and a stranger to revenge, her
progress has been marked by providence, and she, in every stage of
the conflict, has blest her with success.

But let not America wrap herself up in delusive hope and suppose the
business done. The least remissness in preparation, the least
relaxation in execution, will only serve to prolong the war, and
increase expenses. If our enemies can draw consolation from
misfortune, and exert themselves upon despair, how much more ought
we, who are to win a continent by the conquest, and have already an
earnest of success?

Having, in the preceding part, made my remarks on the several matters
which the speech contains, I shall now make my remarks on what it
does not contain.

There is not a syllable in its respecting alliances. Either the
injustice of Britain is too glaring, or her condition too desperate,
or both, for any neighboring power to come to her support. In the
beginning of the contest, when she had only America to contend with,
she hired assistance from Hesse, and other smaller states of Germany,
and for nearly three years did America, young, raw, undisciplined and
unprovided, stand against the power of Britain, aided by twenty
thousand foreign troops, and made a complete conquest of one entire
army. The remembrance of those things ought to inspire us with
confidence and greatness of mind, and carry us through every
remaining difficulty with content and cheerfulness. What are the
little sufferings of the present day, compared with the hardships
that are past? There was a time, when we had neither house nor home
in safety; when every hour was the hour of alarm and danger; when the
mind, tortured with anxiety, knew no repose, and every thing, but
hope and fortitude, was bidding us farewell.

It is of use to look back upon these things; to call to mind the
times of trouble and the scenes of complicated anguish that are past
and gone. Then every expense was cheap, compared with the dread of
conquest and the misery of submission. We did not stand debating upon
trifles, or contending about the necessary and unavoidable charges of
defence. Every one bore his lot of suffering, and looked forward to
happier days, and scenes of rest.

Perhaps one of the greatest dangers which any country can be exposed
to, arises from a kind of trifling which sometimes steals upon the
mind, when it supposes the danger past; and this unsafe situation
marks at this time the peculiar crisis of America. What would she
once have given to have known that her condition at this day should
be what it now is? And yet we do not seem to place a proper value
upon it, nor vigorously pursue the necessary measures to secure it.
We know that we cannot be defended, nor yet defend ourselves, without
trouble and expense. We have no right to expect it; neither ought we
to look for it. We are a people, who, in our situation, differ from
all the world. We form one common floor of public good, and, whatever
is our charge, it is paid for our own interest and upon our own
account.

Misfortune and experience have now taught us system and method; and
the arrangements for carrying on the war are reduced to rule and
order. The quotas of the several states are ascertained, and I intend
in a future publication to show what they are, and the necessity as
well as the advantages of vigorously providing for them.

In the mean time, I shall conclude this paper with an instance of
British clemency, from Smollett's History of England, vol. xi.,
printed in London. It will serve to show how dismal the situation of
a conquered people is, and that the only security is an effectual
defence.

We all know that the Stuart family and the house of Hanover opposed
each other for the crown of England. The Stuart family stood first in
the line of succession, but the other was the most successful.

In July, 1745, Charles, the son of the exiled king, landed in
Scotland, collected a small force, at no time exceeding five or six
thousand men, and made some attempts to re-establish his claim. The
late Duke of Cumberland, uncle to the present King of England, was
sent against him, and on the 16th of April following, Charles was
totally defeated at Culloden, in Scotland. Success and power are the
only situations in which clemency can be shown, and those who are
cruel, because they are victorious, can with the same facility act
any other degenerate character.

"Immediately after the decisive action at Culloden, the Duke of
Cumberland took possession of Inverness; where six and thirty
deserters, convicted by a court martial, were ordered to be executed:
then he detached several parties to ravage the country. One of these
apprehended The Lady Mackintosh, who was sent prisoner to Inverness,
plundered her house, and drove away her cattle, though her husband
was actually in the service of the government. The castle of Lord
Lovat was destroyed. The French prisoners were sent to Carlisle and
Penrith: Kilmarnock, Balmerino, Cromartie, and his son, The Lord
Macleod, were conveyed by sea to London; and those of an inferior
rank were confined in different prisons. The Marquis of Tullibardine,
together with a brother of the Earl of Dunmore, and Murray, the
pretender's secretary, were seized and transported to the Tower of
London, to which the Earl of Traquaire had been committed on
suspicion; and the eldest son of Lord Lovat was imprisoned in the
castle of Edinburgh. In a word, all the jails in Great Britain, from
the capital, northwards, were filled with those unfortunate captives;
and great numbers of them were crowded together in the holds of
ships, where they perished in the most deplorable manner, for want of
air and exercise. Some rebel chiefs escaped in two French frigates
that arrived on the coast of Lochaber about the end of April, and
engaged three vessels belonging to his Britannic majesty, which they
obliged to retire. Others embarked on board a ship on the coast of
Buchan, and were conveyed to Norway, from whence they travelled to
Sweden. In the month of May, the Duke of Cumberland advanced with the
army into the Highlands, as far as Fort Augustus, where he encamped;
and sent off detachments on all hands, to hunt down the fugitives,
and lay waste the country with fire and sword. The castles of
Glengary and Lochiel were plundered and burned; every house, hut, or
habitation, met with the same fate, without distinction; and all the
cattle and provision were carried off; the men were either shot upon
the mountains, like wild beasts, or put to death in cold blood,
without form of trial; the women, after having seen their husbands
and fathers murdered, were subjected to brutal violation, and then
turned out naked, with their children, to starve on the barren
heaths. One whole family was enclosed in a barn, and consumed to
ashes. Those ministers of vengeance were so alert in the execution of
their office, that in a few days there was neither house, cottage,
man, nor beast, to be seen within the compass of fifty miles; all was
ruin, silence, and desolation."

I have here presented the reader with one of the most shocking
instances of cruelty ever practised, and I leave it, to rest on his
mind, that he may be fully impressed with a sense of the destruction
he has escaped, in case Britain had conquered America; and likewise,
that he may see and feel the necessity, as well for his own personal
safety, as for the honor, the interest, and happiness of the whole
community, to omit or delay no one preparation necessary to secure
the ground which we so happily stand upon.

                       TO THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA

          On the expenses, arrangements and disbursements for
           carrying on the war, and finishing it with honor
                            and advantage

WHEN any necessity or occasion has pointed out the convenience of
addressing the public, I have never made it a consideration whether
the subject was popular or unpopular, but whether it was right or
wrong; for that which is right will become popular, and that which is
wrong, though by mistake it may obtain the cry or fashion of the day,
will soon lose the power of delusion, and sink into disesteem.

A remarkable instance of this happened in the case of Silas Deane;
and I mention this circumstance with the greater ease, because the
poison of his hypocrisy spread over the whole country, and every man,
almost without exception, thought me wrong in opposing him. The best
friends I then had, except Mr. [Henry] Laurens, stood at a distance,
and this tribute, which is due to his constancy, I pay to him with
respect, and that the readier, because he is not here to hear it. If
it reaches him in his imprisonment, it will afford him an agreeable
reflection.

"As he rose like a rocket, he would fall like a stick," is a metaphor
which I applied to Mr. Deane, in the first piece which I published
respecting him, and he has exactly fulfilled the description. The
credit he so unjustly obtained from the public, he lost in almost as
short a time. The delusion perished as it fell, and he soon saw
himself stripped of popular support. His more intimate acquaintances
began to doubt, and to desert him long before he left America, and at
his departure, he saw himself the object of general suspicion. When
he arrived in France, he endeavored to effect by treason what he had
failed to accomplish by fraud. His plans, schemes and projects,
together with his expectation of being sent to Holland to negotiate a
loan of money, had all miscarried. He then began traducing and
accusing America of every crime, which could injure her reputation.
"That she was a ruined country; that she only meant to make a tool of
France, to get what money she could out of her, and then to leave her
and accommodate with Britain." Of all which and much more, Colonel
Laurens and myself, when in France, informed Dr. Franklin, who had
not before heard of it. And to complete the character of traitor, he
has, by letters to his country since, some of which, in his own
handwriting, are now in the possession of Congress, used every
expression and argument in his power, to injure the reputation of
France, and to advise America to renounce her alliance, and surrender
up her independence.* Thus in France he abuses America, and in his
letters to America he abuses France; and is endeavoring to create
disunion between two countries, by the same arts of double-dealing by
which he caused dissensions among the commissioners in Paris, and
distractions in America. But his life has been fraud, and his
character has been that of a plodding, plotting, cringing mercenary,
capable of any disguise that suited his purpose. His final detection
has very happily cleared up those mistakes, and removed that
uneasiness, which his unprincipled conduct occasioned. Every one now
sees him in the same light; for towards friends or enemies he acted
with the same deception and injustice, and his name, like that of
Arnold, ought now to be forgotten among us. As this is the first time
that I have mentioned him since my return from France, it is my
intention that it shall be the last. From this digression, which for
several reasons I thought necessary to give, I now proceed to the
purport of my address.

* Mr. William Marshall, of this city [Philadelphia], formerly a
pilot, who had been taken at sea and carried to England, and got from
thence to France, brought over letters from Mr. Deane to America, one
of which was directed to "Robert Morris, Esq." Mr. Morris sent it
unopened to Congress, and advised Mr. Marshall to deliver the others
there, which he did. The letters were of the same purport with those
which have been already published under the signature of S. Deane, to
which they had frequent reference.

I consider the war of America against Britain as the country's war,
the public's war, or the war of the people in their own behalf, for
the security of their natural rights, and the protection of their own
property. It is not the war of Congress, the war of the assemblies,
or the war of government in any line whatever. The country first, by
mutual compact, resolved to defend their rights and maintain their
independence, at the hazard of their lives and fortunes; they elected
their representatives, by whom they appointed their members of
Congress, and said, act you for us, and we will support you. This is
the true ground and principle of the war on the part of America, and,
consequently, there remains nothing to do, but for every one to
fulfil his obligation.

It was next to impossible that a new country, engaged in a new
undertaking, could set off systematically right at first. She saw not
the extent of the struggle that she was involved in, neither could
she avoid the beginning. She supposed every step that she took, and
every resolution which she formed, would bring her enemy to reason
and close the contest. Those failing, she was forced into new
measures; and these, like the former, being fitted to her
expectations, and failing in their turn, left her continually
unprovided, and without system. The enemy, likewise, was induced to
prosecute the war, from the temporary expedients we adopted for
carrying it on. We were continually expecting to see their credit
exhausted, and they were looking to see our currency fail; and thus,
between their watching us, and we them, the hopes of both have been
deceived, and the childishness of the expectation has served to
increase the expense.

Yet who, through this wilderness of error, has been to blame? Where
is the man who can say the fault, in part, has not been his? They
were the natural, unavoidable errors of the day. They were the errors
of a whole country, which nothing but experience could detect and
time remove. Neither could the circumstances of America admit of
system, till either the paper currency was fixed or laid aside. No
calculation of a finance could be made on a medium failing without
reason, and fluctuating without rule.

But there is one error which might have been prevented and was not;
and as it is not my custom to flatter, but to serve mankind, I will
speak it freely. It certainly was the duty of every assembly on the
continent to have known, at all times, what was the condition of its
treasury, and to have ascertained at every period of depreciation,
how much the real worth of the taxes fell short of their nominal
value. This knowledge, which might have been easily gained, in the
time of it, would have enabled them to have kept their constituents
well informed, and this is one of the greatest duties of
representation. They ought to have studied and calculated the
expenses of the war, the quota of each state, and the consequent
proportion that would fall on each man's property for his defence;
and this must have easily shown to them, that a tax of one hundred
pounds could not be paid by a bushel of apples or an hundred of
flour, which was often the case two or three years ago. But instead
of this, which would have been plain and upright dealing, the little
line of temporary popularity, the feather of an hour's duration, was
too much pursued; and in this involved condition of things, every
state, for the want of a little thinking, or a little information,
supposed that it supported the whole expenses of the war, when in
fact it fell, by the time the tax was levied and collected, above
three-fourths short of its own quota.

Impressed with a sense of the danger to which the country was exposed
by this lax method of doing business, and the prevailing errors of
the day, I published, last October was a twelvemonth, the Crisis
Extraordinary, on the revenues of America, and the yearly expense of
carrying on the war. My estimation of the latter, together with the
civil list of Congress, and the civil list of the several states, was
two million pounds sterling, which is very nearly nine millions of
dollars.

Since that time, Congress have gone into a calculation, and have
estimated the expenses of the War Department and the civil list of
Congress (exclusive of the civil list of the several governments) at
eight millions of dollars; and as the remaining million will be fully
sufficient for the civil list of the several states, the two
calculations are exceedingly near each other.

The sum of eight millions of dollars have called upon the states to
furnish, and their quotas are as follows, which I shall preface with
the resolution itself.



             "By the United States in Congress assembled.

                          "October 30, 1781.

"Resolved, That the respective states be called upon to furnish the
treasury of the United States with their quotas of eight millions of
dollars, for the War Department and civil list for the ensuing year,
to be paid quarterly, in equal proportions, the first payment to be
made on the first day of April next.
"Resolved, That a committee, consisting of a member from each state,
be appointed to apportion to the several states the quota of the
above sum.
"November 2d. The committee appointed to ascertain the proportions of
the several states of the monies to be raised for the expenses of the
ensuing year, report the following resolutions:
"That the sum of eight millions of dollars, as required to be raised
by the resolutions of the 30th of October last, be paid by the states
in the following proportion:

               New Hampshire....... $ 373,598
               Massachusetts.......  1,307,596
               Rhode Island........    216,684
               Connecticut.........    747,196
               New York............    373,598
               New Jersey..........    485,679
               Pennsylvania........  1,120,794
               Delaware............    112,085
               Maryland............    933,996
               Virginia............  1,307,594
               North Carolina......    622,677
               South Carolina......    373,598
               Georgia.............     24,905

                                    $8,000,000
"Resolved, That it be recommended to the several states, to lay taxes
for raising their quotas of money for the United States, separate
from those laid for their own particular use."



On these resolutions I shall offer several remarks.

1st, On the sum itself, and the ability of the country.
2d, On the several quotas, and the nature of a union. And,
3d, On the manner of collection and expenditure.

1st, On the sum itself, and the ability of the country. As I know my
own calculation is as low as possible, and as the sum called for by
congress, according to their calculation, agrees very nearly
therewith, I am sensible it cannot possibly be lower. Neither can it
be done for that, unless there is ready money to go to market with;
and even in that case, it is only by the utmost management and
economy that it can be made to do.

By the accounts which were laid before the British Parliament last
spring, it appeared that the charge of only subsisting, that is,
feeding their army in America, cost annually four million pounds
sterling, which is very nearly eighteen millions of dollars. Now if,
for eight millions, we can feed, clothe, arm, provide for, and pay an
army sufficient for our defence, the very comparison shows that the
money must be well laid out.

It may be of some use, either in debate or conversation, to attend to
the progress of the expenses of an army, because it will enable us to
see on what part any deficiency will fall.

The first thing is, to feed them and prepare for the sick.
_Second_, to clothe them.
_Third_, to arm and furnish them.
_Fourth_, to provide means for removing them from place to place. And,
_Fifth_, to pay them.

The first and second are absolutely necessary to them as men. The
third and fourth are equally as necessary to them as an army. And the
fifth is their just due. Now if the sum which shall be raised should
fall short, either by the several acts of the states for raising it,
or by the manner of collecting it, the deficiency will fall on the
fifth head, the soldiers' pay, which would be defrauding them, and
eternally disgracing ourselves. It would be a blot on the councils,
the country, and the revolution of America, and a man would hereafter
be ashamed to own that he had any hand in it.

But if the deficiency should be still shorter, it would next fall on
the fourth head, the means of removing the army from place to place;
and, in this case, the army must either stand still where it can be
of no use, or seize on horses, carts, wagons, or any means of
transportation which it can lay hold of; and in this instance the
country suffers. In short, every attempt to do a thing for less than
it can he done for, is sure to become at last both a loss and a
dishonor.

But the country cannot bear it, say some. This has been the most
expensive doctrine that ever was held out, and cost America millions
of money for nothing. Can the country bear to be overrun, ravaged,
and ruined by an enemy? This will immediately follow where defence is
wanting, and defence will ever be wanting, where sufficient revenues
are not provided. But this is only one part of the folly. The second
is, that when the danger comes, invited in part by our not preparing
against it, we have been obliged, in a number of instances, to expend
double the sums to do that which at first might have been done for
half the money. But this is not all. A third mischief has been, that
grain of all sorts, flour, beef fodder, horses, carts, wagons, or
whatever was absolutely or immediately wanted, have been taken
without pay. Now, I ask, why was all this done, but from that
extremely weak and expensive doctrine, that the country could not
bear it? That is, that she could not bear, in the first instance,
that which would have saved her twice as much at last; or, in
proverbial language, that she could not bear to pay a penny to save a
pound; the consequence of which has been, that she has paid a pound
for a penny. Why are there so many unpaid certificates in almost
every man's hands, but from the parsimony of not providing sufficient
revenues? Besides, the doctrine contradicts itself; because, if the
whole country cannot bear it, how is it possible that a part should?
And yet this has been the case: for those things have been had; and
they must be had; but the misfortune is, that they have been obtained
in a very unequal manner, and upon expensive credit, whereas, with
ready money, they might have been purchased for half the price, and
nobody distressed.

But there is another thought which ought to strike us, which is, how
is the army to bear the want of food, clothing and other necessaries?
The man who is at home, can turn himself a thousand ways, and find as
many means of ease, convenience or relief: but a soldier's life
admits of none of those: their wants cannot be supplied from
themselves: for an army, though it is the defence of a state, is at
the same time the child of a country, or must be provided for in
every thing.

And lastly, the doctrine is false. There are not three millions of
people in any part of the universe, who live so well, or have such a
fund of ability, as in America. The income of a common laborer, who
is industrious, is equal to that of the generality of tradesmen in
England. In the mercantile line, I have not heard of one who could be
said to be a bankrupt since the war began, and in England they have
been without number. In America almost every farmer lives on his own
lands, and in England not one in a hundred does. In short, it seems
as if the poverty of that country had made them furious, and they
were determined to risk all to recover all.

Yet, notwithstanding those advantages on the part of America, true it
is, that had it not been for the operation of taxes for our necessary
defence, we had sunk into a state of sloth and poverty: for there was
more wealth lost by neglecting to till the earth in the years 1776,
'77, and '78, than the quota of taxes amounts to. That which is lost
by neglect of this kind, is lost for ever: whereas that which is
paid, and continues in the country, returns to us again; and at the
same time that it provides us with defence, it operates not only as a
spur, but as a premium to our industry.

I shall now proceed to the second head, viz., on the several quotas,
and the nature of a union.

There was a time when America had no other bond of union, than that
of common interest and affection. The whole country flew to the
relief of Boston, and, making her cause, their own, participated in
her cares and administered to her wants. The fate of war, since that
day, has carried the calamity in a ten-fold proportion to the
southward; but in the mean time the union has been strengthened by a
legal compact of the states, jointly and severally ratified, and that
which before was choice, or the duty of affection, is now likewise
the duty of legal obligation.

The union of America is the foundation-stone of her independence; the
rock on which it is built; and is something so sacred in her
constitution, that we ought to watch every word we speak, and every
thought we think, that we injure it not, even by mistake. When a
multitude, extended, or rather scattered, over a continent in the
manner we were, mutually agree to form one common centre whereon the
whole shall move to accomplish a particular purpose, all parts must
act together and alike, or act not at all, and a stoppage in any one
is a stoppage of the whole, at least for a time.

Thus the several states have sent representatives to assemble
together in Congress, and they have empowered that body, which thus
becomes their centre, and are no other than themselves in
representation, to conduct and manage the war, while their
constituents at home attend to the domestic cares of the country,
their internal legislation, their farms, professions or employments,
for it is only by reducing complicated things to method and orderly
connection that they can be understood with advantage, or pursued
with success. Congress, by virtue of this delegation, estimates the
expense, and apportions it out to the several parts of the empire
according to their several abilities; and here the debate must end,
because each state has already had its voice, and the matter has
undergone its whole portion of argument, and can no more be altered
by any particular state, than a law of any state, after it has
passed, can be altered by any individual. For with respect to those
things which immediately concern the union, and for which the union
was purposely established, and is intended to secure, each state is
to the United States what each individual is to the state he lives
in. And it is on this grand point, this movement upon one centre,
that our existence as a nation, our happiness as a people, and our
safety as individuals, depend.

It may happen that some state or other may be somewhat over or under
rated, but this cannot be much. The experience which has been had
upon the matter, has nearly ascertained their several abilities. But
even in this case, it can only admit of an appeal to the United
States, but cannot authorise any state to make the alteration itself,
any more than our internal government can admit an individual to do
so in the case of an act of assembly; for if one state can do it,
then may another do the same, and the instant this is done the whole
is undone.

Neither is it supposable that any single state can be a judge of all
the comparative reasons which may influence the collective body in
arranging the quotas of the continent. The circumstances of the
several states are frequently varying, occasioned by the accidents of
war and commerce, and it will often fall upon some to help others,
rather beyond what their exact proportion at another time might be;
but even this assistance is as naturally and politically included in
the idea of a union as that of any particular assigned proportion;
because we know not whose turn it may be next to want assistance, for
which reason that state is the wisest which sets the best example.

Though in matters of bounden duty and reciprocal affection, it is
rather a degeneracy from the honesty and ardor of the heart to admit
any thing selfish to partake in the government of our conduct, yet in
cases where our duty, our affections, and our interest all coincide,
it may be of some use to observe their union. The United States will
become heir to an extensive quantity of vacant land, and their
several titles to shares and quotas thereof, will naturally be
adjusted according to their relative quotas, during the war,
exclusive of that inability which may unfortunately arise to any
state by the enemy's holding possession of a part; but as this is a
cold matter of interest, I pass it by, and proceed to my third head,
viz., on the manner of collection and expenditure.

It has been our error, as well as our misfortune, to blend the
affairs of each state, especially in money matters, with those of the
United States; whereas it is our case, convenience and interest, to
keep them separate. The expenses of the United States for carrying on
the war, and the expenses of each state for its own domestic
government, are distinct things, and to involve them is a source of
perplexity and a cloak for fraud. I love method, because I see and am
convinced of its beauty and advantage. It is that which makes all
business easy and understood, and without which, everything becomes
embarrassed and difficult.

There are certain powers which the people of each state have
delegated to their legislative and executive bodies, and there are
other powers which the people of every state have delegated to
Congress, among which is that of conducting the war, and,
consequently, of managing the expenses attending it; for how else can
that be managed, which concerns every state, but by a delegation from
each? When a state has furnished its quota, it has an undoubted right
to know how it has been applied, and it is as much the duty of
Congress to inform the state of the one, as it is the duty of the
state to provide the other.

In the resolution of Congress already recited, it is recommended to
the several states to lay taxes for raising their quotas of money for
the United States, separate from those laid for their own particular
use.

This is a most necessary point to be observed, and the distinction
should follow all the way through. They should be levied, paid and
collected, separately, and kept separate in every instance. Neither
have the civil officers of any state, nor the government of that
state, the least right to touch that money which the people pay for
the support of their army and the war, any more than Congress has to
touch that which each state raises for its own use.

This distinction will naturally be followed by another. It will
occasion every state to examine nicely into the expenses of its civil
list, and to regulate, reduce, and bring it into better order than it
has hitherto been; because the money for that purpose must be raised
apart, and accounted for to the public separately. But while the,
monies of both were blended, the necessary nicety was not observed,
and the poor soldier, who ought to have been the first, was the last
who was thought of.

Another convenience will be, that the people, by paying the taxes
separately, will know what they are for; and will likewise know that
those which are for the defence of the country will cease with the
war, or soon after. For although, as I have before observed, the war
is their own, and for the support of their own rights and the
protection of their own property, yet they have the same right to
know, that they have to pay, and it is the want of not knowing that
is often the cause of dissatisfaction.

This regulation of keeping the taxes separate has given rise to a
regulation in the office of finance, by which it is directed:

"That the receivers shall, at the end of every month, make out an
exact account of the monies received by them respectively, during
such month, specifying therein the names of the persons from whom the
same shall have been received, the dates and the sums; which account
they shall respectively cause to be published in one of the
newspapers of the state; to the end that every citizen may know how
much of the monies collected from him, in taxes, is transmitted to
the treasury of the United States for the support of the war; and
also, that it may be known what monies have been at the order of the
superintendent of finance. It being proper and necessary, that, in a
free country, the people should be as fully informed of the
administration of their affairs as the nature of things will admit."

It is an agreeable thing to see a spirit of order and economy taking
place, after such a series of errors and difficulties. A government
or an administration, who means and acts honestly, has nothing to
fear, and consequently has nothing to conceal; and it would be of use
if a monthly or quarterly account was to be published, as well of the
expenditures as of the receipts. Eight millions of dollars must be
husbanded with an exceeding deal of care to make it do, and,
therefore, as the management must be reputable, the publication would
be serviceable.

I have heard of petitions which have been presented to the assembly
of this state (and probably the same may have happened in other
states) praying to have the taxes lowered. Now the only way to keep
taxes low is, for the United States to have ready money to go to
market with: and though the taxes to be raised for the present year
will fall heavy, and there will naturally be some difficulty in
paying them, yet the difficulty, in proportion as money spreads about
the country, will every day grow less, and in the end we shall save
some millions of dollars by it. We see what a bitter, revengeful
enemy we have to deal with, and any expense is cheap compared to
their merciless paw. We have seen the unfortunate Carolineans hunted
like partridges on the mountains, and it is only by providing means
for our defence, that we shall be kept from the same condition. When
we think or talk about taxes, we ought to recollect that we lie down
in peace and sleep in safety; that we can follow our farms or stores
or other occupations, in prosperous tranquillity; and that these
inestimable blessings are procured to us by the taxes that we pay. In
this view, our taxes are properly our insurance money; they are what
we pay to be made safe, and, in strict policy, are the best money we
can lay out.

It was my intention to offer some remarks on the impost law of five
per cent. recommended by Congress, and to be established as a fund
for the payment of the loan-office certificates, and other debts of
the United States; but I have already extended my piece beyond my
intention. And as this fund will make our system of finance complete,
and is strictly just, and consequently requires nothing but honesty
to do it, there needs but little to be said upon it.

                                              COMMON SENSE.

PHILADELPHIA, March 5, 1782.

                           THE CRISIS.

                                  XI.

                    ON THE PRESENT STATE OF NEWS.

SINCE the arrival of two, if not three packets in quick succession,
at New York, from England, a variety of unconnected news has
circulated through the country, and afforded as great a variety of
speculation.

That something is the matter in the cabinet and councils of our
enemies, on the other side of the water, is certain- that they have
run their length of madness, and are under the necessity of changing
their measures may easily be seen into; but to what this change of
measures may amount, or how far it may correspond with our interest,
happiness and duty, is yet uncertain; and from what we have hitherto
experienced, we have too much reason to suspect them in every thing.
I do not address this publication so much to the people of America as
to the British ministry, whoever they may be, for if it is their
intention to promote any kind of negotiation, it is proper they
should know beforehand, that the United States have as much honor as
bravery; and that they are no more to be seduced from their alliance
than their allegiance; that their line of politics is formed and not
dependent, like that of their enemy, on chance and accident.
On our part, in order to know, at any time, what the British
government will do, we have only to find out what they ought not to
do, and this last will be their conduct. Forever changing and forever
wrong; too distant from America to improve in circumstances, and too
unwise to foresee them; scheming without principle, and executing
without probability, their whole line of management has hitherto been
blunder and baseness. Every campaign has added to their loss, and
every year to their disgrace; till unable to go on, and ashamed to go
back, their politics have come to a halt, and all their fine
prospects to a halter.

Could our affections forgive, or humanity forget the wounds of an
injured country- we might, under the influence of a momentary
oblivion, stand still and laugh. But they are engraven where no
amusement can conceal them, and of a kind for which there is no
recompense. Can ye restore to us the beloved dead? Can ye say to the
grave, give up the murdered? Can ye obliterate from our memories
those who are no more? Think not then to tamper with our feelings by
an insidious contrivance, nor suffocate our humanity by seducing us
to dishonor.

In March 1780, I published part of the Crisis, No. VIII., in the
newspapers, but did not conclude it in the following papers, and the
remainder has lain by me till the present day.
There appeared about that time some disposition in the British
cabinet to cease the further prosecution of the war, and as I had
formed my opinion that whenever such a design should take place, it
would be accompanied by a dishonorable proposition to America,
respecting France, I had suppressed the remainder of that number, not
to expose the baseness of any such proposition. But the arrival of
the next news from England, declared her determination to go on with
the war, and consequently as the political object I had then in view
was not become a subject, it was unnecessary in me to bring it
forward, which is the reason it was never published.
The matter which I allude to in the unpublished part, I shall now
make a quotation of, and apply it as the more enlarged state of
things, at this day, shall make convenient or necessary. It was as
follows:

"By the speeches which have appeared from the British Parliament, it
is easy to perceive to what impolitic and imprudent excesses their
passions and prejudices have, in every instance, carried them during
the present war. Provoked at the upright and honorable treaty between
America and France, they imagined that nothing more was necessary to
be done to prevent its final ratification, than to promise, through
the agency of their commissioners (Carlisle, Eden, and Johnstone) a
repeal of their once offensive acts of Parliament. The vanity of the
conceit, was as unpardonable as the experiment was impolitic. And so
convinced am I of their wrong ideas of America, that I shall not
wonder, if, in their last stage of political frenzy, they propose to
her to break her alliance with France, and enter into one with them.
Such a proposition, should it ever be made, and it has been already
more than once hinted at in Parliament, would discover such a
disposition to perfidiousness, and such disregard of honor and
morals, as would add the finishing vice to national corruption.- I do
not mention this to put America on the watch, but to put England on
her guard, that she do not, in the looseness of her heart, envelop in
disgrace every fragment of reputation."- Thus far the quotation.

By the complection of some part of the news which has transpired
through the New York papers, it seems probable that this insidious
era in the British politics is beginning to make its appearance. I
wish it may not; for that which is a disgrace to human nature, throws
something of a shade over all the human character, and each
individual feels his share of the wound that is given to the whole.
The policy of Britain has ever been to divide America in some way or
other. In the beginning of the dispute, she practised every art to
prevent or destroy the union of the states, well knowing that could
she once get them to stand singly, she could conquer them
unconditionally. Failing in this project in America, she renewed it
in Europe; and, after the alliance had taken place, she made secret
offers to France to induce her to give up America; and what is still
more extraordinary, she at the same time made propositions to Dr.
Franklin, then in Paris, the very court to which she was secretly
applying, to draw off America from France. But this is not all.
On the 14th of September, 1778, the British court, through their
secretary, Lord Weymouth, made application to the Marquis
d'Almadovar, the Spanish ambassador at London, to "ask the
mediation," for these were the words, of the court of Spain, for the
purpose of negotiating a peace with France, leaving America (as I
shall hereafter show) out of the question. Spain readily offered her
mediation, and likewise the city of Madrid as the place of
conference, but withal, proposed, that the United States of America
should be invited to the treaty, and considered as independent during
the time the business was negotiating. But this was not the view of
England. She wanted to draw France from the war, that she might
uninterruptedly pour out all her force and fury upon America; and
being disappointed in this plan, as well through the open and
generous conduct of Spain, as the determination of France, she
refused the mediation which she had solicited.
I shall now give some extracts from the justifying memorial of the
Spanish court, in which she has set the conduct and character of
Britain, with respect to America, in a clear and striking point of
light.

The memorial, speaking of the refusal of the British court to meet in
conference with commissioners from the United States, who were to be
considered as independent during the time of the conference, says,

"It is a thing very extraordinary and even ridiculous, that the court
of London, who treats the colonies as independent, not only in
acting, but of right, during the war, should have a repugnance to
treat them as such only in acting during a truce, or suspension of
hostilities. The convention of Saratoga; the reputing General
Burgoyne as a lawful prisoner, in order to suspend his trial; the
exchange and liberation of other prisoners made from the colonies;
the having named commissioners to go and supplicate the Americans, at
their own doors, request peace of them, and treat with them and the
Congress: and, finally, by a thousand other acts of this sort,
authorized by the court of London, which have been, and are true
signs of the acknowledgment of their independence.

"In aggravation of all the foregoing, at the same time the British
cabinet answered the King of Spain in the terms already mentioned,
they were insinuating themselves at the court of France by means of
secret emissaries, and making very great offers to her, to abandon
the colonies and make peace with England. But there is yet more; for
at this same time the English ministry were treating, by means of
another certain emissary, with Dr. Franklin, minister plenipotentiary
from the colonies, residing at Paris, to whom they made various
proposals to disunite them from France, and accommodate matters with
England.

"From what has been observed, it evidently follows, that the whole of
the British politics was, to disunite the two courts of Paris and
Madrid, by means of the suggestions and offers which she separately
made to them; and also to separate the colonies from their treaties
and engagements entered into with France, and induce them to arm
against the house of Bourbon, or more probably to oppress them when
they found, from breaking their engagements, that they stood alone
and without protection.

"This, therefore, is the net they laid for the American states; that
is to say, to tempt them with flattering and very magnificent
promises to come to an accommodation with them, exclusive of any
intervention of Spain or France, that the British ministry might
always remain the arbiters of the fate of the colonies.
"But the Catholic king (the King of Spain) faithful on the one part
of the engagements which bind him to the Most Christian king (the
King of France) his nephew; just and upright on the other, to his own
subjects, whom he ought to protect and guard against so many insults;
and finally, full of humanity and compassion for the Americans and
other individuals who suffer in the present war; he is determined to
pursue and prosecute it, and to make all the efforts in his power,
until he can obtain a solid and permanent peace, with full and
satisfactory securities that it shall be observed."

Thus far the memorial; a translation of which into English, may be
seen in full, under the head of State Papers, in the Annual Register,
for 1779.

The extracts I have here given, serve to show the various endeavors
and contrivances of the enemy, to draw France from her connection
with America, and to prevail on her to make a separate peace with
England, leaving America totally out of the question, and at the
mercy of a merciless, unprincipled enemy. The opinion, likewise,
which Spain has formed of the British cabinet's character for
meanness and perfidiousness, is so exactly the opinion of America
respecting it, that the memorial, in this instance, contains our own
statements and language; for people, however remote, who think alike,
will unavoidably speak alike.

Thus we see the insidious use which Britain endeavored to make of the
propositions of peace under the mediation of Spain. I shall now
proceed to the second proposition under the mediation of the Emperor
of Germany and the Empress of Russia; the general outline of which
was, that a congress of the several powers at war should meet at
Vienna, in 1781, to settle preliminaries of peace.
I could wish myself at liberty to make use of all the information
which I am possessed of on this subject, but as there is a delicacy
in the matter, I do not conceive it prudent, at least at present, to
make references and quotations in the same manner as I have done with
respect to the mediation of Spain, who published the whole
proceedings herself; and therefore, what comes from me, on this part
of the business, must rest on my own credit with the public, assuring
them, that when the whole proceedings, relative to the proposed
Congress of Vienna shall appear, they will find my account not only
true, but studiously moderate.

We know at the time this mediation was on the carpet, the expectation
of the British king and ministry ran high with respect to the
conquest of America. The English packet which was taken with the mail
on board, and carried into l'Orient, in France, contained letters
from Lord G. Germaine to Sir Henry Clinton, which expressed in the
fullest terms the ministerial idea of a total conquest. Copies of
those letters were sent to congress and published in the newspapers
of last year. Colonel [John] Laurens brought over the originals, some
of which, signed in the handwriting of the then secretary, Germaine,
are now in my possession.

Filled with these high ideas, nothing could be more insolent towards
America than the language of the British court on the proposed
mediation. A peace with France and Spain she anxiously solicited; but
America, as before, was to be left to her mercy, neither would she
hear any proposition for admitting an agent from the United States
into the congress of Vienna.

On the other hand, France, with an open, noble and manly
determination, and a fidelity of a good ally, would hear no
proposition for a separate peace, nor even meet in congress at
Vienna, without an agent from America: and likewise that the
independent character of the United States, represented by the agent,
should be fully and unequivocally defined and settled before any
conference should be entered on. The reasoning of the court of France
on the several propositions of the two imperial courts, which relate
to us, is rather in the style of an American than an ally, and she
advocated the cause of America as if she had been America herself.-
Thus the second mediation, like the first, proved ineffectual.
But since that time, a reverse of fortune has overtaken the British
arms, and all their high expectations are dashed to the ground. The
noble exertions to the southward under General [Nathaniel] Greene;
the successful operations of the allied arms in the Chesapeake; the
loss of most of their islands in the West Indies, and Minorca in the
Mediterranean; the persevering spirit of Spain against Gibraltar; the
expected capture of Jamaica; the failure of making a separate peace
with Holland, and the expense of an hundred millions sterling, by
which all these fine losses were obtained, have read them a loud
lesson of disgraceful misfortune and necessity has called on them to
change their ground.

In this situation of confusion and despair, their present councils
have no fixed character. It is now the hurricane months of British
politics. Every day seems to have a storm of its own, and they are
scudding under the bare poles of hope. Beaten, but not humble;
condemned, but not penitent; they act like men trembling at fate and
catching at a straw. From this convulsion, in the entrails of their
politics, it is more than probable, that the mountain groaning in
labor, will bring forth a mouse, as to its size, and a monster in its
make. They will try on America the same insidious arts they tried on
France and Spain.

We sometimes experience sensations to which language is not equal.
The conception is too bulky to be born alive, and in the torture of
thinking, we stand dumb. Our feelings, imprisoned by their magnitude,
find no way out- and, in the struggle of expression, every finger
tries to be a tongue. The machinery of the body seems too little for
the mind, and we look about for helps to show our thoughts by. Such
must be the sensation of America, whenever Britain, teeming with
corruption, shall propose to her to sacrifice her faith.

But, exclusive of the wickedness, there is a personal offence
contained in every such attempt. It is calling us villains: for no
man asks the other to act the villain unless he believes him inclined
to be one. No man attempts to seduce the truly honest woman. It is
the supposed looseness of her mind that starts the thoughts of
seduction, and he who offers it calls her a prostitute. Our pride is
always hurt by the same propositions which offend our principles; for
when we are shocked at the crime, we are wounded by the suspicion of
our compliance.

Could I convey a thought that might serve to regulate the public
mind, I would not make the interest of the alliance the basis of
defending it. All the world are moved by interest, and it affords
them nothing to boast of. But I would go a step higher, and defend it
on the ground of honor and principle. That our public affairs have
flourished under the alliance- that it was wisely made, and has been
nobly executed- that by its assistance we are enabled to preserve our
country from conquest, and expel those who sought our destruction-
that it is our true interest to maintain it unimpaired, and that
while we do so no enemy can conquer us, are matters which experience
has taught us, and the common good of ourselves, abstracted from
principles of faith and honor, would lead us to maintain the
connection.

But over and above the mere letter of the alliance, we have been
nobly and generously treated, and have had the same respect and
attention paid to us, as if we had been an old established country.
To oblige and be obliged is fair work among mankind, and we want an
opportunity of showing to the world that we are a people sensible of
kindness and worthy of confidence. Character is to us, in our present
circumstances, of more importance than interest. We are a young
nation, just stepping upon the stage of public life, and the eye of
the world is upon us to see how we act. We have an enemy who is
watching to destroy our reputation, and who will go any length to
gain some evidence against us, that may serve to render our conduct
suspected, and our character odious; because, could she accomplish
this, wicked as it is, the world would withdraw from us, as from a
people not to be trusted, and our task would then become difficult.
There is nothing which sets the character of a nation in a higher or
lower light with others, than the faithfully fulfilling, or
perfidiously breaking, of treaties. They are things not to be
tampered with: and should Britain, which seems very probable, propose
to seduce America into such an act of baseness, it would merit from
her some mark of unusual detestation. It is one of those
extraordinary instances in which we ought not to be contented with
the bare negative of Congress, because it is an affront on the
multitude as well as on the government. It goes on the supposition
that the public are not honest men, and that they may be managed by
contrivance, though they cannot be conquered by arms. But, let the
world and Britain know, that we are neither to be bought nor sold;
that our mind is great and fixed; our prospect clear; and that we
will support our character as firmly as our independence.

But I will go still further; General Conway, who made the motion, in
the British Parliament, for discontinuing offensive war in America,
is a gentleman of an amiable character. We have no personal quarrel
with him. But he feels not as we feel; he is not in our situation,
and that alone, without any other explanation, is enough.
The British Parliament suppose they have many friends in America, and
that, when all chance of conquest is over, they will be able to draw
her from her alliance with France. Now, if I have any conception of
the human heart, they will fail in this more than in any thing that
they have yet tried.

This part of the business is not a question of policy only, but of
honor and honesty; and the proposition will have in it something so
visibly low and base, that their partisans, if they have any, will be
ashamed of it. Men are often hurt by a mean action who are not
startled at a wicked one, and this will be such a confession of
inability, such a declaration of servile thinking, that the scandal
of it will ruin all their hopes.

In short, we have nothing to do but to go on with vigor and
determination. The enemy is yet in our country. They hold New York,
Charleston, and Savannah, and the very being in those places is an
offence, and a part of offensive war, and until they can be driven
from them, or captured in them, it would be folly in us to listen to
an idle tale. I take it for granted that the British ministry are
sinking under the impossibility of carrying on the war. Let them then
come to a fair and open peace with France, Spain, Holland and
America, in the manner they ought to do; but until then, we can have
nothing to say to them.
                                     COMMON SENSE.

PHILADELPHIA, May 22, 1782.

                        A SUPERNUMERARY CRISIS

                         TO SIR GUY CARLETON.

IT is the nature of compassion to associate with misfortune; and I
address this to you in behalf even of an enemy, a captain in the
British service, now on his way to the headquarters of the American
army, and unfortunately doomed to death for a crime not his own. A
sentence so extraordinary, an execution so repugnant to every human
sensation, ought never to be told without the circumstances which
produced it: and as the destined victim is yet in existence, and in
your hands rests his life or death, I shall briefly state the case,
and the melancholy consequence.

Captain Huddy, of the Jersey militia, was attacked in a small fort on
Tom's River, by a party of refugees in the British pay and service,
was made prisoner, together with his company, carried to New York and
lodged in the provost of that city: about three weeks after which, he
was taken out of the provost down to the water-side, put into a boat,
and brought again upon the Jersey shore, and there, contrary to the
practice of all nations but savages, was hung up on a tree, and left
hanging till found by our people who took him down and buried him.
The inhabitants of that part of the country where the murder was
committed, sent a deputation to General Washington with a full and
certified statement of the fact. Struck, as every human breast must
be, with such brutish outrage, and determined both to punish and
prevent it for the future, the General represented the case to
General Clinton, who then commanded, and demanded that the refugee
officer who ordered and attended the execution, and whose name is
Lippencott, should be delivered up as a murderer; and in case of
refusal, that the person of some British officer should suffer in his
stead. The demand, though not refused, has not been complied with;
and the melancholy lot (not by selection, but by casting lots) has
fallen upon Captain Asgill, of the Guards, who, as I have already
mentioned, is on his way from Lancaster to camp, a martyr to the
general wickedness of the cause he engaged in, and the ingratitude of
those whom he served.

The first reflection which arises on this black business is, what
sort of men must Englishmen be, and what sort of order and discipline
do they preserve in their army, when in the immediate place of their
headquarters, and under the eye and nose of their commander-in-chief,
a prisoner can be taken at pleasure from his confinement, and his
death made a matter of sport.

The history of the most savage Indians does not produce instances
exactly of this kind. They, at least, have a formality in their
punishments. With them it is the horridness of revenge, but with your
army it is a still greater crime, the horridness of diversion.
The British generals who have succeeded each other, from the time of
General Gage to yourself, have all affected to speak in language that
they have no right to. In their proclamations, their addresses, their
letters to General Washington, and their supplications to Congress
(for they deserve no other name) they talk of British honor, British
generosity, and British clemency, as if those things were matters of
fact; whereas, we whose eyes are open, who speak the same language
with yourselves, many of whom were born on the same spot with you,
and who can no more be mistaken in your words than in your actions,
can declare to all the world, that so far as our knowledge goes,
there is not a more detestable character, nor a meaner or more
barbarous enemy, than the present British one. With us, you have
forfeited all pretensions to reputation, and it is only by holding
you like a wild beast, afraid of your keepers, that you can be made
manageable. But to return to the point in question.

Though I can think no man innocent who has lent his hand to destroy
the country which he did not plant, and to ruin those that he could
not enslave, yet, abstracted from all ideas of right and wrong on the

original question, Captain Asgill, in the present case, is not the
guilty man. The villain and the victim are here separated characters.
You hold the one and we the other. You disown, or affect to disown
and reprobate the conduct of Lippincut, yet you give him a sanctuary;
and by so doing you as effectually become the executioner of Asgill,
as if you had put the rope on his neck, and dismissed him from the
world. Whatever your feelings on this interesting occasion may be are
best known to yourself. Within the grave of your own mind lies buried
the fate of Asgill. He becomes the corpse of your will, or the
survivor of your justice. Deliver up the one, and you save the other;
withhold the one, and the other dies by your choice.

On our part the case is exceeding plain; an officer has been taken
from his confinement and murdered, and the murderer is within your
lines. Your army has been guilty of a thousand instances of equal
cruelty, but they have been rendered equivocal, and sheltered from
personal detection. Here the crime is fixed; and is one of those
extraordinary cases which can neither be denied nor palliated, and to
which the custom of war does not apply; for it never could be
supposed that such a brutal outrage would ever be committed. It is an
original in the history of civilized barbarians, and is truly British.
On your part you are accountable to us for the personal safety of the
prisoners within your walls. Here can be no mistake; they can neither
be spies nor suspected as such; your security is not endangered, nor
your operations subjected to miscarriage, by men immured within a
dungeon. They differ in every circumstance from men in the field, and
leave no pretence for severity of punishment. But if to the dismal
condition of captivity with you must be added the constant
apprehensions of death; if to be imprisoned is so nearly to be
entombed; and if, after all, the murderers are to be protected, and
thereby the crime encouraged, wherein do you differ from [American]
Indians either in conduct or character?

We can have no idea of your honor, or your justice, in any future
transaction, of what nature it may be, while you shelter within your
lines an outrageous murderer, and sacrifice in his stead an officer
of your own. If you have no regard to us, at least spare the blood
which it is your duty to save. Whether the punishment will be greater
on him, who, in this case, innocently dies, or on him whom sad
necessity forces to retaliate, is, in the nicety of sensation, an
undecided question? It rests with you to prevent the sufferings of
both. You have nothing to do but to give up the murderer, and the
matter ends.

But to protect him, be he who he may, is to patronize his crime, and
to trifle it off by frivolous and unmeaning inquiries, is to promote
it. There is no declaration you can make, nor promise you can give
that will obtain credit. It is the man and not the apology that is
demanded.

You see yourself pressed on all sides to spare the life of your own
officer, for die he will if you withhold justice. The murder of
Captain Huddy is an offence not to be borne with, and there is no
security which we can have, that such actions or similar ones shall
not be repeated, but by making the punishment fall upon yourselves.
To destroy the last security of captivity, and to take the unarmed,
the unresisting prisoner to private and sportive execution, is
carrying barbarity too high for silence. The evil must be put an end
to; and the choice of persons rests with you. But if your attachment
to the guilty is stronger than to the innocent, you invent a crime
that must destroy your character, and if the cause of your king needs
to be so supported, for ever cease, sir, to torture our remembrance
with the wretched phrases of British honor, British generosity and
British clemency.

From this melancholy circumstance, learn, sir, a lesson of morality.
The refugees are men whom your predecessors have instructed in
wickedness, the better to fit them to their master's purpose. To make
them useful, they have made them vile, and the consequence of their
tutored villany is now descending on the heads of their encouragers.
They have been trained like hounds to the scent of blood, and
cherished in every species of dissolute barbarity. Their ideas of
right and wrong are worn away in the constant habitude of repeated
infamy, till, like men practised in execution, they feel not the
value of another's life.

The task before you, though painful, is not difficult; give up the
murderer, and save your officer, as the first outset of a necessary
reformation.

PHILADELPHIA May 31, 1782.

                           The Crisis.

                                 XII.

                      TO THE EARL OF SHELBURNE.

MY LORD,- A speech, which has been printed in several of the British
and New York newspapers, as coming from your lordship, in answer to
one from the Duke of Richmond, of the 10th of July last, contains
expressions and opinions so new and singular, and so enveloped in
mysterious reasoning, that I address this publication to you, for the
purpose of giving them a free and candid examination. The speech I
allude to is in these words:

"His lordship said, it had been mentioned in another place, that he
had been guilty of inconsistency. To clear himself of this, he
asserted that he still held the same principles in respect to
American independence which he at first imbibed. He had been, and yet
was of opinion, whenever the Parliament of Great Britain acknowledges
that point, the sun of England's glory is set forever. Such were the
sentiments he possessed on a former day, and such the sentiments he
continued to hold at this hour. It was the opinion of Lord Chatham,
as well as many other able statesmen. Other noble lords, however,
think differently, and as the majority of the cabinet support them,
he acquiesced in the measure, dissenting from the idea; and the point
is settled for bringing the matter into the full discussion of
Parliament, where it will be candidly, fairly, and impartially
debated. The independence of America would end in the ruin of
England; and that a peace patched up with France, would give that
proud enemy the means of yet trampling on this country. The sun of
England's glory he wished not to see set forever; he looked for a
spark at least to be left, which might in time light us up to a new
day. But if independence was to be granted, if Parliament deemed that
measure prudent, he foresaw, in his own mind, that England was
undone. He wished to God that he had been deputed to Congress, that
be might plead the cause of that country as well as of this, and that
he might exercise whatever powers he possessed as an orator, to save
both from ruin, in a conviction to Congress, that, if their
independence was signed, their liberties were gone forever.

"Peace, his lordship added, was a desirable object, but it must be an
honorable peace, and not an humiliating one, dictated by France, or
insisted on by America. It was very true, that this kingdom was not
in a flourishing state, it was impoverished by war. But if we were
not rich, it was evident that France was poor. If we were straitened
in our finances, the enemy were exhausted in their resources. This
was a great empire; it abounded with brave men, who were able and
willing to fight in a common cause; the language of humiliation
should not, therefore, be the language of Great Britain. His lordship
said, that he was not afraid nor ashamed of those expressions going
to America. There were numbers, great numbers there, who were of the
same way of thinking, in respect to that country being dependent on
this, and who, with his lordship, perceived ruin and independence
linked together."

Thus far the speech; on which I remark- That his lordship is a total
stranger to the mind and sentiments of America; that he has wrapped
himself up in fond delusion, that something less than independence,
may, under his administration, be accepted; and he wishes himself
sent to Congress, to prove the most extraordinary of all doctrines,
which is, that independence, the sublimest of all human conditions,
is loss of liberty.

In answer to which we may say, that in order to know what the
contrary word dependence means, we have only to look back to those
years of severe humiliation, when the mildest of all petitions could
obtain no other notice than the haughtiest of all insults; and when
the base terms of unconditional submission were demanded, or
undistinguishable destruction threatened. It is nothing to us that
the ministry have been changed, for they may be changed again. The
guilt of a government is the crime of a whole country; and the nation
that can, though but for a moment, think and act as England has done,
can never afterwards be believed or trusted. There are cases in which
it is as impossible to restore character to life, as it is to recover
the dead. It is a phoenix that can expire but once, and from whose
ashes there is no resurrection. Some offences are of such a slight
composition, that they reach no further than the temper, and are
created or cured by a thought. But the sin of England has struck the
heart of America, and nature has not left in our power to say we can
forgive.

Your lordship wishes for an opportunity to plead before Congress the
cause of England and America, and to save, as you say, both from ruin.

That the country, which, for more than seven years has sought our
destruction, should now cringe to solicit our protection, is adding
the wretchedness of disgrace to the misery of disappointment; and if
England has the least spark of supposed honor left, that spark must
be darkened by asking, and extinguished by receiving, the smallest
favor from America; for the criminal who owes his life to the grace
and mercy of the injured, is more executed by living, than he who
dies.

But a thousand pleadings, even from your lordship, can have no
effect. Honor, interest, and every sensation of the heart, would
plead against you. We are a people who think not as you think; and
what is equally true, you cannot feel as we feel. The situations of
the two countries are exceedingly different. Ours has been the seat
of war; yours has seen nothing of it. The most wanton destruction has
been committed in our sight; the most insolent barbarity has been
acted on our feelings. We can look round and see the remains of burnt
and destroyed houses, once the fair fruit of hard industry, and now
the striking monuments of British brutality. We walk over the dead
whom we loved, in every part of America, and remember by whom they
fell. There is scarcely a village but brings to life some melancholy
thought, and reminds us of what we have suffered, and of those we
have lost by the inhumanity of Britain. A thousand images arise to
us, which, from situation, you cannot see, and are accompanied by as
many ideas which you cannot know; and therefore your supposed system
of reasoning would apply to nothing, and all your expectations die of
themselves.

The question whether England shall accede to the independence of
America, and which your lordship says is to undergo a parliamentary
discussion, is so very simple, and composed of so few cases, that it
scarcely needs a debate.

It is the only way out of an expensive and ruinous war, which has no
object, and without which acknowledgment there can be no peace.

But your lordship says, the sun of Great Britain will set whenever
she acknowledges the independence of America.- Whereas the metaphor
would have been strictly just, to have left the sun wholly out of the
figure, and have ascribed her not acknowledging it to the influence
of the moon.

But the expression, if true, is the greatest confession of disgrace
that could be made, and furnishes America with the highest notions of
sovereign independent importance. Mr. Wedderburne, about the year
1776, made use of an idea of much the same kind,- Relinquish America!
says he- What is it but to desire a giant to shrink spontaneously
into a dwarf.

Alas! are those people who call themselves Englishmen, of so little
internal consequence, that when America is gone, or shuts her eyes
upon them, their sun is set, they can shine no more, but grope about
in obscurity, and contract into insignificant animals? Was America,
then, the giant of the empire, and England only her dwarf in waiting!
Is the case so strangely altered, that those who once thought we
could not live without them, are now brought to declare that they
cannot exist without us? Will they tell to the world, and that from
their first minister of state, that America is their all in all; that
it is by her importance only that they can live, and breathe, and
have a being? Will they, who long since threatened to bring us to
their feet, bow themselves to ours, and own that without us they are
not a nation? Are they become so unqualified to debate on
independence, that they have lost all idea of it themselves, and are
calling to the rocks and mountains of America to cover their
insignificance? Or, if America is lost, is it manly to sob over it
like a child for its rattle, and invite the laughter of the world by
declarations of disgrace? Surely, a more consistent line of conduct
would be to bear it without complaint; and to show that England,
without America, can preserve her independence, and a suitable rank
with other European powers. You were not contented while you had her,
and to weep for her now is childish.

But Lord Shelburne thinks something may yet be done. What that
something is, or how it is to be accomplished, is a matter in
obscurity. By arms there is no hope. The experience of nearly eight
years, with the expense of an hundred million pounds sterling, and
the loss of two armies, must positively decide that point. Besides,
the British have lost their interest in America with the disaffected.
Every part of it has been tried. There is no new scene left for
delusion: and the thousands who have been ruined by adhering to them,
and have now to quit the settlements which they had acquired, and be
conveyed like transports to cultivate the deserts of Augustine and
Nova Scotia, has put an end to all further expectations of aid.

If you cast your eyes on the people of England, what have they to
console themselves with for the millions expended? Or, what
encouragement is there left to continue throwing good money after
bad? America can carry on the war for ten years longer, and all the
charges of government included, for less than you can defray the
charges of war and government for one year. And I, who know both
countries, know well, that the people of America can afford to pay
their share of the expense much better than the people of England
can. Besides, it is their own estates and property, their own rights,
liberties and government, that they are defending; and were they not
to do it, they would deserve to lose all, and none would pity them.
The fault would be their own, and their punishment just.

The British army in America care not how long the war lasts. They
enjoy an easy and indolent life. They fatten on the folly of one
country and the spoils of another; and, between their plunder and
their prey, may go home rich. But the case is very different with the
laboring farmer, the working tradesman, and the necessitous poor in
England, the sweat of whose brow goes day after day to feed, in
prodigality and sloth, the army that is robbing both them and us.
Removed from the eye of that country that supports them, and distant
from the government that employs them, they cut and carve for
themselves, and there is none to call them to account.

But England will be ruined, says Lord Shelburne, if America is
independent.

Then I say, is England already ruined, for America is already
independent: and if Lord Shelburne will not allow this, he
immediately denies the fact which he infers. Besides, to make England
the mere creature of America, is paying too great a compliment to us,
and too little to himself.

But the declaration is a rhapsody of inconsistency. For to say, as
Lord Shelburne has numberless times said, that the war against
America is ruinous, and yet to continue the prosecution of that
ruinous war for the purpose of avoiding ruin, is a language which
cannot be understood. Neither is it possible to see how the
independence of America is to accomplish the ruin of England after
the war is over, and yet not affect it before. America cannot be more
independent of her, nor a greater enemy to her, hereafter than she
now is; nor can England derive less advantages from her than at
present: why then is ruin to follow in the best state of the case,
and not in the worst? And if not in the worst, why is it to follow at
all?

That a nation is to be ruined by peace and commerce, and fourteen or
fifteen millions a-year less expenses than before, is a new doctrine
in politics. We have heard much clamor of national savings and
economy; but surely the true economy would be, to save the whole
charge of a silly, foolish, and headstrong war; because, compared
with this, all other retrenchments are baubles and trifles.

But is it possible that Lord Shelburne can be serious in supposing
that the least advantage can be obtained by arms, or that any
advantage can be equal to the expense or the danger of attempting it?
Will not the capture of one army after another satisfy him, must all
become prisoners? Must England ever be the sport of hope, and the
victim of delusion? Sometimes our currency was to fail; another time
our army was to disband; then whole provinces were to revolt. Such a
general said this and that; another wrote so and so; Lord Chatham was
of this opinion; and lord somebody else of another. To-day 20,000
Russians and 20 Russian ships of the line were to come; to-morrow the
empress was abused without mercy or decency. Then the Emperor of
Germany was to be bribed with a million of money, and the King of
Prussia was to do wonderful things. At one time it was, Lo here! and
then it was, Lo there! Sometimes this power, and sometimes that
power, was to engage in the war, just as if the whole world was mad
and foolish like Britain. And thus, from year to year, has every
straw been catched at, and every Will-with-a-wisp led them a new
dance.

This year a still newer folly is to take place. Lord Shelburne wishes
to be sent to Congress, and he thinks that something may be done.

Are not the repeated declarations of Congress, and which all America
supports, that they will not even hear any proposals whatever, until
the unconditional and unequivocal independence of America is
recognised; are not, I say, these declarations answer enough?

But for England to receive any thing from America now, after so many
insults, injuries and outrages, acted towards us, would show such a
spirit of meanness in her, that we could not but despise her for
accepting it. And so far from Lord Shelburne's coming here to solicit
it, it would be the greatest disgrace we could do them to offer it.
England would appear a wretch indeed, at this time of day, to ask or
owe any thing to the bounty of America. Has not the name of
Englishman blots enough upon it, without inventing more? Even Lucifer
would scorn to reign in heaven by permission, and yet an Englishman
can creep for only an entrance into America. Or, has a land of
liberty so many charms, that to be a doorkeeper in it is better than
to be an English minister of state?

But what can this expected something be? Or, if obtained, what can it
amount to, but new disgraces, contentions and quarrels? The people of
America have for years accustomed themselves to think and speak so
freely and contemptuously of English authority, and the inveteracy is
so deeply rooted, that a person invested with any authority from that
country, and attempting to exercise it here, would have the life of a
toad under a harrow. They would look on him as an interloper, to whom
their compassion permitted a residence. He would be no more than the
Mungo of a farce; and if he disliked that, he must set off. It would
be a station of degradation, debased by our pity, and despised by our
pride, and would place England in a more contemptible situation than
any she has yet been in during the war. We have too high an opinion
of ourselves, even to think of yielding again the least obedience to
outlandish authority; and for a thousand reasons, England would be
the last country in the world to yield it to. She has been
treacherous, and we know it. Her character is gone, and we have seen
the funeral.

Surely she loves to fish in troubled waters, and drink the cup of
contention, or she would not now think of mingling her affairs with
those of America. It would be like a foolish dotard taking to his
arms the bride that despises him, or who has placed on his head the
ensigns of her disgust. It is kissing the hand that boxes his ears,
and proposing to renew the exchange. The thought is as servile as the
war is wicked, and shows the last scene of the drama to be as
inconsistent as the first.

As America is gone, the only act of manhood is to let her go. Your
lordship had no hand in the separation, and you will gain no honor by
temporising politics. Besides, there is something so exceedingly
whimsical, unsteady, and even insincere in the present conduct of
England, that she exhibits herself in the most dishonorable colors.
On the second of August last, General Carleton and Admiral Digby
wrote to General Washington in these words:

"The resolution of the House of Commons, of the 27th of February
last, has been placed in Your Excellency's hands, and intimations
given at the same time that further pacific measures were likely to
follow. Since which, until the present time, we have had no direct
communications with England; but a mail is now arrived, which brings
us very important information. We are acquainted, sir, by authority,
that negotiations for a general peace have already commenced at
Paris, and that Mr. Grenville is invested with full powers to treat
with all the parties at war, and is now at Paris in execution of his
commission. And we are further, sir, made acquainted, that His
Majesty, in order to remove any obstacles to this peace which he so
ardently wishes to restore, has commanded his ministers to direct Mr.
Grenville, that the independence of the Thirteen United Provinces,
should be proposed by him in the first instance, instead of making it
a condition of a general treaty."

Now, taking your present measures into view, and comparing them with
the declaration in this letter, pray what is the word of your king,
or his ministers, or the Parliament, good for? Must we not look upon
you as a confederated body of faithless, treacherous men, whose
assurances are fraud, and their language deceit? What opinion can we
possibly form of you, but that you are a lost, abandoned, profligate
nation, who sport even with your own character, and are to be held by
nothing but the bayonet or the halter?

To say, after this, that the sun of Great Britain will be set
whenever she acknowledges the independence of America, when the not
doing it is the unqualified lie of government, can be no other than
the language of ridicule, the jargon of inconsistency. There were
thousands in America who predicted the delusion, and looked upon it
as a trick of treachery, to take us from our guard, and draw off our
attention from the only system of finance, by which we can be called,
or deserve to be called, a sovereign, independent people. The fraud,
on your part, might be worth attempting, but the sacrifice to obtain
it is too high.

There are others who credited the assurance, because they thought it
impossible that men who had their characters to establish, would
begin with a lie. The prosecution of the war by the former ministry
was savage and horrid; since which it has been mean, trickish, and
delusive. The one went greedily into the passion of revenge, the
other into the subtleties of low contrivance; till, between the
crimes of both, there is scarcely left a man in America, be he Whig
or Tory, who does not despise or detest the conduct of Britain.

The management of Lord Shelburne, whatever may be his views, is a
caution to us, and must be to the world, never to regard British
assurances. A perfidy so notorious cannot be hid. It stands even in
the public papers of New York, with the names of Carleton and Digby
affixed to it. It is a proclamation that the king of England is not
to be believed; that the spirit of lying is the governing principle
of the ministry. It is holding up the character of the House of
Commons to public infamy, and warning all men not to credit them.
Such are the consequences which Lord Shelburne's management has
brought upon his country.

After the authorized declarations contained in Carleton and Digby's
letter, you ought, from every motive of honor, policy and prudence,
to have fulfilled them, whatever might have been the event. It was
the least atonement that you could possibly make to America, and the
greatest kindness you could do to yourselves; for you will save
millions by a general peace, and you will lose as many by continuing
the war.

COMMON SENSE.

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 29, 1782.

P. S. The manuscript copy of this letter is sent your lordship, by
the way of our head-quarters, to New York, inclosing a late pamphlet
of mine, addressed to the Abbe Raynal, which will serve to give your
lordship some idea of the principles and sentiments of America.

                                                 C. S.

                           The Crisis.

      THOUGHTS ON THE PEACE, AND THE PROBABLE ADVANTAGES THEREOF.

"THE times that tried men's souls,"* are over- and the greatest and
completest revolution the world ever knew, gloriously and happily
accomplished.

* "These are the times that try men's souls," The Crisis No. I.
published December, 1776.

But to pass from the extremes of danger to safety- from the tumult of
war to the tranquillity of peace, though sweet in contemplation,
requires a gradual composure of the senses to receive it. Even
calmness has the power of stunning, when it opens too instantly upon
us. The long and raging hurricane that should cease in a moment,
would leave us in a state rather of wonder than enjoyment; and some
moments of recollection must pass, before we could be capable of
tasting the felicity of repose. There are but few instances, in which
the mind is fitted for sudden transitions: it takes in its pleasures
by reflection and comparison and those must have time to act, before
the relish for new scenes is complete.

In the present case- the mighty magnitude of the object- the various
uncertainties of fate it has undergone- the numerous and complicated
dangers we have suffered or escaped- the eminence we now stand on,
and the vast prospect before us, must all conspire to impress us with
contemplation.

To see it in our power to make a world happy- to teach mankind the
art of being so- to exhibit, on the theatre of the universe a
character hitherto unknown- and to have, as it were, a new creation
intrusted to our hands, are honors that command reflection, and can
neither be too highly estimated, nor too gratefully received.

In this pause then of recollection- while the storm is ceasing, and
the long agitated mind vibrating to a rest, let us look back on the
scenes we have passed, and learn from experience what is yet to be
done.

Never, I say, had a country so many openings to happiness as this.
Her setting out in life, like the rising of a fair morning, was
unclouded and promising. Her cause was good. Her principles just and
liberal. Her temper serene and firm. Her conduct regulated by the
nicest steps, and everything about her wore the mark of honor. It is
not every country (perhaps there is not another in the world) that
can boast so fair an origin. Even the first settlement of America
corresponds with the character of the revolution. Rome, once the
proud mistress of the universe, was originally a band of ruffians.
Plunder and rapine made her rich, and her oppression of millions made
her great. But America need never be ashamed to tell her birth, nor
relate the stages by which she rose to empire.

The remembrance, then, of what is past, if it operates rightly, must
inspire her with the most laudable of all ambition, that of adding to
the fair fame she began with. The world has seen her great in
adversity; struggling, without a thought of yielding, beneath
accumulated difficulties, bravely, nay proudly, encountering
distress, and rising in resolution as the storm increased. All this
is justly due to her, for her fortitude has merited the character.
Let, then, the world see that she can bear prosperity: and that her
honest virtue in time of peace, is equal to the bravest virtue in
time of war.

She is now descending to the scenes of quiet and domestic life. Not
beneath the cypress shade of disappointment, but to enjoy in her own
land, and under her own vine, the sweet of her labors, and the reward
of her toil.- In this situation, may she never forget that a fair
national reputation is of as much importance as independence. That it
possesses a charm that wins upon the world, and makes even enemies
civil. That it gives a dignity which is often superior to power, and
commands reverence where pomp and splendor fail.

It would be a circumstance ever to be lamented and never to be
forgotten, were a single blot, from any cause whatever, suffered to
fall on a revolution, which to the end of time must be an honor to
the age that accomplished it: and which has contributed more to
enlighten the world, and diffuse a spirit of freedom and liberality
among mankind, than any human event (if this may be called one) that
ever preceded it.

It is not among the least of the calamities of a long continued war,
that it unhinges the mind from those nice sensations which at other
times appear so amiable. The continual spectacle of woe blunts the
finer feelings, and the necessity of bearing with the sight, renders
it familiar. In like manner, are many of the moral obligations of
society weakened, till the custom of acting by necessity becomes an
apology, where it is truly a crime. Yet let but a nation conceive
rightly of its character, and it will be chastely just in protecting
it. None ever began with a fairer than America and none can be under
a greater obligation to preserve it.

The debt which America has contracted, compared with the cause she
has gained, and the advantages to flow from it, ought scarcely to be
mentioned. She has it in her choice to do, and to live as happily as
she pleases. The world is in her hands. She has no foreign power to
monopolize her commerce, perplex her legislation, or control her
prosperity. The struggle is over, which must one day have happened,
and, perhaps, never could have happened at a better time.* And
instead of a domineering master, she has gained an ally whose
exemplary greatness, and universal liberality, have extorted a
confession even from her enemies.

* That the revolution began at the exact period of time best fitted
to the purpose, is sufficiently proved by the event.- But the great
hinge on which the whole machine turned, is the Union of the States:
and this union was naturally produced by the inability of any one
state to support itself against any foreign enemy without the
assistance of the rest.
Had the states severally been less able than they were when the war
began, their united strength would not have been equal to the
undertaking, and they must in all human probability have failed.-
And, on the other hand, had they severally been more able, they might
not have seen, or, what is more, might not have felt, the necessity
of uniting: and, either by attempting to stand alone or in small
confederacies, would have been separately conquered.
Now, as we cannot see a time (and many years must pass away before it
can arrive) when the strength of any one state, or several united,
can be equal to the whole of the present United States, and as we
have seen the extreme difficulty of collectively prosecuting the war
to a successful issue, and preserving our national importance in the
world, therefore, from the experience we have had, and the knowledge
we have gained, we must, unless we make a waste of wisdom, be
strongly impressed with the advantage, as well as the necessity of
strengthening that happy union which had been our salvation, and
without which we should have been a ruined people.
While I was writing this note, I cast my eye on the pamphlet, Common
Sense, from which I shall make an extract, as it exactly applies to
the case. It is as follows:
"I have never met with a man, either in England or America, who has
not confessed it as his opinion that a separation between the
countries would take place one time or other; and there is no
instance in which we have shown less judgment, than in endeavoring to
describe what we call the ripeness or fitness of the continent for
independence.
"As all men allow the measure, and differ only in their opinion of
the time, let us, in order to remove mistakes, take a general survey
of things, and endeavor, if possible, to find out the very time. But
we need not to go far, the inquiry ceases at once, for, the time has
found us. The general concurrence, the glorious union of all things
prove the fact.
"It is not in numbers, but in a union, that our great strength lies.
The continent is just arrived at that pitch of strength, in which no
single colony is able to support itself, and the whole, when united,
can accomplish the matter; and either more or less than this, might
be fatal in its effects."

With the blessings of peace, independence, and an universal commerce,
the states, individually and collectively, will have leisure and
opportunity to regulate and establish their domestic concerns, and to
put it beyond the power of calumny to throw the least reflection on
their honor. Character is much easier kept than recovered, and that
man, if any such there be, who, from sinister views, or littleness of
soul, lends unseen his hand to injure it, contrives a wound it will
never be in his power to heal.

As we have established an inheritance for posterity, let that
inheritance descend, with every mark of an honorable conveyance. The
little it will cost, compared with the worth of the states, the
greatness of the object, and the value of the national character,
will be a profitable exchange.

But that which must more forcibly strike a thoughtful, penetrating
mind, and which includes and renders easy all inferior concerns, is
the UNION OF THE STATES. On this our great national character
depends. It is this which must give us importance abroad and security
at home. It is through this only that we are, or can be, nationally
known in the world; it is the flag of the United States which renders
our ships and commerce safe on the seas, or in a foreign port. Our
Mediterranean passes must be obtained under the same style. All our
treaties, whether of alliance, peace, or commerce, are formed under
the sovereignty of the United States, and Europe knows us by no other
name or title.

The division of the empire into states is for our own convenience,
but abroad this distinction ceases. The affairs of each state are
local. They can go no further than to itself. And were the whole
worth of even the richest of them expended in revenue, it would not
be sufficient to support sovereignty against a foreign attack. In
short, we have no other national sovereignty than as United States.
It would even be fatal for us if we had- too expensive to be
maintained, and impossible to be supported. Individuals, or
individual states, may call themselves what they please; but the
world, and especially the world of enemies, is not to be held in awe
by the whistling of a name. Sovereignty must have power to protect
all the parts that compose and constitute it: and as UNITED STATES we
are equal to the importance of the title, but otherwise we are not.
Our union, well and wisely regulated and cemented, is the cheapest
way of being great- the easiest way of being powerful, and the
happiest invention in government which the circumstances of America
can admit of.- Because it collects from each state, that which, by
being inadequate, can be of no use to it, and forms an aggregate that
serves for all.

The states of Holland are an unfortunate instance of the effects of
individual sovereignty. Their disjointed condition exposes them to
numerous intrigues, losses, calamities, and enemies; and the almost
impossibility of bringing their measures to a decision, and that
decision into execution, is to them, and would be to us, a source of
endless misfortune.

It is with confederated states as with individuals in society;
something must be yielded up to make the whole secure. In this view
of things we gain by what we give, and draw an annual interest
greater than the capital.- I ever feel myself hurt when I hear the
union, that great palladium of our liberty and safety, the least
irreverently spoken of. It is the most sacred thing in the
constitution of America, and that which every man should be most
proud and tender of. Our citizenship in the United States is our
national character. Our citizenship in any particular state is only
our local distinction. By the latter we are known at home, by the
former to the world. Our great title is AMERICANS- our inferior one
varies with the place.

So far as my endeavors could go, they have all been directed to
conciliate the affections, unite the interests, and draw and keep the
mind of the country together; and the better to assist in this
foundation work of the revolution, I have avoided all places of
profit or office, either in the state I live in, or in the United
States; kept myself at a distance from all parties and party
connections, and even disregarded all private and inferior concerns:
and when we take into view the great work which we have gone through,
and feel, as we ought to feel, the just importance of it, we shall
then see, that the little wranglings and indecent contentions of
personal parley, are as dishonorable to our characters, as they are
injurious to our repose.

It was the cause of America that made me an author. The force with
which it struck my mind and the dangerous condition the country
appeared to me in, by courting an impossible and an unnatural
reconciliation with those who were determined to reduce her, instead
of striking out into the only line that could cement and save her, A
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, made it impossible for me, feeling as I
did, to be silent: and if, in the course of more than seven years, I
have rendered her any service, I have likewise added something to the
reputation of literature, by freely and disinterestedly employing it
in the great cause of mankind, and showing that there may be genius
without prostitution.

Independence always appeared to me practicable and probable, provided
the sentiment of the country could be formed and held to the object:
and there is no instance in the world, where a people so extended,
and wedded to former habits of thinking, and under such a variety of
circumstances, were so instantly and effectually pervaded, by a turn
in politics, as in the case of independence; and who supported their
opinion, undiminished, through such a succession of good and ill
fortune, till they crowned it with success.

But as the scenes of war are closed, and every man preparing for home
and happier times, I therefore take my leave of the subject. I have
most sincerely followed it from beginning to end, and through all its
turns and windings: and whatever country I may hereafter be in, I
shall always feel an honest pride at the part I have taken and acted,
and a gratitude to nature and providence for putting it in my power
to be of some use to mankind.

PHILADELPHIA, April 19, 1783.

                        A SUPERNUMERARY CRISIS

                      TO THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA.

IN "_Rivington's New York Gazette_," of December 6th, is a
publication, under the appearance of a letter from London, dated
September 30th; and is on a subject which demands the attention of
the United States.

The public will remember that a treaty of commerce between the United
States and England was set on foot last spring, and that until the
said treaty could be completed, a bill was brought into the British
Parliament by the then chancellor of the exchequer, Mr. Pitt, to
admit and legalize (as the case then required) the commerce of the
United States into the British ports and dominions. But neither the
one nor the other has been completed. The commercial treaty is either
broken off, or remains as it began; and the bill in Parliament has
been thrown aside. And in lieu thereof, a selfish system of English
politics has started up, calculated to fetter the commerce of
America, by engrossing to England the carrying trade of the American
produce to the West India islands.

Among the advocates for this last measure is Lord Sheffield, a member
of the British Parliament, who has published a pamphlet entitled
"Observations on the Commerce of the American States." The pamphlet
has two objects; the one is to allure the Americans to purchase
British manufactures; and the other to spirit up the British
Parliament to prohibit the citizens of the United States from trading
to the West India islands.

Viewed in this light, the pamphlet, though in some parts dexterously
written, is an absurdity. It offends, in the very act of endeavoring
to ingratiate; and his lordship, as a politician, ought not to have
suffered the two objects to have appeared together. The latter
alluded to, contains extracts from the pamphlet, with high encomiums
on Lord Sheffield, for laboriously endeavoring (as the letter styles
it) "to show the mighty advantages of retaining the carrying trade."

Since the publication of this pamphlet in England, the commerce of
the United States to the West Indies, in American vessels, has been
prohibited; and all intercourse, except in British bottoms, the
property of and navigated by British subjects, cut off.

That a country has a right to be as foolish as it pleases, has been
proved by the practice of England for many years past: in her island
situation, sequestered from the world, she forgets that her whispers
are heard by other nations; and in her plans of politics and commerce
she seems not to know, that other votes are necessary besides her
own. America would be equally as foolish as Britain, were she to
suffer so great a degradation on her flag, and such a stroke on the
freedom of her commerce, to pass without a balance.

We admit the right of any nation to prohibit the commerce of another
into its own dominions, where there are no treaties to the contrary;
but as this right belongs to one side as well as the other, there is
always a way left to bring avarice and insolence to reason.

But the ground of security which Lord Sheffield has chosen to erect
his policy upon, is of a nature which ought, and I think must, awaken
in every American a just and strong sense of national dignity. Lord
Sheffield appears to be sensible, that in advising the British nation
and Parliament to engross to themselves so great a part of the
carrying trade of America, he is attempting a measure which cannot
succeed, if the politics of the United States be properly directed to
counteract the assumption.

But, says he, in his pamphlet, "It will be a long time before the
American states can be brought to act as a nation, neither are they
to be feared as such by us."

What is this more or less than to tell us, that while we have no
national system of commerce, the British will govern our trade by
their own laws and proclamations as they please. The quotation
discloses a truth too serious to be overlooked, and too mischievous
not to be remedied.

Among other circumstances which led them to this discovery none could
operate so effectually as the injudicious, uncandid and indecent
opposition made by sundry persons in a certain state, to the
recommendations of Congress last winter, for an import duty of five
per cent. It could not but explain to the British a weakness in the
national power of America, and encourage them to attempt restrictions
on her trade, which otherwise they would not have dared to hazard.
Neither is there any state in the union, whose policy was more
misdirected to its interest than the state I allude to, because her
principal support is the carrying trade, which Britain, induced by
the want of a well-centred power in the United States to protect and
secure, is now attempting to take away. It fortunately happened (and
to no state in the union more than the state in question) that the
terms of peace were agreed on before the opposition appeared,
otherwise, there cannot be a doubt, that if the same idea of the
diminished authority of America had occurred to them at that time as
has occurred to them since, but they would have made the same grasp
at the fisheries, as they have done at the carrying trade.

It is surprising that an authority which can be supported with so
much ease, and so little expense, and capable of such extensive
advantages to the country, should be cavilled at by those whose duty
it is to watch over it, and whose existence as a people depends upon
it. But this, perhaps, will ever be the case, till some misfortune
awakens us into reason, and the instance now before us is but a
gentle beginning of what America must expect, unless she guards her
union with nicer care and stricter honor. United, she is formidable,
and that with the least possible charge a nation can be so;
separated, she is a medley of individual nothings, subject to the
sport of foreign nations.

It is very probable that the ingenuity of commerce may have found out
a method to evade and supersede the intentions of the British, in
interdicting the trade with the West India islands. The language of
both being the same, and their customs well understood, the vessels
of one country may, by deception, pass for those of another. But this
would be a practice too debasing for a sovereign people to stoop to,
and too profligate not to be discountenanced. An illicit trade, under
any shape it can be placed, cannot be carried on without a violation
of truth. America is now sovereign and independent, and ought to
conduct her affairs in a regular style of character. She has the same
right to say that no British vessel shall enter ports, or that no
British manufactures shall be imported, but in American bottoms, the
property of, and navigated by American subjects, as Britain has to
say the same thing respecting the West Indies. Or she may lay a duty
of ten, fifteen, or twenty shillings per ton (exclusive of other
duties) on every British vessel coming from any port of the West
Indies, where she is not admitted to trade, the said tonnage to
continue as long on her side as the prohibition continues on the
other.

But it is only by acting in union, that the usurpations of foreign
nations on the freedom of trade can be counteracted, and security
extended to the commerce of America. And when we view a flag, which
to the eye is beautiful, and to contemplate its rise and origin
inspires a sensation of sublime delight, our national honor must
unite with our interest to prevent injury to the one, or insult to
the other.
