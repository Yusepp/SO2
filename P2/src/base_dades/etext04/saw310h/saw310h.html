<p>TOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well
out of the track of returning scholars, and then fell into a
moody jog. He crossed a small "branch" two or three times,
because of a prevailing juvenile superstition that to cross water
baffled pursuit. Half an hour later he was disappearing behind
the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff Hill, and the
school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the valley
behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to
the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading
oak. There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat
had even stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance
that was broken by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering
of a wood-pecker, and this seemed to render the pervading silence
and sense of loneliness the more profound. The boy's soul was
steeped in melancholy; his feelings were in happy accord with his
surroundings. He sat long with his elbows on his knees and his
chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him that life was but
a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy Hodges, so
lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie and
slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering
through the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over
the grave, and nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more.
If he only had a clean Sunday-school record he could be willing
to go, and be done with it all. Now as to this girl. What had he
done? Nothing. He had meant the best in the world, and been
treated like a dog&mdash;like a very dog. She would be sorry some
day&mdash;maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only die
TEMPORARILY!</p>

<p>But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one
constrained shape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift
insensibly back into the concerns of this life again. What if he
turned his back, now, and disappeared mysteriously? What if he
went away&mdash;ever so far away, into unknown countries beyond
the seas&mdash;and never came back any more! How would she feel
then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only to fill
him with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights were
an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was
exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would
be a soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and
illustrious. No&mdash; better still, he would join the Indians,
and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges
and the trackless great plains of the Far West, and away in the
future come back a great chief, bristling with feathers, hideous
with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy summer
morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs
of all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was
something gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was
it! NOW his future lay plain before him, and glowing with
unimaginable splendor. How his name would fill the world, and
make people shudder! How gloriously he would go plowing the
dancing seas, in his long, low, black-hulled racer, the Spirit of
the Storm, with his grisly flag flying at the fore! And at the
zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear at the old
village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in his
black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his
crimson sash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his
crime-rusted cutlass at his side, his slouch hat with waving
plumes, his black flag unfurled, with the skull and crossbones on
it, and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings, "It's Tom
Sawyer the Pirate!&mdash;the Black Avenger of the Spanish
Main!"</p>

<p>Yes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run
away from home and enter upon it. He would start the very next
morning. Therefore he must now begin to get ready. He would
collect his resources together. He went to a rotten log near at
hand and began to dig under one end of it with his Barlow knife.
He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He put his hand there
and uttered this incantation impressively:</p>

<p>"What hasn't come here, come! What's here, stay here!"</p>

<p>Then he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He
took it up and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose
bottom and sides were of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom's
astonishment was bound-less! He scratched his head with a
perplexed air, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, that beats anything!"</p>

<p>Then he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood
cogitating. The truth was, that a superstition of his had failed,
here, which he and all his comrades had always looked upon as
infallible. If you buried a marble with certain necessary
incantations, and left it alone a fortnight, and then opened the
place with the incantation he had just used, you would find that
all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves
together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been
separated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably
failed. Tom's whole structure of faith was shaken to its
foundations. He had many a time heard of this thing succeeding
but never of its failing before. It did not occur to him that he
had tried it several times before, himself, but could never find
the hiding-places afterward. He puzzled over the matter some
time, and finally decided that some witch had interfered and
broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself on that
point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot
with a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself
down and put his mouth close to this depression and
called&mdash;</p>

<p>"Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!
Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!"</p>

<p>The sand began to work, and presently a small black bug
appeared for a second and then darted under again in a
fright.</p>

<p>"He dasn't tell! So it WAS a witch that done it. I just knowed
it."</p>

<p>He well knew the futility of trying to contend against
witches, so he gave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that
he might as well have the marble he had just thrown away, and
therefore he went and made a patient search for it. But he could
not find it. Now he went back to his treasure-house and carefully
placed himself just as he had been standing when he tossed the
marble away; then he took another marble from his pocket and
tossed it in the same way, saying:</p>

<p>"Brother, go find your brother!"</p>

<p>He watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it
must have fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more.
The last repetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a
foot of each other.</p>

<p>Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the
green aisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and
trousers, turned a suspender into a belt, raked away some brush
behind the rotten log, disclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath
sword and a tin trumpet, and in a moment had seized these things
and bounded away, barelegged, with fluttering shirt. He presently
halted under a great elm, blew an answering blast, and then
began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way and that. He said
cautiously&mdash;to an imaginary company:</p>

<p>"Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow."</p>

<p>Now appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed
as Tom. Tom called:</p>

<p>"Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my
pass?"</p>

<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>


<p>"Guy of Guisborne wants no man's pass. Who art thou
that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dares to hold such language," said Tom, prompting&mdash;for
they talked "by the book," from memory.</p>

<p>"Who art thou that dares to hold such language?"</p>

<p>"I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall
know."</p>

<p>"Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I
dispute with thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at
thee!"</p>

<p>They took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the
ground, struck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a
grave, careful combat, "two up and two down." Presently Tom
said:</p>

<p>"Now, if you've got the hang, go it lively!"</p>

<p>So they "went it lively," panting and perspiring with the
work. By and by Tom shouted:</p>

<p>"Fall! fall! Why don't you fall?"</p>

<p>"I sha'n't! Why don't you fall yourself? You're getting the
worst of it."</p>

<p>"Why, that ain't anything. I can't fall; that ain't the way it
is in the book. The book says, 'Then with one back-handed stroke
he slew poor Guy of Guisborne.' You're to turn around and let me
hit you in the back."</p>

<p>There was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned,
received the whack and fell.</p>

<p>"Now," said Joe, getting up, "you got to let me kill YOU.
That's fair."</p>

<p>"Why, I can't do that, it ain't in the book."</p>

<p>"Well, it's blamed mean&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's
son, and lam me with a quarter-staff; or I'll be the Sheriff of
Nottingham and you be Robin Hood a little while and kill me."</p>

<p>This was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried
out. Then Tom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the
treacherous nun to bleed his strength away through his neglected
wound. And at last Joe, representing a whole tribe of weeping
outlaws, dragged him sadly forth, gave his bow into his feeble
hands, and Tom said, "Where this arrow falls, there bury poor
Robin Hood under the greenwood tree." Then he shot the arrow and
fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle and sprang
up too gaily for a corpse.</p>

<br><br><br><br>


<p>The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and
went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and
wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to
compensate for their loss. They said they would rather be outlaws
a year in Sherwood Forest than President of the United States
forever.</p>

<p>AT half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed,
as usual. They said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom
lay awake and waited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to
him that it must be nearly daylight, he heard the clock strike
ten! This was despair. He would have tossed and fidgeted, as his
nerves demanded, but he was afraid he might wake Sid. So he lay
still, and stared up into the dark. Everything was dismally
still. By and by, out of the stillness, little, scarcely
preceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking of
the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to
crack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently
spirits were abroad. A measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt
Polly's chamber. And now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that
no human ingenuity could locate, began. Next the ghastly ticking
of a death-watch in the wall at the bed's head made Tom
shudder&mdash;it meant that somebody's days were numbered. Then
the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered
by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony.
At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun;
he began to doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven,
but he did not hear it. And then there came, mingling with his
half-formed dreams, a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising
of a neighboring window disturbed him. A cry of "Scat! you
devil!" and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his
aunt's woodshed brought him wide awake, and a single minute later
he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof
of the "ell" on all fours. He "meow'd" with caution once or
twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and
thence to the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead
cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end
of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the
graveyard.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="09-086"></a>
<br><br>

<img alt="09-086.jpg (52K)" src="09-086.jpg" height="548" width="362">

<br><br><br><br>


<p>It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was
on a hill, about a mile and a half from the village. It had a
crazy board fence around it, which leaned inward in places, and
outward the rest of the time, but stood upright nowhere. Grass
and weeds grew rank over the whole cemetery. All the old graves
were sunken in, there was not a tombstone on the place;
round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over the graves,
leaning for support and finding none. "Sacred to the memory of"
So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer
have been read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been
light.</p>

<p>A faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might
be the spirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The
boys talked little, and only under their breath, for the time and
the place and the pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their
spirits. They found the sharp new heap they were seeking, and
ensconced themselves within the protection of three great elms
that grew in a bunch within a few feet of the grave.</p>

<p>Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The
hooting of a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead
stillness. Tom's reflections grew oppressive. He must force some
talk. So he said in a whisper:</p>

<p>"Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be
here?"</p>

<p>Huckleberry whispered:</p>

<p>"I wisht I knowed. It's awful solemn like, AIN'T it?"</p>

<p>"I bet it is."</p>

<p>There was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this
matter inwardly. Then Tom whispered:</p>

<p>"Say, Hucky&mdash;do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us
talking?"</p>

<p>"O' course he does. Least his sperrit does."</p>

<p>Tom, after a pause:</p>

<p>"I wish I'd said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm.
Everybody calls him Hoss."</p>

<p>"A body can't be too partic'lar how they talk 'bout these-yer
dead people, Tom."</p>

<p>This was a damper, and conversation died again.</p>

<p>Presently Tom seized his comrade's arm and said:</p>

<p>"Sh!"</p>

<p>"What is it, Tom?" And the two clung together with beating
hearts.</p>

<p>"Sh! There 'tis again! Didn't you hear it?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There! Now you hear it."</p>

<p>"Lord, Tom, they're coming! They're coming, sure. What'll we
do?"</p>

<p>"I dono. Think they'll see us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I
hadn't come."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be afeard. I don't believe they'll bother us. We
ain't doing any harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they
won't notice us at all."</p>

<p>"I'll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I'm all of a shiver."</p>

<p>"Listen!"</p>

<p>The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A
muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the
graveyard.</p>

<p>"Look! See there!" whispered Tom. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful."</p>

<p>Some vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an
old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with
innumerable little spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry
whispered with a shudder:</p>

<p>"It's the devils sure enough. Three of 'em! Lordy, Tom, we're
goners! Can you pray?"</p>

<p>"I'll try, but don't you be afeard. They ain't going to hurt
us. 'Now I lay me down to sleep, I&mdash;'"</p>

<br><br>

<img alt="09-088.jpg (48K)" src="09-088.jpg" height="494" width="332">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Sh!"</p>

<p>"What is it, Huck?"</p>

<p>"They're HUMANS! One of 'em is, anyway. One of 'em's old Muff
Potter's voice."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;'tain't so, is it?"</p>

<p>"I bet I know it. Don't you stir nor budge. He ain't sharp
enough to notice us. Drunk, the same as usual,
likely&mdash;blamed old rip!"</p>

<p>"All right, I'll keep still. Now they're stuck. Can't find it.
Here they come again. Now they're hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red
hot! They're p'inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another
o' them voices; it's Injun Joe."</p>

<p>"That's so&mdash;that murderin' half-breed! I'd druther they
was devils a dern sight. What kin they be up to?"</p>

<p>The whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had
reached the grave and stood within a few feet of the boys'
hiding-place.</p>

<p>"Here it is," said the third voice; and the owner of it held
the lantern up and revealed the face of young Doctor
Robinson.</p>

<p>Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope
and a couple of shovels on it. They cast down their load and
began to open the grave. The doctor put the lantern at the head
of the grave and came and sat down with his back against one of
the elm trees. He was so close the boys could have touched
him.</p>

<p>"Hurry, men!" he said, in a low voice; "the moon might come
out at any moment."</p>

<p>They growled a response and went on digging. For some time
there was no noise but the grating sound of the spades
discharging their freight of mould and gravel. It was very
monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon the coffin with a dull
woody accent, and within another minute or two the men had
hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with their
shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The
moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.
The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered
with a blanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took
out a large spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope
and then said:</p>

<p>"Now the cussed thing's ready, Sawbones, and you'll just out
with another five, or here she stays."</p>

<p>"That's the talk!" said Injun Joe.</p>

<p>"Look here, what does this mean?" said the doctor. "You
required your pay in advance, and I've paid you."</p>

<p>"Yes, and you done more than that," said Injun Joe,
approaching the doctor, who was now standing. "Five years ago you
drove me away from your father's kitchen one night, when I come
to ask for something to eat, and you said I warn't there for any
good; and when I swore I'd get even with you if it took a hundred
years, your father had me jailed for a vagrant. Did you think I'd
forget? The Injun blood ain't in me for nothing. And now I've GOT
you, and you got to SETTLE, you know!"</p>

<p>He was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by
this time. The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the
ruffian on the ground. Potter dropped his knife, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Here, now, don't you hit my pard!" and the next moment he had
grappled with the doctor and the two were struggling with might
and main, trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their
heels. Injun Joe sprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with
passion, snatched up Potter's knife, and went creeping, catlike
and stooping, round and round about the combatants, seeking an
opportunity. All at once the doctor flung himself free, seized
the heavy headboard of Williams' grave and felled Potter to the
earth with it&mdash;and in the same instant the half-breed saw
his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man's
breast. He reeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with
his blood, and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the
dreadful spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away
in the dark.</p>

<p>Presently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing
over the two forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured
inarticulately, gave a long gasp or two and was still. The
half-breed muttered:</p>

<p>"THAT score is settled&mdash;damn you."</p>

<p>Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in
Potter's open right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin.
Three&mdash;four&mdash; five minutes passed, and then Potter
began to stir and moan. His hand closed upon the knife; he raised
it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a shudder. Then he sat
up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and then around
him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe's.</p>

<p>"Lord, how is this, Joe?" he said.</p>

<p>"It's a dirty business," said Joe, without moving.</p>

<p>"What did you do it for?"</p>

<p>"I! I never done it!"</p>

<p>"Look here! That kind of talk won't wash."</p>

<p>Potter trembled and grew white.</p>

<p>"I thought I'd got sober. I'd no business to drink to-night.
But it's in my head yet&mdash;worse'n when we started here. I'm
all in a muddle; can't recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell
me, Joe&mdash;HONEST, now, old feller&mdash;did I do it? Joe, I
never meant to&mdash;'pon my soul and honor, I never meant to,
Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it's awful&mdash;and him so
young and promising."</p>

<p>"Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the
headboard and you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling
and staggering like, and snatched the knife and jammed it into
him, just as he fetched you another awful clip&mdash;and here
you've laid, as dead as a wedge til now."</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Oh, I didn't know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this
minute if I did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the
excitement, I reckon. I never used a weepon in my life before,
Joe. I've fought, but never with weepons. They'll all say that.
Joe, don't tell! Say you won't tell, Joe&mdash;that's a good
feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you, too. Don't
you remember? You WON'T tell, WILL you, Joe?" And the poor
creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and
clasped his appealing hands.</p>

<p>"No, you've always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter,
and I won't go back on you. There, now, that's as fair as a man
can say."</p>

<p>"Oh, Joe, you're an angel. I'll bless you for this the longest
day I live." And Potter began to cry.</p>

<p>"Come, now, that's enough of that. This ain't any time for
blubbering. You be off yonder way and I'll go this. Move, now,
and don't leave any tracks behind you."</p>

<p>Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The
half-breed stood looking after him. He muttered:</p>

<p>"If he's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the
rum as he had the look of being, he won't think of the knife till
he's gone so far he'll be afraid to come back after it to such a
place by himself&mdash; chicken-heart!"</p>

<p>Two or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed
corpse, the lidless coffin, and the open grave were under no
inspection but the moon's. The stillness was complete again,
too.</p>

<p>THE two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless
with horror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time
to time, apprehensively, as if they feared they might be
followed. Every stump that started up in their path seemed a man
and an enemy, and made them catch their breath; and as they sped
by some outlying cottages that lay near the village, the barking
of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give wings to their feet.</p>

<p>"If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!"
whispered Tom, in short catches between breaths. "I can't stand
it much longer."</p>

<p>Huckleberry's hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys
fixed their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their
work to win it. They gained steadily on it, and at last, breast
to breast, they burst through the open door and fell grateful and
exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond. By and by their
pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:</p>

<p>"Huckleberry, what do you reckon'll come of this?"</p>

<p>"If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging'll come of it."</p>

<p>"Do you though?"</p>

<p>"Why, I KNOW it, Tom."</p>

<p>Tom thought a while, then he said:</p>

<p>"Who'll tell? We?"</p>

<p>"What are you talking about? S'pose something happened and
Injun Joe DIDN'T hang? Why, he'd kill us some time or other, just
as dead sure as we're a laying here."</p>

<p>"That's just what I was thinking to myself, Huck."</p>

<p>"If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he's fool enough.
He's generally drunk enough."</p>

<p>Tom said nothing&mdash;went on thinking. Presently he
whispered:</p>

<p>"Huck, Muff Potter don't know it. How can he tell?"</p>

<p>"What's the reason he don't know it?"</p>

<p>"Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it.
D'you reckon he could see anything? D'you reckon he knowed
anything?"</p>

<p>"By hokey, that's so, Tom!"</p>

<p>"And besides, look-a-here&mdash;maybe that whack done for
HIM!"</p>

<p>"No, 'taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see
that; and besides, he always has. Well, when pap's full, you
might take and belt him over the head with a church and you
couldn't phase him. He says so, his own self. So it's the same
with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man was dead sober, I
reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono."</p>

<p>After another reflective silence, Tom said:</p>

<p>"Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?"</p>

<p>"Tom, we GOT to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil
wouldn't make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if
we was to squeak 'bout this and they didn't hang him. Now,
look-a-here, Tom, less take and swear to one another&mdash;that's
what we got to do&mdash;swear to keep mum."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="10-095"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="10-095.jpg (149K)" src="10-095.jpg" height="1030" width="795">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"I'm agreed. It's the best thing. Would you just hold hands
and swear that we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no, that wouldn't do for this. That's good enough for
little rubbishy common things&mdash;specially with gals, cuz THEY
go back on you anyway, and blab if they get in a huff&mdash;but
there orter be writing 'bout a big thing like this. And
blood."</p>

<p>Tom's whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark,
and awful; the hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were
in keeping with it. He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in
the moon-light, took a little fragment of "red keel" out of his
pocket, got the moon on his work, and painfully scrawled these
lines, emphasizing each slow down-stroke by clamping his tongue
between his teeth, and letting up the pressure on the up-strokes.
[See next page.]</p>

<p>"Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This
and They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They
ever Tell and Rot."</p>

<p>Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom's facility in
writing, and the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin
from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh, but Tom
said:</p>

<p>"Hold on! Don't do that. A pin's brass. It might have
verdigrease on it."</p>

<p>"What's verdigrease?"</p>

<p>"It's p'ison. That's what it is. You just swaller some of it
once&mdash; you'll see."</p>

<p>So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each
boy pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of
blood. In time, after many squeezes, Tom managed to sign his
initials, using the ball of his little finger for a pen. Then he
showed Huckleberry how to make an H and an F, and the oath was
complete. They buried the shingle close to the wall, with some
dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters that bound
their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown
away.</p>

<p>A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of
the ruined building, now, but they did not notice it.</p>

<p>"Tom," whispered Huckleberry, "does this keep us from EVER
telling&mdash; ALWAYS?"</p>

<p>"Of course it does. It don't make any difference WHAT happens,
we got to keep mum. We'd drop down dead&mdash;don't YOU know
that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon that's so."</p>

<p>They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a
dog set up a long, lugubrious howl just outside&mdash;within ten
feet of them. The boys clasped each other suddenly, in an agony
of fright.</p>

<p>"Which of us does he mean?" gasped Huckleberry.</p>

<p>"I dono&mdash;peep through the crack. Quick!"</p>

<p>"No, YOU, Tom!"</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;I can't DO it, Huck!"</p>

<p>"Please, Tom. There 'tis again!"</p>

<p>"Oh, lordy, I'm thankful!" whispered Tom. "I know his voice.
It's Bull Harbison." *</p>

<p>[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have
spoken of him as "Harbison's Bull," but a son or a dog of that
name was "Bull Harbison."]</p>

<p>"Oh, that's good&mdash;I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to
death; I'd a bet anything it was a STRAY dog."</p>

<p>The dog howled again. The boys' hearts sank once more.</p>

<p>"Oh, my! that ain't no Bull Harbison!" whispered Huckleberry.
"DO, Tom!"</p>

<p>Tom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack.
His whisper was hardly audible when he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, Huck, IT S A STRAY DOG!"</p>

<p>"Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?"</p>

<p>"Huck, he must mean us both&mdash;we're right together."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, I reckon we're goners. I reckon there ain't no
mistake 'bout where I'LL go to. I been so wicked."</p>

<p>"Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing
everything a feller's told NOT to do. I might a been good, like
Sid, if I'd a tried &mdash;but no, I wouldn't, of course. But if
ever I get off this time, I lay I'll just WALLER in
Sunday-schools!" And Tom began to snuffle a little.</p>

<p>"YOU bad!" and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. "Consound it,
Tom Sawyer, you're just old pie, 'long-side o' what I am. Oh,
LORDY, lordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance."</p>

<p>Tom choked off and whispered:</p>

<p>"Look, Hucky, look! He's got his BACK to us!"</p>

<p>Hucky looked, with joy in his heart.</p>

<p>"Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is
bully, you know. NOW who can he mean?"</p>

<p>The howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.</p>

<p>"Sh! What's that?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"Sounds like&mdash;like hogs grunting. No&mdash;it's somebody
snoring, Tom."</p>

<p>"That IS it! Where 'bouts is it, Huck?"</p>

<p>"I bleeve it's down at 'tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap
used to sleep there, sometimes, 'long with the hogs, but laws
bless you, he just lifts things when HE snores. Besides, I reckon
he ain't ever coming back to this town any more."</p>

<p>The spirit of adventure rose in the boys' souls once more.</p>

<p>"Hucky, do you das't to go if I lead?"</p>

<p>"I don't like to, much. Tom, s'pose it's Injun Joe!"</p>

<br><br>
<a name="10-098"></a>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Tom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again
and the boys agreed to try, with the understanding that they
would take to their heels if the snoring stopped. So they went
tiptoeing stealthily down, the one behind the other. When they
had got to within five steps of the snorer, Tom stepped on a
stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man moaned, writhed a
little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was Muff Potter.
The boys' hearts had stood still, and their hopes too, when the
man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tip-toed out,
through the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little
distance to exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl
rose on the night air again! They turned and saw the strange dog
standing within a few feet of where Potter was lying, and FACING
Potter, with his nose pointing heavenward.</p>

<p>"Oh, geeminy, it's HIM!" exclaimed both boys, in a breath.</p>

<p>"Say, Tom&mdash;they say a stray dog come howling around
Johnny Miller's house, 'bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago;
and a whippoorwill come in and lit on the banisters and sung, the
very same evening; and there ain't anybody dead there yet."</p>

<p>"Well, I know that. And suppose there ain't. Didn't Gracie
Miller fall in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the
very next Saturday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but she ain't DEAD. And what's more, she's getting
better, too."</p>

<p>"All right, you wait and see. She's a goner, just as dead sure
as Muff Potter's a goner. That's what the niggers say, and they
know all about these kind of things, Huck."</p>

<p>Then they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his
bedroom window the night was almost spent. He undressed with
excessive caution, and fell asleep congratulating himself that
nobody knew of his escapade. He was not aware that the
gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for an hour.</p>

<p>When Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late
look in the light, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was
startled. Why had he not been called&mdash;persecuted till he was
up, as usual? The thought filled him with bodings. Within five
minutes he was dressed and down-stairs, feeling sore and drowsy.
The family were still at table, but they had finished breakfast.
There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted eyes; there
was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill to the
culprit's heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it was
up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed
into silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.</p>

<p>After breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost
brightened in the hope that he was going to be flogged; but it
was not so. His aunt wept over him and asked him how he could go
and break her old heart so; and finally told him to go on, and
ruin himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave,
for it was no use for her to try any more. This was worse than a
thousand whippings, and Tom's heart was sorer now than his body.
He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform over and
over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that he had
won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble
confidence.</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful
toward Sid; and so the latter's prompt retreat through the back
gate was unnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took
his flogging, along with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day
before, with the air of one whose heart was busy with heavier
woes and wholly dead to trifles. Then he betook himself to his
seat, rested his elbows on his desk and his jaws in his hands,
and stared at the wall with the stony stare of suffering that has
reached the limit and can no further go. His elbow was pressing
against some hard substance. After a long time he slowly and
sadly changed his position, and took up this object with a sigh.
It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal
sigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron
knob!</p>

<p>This final feather broke the camel's back.</p>

<p>CLOSE upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly
electrified with the ghastly news. No need of the as yet
un-dreamed-of telegraph; the tale flew from man to man, from
group to group, from house to house, with little less than
telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave holi-day for
that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of him if
he had not.</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it
had been recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff
Potter&mdash;so the story ran. And it was said that a belated
citizen had come upon Potter washing himself in the "branch"
about one or two o'clock in the morning, and that Potter had at
once sneaked off&mdash;suspicious circumstances, especially the
washing which was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that
the town had been ransacked for this "murderer" (the public are
not slow in the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a
verdict), but that he could not be found. Horsemen had departed
down all the roads in every direction, and the Sheriff "was
confident" that he would be captured before night.</p>

<p>All the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom's
heartbreak vanished and he joined the procession, not because he
would not a thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because
an awful, unaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the
dreadful place, he wormed his small body through the crowd and
saw the dismal spectacle. It seemed to him an age since he was
there before. Somebody pinched his arm. He turned, and his eyes
met Huckleberry's. Then both looked elsewhere at once, and
wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their mutual glance.
But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly spectacle
before them.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!" "Poor young fellow!" "This ought to be a lesson
to grave robbers!" "Muff Potter'll hang for this if they catch
him!" This was the drift of remark; and the minister said, "It
was a judgment; His hand is here."</p>

<p>Now Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the
stolid face of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway
and struggle, and voices shouted, "It's him! it's him! he's
coming himself!"</p>

<p>"Who? Who?" from twenty voices.</p>

<p>"Muff Potter!"</p>

<p>"Hallo, he's stopped!&mdash;Look out, he's turning! Don't let
him get away!"</p>

<p>People in the branches of the trees over Tom's head said he
wasn't trying to get away&mdash;he only looked doubtful and
perplexed.</p>

<p>"Infernal impudence!" said a bystander; "wanted to come and
take a quiet look at his work, I reckon&mdash;didn't expect any
company."</p>

<p>The crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through,
ostentatiously leading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow's face
was haggard, and his eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When
he stood before the murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and
he put his face in his hands and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"I didn't do it, friends," he sobbed; "'pon my word and honor
I never done it."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="11-103"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="11-103.jpg (112K)" src="11-103.jpg" height="512" width="674">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Who's accused you?" shouted a voice.</p>

<p>This shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and
looked around him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He
saw Injun Joe, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you'd never&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that your knife?" and it was thrust before him by the
Sheriff.</p>

<p>Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased
him to the ground. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Something told me 't if I didn't come back and get&mdash;" He
shuddered; then waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished
gesture and said, "Tell 'em, Joe, tell 'em&mdash;it ain't any use
any more."</p>

<p>Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard
the stony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they
expecting every moment that the clear sky would deliver God's
lightnings upon his head, and wondering to see how long the
stroke was delayed. And when he had finished and still stood
alive and whole, their wavering impulse to break their oath and
save the poor betrayed prisoner's life faded and vanished away,
for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and it would
be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you leave? What did you want to come here for?"
somebody said.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help it&mdash;I couldn't help it," Potter moaned.
"I wanted to run away, but I couldn't seem to come anywhere but
here." And he fell to sobbing again.</p>

<p>Injun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few
minutes afterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys,
seeing that the lightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in
their belief that Joe had sold himself to the devil. He was now
become, to them, the most balefully interesting object they had
ever looked upon, and they could not take their fascinated eyes
from his face.</p>

<p>They inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity
should offer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread
master.</p>

<p>Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put
it in a wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the
shuddering crowd that the wound bled a little! The boys thought
that this happy circumstance would turn suspicion in the right
direction; but they were disappointed, for more than one villager
remarked:</p>

<p>"It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it."</p>

<p>Tom's fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his
sleep for as much as a week after this; and at breakfast one
morning Sid said:</p>

<p>"Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you
keep me awake half the time."</p>

<p>Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.</p>

<p>"It's a bad sign," said Aunt Polly, gravely. "What you got on
your mind, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Nothing 't I know of." But the boy's hand shook so
that he spilled his coffee.</p>

<p>"And you do talk such stuff," Sid said. "Last night you said,
'It's blood, it's blood, that's what it is!' You said that over
and over. And you said, 'Don't torment me so&mdash;I'll tell!'
Tell WHAT? What is it you'll tell?"</p>

<p>Everything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what
might have happened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of
Aunt Polly's face and she came to Tom's relief without knowing
it. She said:</p>

<p>"Sho! It's that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every
night myself. Sometimes I dream it's me that done it."</p>

<p>Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed
satisfied. Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly
could, and after that he complained of toothache for a week, and
tied up his jaws every night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly
watching, and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned
on his elbow listening a good while at a time, and afterward
slipped the bandage back to its place again. Tom's distress of
mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew irksome and was
discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of Tom's
disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.</p>

<p>It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done
holding inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble
present to his mind. Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at
one of these inquiries, though it had been his habit to take the
lead in all new enterprises; he noticed, too, that Tom never
acted as a witness&mdash;and that was strange; and Sid did not
overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion to these
inquests, and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled,
but said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue at
last, and ceased to torture Tom's conscience.</p>

<p>Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his
opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and
smuggled such small comforts through to the "murderer" as he
could get hold of. The jail was a trifling little brick den that
stood in a marsh at the edge of the village, and no guards were
afforded for it; indeed, it was seldom occupied. These offerings
greatly helped to ease Tom's conscience.</p>

<p>The villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe
and ride him on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was
his character that nobody could be found who was willing to take
the lead in the matter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to
begin both of his inquest-statements with the fight, without
confessing the grave-robbery that preceded it; therefore it was
deemed wisest not to try the case in the courts at present.</p>

<p>ONE of the reasons why Tom's mind had drifted away from its
secret troubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter
to interest itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to
school. Tom had struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to
"whistle her down the wind," but failed. He began to find himself
hanging around her father's house, nights, and feeling very
miserable. She was ill. What if she should die! There was
distraction in the thought. He no longer took an interest in
war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there was
nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;
there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She
began to try all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those
people who are infatuated with patent medicines and all
new-fangled methods of producing health or mending it. She was an
inveterate experimenter in these things. When something fresh in
this line came out she was in a fever, right away, to try it; not
on herself, for she was never ailing, but on anybody else that
came handy. She was a subscriber for all the "Health" periodicals
and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance they were
inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the "rot" they
contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get
up, and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to
take, and what frame of mind to keep one's self in, and what sort
of clothing to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never
observed that her health-journals of the current month
customarily upset everything they had recommended the month
before. She was as simple-hearted and honest as the day was long,
and so she was an easy victim. She gathered together her quack
periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed with death,
went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with "hell
following after." But she never suspected that she was not an
angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the
suffering neighbors.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>The water treatment was new, now, and Tom's low condition was
a windfall to her. She had him out at daylight every morning,
stood him up in the wood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of
cold water; then she scrubbed him down with a towel like a file,
and so brought him to; then she rolled him up in a wet sheet and
put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul clean and
"the yellow stains of it came through his pores"&mdash;as Tom
said.</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more
melancholy and pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz
baths, shower baths, and plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a
hearse. She began to assist the water with a slim oatmeal diet
and blister-plasters. She calculated his capacity as she would a
jug's, and filled him up every day with quack cure-alls.</p>

<p>Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This
phase filled the old lady's heart with consternation. This
indifference must be broken up at any cost. Now she heard of
Pain-killer for the first time. She ordered a lot at once. She
tasted it and was filled with gratitude. It was simply fire in a
liquid form. She dropped the water treatment and everything else,
and pinned her faith to Pain-killer. She gave Tom a teaspoonful
and watched with the deepest anxiety for the result. Her troubles
were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again; for the
"indifference" was broken up. The boy could not have shown a
wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.</p>

<p>Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might
be romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was
getting to have too little sentiment and too much distracting
variety about it. So he thought over various plans for relief,
and finally hit upon that of professing to be fond of Pain-killer.
He asked for it so often that he became a nuisance, and his aunt
ended by telling him to help himself and quit bothering her. If
it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings to alloy her
delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle
clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish,
but it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health
of a crack in the sitting-room floor with it.</p>

<p>One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt's
yellow cat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously,
and begging for a taste. Tom said:</p>

<p>"Don't ask for it unless you want it, Peter."</p>

<p>But Peter signified that he did want it.</p>

<p>"You better make sure."</p>

<p>Peter was sure.</p>

<p>"Now you've asked for it, and I'll give it to you, because
there ain't anything mean about me; but if you find you don't
like it, you mustn't blame anybody but your own self."</p>

<p>Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured
down the Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air,
and then delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the
room, banging against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and
making general havoc. Next he rose on his hind feet and pranced
around, in a frenzy of enjoyment, with his head over his shoulder
and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness. Then he
went tearing around the house again spreading chaos and
destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time to see him
throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah, and
sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the
flower-pots with him. The old lady stood petrified with
astonishment, peering over her glasses; Tom lay on the floor
expiring with laughter.</p>

<p>"Tom, what on earth ails that cat?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, aunt," gasped the boy.</p>

<p>"Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act
so?"</p>

<p>"Deed I don't know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when
they're having a good time."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="12-110"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="12-110.jpg (106K)" src="12-110.jpg" height="501" width="680">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"They do, do they?" There was something in the tone that made
Tom apprehensive.</p>

<p>"Yes'm. That is, I believe they do."</p>

<p>"You DO?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>The old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest
emphasized by anxiety. Too late he divined her "drift." The
handle of the telltale tea-spoon was visible under the
bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it up. Tom winced, and
dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual
handle&mdash;his ear&mdash;and cracked his head soundly with her
thimble.</p>

<p>"Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so,
for?"</p>

<p>"I done it out of pity for him&mdash;because he hadn't any
aunt."</p>

<p>"Hadn't any aunt!&mdash;you numskull. What has that got to do
with it?"</p>

<p>"Heaps. Because if he'd had one she'd a burnt him out herself!
She'd a roasted his bowels out of him 'thout any more feeling
than if he was a human!"</p>

<p>Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the
thing in a new light; what was cruelty to a cat MIGHT be cruelty
to a boy, too. She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes
watered a little, and she put her hand on Tom's head and said
gently:</p>

<p>"I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it DID do you
good."</p>

<p>Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle
peeping through his gravity.</p>

<p>"I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with
Peter. It done HIM good, too. I never see him get around so
since&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, go 'long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again.
And you try and see if you can't be a good boy, for once, and you
needn't take any more medicine."</p>

<p>Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this
strange thing had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as
usual of late, he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead
of playing with his comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked
it. He tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he
really was looking&mdash;down the road. Presently Jeff Thatcher
hove in sight, and Tom's face lighted; he gazed a moment, and
then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom accosted
him; and "led up" warily to opportunities for remark about Becky,
but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and
watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and
hating the owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right
one. At last frocks ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly
into the dumps; he entered the empty schoolhouse and sat down to
suffer. Then one more frock passed in at the gate, and Tom's
heart gave a great bound. The next instant he was out, and "going
on" like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys, jumping over
the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings,
standing on his head&mdash;doing all the heroic things he could
conceive of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see
if Becky Thatcher was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious
of it all; she never looked. Could it be possible that she was
not aware that he was there? He carried his exploits to her
immediate vicinity; came war-whooping around, snatched a boy's
cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse, broke through a
group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and fell
sprawling, himself, under Becky's nose, almost upsetting
her&mdash;and she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard
her say: "Mf! some people think they're mighty smart&mdash;always
showing off!"</p>

<p>Tom's cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off,
crushed and crestfallen.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
