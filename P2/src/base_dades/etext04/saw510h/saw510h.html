<p>THAT was Tom's great secret&mdash;the scheme to return home
with his brother pirates and attend their own funerals. They had
paddled over to the Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday,
landing five or six miles below the village; they had slept in
the woods at the edge of the town till nearly daylight, and had
then crept through back lanes and alleys and finished their sleep
in the gallery of the church among a chaos of invalided
benches.</p>

<p>At breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very
loving to Tom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an
unusual amount of talk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:</p>

<p>"Well, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep
everybody suffering 'most a week so you boys had a good time, but
it is a pity you could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so.
If you could come over on a log to go to your funeral, you could
have come over and give me a hint some way that you warn't dead,
but only run off."</p>

<p>"Yes, you could have done that, Tom," said Mary; "and I
believe you would if you had thought of it."</p>

<p>"Would you, Tom?" said Aunt Polly, her face lighting
wistfully. "Say, now, would you, if you'd thought of it?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;well, I don't know. 'Twould 'a' spoiled
everything."</p>

<p>"Tom, I hoped you loved me that much," said Aunt Polly, with a
grieved tone that discomforted the boy. "It would have been
something if you'd cared enough to THINK of it, even if you
didn't DO it."</p>

<p>"Now, auntie, that ain't any harm," pleaded Mary; "it's only
Tom's giddy way&mdash;he is always in such a rush that he never
thinks of anything."</p>

<p>"More's the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have
come and DONE it, too. Tom, you'll look back, some day, when it's
too late, and wish you'd cared a little more for me when it would
have cost you so little."</p>

<p>"Now, auntie, you know I do care for you," said Tom.</p>

<p>"I'd know it better if you acted more like it."</p>

<p>"I wish now I'd thought," said Tom, with a repentant tone;
"but I dreamt about you, anyway. That's something, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"It ain't much&mdash;a cat does that much&mdash;but it's
better than nothing. What did you dream?"</p>

<p>"Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there
by the bed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to
him."</p>

<p>"Well, so we did. So we always do. I'm glad your dreams could
take even that much trouble about us."</p>

<p>"And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here."</p>

<p>"Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?"</p>

<p>"Oh, lots. But it's so dim, now."</p>

<p>"Well, try to recollect&mdash;can't you?"</p>

<p>"Somehow it seems to me that the wind&mdash;the wind blowed
the&mdash;the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!"</p>

<p>Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and
then said:</p>

<p>"I've got it now! I've got it now! It blowed the candle!"</p>

<p>"Mercy on us! Go on, Tom&mdash;go on!"</p>

<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>"And it seems to me that you said, 'Why, I believe that that
door&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Go ON, Tom!"</p>

<p>"Just let me study a moment&mdash;just a moment. Oh,
yes&mdash;you said you believed the door was open."</p>

<p>"As I'm sitting here, I did! Didn't I, Mary! Go on!"</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;and then&mdash;well I won't be certain, but it
seems like as if you made Sid go and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him
do?"</p>

<p>"You made him&mdash;you&mdash;Oh, you made him shut it."</p>

<p>"Well, for the land's sake! I never heard the beat of that in
all my days! Don't tell ME there ain't anything in dreams, any
more. Sereny Harper shall know of this before I'm an hour older.
I'd like to see her get around THIS with her rubbage 'bout
superstition. Go on, Tom!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you
said I warn't BAD, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any
more responsible than&mdash;than&mdash;I think it was a colt, or
something."</p>

<p>"And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!"</p>

<p>"And then you began to cry."</p>

<p>"So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the
same, and she wished she hadn't whipped him for taking cream when
she'd throwed it out her own self&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a
prophesying&mdash;that's what you was doing! Land alive, go on,
Tom!"</p>

<p>"Then Sid he said&mdash;he said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think I said anything," said Sid.</p>

<p>"Yes you did, Sid," said Mary.</p>

<p>"Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?"</p>

<p>"He said&mdash;I THINK he said he hoped I was better off where
I was gone to, but if I'd been better sometimes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"THERE, d'you hear that! It was his very words!"</p>

<p>"And you shut him up sharp."</p>

<p>"I lay I did! There must 'a' been an angel there. There WAS an
angel there, somewheres!"</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a
firecracker, and you told about Peter and the
Pain-killer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just as true as I live!"</p>

<p>"And then there was a whole lot of talk 'bout dragging the
river for us, and 'bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you
and old Miss Harper hugged and cried, and she went."</p>

<p>"It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I'm
a-sitting in these very tracks. Tom, you couldn't told it more
like if you'd 'a' seen it! And then what? Go on, Tom!"</p>

<p>"Then I thought you prayed for me&mdash;and I could see you
and hear every word you said. And you went to bed, and I was so
sorry that I took and wrote on a piece of sycamore bark, 'We
ain't dead&mdash;we are only off being pirates,' and put it on
the table by the candle; and then you looked so good, laying
there asleep, that I thought I went and leaned over and kissed
you on the lips."</p>

<p>"Did you, Tom, DID you! I just forgive you everything for
that!" And she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him
feel like the guiltiest of villains.</p>

<p>"It was very kind, even though it was only a&mdash;dream," Sid
soliloquized just audibly.</p>

<p>"Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he'd do
if he was awake. Here's a big Milum apple I've been saving for
you, Tom, if you was ever found again&mdash;now go 'long to
school. I'm thankful to the good God and Father of us all I've
got you back, that's long-suffering and merciful to them that
believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness knows I'm
unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings and
had His hand to help them over the rough places, there's few
enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long
night comes. Go 'long Sid, Mary, Tom&mdash;take yourselves
off&mdash;you've hendered me long enough."</p>

<p>The children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs.
Harper and vanquish her realism with Tom's marvellous dream. Sid
had better judgment than to utter the thought that was in his
mind as he left the house. It was this: "Pretty thin&mdash;as
long a dream as that, without any mistakes in it!"</p>

<p>What a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and
prancing, but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate
who felt that the public eye was on him. And indeed it was; he
tried not to seem to see the looks or hear the remarks as he
passed along, but they were food and drink to him. Smaller boys
than himself flocked at his heels, as proud to be seen with him,
and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer at the head
of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into town.
Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at
all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would
have given anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of his,
and his glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with
either for a circus.</p>

<br><br><br><br> 

<p>At school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and
delivered such eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two
heroes were not long in becoming insufferably "stuck-up." They
began to tell their adventures to hungry listeners&mdash;but
they only began; it was not a thing likely to have an end, with
imaginations like theirs to furnish material. And finally, when
they got out their pipes and went serenely puffing around, the
very summit of glory was reached.</p>

<p>Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher
now. Glory was sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he
was distinguished, maybe she would be wanting to "make up." Well,
let her&mdash;she should see that he could be as indifferent as
some other people. Presently she arrived. Tom pretended not to
see her. He moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and
began to talk. Soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back
and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes, pretending to be
busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter when she
made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her captures
in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious
eye in his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the
vicious vanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning him,
it only "set him up" the more and made him the more diligent to
avoid betraying that he knew she was about. Presently she gave
over skylarking, and moved irresolutely about, sighing once or
twice and glancing furtively and wistfully toward Tom. Then she
observed that now Tom was talking more particularly to Amy
Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang and grew
disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her feet
were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said
to a girl almost at Tom's elbow&mdash;with sham vivacity:</p>

<p>"Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn't you come to
Sunday-school?"</p>

<p>"I did come&mdash;didn't you see me?"</p>

<p>"Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?"</p>

<p>"I was in Miss Peters' class, where I always go. I saw
YOU."</p>

<p>"Did you? Why, it's funny I didn't see you. I wanted to tell
you about the picnic."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's jolly. Who's going to give it?"</p>

<p>"My ma's going to let me have one."</p>

<p>"Oh, goody; I hope she'll let ME come."</p>

<p>"Well, she will. The picnic's for me. She'll let anybody come
that I want, and I want you."</p>

<p>"That's ever so nice. When is it going to be?"</p>

<p>"By and by. Maybe about vacation."</p>

<p>"Oh, won't it be fun! You going to have all the girls and
boys?"</p>

<p>"Yes, every one that's friends to me&mdash;or wants to be";
and she glanced ever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right
along to Amy Lawrence about the terrible storm on the island, and
how the lightning tore the great sycamore tree "all to flinders"
while he was "standing within three feet of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, may I come?" said Grace Miller.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And me?" said Sally Rogers.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And me, too?" said Susy Harper. "And Joe?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group
had begged for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned
coolly away, still talking, and took Amy with him. Becky's lips
trembled and the tears came to her eyes; she hid these signs with
a forced gayety and went on chattering, but the life had gone out
of the picnic, now, and out of everything else; she got away as
soon as she could and hid herself and had what her sex call "a
good cry." Then she sat moody, with wounded pride, till the bell
rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast in her eye, and
gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what SHE'D
do.</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant
self-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and
lacerate her with the performance. At last he spied her, but
there was a sudden falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily
on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a
picture-book with Alfred Temple&mdash;and so absorbed were they,
and their heads so close together over the book, that they did
not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.
Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom's veins. He began to hate
himself for throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a
reconciliation. He called himself a fool, and all the hard names
he could think of. He wanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted
happily along, as they walked, for her heart was singing, but
Tom's tongue had lost its function. He did not hear what Amy was
saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer
an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as otherwise. He
kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and again,
to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could
not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw,
that Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the
land of the living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew
she was winning her fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as
she had suffered.</p>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="18-155.jpg (57K)" src="18-155.jpg" height="523" width="369">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>Amy's happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things
he had to attend to; things that must be done; and time was
fleeting. But in vain &mdash;the girl chirped on. Tom thought,
"Oh, hang her, ain't I ever going to get rid of her?" At last he
must be attending to those things&mdash;and she said artlessly
that she would be "around" when school let out. And he hastened
away, hating her for it.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="18-156"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="18-156.jpg (47K)" src="18-156.jpg" height="510" width="373">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>"Any other boy!" Tom thought, grating his teeth. "Any boy in
the whole town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses
so fine and is aristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first
day you ever saw this town, mister, and I'll lick you again! You
just wait till I catch you out! I'll just take and&mdash;"</p>

<p>And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary
boy&mdash; pummelling the air, and kicking and gouging. "Oh, you
do, do you? You holler 'nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn
you!" And so the imaginary flogging was finished to his
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any
more of Amy's grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no
more of the other distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections
with Alfred, but as the minutes dragged along and no Tom came to
suffer, her triumph began to cloud and she lost interest;
gravity and absentmindedness followed, and then melancholy; two
or three times she pricked up her ear at a footstep, but it was a
false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew entirely miserable and
wished she hadn't carried it so far. When poor Alfred, seeing
that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept exclaiming:
"Oh, here's a jolly one! look at this!" she lost patience at
last, and said, "Oh, don't bother me! I don't care for them!" and
burst into tears, and got up and walked away.</p>

<p>Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her,
but she said:</p>

<p>"Go away and leave me alone, can't you! I hate you!"</p>

<p>So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done&mdash;for
she had said she would look at pictures all through the
nooning&mdash;and she walked on, crying. Then Alfred went musing
into the deserted schoolhouse. He was humiliated and angry. He
easily guessed his way to the truth&mdash;the girl had simply
made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer. He
was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to
him. He wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble
without much risk to himself. Tom's spelling-book fell under his
eye. Here was his opportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson
for the afternoon and poured ink upon the page.</p>

<br><br><br><br> 

<p>Becky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw
the act, and moved on, without discovering herself. She started
homeward, now, intending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be
thankful and their troubles would be healed. Before she was half
way home, however, she had changed her mind. The thought of Tom's
treatment of her when she was talking about her picnic came
scorching back and filled her with shame. She resolved to let him
get whipped on the damaged spelling-book's account, and to hate
him forever, into the bargain.</p>

<p>TOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his
aunt said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an
unpromising market:</p>

<p>"Tom, I've a notion to skin you alive!"</p>

<p>"Auntie, what have I done?"</p>

<p>"Well, you've done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper,
like an old softy, expecting I'm going to make her believe all
that rubbage about that dream, when lo and behold you she'd found
out from Joe that you was over here and heard all the talk we had
that night. Tom, I don't know what is to become of a boy that
will act like that. It makes me feel so bad to think you could
let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and
never say a word."</p>

<p>This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the
morning had seemed to Tom a good joke before, and very
ingenious. It merely looked mean and shabby now. He hung his head
and could not think of anything to say for a moment. Then he
said:</p>

<p>"Auntie, I wish I hadn't done it&mdash;but I didn't
think."</p>

<p>"Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but
your own selfishness. You could think to come all the way over
here from Jackson's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles,
and you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you
couldn't ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow."</p>

<p>"Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn't mean to be mean.
I didn't, honest. And besides, I didn't come over here to laugh
at you that night."</p>

<p>"What did you come for, then?"</p>

<p>"It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we
hadn't got drownded."</p>

<p>"Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I
could believe you ever had as good a thought as that, but you
know you never did&mdash;and I know it, Tom."</p>

<p>"Indeed and 'deed I did, auntie&mdash;I wish I may never stir
if I didn't."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, don't lie&mdash;don't do it. It only makes things a
hundred times worse."</p>

<p>"It ain't a lie, auntie; it's the truth. I wanted to keep you
from grieving&mdash;that was all that made me come."</p>

<p>"I'd give the whole world to believe that&mdash;it would cover
up a power of sins, Tom. I'd 'most be glad you'd run off and
acted so bad. But it ain't reasonable; because, why didn't you
tell me, child?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I
just got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the
church, and I couldn't somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put
the bark back in my pocket and kept mum."</p>

<p>"What bark?"</p>

<p>"The bark I had wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirating. I
wish, now, you'd waked up when I kissed you&mdash;I do,
honest."</p>

<p>The hard lines in his aunt's face relaxed and a sudden
tenderness dawned in her eyes.</p>

<p>"DID you kiss me, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I did."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you did, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I did, auntie&mdash;certain sure."</p>

<p>"What did you kiss me for, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was
so sorry."</p>

<p>The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a
tremor in her voice when she said:</p>

<p>"Kiss me again, Tom!&mdash;and be off with you to school, now,
and don't bother me any more."</p>

<p>The moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the
ruin of a jacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she
stopped, with it in her hand, and said to herself:</p>

<p>"No, I don't dare. Poor boy, I reckon he's lied about
it&mdash;but it's a blessed, blessed lie, there's such a comfort
come from it. I hope the Lord&mdash;I KNOW the Lord will forgive
him, because it was such good-heartedness in him to tell it. But
I don't want to find out it's a lie. I won't look."</p>

<p>She put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice
she put out her hand to take the garment again, and twice she
refrained. Once more she ventured, and this time she fortified
herself with the thought: "It's a good lie&mdash;it's a good
lie&mdash;I won't let it grieve me." So she sought the jacket
pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom's piece of bark
through flowing tears and saying: "I could forgive the boy, now,
if he'd committed a million sins!"</p>

<p>THERE was something about Aunt Polly's manner, when she kissed
Tom, that swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted
and happy again. He started to school and had the luck of coming
upon Becky Thatcher at the head of Meadow Lane. His mood always
determined his manner. Without a moment's hesitation he ran to
her and said:</p>

<p>"I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I'm so sorry. I won't
ever, ever do that way again, as long as ever I live&mdash;please
make up, won't you?"</p>

<p>The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:</p>

<p>"I'll thank you to keep yourself TO yourself, Mr. Thomas
Sawyer. I'll never speak to you again."</p>

<p>She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he
had not even presence of mind enough to say "Who cares, Miss
Smarty?" until the right time to say it had gone by. So he said
nothing. But he was in a fine rage, nevertheless. He moped into
the schoolyard wishing she were a boy, and imagining how he would
trounce her if she were. He presently encountered her and
delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled one in
return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in
her hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to
"take in," she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the
injured spelling-book. If she had had any lingering notion of
exposing Alfred Temple, Tom's offensive fling had driven it
entirely away.</p>

<p>Poor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble
herself. The master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an
unsatisfied ambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a
doctor, but poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher
than a village schoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book
out of his desk and absorbed himself in it at times when no
classes were reciting. He kept that book under lock and key.
There was not an urchin in school but was perishing to have a
glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy and girl had
a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories were
alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.
Now, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door,
she noticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious
moment. She glanced around; found herself alone, and the next
instant she had the book in her hands. The
titlepage&mdash;Professor Somebody's ANATOMY&mdash; carried no
information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She
came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored
frontispiece&mdash;a human figure, stark naked. At that moment a
shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the door and
caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky snatched at the book to
close it, and had the hard luck to tear the pictured page half
down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk, turned the
key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.</p>

<p>"Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up
on a person and look at what they're looking at."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="20-163"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="20-163.jpg (54K)" src="20-163.jpg" height="490" width="361">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>"How could I know you was looking at anything?"</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know
you're going to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I
do! I'll be whipped, and I never was whipped in school."</p>

<p>Then she stamped her little foot and said:</p>

<p>"BE so mean if you want to! I know something that's going to
happen. You just wait and you'll see! Hateful, hateful,
hateful!"&mdash;and she flung out of the house with a new
explosion of crying.</p>

<p>Tom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently
he said to himself:</p>

<p>"What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in
school! Shucks! What's a licking! That's just like a
girl&mdash;they're so thin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of
course I ain't going to tell old Dobbins on this little fool,
because there's other ways of getting even on her, that ain't so
mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask who it was tore his
book. Nobody'll answer. Then he'll do just the way he always
does&mdash;ask first one and then t'other, and when he comes to
the right girl he'll know it, without any telling. Girls' faces
always tell on them. They ain't got any backbone. She'll get
licked. Well, it's a kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher,
because there ain't any way out of it." Tom conned the thing a
moment longer, and then added: "All right, though; she'd like to
see me in just such a fix&mdash;let her sweat it out!"</p>

<p>Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few
moments the master arrived and school "took in." Tom did not feel
a strong interest in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at
the girls' side of the room Becky's face troubled him.
Considering all things, he did not want to pity her, and yet it
was all he could do to help it. He could get up no exultation
that was really worthy the name. Presently the spelling-book
discovery was made, and Tom's mind was entirely full of his own
matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her lethargy
of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She did
not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that
he spilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The
denial only seemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky
supposed she would be glad of that, and she tried to believe she
was glad of it, but she found she was not certain. When the worst
came to the worst, she had an impulse to get up and tell on
Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced herself to keep
still&mdash;because, said she to herself, "he'll tell about me
tearing the picture sure. I wouldn't say a word, not to save his
life!"</p>

<p>Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all
broken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had
unknowingly upset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some
skylarking bout&mdash;he had denied it for form's sake and
because it was custom, and had stuck to the denial from
principle.</p>

<p>A whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne,
the air was drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins
straightened himself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and
reached for his book, but seemed undecided whether to take it out
or leave it. Most of the pupils glanced up languidly, but there
were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes.
Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while, then took it
out and settled himself in his chair to read! Tom shot a glance
at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she
did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot his
quarrel with her. Quick&mdash;something must be done! done in a
flash, too! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his
invention. Good!&mdash;he had an inspiration! He would run and
snatch the book, spring through the door and fly. But his
resolution shook for one little instant, and the chance was
lost&mdash;the master opened the volume. If Tom only had the
wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help for
Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.
Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote
even the innocent with fear. There was silence while one might
count ten&mdash;the master was gathering his wrath. Then he
spoke: "Who tore this book?"</p>

<p>There was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The
stillness continued; the master searched face after face for
signs of guilt.</p>

<p>"Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?"</p>

<p>A denial. Another pause.</p>

<p>"Joseph Harper, did you?"</p>

<p>Another denial. Tom's uneasiness grew more and more intense
under the slow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned
the ranks of boys &mdash;considered a while, then turned to the
girls:</p>

<p>"Amy Lawrence?"</p>

<p>A shake of the head.</p>

<p>"Gracie Miller?"</p>

<p>The same sign.</p>

<p>"Susan Harper, did you do this?"</p>

<p>Another negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was
trembling from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the
hopelessness of the situation.</p>

<p>"Rebecca Thatcher" [Tom glanced at her face&mdash;it was white
with terror] &mdash;"did you tear&mdash;no, look me in the face"
[her hands rose in appeal] &mdash;"did you tear this book?"</p>

<p>A thought shot like lightning through Tom's brain. He sprang
to his feet and shouted&mdash;"I done it!"</p>

<br><br>

<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom
stood a moment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he
stepped forward to go to his punishment the surprise, the
gratitude, the adoration that shone upon him out of poor Becky's
eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings. Inspired by the
splendor of his own act, he took without an outcry the most
merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever administered;
and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a
command to remain two hours after school should be
dismissed&mdash;for he knew who would wait for him outside till
his captivity was done, and not count the tedious time as loss,
either.</p>

<p>Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred
Temple; for with shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not
forgetting her own treachery; but even the longing for vengeance
had to give way, soon, to pleasanter musings, and he fell asleep
at last with Becky's latest words lingering dreamily in his
ear&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tom, how COULD you be so noble!"</p>

<p>VACATION was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe,
grew severer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the
school to make a good showing on "Examination" day. His rod and
his ferule were seldom idle now&mdash;at least among the smaller
pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and
twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins' lashings were very vigorous
ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a perfectly
bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there
was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day
approached, all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface;
he seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least
shortcomings. The consequence was, that the smaller boys spent
their days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting
revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do the master a
mischief. But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution that
followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that
the boys always retired from the field badly worsted. At last
they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a
dazzling victory. They swore in the signpainter's boy, told him
the scheme, and asked his help. He had his own reasons for being
delighted, for the master boarded in his father's family and had
given the boy ample cause to hate him. The master's wife would go
on a visit to the country in a few days, and there would be
nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always prepared
himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and
the signpainter's boy said that when the dominie had reached the
proper condition on Examination Evening he would "manage the
thing" while he napped in his chair; then he would have him
awakened at the right time and hurried away to school.</p>

<p>In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At
eight in the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and
adorned with wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The
master sat throned in his great chair upon a raised platform,
with his blackboard behind him. He was looking tolerably mellow.
Three rows of benches on each side and six rows in front of him
were occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents
of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of citizens, was a
spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the scholars
who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of
small boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of
discomfort; rows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young
ladies clad in lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of
their bare arms, their grandmothers' ancient trinkets, their
bits of pink and blue ribbon and the flowers in their hair. All
the rest of the house was filled with non-participating
scholars.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="21-168"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="21-168.jpg (103K)" src="21-168.jpg" height="516" width="712">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly
recited, "You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on
the stage," etc.&mdash;accompanying himself with the painfully
exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have
used&mdash;supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order. But
he got through safely, though cruelly scared, and got a fine
round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and
retired.</p>

<p>A little shamefaced girl lisped, "Mary had a little lamb,"
etc., performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of
applause, and sat down flushed and happy.</p>

<p>Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and
soared into the unquenchable and indestructible "Give me liberty
or give me death" speech, with fine fury and frantic
gesticulation, and broke down in the middle of it. A ghastly
stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under him and he was
like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the house
but he had the house's silence, too, which was even worse than
its sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the
disaster. Tom struggled awhile and then retired, utterly
defeated. There was a weak attempt at applause, but it died
early.</p>

<p>"The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck" followed; also "The
Assyrian Came Down," and other declamatory gems. Then there were
reading exercises, and a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class
recited with honor. The prime feature of the evening was in
order, now&mdash;original "compositions" by the young ladies.
Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform,
cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty
ribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to
"expression" and punctuation. The themes were the same that had
been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before
them, their grandmothers, and doubtless all their ancestors in
the female line clear back to the Crusades. "Friendship" was
one; "Memories of Other Days"; "Religion in History"; "Dream
Land"; "The Advantages of Culture"; "Forms of Political
Government Compared and Contrasted"; "Melancholy"; "Filial Love";
"Heart Longings," etc., etc.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="21-170"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="21-170.jpg (87K)" src="21-170.jpg" height="496" width="677">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and
petted melancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of
"fine language"; another was a tendency to lug in by the ears
particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn
entirely out; and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and
marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged
its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them. No
matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was made
to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and
religious mind could contemplate with edification. The glaring
insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the
banishment of the fashion from the schools, and it is not
sufficient today; it never will be sufficient while the world
stands, perhaps. There is no school in all our land where the
young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with
a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous
and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest
and the most relentlessly pious. But enough of this. Homely truth
is unpalatable.</p>

<p>Let us return to the "Examination." The first composition that
was read was one entitled "Is this, then, Life?" Perhaps the
reader can endure an extract from it:</p>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions
does the youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of
festivity! Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of
joy. In fancy, the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid
the festive throng, 'the observed of all observers.' Her graceful
form, arrayed in snowy robes, is whirling through the mazes of
the joyous dance; her eye is brightest, her step is lightest in
the gay assembly.</p>

<p>"In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the
welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of
which she has had such bright dreams. How fairy-like does
everything appear to her enchanted vision! Each new scene is more
charming than the last. But after a while she finds that beneath
this goodly exterior, all is vanity, the flattery which once
charmed her soul, now grates harshly upon her ear; the ballroom
has lost its charms; and with wasted health and imbittered heart,
she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot
satisfy the longings of the soul!"</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>And so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification
from time to time during the reading, accompanied by whispered
ejaculations of "How sweet!" "How eloquent!" "So true!" etc., and
after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon
the applause was enthusiastic.</p>

<p>Then arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the
"interesting" paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and
read a "poem." Two stanzas of it will do:</p>
<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"A MISSOURI MAIDEN'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA</p>

<p>"Alabama, goodbye! I love thee well!<br>
But yet for a while do I leave thee now!<br>
Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell,<br>
And burning recollections throng my brow!<br>
For I have wandered through thy flowery woods;<br>
Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa's stream;<br>
Have listened to Tallassee's warring floods,<br>
And wooed on Coosa's side Aurora's beam.</p>

<p>"Yet shame I not to bear an o'erfull heart,<br>
Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes; <br>
'Tis from no stranger land I now must part, <br>
'Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.<br>
Welcome and home were mine within this State,<br>
Whose vales I leave&mdash;whose spires fade fast from me<br>
And cold must be mine eyes, and heart, and tete,<br>
When, dear Alabama! they turn cold on thee!"</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>There were very few there who knew what "tete" meant, but the
poem was very satisfactory, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Next appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired
young lady, who paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic
expression, and began to read in a measured, solemn tone:</p>


<br><br>

<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="21-173.jpg (87K)" src="21-173.jpg" height="505" width="683">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 


<blockquote><blockquote>
<p>"A VISION</p>

<p>"Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not
a single star quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy
thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific
lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of
heaven, seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the
illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous winds unanimously came
forth from their mystic homes, and blustered about as if to
enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.</p>

<p>"At such a time, so dark,so dreary, for human sympathy my very
spirit sighed; but instead thereof,</p>

<p>"'My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and
guide&mdash;My joy in grief, my second bliss in joy,' came to my
side. She moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the
sunny walks of fancy's Eden by the romantic and young, a queen of
beauty unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness. So soft
was her step, it failed to make even a sound, and but for the
magical thrill imparted by her genial touch, as other unobtrusive
beauties, she would have glided away unperceived&mdash;
unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features, like icy
tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the contending
elements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings
presented."</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and
wound up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to
non-Presbyterians that it took the first prize. This composition
was considered to be the very finest effort of the evening. The
mayor of the village, in delivering the prize to the author of
it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the
most "eloquent" thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel
Webster himself might well be proud of it.</p>

<p>It may be remarked, in passing, that the number of
compositions in which the word "beauteous" was over-fondled, and
human experience referred to as "life's page," was up to the
usual average.</p>

<p>Now the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put
his chair aside, turned his back to the audience, and began to
draw a map of America on the blackboard, to exercise the
geography class upon. But he made a sad business of it with his
unsteady hand, and a smothered titter rippled over the house. He
knew what the matter was, and set himself to right it. He sponged
out lines and remade them; but he only distorted them more than
ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his entire
attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down
by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he
imagined he was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it
even manifestly increased. And well it might. There was a garret
above, pierced with a scuttle over his head; and down through
this scuttle came a cat, suspended around the haunches by a
string; she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her
from mewing; as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed
at the string, she swung downward and clawed at the intangible
air. The tittering rose higher and higher&mdash;the cat was
within six inches of the absorbed teacher's head&mdash;down,
down, a little lower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate
claws, clung to it, and was snatched up into the garret in an
instant with her trophy still in her possession! And how the
light did blaze abroad from the master's bald pate&mdash;for the
signpainter's boy had GILDED it!</p>

<p>TOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being
attracted by the showy character of their "regalia." He promised
to abstain from smoking, chewing, and profanity as long as he
remained a member. Now he found out a new thing&mdash;namely,
that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world
to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon found
himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire
grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to
display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from
the order. Fourth of July was coming; but he soon gave that
up&mdash; gave it up before he had worn his shackles over
forty-eight hours&mdash;and fixed his hopes upon old Judge
Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed
and would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an
official. During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the
Judge's condition and hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes
ran high&mdash;so high that he would venture to get out his
regalia and practise before the looking-glass. But the Judge had
a most discouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was pronounced
upon the mend &mdash;and then convalescent. Tom was disgusted;
and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation at
once&mdash;and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died.
Tom resolved that he would never trust a man like that again.</p>

<p>The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style
calculated to kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy
again, however&mdash; there was something in that. He could
drink and swear, now&mdash;but found to his surprise that he did
not want to. The simple fact that he could, took the desire away,
and the charm of it.</p>

<p>Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was
beginning to hang a little heavily on his hands.</p>

<p>He attempted a diary&mdash;but nothing happened during three
days, and so he abandoned it.</p>

<p>The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and
made a sensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers
and were happy for two days.</p>

<br><br>

<img alt="22-177.jpg (110K)" src="22-177.jpg" height="525" width="690">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it
rained hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the
greatest man in the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an
actual United States Senator, proved an overwhelming
disappointment&mdash;for he was not twenty-five feet high, nor
even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.</p>

<p>A circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward
in tents made of rag carpeting&mdash;admission, three pins for
boys, two for girls &mdash;and then circusing was abandoned.</p>

<p>A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came&mdash;and went again and
left the village duller and drearier than ever.</p>

<p>There were some boys-and-girls' parties, but they were so few
and so delightful that they only made the aching voids between
ache the harder.</p>

<p>Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay
with her parents during vacation&mdash;so there was no bright
side to life anywhere.</p>

<p>The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was
a very cancer for permanency and pain.</p>

<p>Then came the measles.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="22-178"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="22-178.jpg (51K)" src="22-178.jpg" height="482" width="363">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world
and its happenings. He was very ill, he was interested in
nothing. When he got upon his feet at last and moved feebly
downtown, a melancholy change had come over everything and every
creature. There had been a "revival," and everybody had "got
religion," not only the adults, but even the boys and girls. Tom
went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed
sinful face, but disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found
Joe Harper studying a Testament, and turned sadly away from the
depressing spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him
visiting the poor with a basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim
Hollis, who called his attention to the precious blessing of his
late measles as a warning. Every boy he encountered added another
ton to his depression; and when, in desperation, he flew for
refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn and was received
with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he crept home
and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost,
forever and forever.</p>

<p>And that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving
rain, awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He
covered his head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of
suspense for his doom; for he had not the shadow of a doubt that
all this hubbub was about him. He believed he had taxed the
forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and
that this was the result. It might have seemed to him a waste of
pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery,
but there seemed nothing incongruous about the getting up such
an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from under
an insect like himself.</p>

<p>By and by the tempest spent itself and died without
accomplishing its object. The boy's first impulse was to be
grateful, and reform. His second was to wait&mdash;for there
might not be any more storms.</p>

<p>The next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The
three weeks he spent on his back this time seemed an entire age.
When he got abroad at last he was hardly grateful that he had
been spared, remembering how lonely was his estate, how
companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted listlessly down the
street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a juvenile court
that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her victim,
a bird. He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a
stolen melon. Poor lads! they&mdash;like Tom&mdash;had suffered a
relapse.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg

These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).


Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
