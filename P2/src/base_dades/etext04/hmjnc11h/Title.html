<h3>PREFACE</h3>
</center>

<p class="first">Having accompanied Sir James Boss on his voyage of
discovery to the Antarctic regions, where botany was my chief
pursuit, on my return I earnestly desired to add to my acquaintance
with the natural history of the temperate zones, more knowledge of
that of the tropics than I bad hitherto had the opportunity of
acquiring. My choice lay between India and the Andes, and I decided
upon the former, being principally influenced by Dr. Falconer, who
promised me every assistance which his position as Superintendent
of the H.E.I.C. Botanic Garden at Calcutta, would enable hum to
give. He also drew my attention to the fact that we were ignorant
even of the geography of the central and eastern parts of these
mountains, while all to the north was involved in a mystery equally
attractive to the traveller and the naturalist.</p>

<p>On hearing of the kind interest taken by Baron Humboldt in my
proposed travels, and at the request of my father (Sir William
Hooker), the Earl of Carlisle (then Chief Commissioner of Woods and
Forests) undertook to represent to Her Majesty&rsquo;s
Government</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page viii">[ viii ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the expediency of securing my collections for the
Royal Gardens at Kew; and owing to the generous exertions of that
nobleman, and of the late Earl of Auckland (then First Lord of the
Admiralty), my journey assumed the character of a Government
mission, &pound;400 per annum being granted by the Treasury for two
years.</p>

<p>I did not contemplate proceeding beyond the Himalaya and Tibet,
when Lord Auckland desired that I should afterwards visit Borneo,
for the purpose of reporting on the capabilities of Labuan, with
reference to the cultivation of cotton, tobacco, sugar, indigo,
spices, guttapercha, etc. To this end a commission in the navy (to
which service I was already attached) was given me, such
instructions were drawn up as might facilitate my movements in the
East, and a suitable sum of money was placed at my disposal.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving England, my plans became, from various
causes, altered. The Earl of Auckland* was dead; the interest in
Borneo had in a great measure subsided; H.M.S.
&ldquo;M&aelig;ander,&rdquo; to which I had been attached for
service in Labuan, had left the Archipelago; reports of the
unhealthy nature of the coast had excited</p>

<p class="fnote">* It is with a melancholy satisfaction that I here
record the intentions of that enlightened nobleman. The idea of
turning to public account what was intended as a scientific voyage,
occurred to his lordship when considering my application for
official leave to proceed to India; and from the hour of my
accepting the Borneo commission with which he honoured me, he
displayed the most active zeal in promoting its fulfilment. He
communicated to me his views as to the direction in which I should
pursue my researches, furnished me with official and other
information, and provided me with introductions of the most
essential use.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page ix">[ ix ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">alarm; and the results of my researches in the
Himalaya had proved of more interest and advantage than had been
anticipated. It was hence thought expedient to cancel the Borneo
appointment, and to prolong my services for a third year in India;
for which purpose a grant of &pound;300 (originally intended for
defraying the expense of collecting only, in Borneo) was
transferred as salary for the additional year to be spent in the
Himalaya.</p>

<p>The portion of the Himalaya best worth exploring, was selected
for me both by Lord Auckland and Dr. Falconer, who independently
recommended Sikkim, as being ground untrodden by traveller or
naturalist. Its ruler was, moreover, all but a dependant of the
British government, and it was supposed, would therefore be glad to
facilitate my researches.</p>

<p>No part of the snowy Himalaya eastward of the northwest
extremity of the British possessions had been visited since
Turner&rsquo;s embassy to Tibet in 1789; and hence it was highly
important to explore scientifically a part of the chain which, from
its central position, might be presumed to be typical of the whole
range. The possibility of visiting Tibet, and of ascertaining
particulars respecting the great mountain Chumulari,* which was
only known from Turner&rsquo;s account, were additional inducements
to a student of physical geography;</p>

<p class="fnote">* My earliest recollections in reading are of
&ldquo;Turner&rsquo;s Travels in Tibet,&rdquo; and of
&ldquo;Cook&rsquo;s Voyages.&rdquo; The account of Lama worship and
of Chumulari in the one, and of Kerguelen&rsquo;s Land in the
other, always took a strong hold on my fancy. It is, therefore,
singular that Kerguelen&rsquo;s Land should have been the first
strange country I ever visited (now fourteen years ago), and that
in the first King&rsquo;s ship which has touched there since
Cook&rsquo;s voyage, and whilst following the track of that
illustrious navigator in south polar discovery. At a later period I
have been nearly the first European who has approached Chumulari
since Turner&rsquo;s embassy.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page x">[ x ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">but it was not then known that Kinchinjunga, the
loftiest known mountain on the globe, was situated on my route, and
formed a principal feature in the physical geography of Sikkim.</p>

<p>My passage to Egypt was provided by the Admiralty in H.M.
steam-vessel &ldquo;Sidon,&rdquo; destined to convey the Marquis of
Dalhousie, Governor-General of India, thus far on his way. On his
arrival in Egypt, his Lordship did me the honour of desiring me to
consider myself in the position of one of his suite, for the
remainder of the voyage, which was performed in the
&ldquo;Moozuffer,&rdquo; a steam frigate belonging to the Indian
Navy. My obligations to this nobleman had commenced before leaving
England, by his promising me every facility he could command; and
he thus took the earliest opportunity of affording it, by giving me
such a position near himself as ensured me the best reception
everywhere; no other introduction being needed. His Lordship
procured my admission into Sikkim, and honoured me throughout my
travels with the kindest encouragement.</p>

<p>During the passage out, some days were spent in Egypt, at Aden,
Ceylon, and Madras. I have not thought it necessary to give here
the observations made in those well-known countries; they are
detailed in a series of letters published in the &ldquo;London
Journal of Botany,&rdquo;</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page xi">[ xi ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">as written for my private friends. Arriving at
Calcutta in January, I passed the remainder of the cold season in
making myself acquainted with the vegetation of the plains and
hills of Western Bengal, south of the Ganges, by a journey across
the mountains of Birbhoom and Behar to the Soane valley, and thence
over the Vindhya range to the Ganges, at Mirzapore, whence I
descended that stream to Bhaugulpore; and leaving my boat, struck
north to the Sikkim Himalaya. This excursion is detailed in the
&ldquo;London Journal of Botany,&rdquo; and the Asiatic Society of
Bengal honoured me by printing the meteorological observations made
during its progress.</p>

<p>During the two years&rsquo; residence in Sikkim which succeeded,
I was laid under obligations of no ordinary nature to Brian H.
Hodgson, Esq., B.C.S., for many years Resident at the Nepal Court;
whose guest I became for several months. Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s high
position as a man of science requires no mention here; but the
difficulties he overcame, and the sacrifices he made, in attaining
that position, are known to few. He entered the wilds of Nepal when
very young, and in indifferent health; and finding time to spare,
cast about for the best method of employing it: he had no one to
recommend or direct a pursuit, no example to follow, no rival to
equal or surpass; he had never been acquainted with a scientific
man, and knew nothing of science except the name. The natural
history of men and animals, in its most comprehensive sense,
attracted his attention; he sent to Europe for books, and commenced
the study of ethnology and</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page xii">[ xii ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">zoology. His labours have now extended over
upwards of twenty-five years&rsquo; residence in the Himalaya.
During this period he has seldom had a staff of less than from ten
to twenty persons (often many more), of various tongues and races,
employed as translators and collectors, artists, shooters, and
stuffers. By unceasing exertions and a princely liberality, Mr.
Hodgson has unveiled the mysteries of the Boodhist religion,
chronicled the affinities, languages, customs, and faiths of the
Himalayan tribes; and completed a natural history of the animals
and birds of these regions. His collections of specimens are
immense, and are illustrated by drawings and descriptions taken
from life, with remarks on the anatomy,* habits, and localities of
the animals themselves. Twenty volumes of the Journals, and the
Museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, teem with the proofs of
his indefatigable zeal; and throughout the cabinets of the bird and
quadruped departments of our national museum, Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s
name stands pre-eminent. A seat in the Institute of France, and the
cross of the Legion of Honour, prove the estimation in which his
Boodhist studies are held on the continent of Europe. To be
welcomed to the Himalaya by such a person, and to be allowed the
most unreserved intercourse, and the advantage of all his
information and library, exercised a material influence on the
progress I made in my studies, and on my travels. When I add that
many of the subjects</p>

<p class="fnote">* In this department he availed himself of the
services of Dr. Campbell, who was also attached to the Residency at
Nepal, as surgeon and assistant political agent.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page xiii">[ xiii ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">treated of in these volumes were discussed between
us, it will be evident that it is impossible for me to divest much
of the information thus insensibly obtained, of the appearance of
being the fruits of my own research.</p>

<p>Dr. Campbell, the Superintendent of Dorjiling, is likewise the
Governor-General&rsquo;s agent, or medium of communication between
the British Government and the Sikkim Rajah; and as such, invested
with many discretionary powers. In the course of this narrative, I
shall give a sketch of the rise, progress, and prospects of the
Sanatarium, or Health-station of Dorjiling, and of the anomalous
position held by the Sikkim Rajah. The latter circumstance led
indirectly to the detention of Dr. Campbell (who joined me in one
of my journeys) and myself, by a faction of the Sikkim court, for
the purpose of obtaining from the Indian Government a more
favourable treaty than that then existing. This mode of enforcing a
request by <i>douce violence</i> and detention, is common with the
turbulent tribes east of Nepal, but was in this instance aggravated
by violence towards my fellow-prisoner, through the ill will of the
persons who executed the orders of their superiors, and who had
been punished by Dr. Campbell for crimes committed against both the
British and Nepalese governments. The circumstances of this outrage
were misunderstood at the time; its instigators were supposed to be
Chinese; its perpetrators Tibetans; and we the offenders were
assumed to have thrust ourselves into the country, without
authority from our own government,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page xiv">[ xiv ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and contrary to the will of the Sikkim Rajah; who
was imagined to be a tributary of China, and protected by that
nation, and to be under no obligation to the East Indian
government.</p>

<p>With regard to the obligations I owe to Dr. Campbell, I confine
myself to saying that his whole aim was to promote my comfort, and
to secure my success, in all possible ways. Every object I had in
view was as sedulously cared for by him as by myself: I am indebted
to his influence with Jung Bahadoor* for the permission to traverse
his dominions, and to visit the Tibetan passes of Nepal. His
prudence and patience in negotiating with the Sikkim court, enabled
me to pursue my investigations in that country. My journal is
largely indebted to his varied and extensive knowledge of the
people and productions of these regions.</p>

<p>In all numerical calculations connected with my observations, I
received most essential aid from John Muller, Esq., Accountant of
the Calcutta Mint, and from his brother, Charles Muller, Esq., of
Patna, both ardent amateurs in scientific pursuits, and who
employed themselves in making meteorological observations at
Dorjiling, where they were recruiting constitutions impaired by the
performance of arduous duties in the climate of the plains. I
cannot sufficiently thank these gentlemen for</p>

<p class="fnote">* It was in Nepal that Dr. Campbell gained the
friendship of Jung Bahadoor, the most remarkable proof of which is
the acceding to his request, and granting me leave to visit the
eastern parts of his dominions; no European that I am aware of,
having been allowed, either before or since, to travel anywhere
except to and from the plains of India and valley of Katmandu, in
which the capital city and British residency are situated.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page xv">[ xv ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the handsome manner in which they volunteered me
their assistance in these laborious operations. Mr. J. Muller
resided at Dorjiling during eighteen months of my stay in Sikkim,
over the whole of which period his generous zeal in my service
never relaxed; he assisted me in the reduction of many hundreds of
my observations for latitude, time, and elevation, besides
adjusting and rating my instruments; and I can recall no more
pleasant days than those thus spent with these hospitable
friends.</p>

<p>Thanks to Dr. Falconer&rsquo;s indefatigable exertions, such of
my collections as reached Calcutta were forwarded to England in
excellent order; and they were temporarily deposited in Kew Gardens
until their destination should be determined. On my return home, my
scientific friends interested themselves in procuring from the
Government such aid as might enable me to devote the necessary time
to the arrangement, naming, and distributing of my collections, the
publication of my manuscripts, etc. I am in this most deeply
indebted to the disinterested and generous exertions of Mr. L.
Horner, Sir Charles Lyell, Dr. Lindley, Professor E. Forbes, and
many others; and most especially to the Presidents of the Royal
Society (the Earl of Rosse), of the Linnean (Mr. R. Brown), and
Geological (Mr. Hopkins), who in their official capacities
memorialized in person the Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests
on this subject; Sir William Hooker at the same time bringing it
under the notice of the First Lord of the Treasury.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page xvi">[ xvi ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">The result was a grant of &pound;400 annually for
three years.</p>

<p>Dr. T. Thomson joined me in Dorjiling in the end of 1849, after
the completion of his arduous journeys in the North-West Himalaya
and Tibet, and we spent the year 1850 in travelling and collecting,
returning to England together in 1851. Having obtained permission
from the Indian Government to distribute his botanical collections,
which equal my own in extent and value, we were advised by all our
botanical friends to incorporate, and thus to distribute them. The
whole constitute an Herbarium of from 6000 to 7000 species of
Indian plants, including an immense number of duplicates; and it is
now in process of being arranged and named, by Dr. Thomson and
myself, preparatory to its distribution amongst sixty of the
principal public and private herbaria in Europe, India, and the
United States of America.</p>

<p>For the information of future travellers, I may state that the
total expense of my Indian journey, including outfit, three years
and a half travelling, and the sending of my collections to
Calcutta, was under &pound;2000 (of which &pound;1200 were defrayed
by government), but would have come to much more, had I not enjoyed
the great advantages I have detailed. This sum does not include the
purchase of books and instruments, with which I supplied myself,
and which cost about &pound;200, nor the freight of the collections
to England, which was paid by Government. Owing to the kind
services of Mr. J. C. Melvill, Secretary of the India House,
many</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page xvii">[ xvii ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">small parcels of seeds, etc., were conveyed to
England, free of cost; and I have to record my great obligations
and sincere thanks to the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation
Company, for conveying, without charge, all small parcels of books,
instruments and specimens, addressed to or by myself.</p>

<p>It remains to say something of the illustrations of this work.
The maps are from surveys of my own, made chiefly with my own
instruments, but partly with some valuable ones for the use of
which I am indebted to my friend Captain H. Thuillier, Deputy
Surveyor-General of India, who placed at my disposal the resources
of the magnificent establishment under his control, and to whose
innumerable good offices I am very greatly beholden.</p>

<p>The landscapes, etc. have been prepared chiefly from my own
drawings, and will, I hope, be found to be tolerably faithful
representations of the scenes. I have always endeavoured to
overcome that tendency to exaggerate heights, and increase the
angle of slopes, which is I believe the besetting sin, not of
amateurs only, but of our most accomplished artists. As, however, I
did not use instruments in projecting the outlines, I do not
pretend to have wholly avoided this snare; nor, I regret to say;
has the lithographer, in all cases, been content to abide by his
copy. My drawings will be considered tame compared with most
mountain landscapes, though the subjects comprise some of the
grandest scenes in nature. Considering how conventional the
treatment</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page xviii">[ xviii ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">of such subjects is, and how unanimous artists
seem to be as to the propriety of exaggerating those features which
should predominate in the landscape, it may fairly be doubted
whether the total effect of steepness and elevation, especially in
a mountain view, can, on a small scale, be conveyed by a strict
adherence to truth. I need hardly add, that if such is attainable,
it is only by those who have a power of colouring that few pretend
to. In the list of plates and woodcuts I have mentioned the
obligations I am under to several friends for the use of drawings,
etc.</p>

<p>With regard to the spelling of native names, after much anxious
discussion I have adopted that which assimilates most to the
English pronunciation. For great assistance in this, for a careful
revision of the sheets as they passed through the press, and for
numerous valuable suggestions throughout, I am indebted to my
fellow-traveller, Dr. Thomas Thomson.</p>
