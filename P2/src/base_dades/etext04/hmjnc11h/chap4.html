<p class="first">I took as it were, a new departure, on Saturday,
April the 8th, my dawk being laid on that day from Caragola-Ghat,
about thirty miles down the river, for the foot of the Himalaya
range and Dorjiling.</p>

<p>Passing the pretty villa-like houses of the English residents,
the river-banks re-assumed their wonted features the hills receded
from the shore; and steep clay cliffs, twenty to fifty feet high,
on one side, opposed long sandy shelves on the other. Kunker was
still most abundant, especially in the lower bed of the banks,
close to the (now very low) water. The strata containing it were
much undulated, but not uniformly so; horizontal layers over or
under-lying the disturbed ones. At Colgong, conical hills appear,
and two remarkable sister-rocks start out of the river, the same in
structure with those of Sultangunj. A boisterous current swirls
round them, strong even at this season, and very dangerous in the
rains, when the swollen</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 95">[ 95 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">river is from twenty-eight to forty feet deeper
than now. We landed opposite the rocks, and proceeded to the
residence of Mr. G. Barnes, prettily situated on one of the conical
elevations characteristic of the geology of the district. The
village we passed through had been recently destroyed by fire; and
nothing but the clay outer walls and curious-looking partition
walls remained, often white-washed and daubed with figures in red
of the palm of the hand, elephant, peacock, and tiger,&mdash;a sort
of rude fresco-painting. We did not arrive till past mid-day, and
the boat, with my palkee and servant, not having been able to face
the gale, I was detained till the middle of the following day. Mr.
Barnes and his brother proved most agreeable companions,&mdash;very
luckily for me, for it requires no ordinary philosophy to bear
being storm-stayed on a voyage, with the prospect of paying a heavy
demurrage for detaining the dawk, and the worse one of finding the
bearers given to another traveller when you arrive at the
rendezvous. The view from Mr. Barnes' house is very fine: it
commands the river and its rocks; the Rajmahal hills to the east
and south; broad acres of indigo and other crops below; long lines
of palm-trees, and groves of mango, banana, tamarind, and other
tropical trees, scattered close around and in the distance. In the
rainy season, and immediately after, the snowy Himalaya are
distinctly seen on the horizon, fully 170 miles off. Nearly
opposite, the Cosi river enters the Ganges, bearing (considering
its short course) an enormous volume of water, comprising the
drainage of the whole Himalaya between the two giant peaks of
Kinchinjunga in Sikkim, and Gossain-Than in Nepal. Even at this
season, looking from Mr. Barnes' eyrie over the bed of the Ganges,
the enormous expanses of sand, the numerous shifting islets, and
the long</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 96">[ 96 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">spits of mud betray the proximity of some very
restless and resistless power. During the rains, the scene must
indeed be extraordinary, when the Cosi lays many miles of land
under water, and pours so vast a quantity of detritus into the bed
of the Ganges that long islets are heaped up and swept away in a
few hours; and the latter river becomes all but unnavigable. Boats
are caught in whirlpools, formed without a moment's warning, and
sunk ere they have spun round thrice in the eddies; and no part of
the inland navigation of India is so dreaded or dangerous, as the
Ganges at its junction with the Cosi.</p>

<p>Rain generally falls in partial showers at this season, and they
are essential to the well-being of the spring crops of indigo. The
stormy appearance of the sky, though it proved fallacious, was
hailed by my hosts as predicting a fall, which was much wanted. The
wind however seemed but to aggravate the drought, by the great body
of sand it lifted and swept up the valleys, obscuring the near
horizon, and especially concealing the whole delta of the Cosi,
where the clouds were so vast and dense, and ascended so high as to
resemble another element.</p>

<p>All night the gale blew on, accompanied with much thunder and
lightning, and it was not till noon of the 9th that I descried my
palkee-boat toiling down the stream. Then I again embarked, taking
the lagging boat in tow of my own. Passing the mouths of the Cosi,
the gale and currents were so adverse that we had to bring up on
the sand, when the quantity which drifted into the boat rendered
the delay as disagreeable as it was tedious. The particles
penetrated everywhere, up my nose and down my back, drying my
eyelids, and gritting between my teeth. The craft kept bumping on
the banks, and being both crazy and leaky, the little comfortless
cabin became the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 97">[ 97 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">refuge of scared rats and cockroaches. In the
evening I shared a meal with these creatures, on some provisions my
kind friends had put into the boat, but the food was so sandy that
I had to bolt my supper!</p>

<p>At night the storm lulled a little, and I proceeded to Caragola
Ghat and took up my dawk, which had been twenty-eight hours
expecting me, and was waiting, in despair of my arrival, for
another traveller on the opposite bank, who however could not cross
the river.</p>

<p>Having accomplished thirty miles, I halted at 9 a..m. on the
following morning at Purnea, quitting it at noon for Kishengunj.
The whole country wore a greener garb than I had seen anywhere
south of the Ganges: the climate was evidently more humid, and had
been gradually becoming so from Mirzapore. The first decided change
was a few miles below the Soane mouth, at Dinapore and Patna; and
the few hygrometrical observations I took at Bhagulpore confirmed
the increase of moisture. The proximity to the sea and great Delta
of the Ganges sufficiently accounts for this; as does the approach
to the hills for the still greater dampness and brighter verdure of
Purnea. I was glad to feel myself within the influence of the
long-looked-for Himalaya; and I narrowly watched every change in
the character of the vegetation. A fern, growing by the roadside,
was the first and most tangible evidence of this; together with the
rarity or total absence of <i>Butea, Boswellia, Catechu, Grislea,
Carissa,</i> and all the companions of my former excursion.</p>

<p>Purnea is a large station, and considered very unhealthy during
and after the rains. From it the road passed through some pretty
lanes, with groves of planted Guava and a rattan palm
(<i>Calamus</i>), the first I had seen. Though no hills are nearer
than the Himalaya, from the constant</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 98">[ 98 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">alteration of the river-beds, the road undulates
remarkably for this part of India, and a jungly vegetation ensues,
consisting of the above plants, with the yellow-flowered Cactus
replacing the Euphorbias, which were previously much more common.
Though still 100 miles distant from the hills, mosses appeared on
the banks, and more ferns were just sprouting above ground.</p>

<p>The Bamboo was a very different species from any I had hitherto
met with, forming groves of straight trees fifteen to twenty feet
high, thin of foliage, and not unlike poplars.</p>

<p>Thirty-six miles from Purnea brought me to Kishengunj, when I
found that no arrangements whatever had been made for my dawk, and
I was fairly stranded. Luckily a thoughtful friend had provided me
with letters to the scattered residents along the road, and I
proceeded with one to Mr. Perry, the assistant magistrate of the
district,&mdash;a gentleman well known for his urbanity, and the
many aids he affords to travellers on this neglected line of road.
Owing to this being some festival or holiday, it was impossible to
get palkee-bearers; the natives were busy catching fish in all the
muddy pools around. Some of Mr. Perry's own family also were about
to proceed to Dorjiling, so that I had only to take patience, and
be thankful for having to exercise it in such pleasant quarters.
The Mahanuddee, a large stream from the hills, flows near this
place, strewing the surrounding neighbourhood with sand, and from
the frequent alterations in its course, causing endless disputes
amongst the landholders. A kind of lark called an Ortolan was
abundant: this is not, however, the European delicacy of that name,
though a migratory bird; the flocks are large, and the birds so
fat, that they make excellent table game. At this time they were
rapidly disappearing; to return from the north in September.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 99">[ 99 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had just got into bed at night, when the bearers arrived; so
bidding a hurried adieu to my kind host, I proceeded onwards.</p>

<p><i>April 12.</i>&mdash;I awoke at 4 a.m., and found my palkee on
the ground, and the bearers coolly smoking their hookahs under a
tree (it was raining hard): they had carried me the length of their
stage, twelve miles, and there were no others to take me on. I had
paid twenty-four pounds for my dawk, from Caragola to the hills, to
which I had been obliged to add a handsome douceur; so I lost all
patience. After waiting and entreating during several hours, I
found the head-man of a neighbouring village, and by a further
disbursement induced six out of the twelve bearers to carry the
empty palkee, whilst I should walk to the next stage; or till we
should meet some others. They agreed, and cutting the thick and
spongy sheaths of the banana, used them for shoulder-pads: they
also wrapped them round the palkee-poles, to ease their aching
clavicles. Walking along I picked up a few plants, and fourteen
miles further on came again to the banks of the Mahanuddee, whose
bed was strewn with pebbles and small boulders, brought thus far
from the mountains (about thirty miles distant). Here, again, I had
to apply to the head-man of a village, and pay for bearers to take
me to Titalya, the next stage (fourteen miles). Some curious long
low sheds puzzled me very much, and on examining them they proved
to be for the growth of Pawn or Betel-pepper, another indication of
the moisture of the climate. These sheds are twenty to fifty yards
long, eight or twelve or so broad, and scarcely five high; they are
made of bamboo, wattled all round and over the top. Slender rods
are placed a few feet apart, inside, up which the Pepper Vines
climb, and quickly fill the place with their</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 100">[ 100 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">deep green glossy foliage. The native enters every
morning by a little door, and carefully cleans the plants. Constant
heat, damp, and moisture, shelter from solar beams, from scorching
heat, and from nocturnal radiation, are thus all procured for the
plant, which would certainly not live twenty-four hours, if exposed
to the climate of this treeless district. Great attention is paid
to the cultivation, which is very profitable. Snakes frequently
take up their quarters in these hot-houses, and cause fatal
accidents.</p>

<p>Titalya was once a military station of some importance, and from
its proximity to the hills has been selected by Dr. Campbell (the
Superintendent of Dorjiling) as the site for an annual fair, to
which the mountain tribes resort, as well as the people of the
plains. The Calcutta road to Dorjiling by Dinajpore meets, near
here, that by which I had come; and I found no difficulty in
procuring bearers to proceed to Siligoree, where I arrived at 6
a.m. on the 13th. Hitherto I bad not seen the mountains, so
uniformly had they been shrouded by dense wreaths of vapour: here,
however, when within eight miles of their base, I caught a first
glimpse of the outer range&mdash;sombre masses, of far from
picturesque outline, clothed everywhere with a dusky forest.</p>

<p>Siligoree stands on the verge of the Terai, that low malarious
belt which skirts the base of the Himalaya, from the Sutlej to
Brahma-koond in Upper Assam. Every feature, botanical, geological,
and zoological, is new on entering this district. The change is
sudden and immediate: sea and shore are hardly more conspicuously
different, nor from the edge of the Terai to the limit of perpetual
snow is any botanical region more clearly marked than this, which
is the commencement of Himalayan vegetation. A sudden descent leads
to the Mahanuddee river, flowing in a shallow valley, over a pebbly
bottom: it</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 101">[ 101 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">is a rapid river, even at this season; its banks
are fringed with bushes, and it is as clear and sparkling as a
trout stream in Scotland. Beyond it the road winds through a thick
brushwood, choked with long grasses, and with but few trees,
chiefly of <i>Acacia, Dalbergia Sissoo,</i> and a scarlet fruited
<i>Sterculia.</i> The soil is a red, friable clay and gravel. At
this season only a few spring plants were in flower, amongst which
a very sweet-scented <i>Crinum,</i> Asphodel, and a small <i>
Curcuma,</i> were in the greatest profusion. Leaves of terrestrial
Orchids appeared, with ferns and weeds of hot damp regions. I
crossed the beds of many small streams: some were dry, and all very
tortuous; their banks were richly clothed with brushwood and
climbers of Convolvulus, Vines, <i>Hir&aelig;a, Leea,
Menisperme&aelig;, Cucurbitace&aelig;,</i> and <i>
Bignoniace&aelig;.</i> Their pent-up waters, percolating the gravel
beds, and partly carried off by evaporation through the stratum of
ever-increasing vegetable mould, must be one main agent in the
production of the malarious vapours of this pestilential region.
Add to this, the detention of the same amongst the jungly herbage,
the amount of vapour in the humid atmosphere above, checking the
upward passage of that from the soil, the sheltered nature of the
locality at the immediate base of lofty mountains; and there appear
to me to be here all necessary elements, which, combined, will
produce stagnation and deterioration in an atmosphere loaded with
vapour. Fatal as this district is, and especially to Europeans, a
race inhabit it with impunity, who, if not numerous, do not owe
their paucity to any climatic causes. These are the Mechis, often
described as a squalid, unhealthy people, typical of the region
they frequent; but who are, in reality, more robust than the
Europeans in India, and whose disagreeably</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 102">[ 102 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">sallow complexion is deceptive as indicating a
sickly constitution. They are a mild, inoffensive people,
industrious for Orientals, living by annually burning the Terai
jungle and cultivating the cleared spots; and, though so
sequestered and isolated, they rather court than avoid intercourse
with those whites whom they know to be kindly disposed.</p>

<p>After proceeding some six miles along the gradually ascending
path, I came to a considerable stream, cutting its way through
stratified gravel, with cliffs on each side fifteen to twenty feet
high, here and there covered with ferns, the little <i>Oxalis
sensitiva,</i> and other herbs. The road here suddenly ascends a
steep gravelly hill, and opens out on a short flat, or spur, from
which the Himalaya rise abruptly, clothed with forest from the
base: the little bungalow of Punkabaree, my immediate destination,
nestled in the woods, crowning a lateral knoll, above which, to
east and west, as far as the eye could reach, were range after
range of wooded mountains, 6000 to 8000 feet high. I here met with
the India-rubber tree (<i>Ficus elastica</i>); it abounds in Assam,
but this is its western limit.</p>

<p>From this steppe, the ascent to Punkabaree is sudden and steep,
and accompanied with a change in soil and vegetation. The mica
slate and clay slate protrude everywhere, the former full of
garnets. A giant forest replaces the stunted and bushy timber of
the Terai Proper; of which the <i>Duabanga</i> and <i>
Terminalias</i> form the prevailing trees, with <i>Cedrela</i> and
the <i>Gordonia Wallichii.</i> Smaller timber and shrubs are
innumerable; a succulent character pervades the bushes and herbs,
occasioned by the prevalence of <i>Urtice&aelig;.</i> Large bamboos
rather crest the hills than court the deeper shade, and of the
latter there is</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 103">[ 103 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">abundance, for the torrents cut a straight, deep,
and steep course down the hill flanks: the galleys they traverse
are choked with vegetation and bridged by fallen trees, whose
trunks are richly clothed with <i>Dendrobium Pierardi</i> and other
epiphytical Orchids, with pendulous <i>Lycopodia</i> and many
ferns, <i>Hoya, Scitamine&aelig;,</i> and similar types of the
hottest and dampest climates.</p>

<p>The bungalow at Punkabaree was good&mdash;which was well, as my
luggage-bearers were not come up, and there were no signs of them
along the Terai road, which I saw winding below me. My scanty stock
of paper being full of plants, I was reduced to the strait of
botanising, and throwing away my specimens. The forest was truly
magnificent along the steep mountain sides. The apparently large
proportion of deciduous trees was far more considerable than I had
expected; partly, probably, due to the abundance of the <i>
Dillenia, Cassia,</i> and <i>Sterculia,</i> whose copious fruit was
all the more conspicuous from the leafless condition of the plant.
The white or lilac blossoms of the convolvuluslike <i>
Thunbergia,</i> and other <i>Acanthace&aelig;</i> were the
predominant features of the shrubby vegetation, and very
handsome.</p>

<p>All around, the hills rise steeply five or six thousand feet,
clothed in a dense deep-green dripping forest. Torrents rush down
the slopes, their position indicated by the dipping of the forest
into their beds, or the occasional cloud of spray rising above some
more boisterous part of their course. From the road, at and a
little above Punkabaree, the view is really superb, and very
instructive. Behind (or north) the Himalaya rise in steep confused
masses. Below, the hill on which I stood, and the ranges as far as
the eye can reach east and west, throw spurs on to the plains of
India. These are very thickly wooded, and enclose broad, dead-flat,
hot and damp valleys,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 104">[ 104 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">apparently covered with a dense forest. Secondary
spurs of clay and gravel, like that immediately below Punkabaree,
rest on the bases of the mountains, and seem to form an
intermediate neutral ground between flat and mountainous India. The
Terai district forms a very irregular belt, scantily clothed, and
intersected by innumerable rivulets from the hills, which unite and
divide again on the flat, till, emerging from the region of many
trees, they enter the plains, following devious courses, which
glisten like silver threads. The whole horizon is bounded by the
sea-like expanse of the plains, which stretch away into the region
of sunshine and fine weather, in one boundless flat.</p>

<p>In the distance, the courses of the Teesta and Cosi, the great
drainers of the snowy Himalayas, and the recipients of innumerable
smaller rills, are with difficulty traced at this, the dry season.
The ocean-like appearance of this southern view is even more
conspicuous in the heavens than on the land, the clouds arranging
themselves after a singularly sea-scape fashion. Endless strata run
in parallel ribbons over the extreme horizon; above these,
scattered cumuli, also in horizontal lines, are dotted against a
clear grey sky, which gradually, as the eye is lifted, passes into
a deep cloudless blue vault, continuously clear to the zenith;
there the cumuli, in white fleecy masses, again appear; till, in
the northern celestial hemisphere, they thicken and assume the
leaden hue of nimbi, discharging their moisture on the dark
forest-clad hills around. The breezes are south-easterly, bringing
that vapour from the Indian Ocean, which is rarefied and suspended
aloft over the heated plains, but condensed into a drizzle when it
strikes the cooler flanks of the hills, and into heavy rain when it
meets their still colder summits. Upon what a gigantic scale does
nature here operate! Vapours, raised</p>

<p class="first">from an ocean whose nearest shore is more than 400
miles distant, are safely transported without the loss of one drop
of water, to support the rank luxuriance of this far distant
region. This and other offices fulfilled, the waste waters are
returned, by the Cosi and Teesta, to the ocean, and again exhaled,
exported, expended, re-collected, and returned.</p>

<p>The soil and bushes everywhere swarmed with large and
troublesome ants, and enormous earthworms. In the evening, the
noise of the great <i>Cicad&aelig;</i> in the trees was almost
deafening. They burst suddenly into full chorus, with a voice so
harshly croaking, so dissonant, and so unearthly, that in these
solitary forests I could not help being startled. In general
character the note was very similar to that of other <i>
Cicad&aelig;.</i> They ceased as suddenly as they commenced. On the
following morning my baggage arrived, and, leaving my palkee, I
mounted a pony kindly sent for me by Mr. Hodgson, and commenced a
very steep ascent of about 3000 feet, winding along the face of a
steep, richly-wooded valley. The road zigzags extraordinarily in
and out of the innumerable lateral ravines, each with its water
course, dense jungle, and legion of leeches; the bite of these
blood-suckers gives no pain, but is fo1lowed by considerable
effusion of blood. They puncture through thick worsted stockings,
and even trousers, and, when full, roll in the form of a little
soft ball into the bottom of the shoe, where their presence is
hardly felt in walking.</p>

<p>Not only are the roadsides rich in plants, but native paths,
cutting off all the zigzags, run in straight lines up the steepest
hill-faces, and thus double the available means for botanising; and
it is all but impossible to leave the paths of one kind or other,
except for a yard or two up</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 108">[ 108 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the rocky ravines. Elephants, tigers, and
occasionally the rhinoceros, inhabit the foot of these hills, with
wild boars, leopards, etc.; but none are numerous. The elephant's
path is an excellent specimen of engineering&mdash;the opposite of
the native track, for it winds judiciously.</p>

<p>At about 1000 feet above Punkabaree, the vegetation is very
rich, and appears all the more so from the many turnings of the
road, affording glorious prospects of the foreshortened tropical
forests. The prevalent timber is gigantic, and scaled by climbing
<i>Leguminos&aelig;,</i> as <i>Bauhinias</i> and <i>Robinias,</i>
which sometimes sheath the trunks, or span the forest with huge
cables, joining tree to tree. Their trunks are also clothed with
parasitical Orchids, and still more beautifully with Pothos
(<i>Scindapsus</i>), Peppers, <i>Gnetum,</i> Vines, Convolvulus,
and <i>Bignoni&aelig;.</i> The beauty of the drapery of the
Pothos-leaves is pre-eminent, whether for the graceful folds the
foliage assumes, or for the liveliness of its colour. Of the more
conspicuous smaller trees, the wild banana is the most abundant,
its crown of very beautiful foliage contrasting with the
smaller-leaved plants amongst which it nestles; next comes a
screw-pine (<i>Pandanus</i>) with a straight stem and a tuft of
leaves; each eight or ten feet long, waving on all sides. <i>
Araliace&aelig;,</i> with smooth or armed slender trunks, and <i>
Mappa</i>-like <i>Euphorbiace&aelig;,</i> spread their long
petioles horizontally forth, each terminated with an ample leaf
some feet in diameter. Bamboo abounds everywhere: its dense tufts
of culms, 100 feet and upwards high, are as thick as a man's thigh
at the base. Twenty or thirty, species of ferns (including a
tree-fern) were luxuriant and handsome. Foliaceous lichens and a
few mosses appeared at 2000 feet. Such is the vegetation of the
roads through the tropical forests of the Outer-Himalaya.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 109">[ 109 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At about 4000 feet the road crossed a saddle, and ran along the
narrow crest of a hill, the top of that facing the plains of India,
and over which is the way to the interior ranges, amongst which
Dorjiling is placed, still twenty-five miles off. A little below
this a great change had taken place in the vegetation, marked,
first, by the appearance of a very English-looking bramble, which,
however, by way of proving its foreign origin, bore a very good
yellow fruit, called here the &ldquo;yellow raspberry.&rdquo;
Scattered oaks, of a noble species, with large lamellated cups and
magnificent foliage, succeeded; and along the ridge of the mountain
to Kursiong (a dawk bungalow at about 4,800 feet), the change in
the flora was complete.</p>

<p>The spring of this region and elevation most vividly recalled
that of England. The oak flowering, the birch bursting into leaf,
the violet, <i>Chrysosplenium, Stellaria</i> and <i>Arum,
Vaccinium,</i> wild strawberry, maple, geranium, bramble. A colder
wind blew here: mosses and lichens carpeted the banks and
roadsides: the birds and insects were very different from those
below; and everything proclaimed the marked change in elevation,
and not only in this, but in season, for I had left the winter of
the tropics and here encountered the spring of the temperate
zone.</p>

<p>The flowers I have mentioned are so notoriously the harbingers
of a European spring that their presence carries one home at once;
but, as species, they differ from their European prototypes, and
are accompanied at this elevation (and for 2000 feet higher up)
with tree-fern, Pothos, bananas, palms, figs, pepper, numbers of
epiphytal Orchids, and similar genuine tropical genera. The uniform
temperature and humidity of the region here favour the extension of
tropical plants into a temperate region; exactly as the same
conditions cause similar forms to reach</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 110">[ 110 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">higher latitudes in the southern hemisphere (as in
New Zealand, Tasmania, South Chili, etc.) than they do in the
northern.</p>

<p>Along this ridge I met with the first tree-fern. This species
seldom reaches the height of forty feet; the black trunk is but
three or four in girth, and the feathery crown is ragged in
comparison with the species of many other countries: it is the <i>
Alsophila gigantea,</i> and ascends nearly to 7000 feet
elevation.</p>

<p>Kursiong bungalow, where I stopped for a few hours, is superbly
placed, on a narrow mountain ridge. The west window looks down the
valley of the Balasun river, the east into that of the Mahanuddee:
both of these rise from the outer range, and flow in broad, deep,
and steep valleys (about 4000 feet deep) which give them their
respective names; and are richly wooded from the Terai to their
tops. Till reaching this spur, I had wound upwards along the
western slope of the Mahanuddee valley. The ascent from the spur at
Kursiong, to the top of the mountain (on the northern face of which
Dorjiling is situated), is along the eastern slope of the
Balasun.</p>

<p>From Kursiong a very steep zigzag leads up the mountain, through
a magnificent forest of cbesnut, walnut, oaks, and laurels. It is
difficult to conceive a grander mass of vegetation: the straight
shafts of the timber-trees shooting aloft, some naked and clean,
with grey, pale, or brown bark; others literally clothed for yards
with a continuous garment of epiphytes, one mass of blossoms,
especially the white Orchids <i>C&aelig;logynes,</i> which bloom in
a profuse manner, whitening their trunks like snow. More bulky
trunks were masses of interlacing climbers, <i>Araliace&aelig;,
Leguminos&aelig;, Vines,</i> and <i>Menisperme&aelig;,</i>
Hydrangea, and Peppers, enclosing a hollow, once filled by the now
strangled</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 111">[ 111 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">supporting tree, which had long ago decayed away.
From the sides and summit of these, supple branches hung forth,
either leafy or naked; the latter resembling cables flung from one
tree to another, swinging in the breeze, their rocking motion
increased by the weight of great bunches of ferns or Orchids, which
were perched aloft in the loops. Perpetual moisture nourishes this
dripping forest: and pendulous mosses and lichens are met with in
profusion.</p>

<p>Two thousand feet higher up, near Mahaldiram (whence the last
view of the plains is gained), European plants
appear,&mdash;Berberry, <i>Paris,</i> etc.; but here, night
gathered round, and I had still ten miles to go to the nearest
bungalow, that of Pacheem. The road still led along the eastern
slope of the Balasun valley, which was exceedingly steep, and so
cut up by ravines, that it winds in and out of gulleys almost
narrow enough to be jumped across.</p>

<p>It was very late before I arrived at Pacheem bungalow, the most
sinister-looking rest-house I ever saw, stuck on a little cleared
spur of the mountain, surrounded by dark forests, overhanging a
profound valley, and enveloped in mists and rain, and hideous in
architecture, being a miserable attempt to unite the Swiss cottage
with the suburban gothic; it combined a maximum of discomfort with
a minimum of good looks or good cheer. I was some time in finding
the dirty housekeeper, in an outhouse hard by, and then in waking
him. As he led me up the crazy verandah, and into a broad ghostly
room, without glass in the windows, or fire, or any one comfort, my
mind recurred to the stories told of the horrors of the Hartz
forest, and of the benighted traveller's situation therein. Cold
sluggish beetles hung to the damp walls,&mdash;and these I
immediately secured. After due exertions and perseverance with the
damp wood, a fire smoked lustily, and, by</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 112">[ 112 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">cajoling the gnome of a housekeeper, I procured
the usual roast fowl and potatos, with the accustomed sauce of a
strong smoky and singed flavour.*</p>

<p>Pacheem stands at an elevation of nearly 7300 feet, and as I
walked out on the following morning I met with English looking
plants in abundance, but was too early in the season to get aught
but the foliage of most. <i>Chryosplenium,</i> violet, <i>
Lobelia,</i> a small geranium, strawberry, five or six kinds of
bramble, <i>Arum, Paris, Convallaria, Stellaria, Rubia,
Vaccinium,</i> and various <i>Gnaphalia.</i> Of small bushes,
cornels, honeysuckles, and the ivy tribe predominated, with <i>
Symplocos</i> and <i>Skimmia, Eurya,</i> bushy brambles, having
simple or compound green or beautifully silky foliage; <i>
Hypericum,</i> Berberry, Hydrangea, Wormwood, <i>Adamia cyanea,
Viburnum,</i> Elder, dwarf bamboo, etc.</p>

<p>The climbing plants were still <i>Panax</i> or <i>Aralia,
Kadsura, Saurauja, Hydrangea,</i> Vines, <i>Smilax, Ampelopsis,
Polygona,</i> and, most beautiful of all, <i>Stauntonia,</i> with
pendulous racemes of lilac blossoms. Epiphytes were rarer, still I
found white and purple <i>C&aelig;loynes,</i> and other Orchids,
and a most noble white Rhododendron, whose truly enormous and
delicious lemon-scented blossoms strewed the ground. The trees were
one half oaks, one quarter Magnolias, and nearly another quarter
laurels, amongst which grew Himalayan kinds of birch, alder, maple,
holly, bird-cherry, common cherry, and apple. The absence of <i>
Leguminos&aelig;</i> was most remarkable, and the most prominent
botanical feature in the vegetation of this region: it is too high
for the tropical tribes of the warmer elevations, too low for the
Alpines, and probably too moist for those of temperate regions;
cool, equable, humid climates being generally</p>

<p class="fnote">* Since writing the above a comfortable house has
been erected at Senadah, the name now given to what was called
Pacheem Bungalow.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 113">[ 113 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">unfavourable to that order. Clematis was rare, and
other <i>Ranunculace&aelig;</i> still more so. <i>
Crucifer&aelig;</i> were absent, and, what was still more
remarkable, I found very few native species of grasses. Both <i>Poa
annua</i> and white Dutch clover flourished where accidentally
disseminated, but only in artificially cleared spots. Of ferns I
collected about sixty species, chiefly of temperate genera. The
supremacy of this temperate region consists in the infinite number
of forest trees, in the absence (in the usual proportion, at any
rate) of such common orders as <i>Composit&aelig;,
Leguminos&aelig;, Crucifer&aelig;,</i> and <i>
Ranunculace&aelig;,</i> and of Grasses amongst Monocotyledons, and
in the predominance of the rarer and more local families, as those
of Rhododendron, Camellia, Magnolia, Ivy, Cornel, Honeysuckle,
Hydrangea, Begonia, and Epiphytic orchids.</p>

<p>From Pacheem, the road runs in a northerly direction to
Dorjiling, still along the Balasun valley, till the saddle of the
great mountain Sinchul is crossed. This is narrow, stretching east
and west, and from it a spur projects northwards for five or six
miles, amongst the many mountains still intervening between it and
the snows. This saddle (alt. 7,400 feet) crossed, one is fairly
amongst the mountains: the plains behind are cut off by it; and in
front, the snows may be seen when the weather is propitious. The
valleys on this side of the mountain run northwards, and discharge
their streams into great rivers, which, coming from the snow, wind
amongst the hills, and debouche into the Teesta, to the east, where
it divides Sikkim from Bhotan.</p>

<p>Dorjiling station occupies a narrow ridge, which divides into
two spurs, descending steeply to the bed of the Great Rungeet
river, up whose course the eye is carried to the base of the great
snowy mountains. The ridge itself is</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 114">[ 114 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">very narrow at the top, along which most of the
houses are perched, while others occupy positions on its flanks,
where narrow <i>locations</i> on the east, and broader ones on the
west, are cleared from wood. The valleys on either side are at
least 6000 feet deep, forest-clad to the bottom, with very few and
small level spots, and no absolute precipice; from their flanks
project innumerable little spurs, occupied by native clearings.</p>

<p>My route lay along the east flank, overhanging the valley of the
Rungmo river. Looking east, the amphitheatre of hills from the
ridge I had crossed was very fine; enclosing an area some four
miles across and 4000 feet deep, clothed throughout with an
impenetrable, dark forest: there was not one clear patch except
near the very bottom, where were some scattered hamlets of two or
three huts each. The rock is everywhere near the surface, and the
road has been formed by blasting at very many places. A wooded
slope descends suddenly from the edge of the road, while, on the
other hand, a bank rises abruptly to the top of the ridge,
alternately mossy, rocky, and clayey, and presenting a good
geological section, all the way along, of the nucleus of Dorjiling
spur, exposing broken masses of gneiss. As I descended, I came upon
the upper limit of the chesnut, a tree second in abundance to the
oak; gigantic, tall, and straight in the trunk.</p>

<p>I arrived at Dorjiling on the 16th of April; a showery, cold
month at this elevation. I was so fortunate as to find Mr. Charles
Barnes (brother of my friend at Colgong), the sole tenant of a
long, cottage-like building, divided off into pairs of apartments,
which are hired by visitors. It is usual for Europeans to bring a
full establishment of servants (with bedding, etc.) to such
stations, but I had not done so, having been told that</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 115">[ 115 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">there was a furnished hotel in Dorjiling; and I
was, therefore, not a little indebted to Mr. Barnes for his kind
invitation to join his mess. As he was an active mountaineer, we
enjoyed many excursions together, in the two months and a half
during which we were companions.</p>

<p>Dr. Campbell procured me several active native (Lepcha) lads as
collectors, at wages varying from eight to twenty shillings a
month; these either accompanied me on my excursions, or went by
themselves into the jungles to collect plants, which I occupied
myself in drawing, dissecting, and ticketing: while the preserving
of them fell to the Lepchas, who, after a little training, became,
with constant superintendence, good plant-driers. Even at this
season (four weeks before the setting in of the rains) the weather
was very uncertain, so that the papers had generally to be dried by
the fire.</p>

<p>The hill-station or Sanatarium of Dorjiling owes its origin
(like Simla, Mussooree, etc.) to the necessity that exists in
India, of providing places where the health of Europeans may be
recruited by a more temperate climate. Sikkim proved an eligible
position for such an establishment, owing to its proximity to
Calcutta, which lies but 370 miles to the southward; whereas the
north-west stations mentioned above are upwards of a thousand miles
from that city. Dorjiling ridge varies in height from 6,500 to
7,500 feet above the level of the sea; 8000 feet being the
elevation at which the mean temperature most nearly coincides with
that of London, viz., 50&deg;.</p>

<p>Sikkim was, further, the only available spot for a Sanatarium
throughout the whole range of the Himalaya, east of the extreme
western frontier of Nepal; being a protected state, and owing no
allegiance, except to the British government; which, after the
Rajah had been driven</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 116">[ 116 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">from the country by the Ghorkas, in 1817, replaced
him on his throne, and guaranteed him the sovereignty. Our main
object in doing this was to retain Sikkim as a fender between Nepal
and Bhotan: and but for this policy, the aggressive Nepalese would,
long ere this, have possessed themselves of Sikkim, Bhotan, and the
whole Himalaya, eastwards to the borders of Burmah.*</p>

<p>From 1817 to 1828 no notice was taken of Sikkim, till a frontier
dispute occurred between the Lepchas and Nepalese, which was
referred (according to the terms of the treaty) to the British
Government. During the arrangement of this, Dorjiling was visited
by a gentleman of high scientific attainments, Mr. J. W. Grant, who
pointed out its eligibility as a site for a Sanatarium to Lord
William Bentinck, then Governor-General; dwelling especially upon
its climate, proximity to Calcutta, and accessibility; on its
central position between Tibet, Bhotan, Nepal, and British India;
and on the good example a peaceably-conducted and well-governed
station would be to our turbulent neighbours in that quarter. The
suggestion was cordially received, and Major Herbert (the late
eminent Surveyor-General of India) and Mr. Grant were employed to
report further on the subject.</p>

<p>The next step taken was that of requesting the Rajah to cede a
tract of country which should include Dorjiling, for an equivalent
in money or land. His first demand was unreasonable; but on further
consideration he surrendered Dorjiling unconditionally, and a sum
of 300 pounds per</p>

<p class="fnote">* Of such being their wish the Nepalese have never
made any secret, and they are said to have asked permission from
the British to march an army across Sikkim for the purpose of
conquering Bhotan, offering to become more peaceable neighbours to
us than the Bhotanese are. Such they would doubtless have proved,
but the Nepal frontier is considered broad enough already.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 117">[ 117 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">annum was granted to him as an equivalent for what
was then a worthless uninhabited mountain. In 1840 Dr. Campbell was
removed from Nepal as superintendent of the new station, and was
entrusted with the charge of the political relations between the
British and Sikkim government.</p>

<p>Once established, Dorjiling rapidly increased. Allotments of
land were purchased by Europeans for building dwelling-houses;
barracks and a bazaar were formed, with accommodation for invalid
European soldiers; a few official residents, civil and military,
formed the nucleus of a community, which was increased by retired
officers and their families, and by temporary visitors in search of
health, or the luxury of a cool climate and active exercise.</p>

<p>For the first few years matters went on smoothly with the Rajah,
whose minister (or Dewan) was upright and intelligent: but the
latter, on his death, was succeeded by the present Dewan, a
Tibetan, and a relative of the Ranee (or Rajah's wife); a man
unsurpassed for insolence and avarice, whose aim was to monopolise
the trade of the country, and to enrich himself at its expense.
Every obstacle was thrown by him in the way of a good understanding
between Sikkim and the British government. British subjects were
rigorously excluded from Sikkim; every liberal offer for free trade
and intercourse was rejected, generally with insolence; merchandise
was taxed, and notorious offenders, refugees from the British
territories, were harboured; despatches were detained; and the
Vakeels, or Rajah's representatives, were chosen for their
insolence and incapacity. The conduct of the Dewan throughout was
Indo-Chinese; assuming, insolent, aggressive, never perpetrating
open violence, but by petty insults effectually preventing all good
understanding. He was met</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 118">[ 118 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">by neglect or forbearance on the part of the
Calcutta government; and by patience and passive resistance at
Dorjiling. Our inaction and long-suffering were taken for weakness,
and our concessions for timidity. Such has been our policy in
China, Siam, and Burmah, and in each instance the result has been
the same. Had it been insisted that the terms of the treaty should
be strictly kept, and had the first act of insolence been noticed,
we should have maintained the best relations with Sikkim, whose
people and rulers (with the exception of the Dewan and his faction)
have proved themselves friendly throughout, and most anxious for
unrestricted communication.</p>

<p>These political matters have not, however, prevented the rapid
increase of Dorjiling; the progress of which, during the two years
I spent in Sikkim, resembled that of an Australian colony, not only
in amount of building, but in the accession of native families from
the surrounding countries. There were not a hundred inhabitants
under British protection when the ground was transferred; there are
now four thousand. At the former period there was no trade
whatever; there is now a very considerable one, in musk, salt,
gold-dust, borax, soda, woollen cloths, and especially in poneys,
of which the Dewan in one year brought on his own account upwards
of 50 into Dorjiling.* The trade has been greatly increased by the
annual fair which Dr. Campbell has established at the foot of the
hills, to which many thousands of natives flock from all quarters,
and which exercises a most beneficial influence throughout the
neighbouring territories. At this, prizes (in medals, money, and
kind) are given for agricultural implements</p>

<p class="fnote">* The Tibetan pony, though born and bred 10,000 to
14,000 feet above the sea, is one of the most active and useful
animals in the plains of Bengal, powerful and hardy, and when well
trained early, docile, although by nature vicious and
obstinate.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 119">[ 119 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and produce, stock, etc., by the originator and a
few friends; a measure attended with eminent success.</p>

<p>In estimating in a sanitory point of view the value of any
health-station, little reliance can be placed on the general
impressions of invalids, or even of residents; the opinion of each
varies with the nature and state of his complaint, if ill, or with
his idiosyncracy and disposition, if well. I have seen prejudiced
invalids rapidly recovering, in spite of themselves, and all the
while complaining in unmeasured terms of the climate of Dorjiling,
and abusing it as killing them. Others are known who languish under
the heat of the plains at one season, and the damp at another; and
who, though sickening and dying under its influence, yet
consistently praise a tropical climate to the last. The opinions of
those who resort to Dorjiling in health, differ equally; those of
active minds invariably thoroughly enjoy it, while the mere lounger
or sportsman mopes. The statistical tables afford conclusive proofs
of the value of the climate to Europeans suffering from acute
diseases, and they are corroborated by the returns of the medical
officer in charge of the station. With respect to its suitability
to the European constitution I feel satisfied, and that much saving
of life, health, and money would be effected were European troops
drafted thither on their arrival in Bengal, instead of being
stationed in Calcutta, exposed to disease, and temptation to those
vices which prove fatal to so many hundreds. This, I have been
given to understand, was the view originally taken by the Court of
Directors, but it has never been carried out.</p>

<p>I believe that children's faces afford as good an index as any
to the healthfulness of a climate, and in no part of the world is
there a more active, rosy, and bright young</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 120">[ 120 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">community, than at Dorjiling. It is incredible
what a few weeks of that mountain air does for the India-born
children of European parents: they are taken there sickly, pallid
or yellow, soft and flabby, to become transformed into models of
rude health and activity.</p>

<p>There are, however, disorders to which the climate (in common
with all damp ones) is not at all suited; such are especially
dysentery, bowel complaints, and liver complaints of long standing;
which are not benefited by a residence on these hills, though how
much worse they might have become in the plains is not shown. I
cannot hear that the climate aggravates, but it certainly does not
remove them. Whoever is suffering from the debilitating effects of
any of the multifarious acute maladies of the plains, finds instant
relief, and acquires a stock of health that enables him to resist
fresh attacks, under circumstances similar to those which before
engendered them.</p>

<p>Natives of the low country, and especially Bengalees, are far
from enjoying the climate as Europeans do, being liable to sharp
attacks of fever and ague, from which the poorly clad natives are
not exempt. It is, however, difficult to estimate the effects of
exposure upon the Bengalees, who sleep on the bare and often damp
ground, and adhere, with characteristic prejudice, to the attire of
a torrid climate, and to a vegetable diet, under skies to which
these are least of all adapted.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that Europeans who have resided in the
plains can, on their first arrival, expose themselves with impunity
to the cold of these elevations; this was shown in the winter of
1848 and 1849, when troops brought up to Dorjiling were cantoned in
newly-built dwellings, on a high exposed ridge 8000 feet above the
sea, and lay, insufficiently protected, on a floor of</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 121">[ 121 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">loosely laid planks, exposed to the cold wind,
when the ground without was covered with snow. Rheumatisms, sharp
febrile attacks, and dysenteries ensued, which were attributed in
the public prints to the unhealthy nature of the climate of
Dorjiling.</p>

<p>The following summary of hospital admissions affords the best
test of the healthiness of the climate, embracing, as the period
does, the three most fatal months to European troops in India. Out
of a detachment (105 strong) of H.M. 80th Regiment stationed at
Dorjiling, in the seven months from January to July inclusive,
there were sixty-four admissions to the hospital, or, on the
average, 4-1/3 per cent. per month; and only two deaths, both of
dysentery. Many of these men had suffered frequently in the plains
from acute dysentery and hepatic affections, and many others had
aggravated these complaints by excessive drinking, and two were
cases of delirium tremens. During the same period, the number of
entries at Calcutta or Dinapore would probably have more than
trebled this.</p>
