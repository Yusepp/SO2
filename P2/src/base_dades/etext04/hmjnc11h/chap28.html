<p class="first">Churra Poonji is said to be so called from the
number of streams in the neighbourhood, and poonji, “a
village” (Khas.): it was selected for a European station,
partly from the elevation and consequent healthiness of the spot,
and partly from its being on the high road from Silhet to
Gowahatty, on the Burrampooter, the capital of Assam, which is
otherwise only accessible by ascending that river, against both its
current and the perennial east wind. A rapid postal communication
is hereby secured: but the extreme unhealthiness of the northern
foot of the mountains effectually precludes all other intercourse
for nine months in the year.</p>

<p>On the first opening up of the country, the Europeans were
brought into sanguinary collision with the Khasias, who fought
bravely with bows and arrows, displaying a most blood-thirsty and
cruel disposition. This is indeed</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 273">[ 273 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">natural to them; and murders continued very
frequent as preludes to the most trifling robberies, until the
extreme penalty of our law was put in force. Even now, some of the
tributary Rajahs are far from quiet under our rule, and various
parts of the country are not safe to travel in. The Garrows, who
occupy the western extremity of this range, at the bend of the
Burrampooter, are still in a savage state. Human sacrifices and
polyandry are said to be frequent amongst them, and their orgies
are detestable. Happily we are hardly ever brought into collision
with them, except by their occasional depredations on the Assam and
Khasia frontier: their country is very unhealthy, and is said to
contain abundance of coal, iron, and lime.</p>

<p>We seldom employed fewer than twelve or fourteen of the natives
as collectors, and when travelling, from thirty to forty as
coolies, etc. They are averse to rising early, and are intolerably
filthy in their persons, though not so in their cottages, which are
very poor, with broad grass roofs reaching nearly to the ground,
and usually encircled by bamboo fences; the latter custom is not
common in savage communities, and perhaps indicates a dread of
treachery. The beams are of hewn wood (they do not use saws), often
neatly carved, and the doors turn on good wooden pivots. They have
no windows, and the fire is made on the floor: the utensils, etc.
are placed on hanging shelves and in baskets.</p>

<p>The Khasia people are of the Indo-Chinese race; they are short,
very stout, and muscular, with enormous calves and knees, rather
narrow eyes and little beard, broad, high cheekbones, flat noses,
and open nostrils. I believe that a few are tattooed. The hair is
gathered into a top-knot, and sometimes shaved off the forehead and
temples. A loose cotton shirt, often striped blue and red,
without</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 274">[ 274 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">sleeves and bordered with long thread fringes, is
their principal garment; it is gathered into a girdle of silver
chains by people of rank. A cotton robe is sometimes added, with a
large cotton turban or small skull-cap. The women wear a long cloth
tied in a knot across the breast. During festivals both men and
women load themselves with silk robes, fans, peacock’s
feathers, and gold and silver ornaments of great value, procured
from Assam, many of which are said to be extremely curious, but I
regret to say that I never saw any of them. On these occasions
spirits are drunk, and dancing kept up all night: the dance is
described as a slow ungraceful motion, the women being tightly
swathed in cloths.</p>

<p>All their materials are brought from Assam; the only articles in
constant use, of their own manufacture, being a rude sword or knife
with a wooden handle and a long, narrow, straight blade of iron,
and the baskets with head-straps, like those used by the Lepchas,
but much neater; also a netted bag of pine-apple fibre (said to
come from Silhet) which holds a clasp-knife, comb, flint, steel,
and betel-nut box. They are much addicted to chewing pawn
(betel-nut, pepper leaves, and lime) all day long, and their red
saliva looks like blood on the paths. Besides the sword I have
described, they carry bows and arrows, and rarely a lance, and a
bamboo wicker-work shield.</p>

<p>We found the Khasias to be sulky intractable fellows,
contrasting unpleasantly with the Lepchas; wanting in quickness,
frankness, and desire to please, and obtrusively independent in
manner; nevertheless we had a head man who was very much the
reverse of this, and whom we had never any cause to blame. Their
language is, I believe, Indo-Chinese and monosyllabic: it is
disagreeably nasal and guttural, and there are several dialects and
accents in</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 275">[ 275 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">contiguous villages. All inflections are made by
prefixing syllables, and when using the Hindoo language, the future
is invariably substituted for the past tense. They count up to a
hundred, and estimate distances by the number of mouthfuls of pawn
they eat on the road.</p>

<p>Education has been attempted by missionaries with partial
success, and the natives are said to have shown themselves apt
scholars. Marriage is a very loose tie amongst them, and hardly any
ceremony attends it. We were informed that the husband does not
take his wife home, but enters her father’s household, and is
entertained there. Divorce and an exchange of wives is common, and
attended with no disgrace: thus the son often forgets his
father’s name and person before he grows up, but becomes
strongly attached to his mother. The sister’s son inherits
both property and rank, and the proprietors’ or Rajahs’
offspring are consequently often reared in poverty and neglect. The
usual toy of the children is the bow and arrow, with which they are
seldom expert; they are said also to spin pegtops like the English,
climb a greased pole, and run round with a beam turning
horizontally on an upright, to which it is attached by a pivot.</p>

<p>The Khasias eat fowls, and all meat, especially pork, potatos
and vegetables, dried and half putrid fish in abundance, but they
have an aversion to milk, which is very remarkable, as a great
proportion of their country is admirably adapted for pasturage. In
this respect, however, they assimilate to the Chinese, and many
Indo-Chinese nations who are indifferent to milk, as are the Sikkim
people. The Bengalees, Hindoos, and Tibetans, on the other hand,
consume immense quantities of milk. They have no sheep, and few
goats or cattle, the latter of which are kept for slaughter; they
have, however, plenty</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 276">[ 276 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">of pigs and fowls. Eggs are most abundant, but
used for omens only, and it is a common, but disgusting occurrence,
to see large groups employed for hours in breaking them upon
stones, shouting and quarrelling, surrounded by the mixture of
yellow yolks and their red pawn saliva.</p>

<p>The funeral ceremonies are the only ones of any importance, and
are often conducted with barbaric pomp and expense; and rude stones
of gigantic proportions are erected as monuments, singly or in
rows, circles, or supporting one another, like those of Stonehenge,
which they rival in dimensions and appearance. The body is burned,
though seldom during the rains, from the difficulty of obtaining a
fire; it is therefore preserved in honey (which is abundant and
good) till the dry season: a practice I have read of as prevailing
among some tribes in the Malay peninsula. Spirits are drunk on
these occasions; but the hill Khasia is not addicted to
drunkenness, though some of the natives of the low valleys are very
much so. These ascend the rocky faces of the mountains by ladders,
to the Churra markets, and return loaded at night, apparently all
but too drunk to stand; yet they never miss their footing in places
which are most dangerous to persons unaccustomed to such
situations.</p>

</center>

<p>The Khasias are superstitious, but have no religion; like the
Lepchas, they believe in a supreme being, and in deities of the
grove, cave, and stream. Altercations are often decided by holding
the disputants’ heads under water, when the longest winded
carries his point. Fining is a common punishment, and death for
grave offences. The changes of the moon are accounted for by the
theory that this orb, who is a man, monthly falls in love with his
wife’s mother, who throws ashes in his face.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 277">[ 277 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">The sun is female; and Mr. Yule* (who is my
authority) says that the Pleiades are called “the
Hen-man” (as in Italy “the chickens”); also that
they have names for the twelve months; they do not divide their
time by weeks, but hold a market every four days. These people are
industrious, and good cultivators of rice, millet, and legumes of
many kinds. Potatoes were introduced amongst them about twenty
years ago by Mr. Inglis, and they have increased so rapidly that
the Calcutta market is now supplied by their produce. They keep
bees in rude hives of logs of wood.</p>

<p>The flat table-land on which Churra Poonji is placed, is three
miles long and two broad, dipping abruptly in front and on both
sides, and rising behind towards the main range, of which it is a
spur. The surface of this area is everywhere intersected by
shallow, rocky watercourses, which are the natural drains for the
deluge that annually visits it. The western part is undulated and
hilly, the southern rises in rocky ridges of limestone and coal,
and the eastern is very flat and stony, broken only by low isolated
conical mounds.</p>

<p>The scenery varies extremely at different parts of the surface.
Towards the flat portion, where the English reside, the aspect is
as bleak and inhospitable as can be imagined: a thin stratum of
marshy or sandy soil covers a tabular mass of cold red sandstone;
and there is not a tree, and scarcely a shrub to be seen, except
occasional clumps of Pandanus. The low white bungalows are few in
number, and very scattered, some of them being a mile asunder,
enclosed with stone walls and shrubs; and a small white</p>

<p class="fnote">* I am indebted to Mr. Inglis for most of this
information relating to the Khasias, which I have since found, with
much more that is curious and interesting, in a paper by Lieut.
Yule in Bengal Asiat. Soc. Journal.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 278">[ 278 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">church, disused on account of the damp, stands
lonely in the centre of all.</p>

<p>The views from the margins of this plateau are magnificent: 4000
feet below are bay-like valleys, carpetted as with green velvet,
from which rise tall palms, tree-ferns with spreading crowns, and
rattans shooting their pointed heads, surrounded with feathery
foliage, as with ostrich plumes, far above the great trees. Beyond
are the Jheels, looking like a broad shallow sea with the tide half
out, bounded in the blue distance by the low-hills of Tipperah. To
the right and left are the scarped red rocks and roaring
waterfalls, shooting far over the cliff’s, and then arching
their necks as they expand in feathery foam, over which rainbows
float, forming and dissolving as the wind sways the curtains of
spray from side to side.</p>

<p>To the south of Churra the lime and coal measures rise abruptly
in flat-topped craggy hills, covered with brushwood and small
trees. Similar hills are seen far westward across the intervening
valleys in the Garrow country, rising in a series of steep isolated
ranges, 300 to 400 feet above the general level of the country, and
always skirting the south face of the mountains. Considerable
caverns penetrate the limestone, the broken surface of which rock
presents many picturesque and beautiful spots, like the same rocks
in England.</p>

<p>Westward the plateau becomes very hilly, bare, and grassy, with
the streams broad and full, but superficial and rocky,
precipitating themselves in low cascades over tabular masses of
sand-stone. At Mamloo their beds are deeper, and full of brushwood,
and a splendid valley and amphitheatre of red cliffs and cascades,
rivalling those of Moosmai (<a href="chap27.html#page 261">p.
261</a>), bursts suddenly into view. Mamloo is a large village, on
the top of a spur, to the westward: it</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 279">[ 279 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><img src="images2/fig28.jpg" width="321" height="287" alt=
"Mamloo cascades"></center>

<p class="first">is buried in a small forest, particularly rich in
plants, and is defended by a stone wall behind: the only road is
tunnelled through the sandstone rock, under the wall; and the spur
on either side dips precipitously, so that the place is almost
impregnable if properly defended. A sanguinary conflict took place
here between the British and the Khasias, which terminated in the
latter being driven over the precipices, beneath which many of them
were shot. The fan-palm, <i>Chamærops Khasiana</i>
(“Pakha,” Khas.), grows on the cliff’s near
Mamloo: it may be seen on looking over the edge of the plateau, its
long curved trunk rising out of the naked rocks, but its site is
generally</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 280">[ 280 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">inaccessible;* while near it grows the <i>
Saxifragis ciliaris</i> of our English gardens, a common plant in
the north-west Himalaya, but extremely scarce in Sikkim and the
Khasia mountains.</p>

<p>The descent of the Mamloo spur is by steps, alternating with
pebbly flats, for 1500 feet, to a saddle which connects the Churra
hills with those of Lisouplang to the westward. The rise is along a
very steep narrow ridge to a broad long grassy hill, 3,500 feet
high, whence an extremely steep descent leads to the valley of the
Boga-panee, and the great mart of Chela, which is at the embouchure
of that river. The transverse valley thus formed by the Mamloo
spur, is full of orange groves, whose brilliant green is
particularly conspicuous from above. At the saddle below Mamloo are
some jasper rocks, which are the sandstone altered by basalt.
Fossil shells are recorded to have been found by Dr.
M’Lelland† on some of the flats, which he considers to
be raised beaches: but we sought in vain for any evidence of this
theory beyond the pebbles, whose rounding we attributed to the
action of superficial streams.</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to give within the limits of this
narrative any idea of the Khasia flora, which is, in extent and
number of fine plants, the richest in India, and probably in all
Asia. We collected upwards of 2000 flowering plants within ten
miles of the station of Churra, besides 150 ferns, and a profusion
of mosses, lichens, and fungi. This extraordinary exuberance of
species is not so much attributable to the elevation, for the whole
Sikkim Himalaya</p>

<p class="fnote">* This species is very closely allied to, if not
identical with <i>P. Martiana</i> of Nepal; which ascends to 8000
feet in the western Himalaya, where it is annually covered with
snow: it is not found in Sikkim, but an allied species occurs in
Affghanistan, called <i>P. Ritcheana</i>: the dwarf palm of
southern Europe is a fourth species.<br>

M’Lelland in the “Bengal Asiatic Society’s
Journal.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">(three times more elevated) does not contain 500
more flowering plants, and far fewer ferns, etc.; but to the
variety of exposures; namely, 1. the Jheels, 2. the tropical
jungles, both in deep, hot, and wet valleys, and on drier slopes;
3. the rocks; 4. the bleak table-lands and stony soils; 5. the
moor-like uplands, naked and exposed, where many species and genera
appear at 5000 to 6000 feet, which are not found on the outer
ranges of Sikkim under 10,000.* In fact, strange as it may appear,
owing to this last cause, the temperate flora descends fully 4000
feet lower in the latitude of Khasia (25° N.) than in that of
Sikkim (27° N.), though the former is two degrees nearer the
equator.</p>

<p>The <i>Pandanus</i> alone forms a conspicuous feature in the
immediate vicinity of Churra; while the small woods about Mamloo,
Moosmai, and the coal-pits, are composed of <i>Symplocos,</i>
laurels, brambles, and jasmines, mixed with small oaks and <i>
Photinia,</i> and many tropical genera of trees and shrubs.</p>

<p><i>Orchideæ</i> are, perhaps, the largest natural order in
the Khasia, where fully 250 kinds grow, chiefly on trees and rocks,
but many are terrestrial, inhabiting damp woods and grassy slopes.
I doubt whether in any other part of the globe the species of
orchids outnumber those of any other natural order, or form so
large a proportion of the flora. Balsams are next in relative
abundance (about twenty-five), both tropical and temperate kinds,
of great beauty and variety in colour, form, and size of blossom.
Palms amount to fourteen, of which the <i>Chamærops</i> and
<i>Arenga</i> are the only genera not found in Sikkim. Of bamboos
there are also fifteen, and of other grasses 150, which is an
immense proportion, considering that the</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 282">[ 282 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Indian flora (including those of Ceylon, Kashmir,
and all the Himalaya), hardly contains 400. <i>Scitamineæ</i>
also are abundant, and extremely beautiful; we collected
thirty-seven kinds.</p>

<p>No rhododendron grows at Churra, but several species occur a
little further north: there is but one pine (<i>P. Khasiana</i>)
besides the yew, (and two <i>Podocarpi</i>), and that is only found
in the drier interior regions. Singular to say, it is a species not
seen in the Himalaya or elsewhere, but very nearly allied to <i>
Pinua longifolia,</i>* though more closely resembling the Scotch
fir than that tree does.</p>

<p>The natural orders whose rarity is most noticeable, are <i>
Cruciferæ,</i> represented by only three kinds, and <i>
Caryophylleæ.</i> Of <i>Ranunculaceæ,</i> there are six
or seven species of <i>Clematis,</i> two of <i>Anemone,</i> one <i>
Delphinium,</i> three of <i>Thalictrum,</i> and two <i>
Ranunculi.</i> <i>Compositæ</i> and <i>Leguminosæ</i>
are far more numerous than in Sikkim.</p>

<p>The climate of Khasia is remarkable for the excessive rain-fall.
Attention was first drawn to this by Mr. Yule, who stated, that in
the month of August, 1841, 264 inches fell, or twenty-two feet; and
that during five successive days, thirty inches fell in every
twenty-four hours! Dr. Thomson and I also recorded thirty inches in
one day and night, and during the seven months of our stay, upwards
of 500 inches fell, so that the total annual fall perhaps greatly
exceeded 600 inches, or fifty feet, which</p>

<p class="fnote">* Cone-bearing pines with long leaves, like the
common Scotch fir, are found in Asia, and as far south as the
Equator (in Borneo) and also inhabit Arracan, the Malay Peninsula,
Sumatra, and South China. It is a very remarkable fact that no
Gymnospermous tree inhabits the Peninsula of India; not even the
genus <i>Podocarpus,</i> which includes most of the tropical
Gymnosperms, and is technically coniferous, and has glandular woody
fibre; though like the yew it bears berries. Two species of this
genus are found in the Khasia, and one advances as far west as
Nepal. The absence of oaks and of the above genera
(<i>Podocarpus</i> and <i>Pinus</i>) is one of the most
characteristic differences between the botany of the east and west
shores of the Bay of Bengal.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 283">[ 283 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">has been registered in succeeding years! From
April, 1849, to April, 1850, 502 inches (forty-two feet) fell. This
unparalleled amount is attributable to the abruptness of the
mountains which face the Bay of Bengal, from which they are
separated by 200 miles of Jheels and Sunderbunds.</p>

<p>This fall is very local: at Silhet, not thirty miles further
south, it is under 100 inches; at Gowahatty, north of the Khasia in
Assam, it is about 80; and even on the hills, twenty miles inland
from Churra itself, the fall is reduced to 200. At the Churra
station, the distribution of the rain is very local; my gauges,
though registering the same amount when placed beside a good one in
the station; when removed half a mile, received a widely different
quantity, though the different gauges gave nearly the same mean
amount at the end of each whole month.</p>

<p>The direct effect of this deluge is to raise the little streams
about Churra fourteen feet in as many hours, and to inundate the
whole flat; from which, however, the natural drainage is so
complete, as to render a tract, which in such a climate and
latitude should be clothed with exuberant forest, so sterile, that
no tree finds support, and there is no soil for cultivation of any
kind whatsoever, not even of rice. Owing, however, to the hardness
of the horizontally stratified sandstone, the streams have not cut
deep channels, nor have the cataracts worked far back into the
cliffs. The limestone alone seems to suffer, and the turbid streams
from it prove how rapidly it is becoming denuded. The great mounds
of angular gravel on the Churra flat, are perhaps the remains of an
extensive deposit, fifty feet thick, elsewhere washed away by these
rains; and I have remarked traces of the same over many slopes of
the hills around.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 284">[ 284 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mean temperature of Churra (elev. 4000 feet) is about
66°, or 16° below that of Calcutta; which, allowing for
2·5° of northing, gives 1° of temperature to every
290 to 300 feet of ascent. In summer the thermometer often rises to
88° and 90°; and in the winter, owing to the intense
radiation, hoar-frost is frequent. Such a climate is no less
inimical to the cultivation of plants, than is the wretched soil:
of this we saw marked instances in the gardens of two of the
resident officers, Lieutenants Raban and Cave, to whom we were
indebted for the greatest kindness and hospitality. These gentlemen
are indefatigable horticulturists, and took a zealous interest in
our pursuits, accompanying us in our excursions, enriching our
collections in many ways, and keeping an eye to them and to our
plant-driers during our absence from the station. In their gardens
the soil had to be brought from a considerable distance, and
dressed copiously with vegetable matter. Bamboo clumps were planted
for shelter within walls, and native shrubs, rhododendrons, etc.,
introduced. Many <i>Orchideæ</i> throve well on the branches
of the stunted trees which they had planted, and some superb kinds
of <i>Hedychium</i> in the ground; but a very few English garden
plants throve in the flower-beds. Even in pots and frames,
geraniums, etc., would rot, from the rarity of sunshine, which is
as prejudicial as the damp and exposure. Still many wild shrubs of
great interest and beauty flourished, and some European ones
succeeded with skill and management; as geraniums, <i>Salvia,
Petunia,</i> nasturtium, chrysanthemum, <i>Kennedya rubicunda,
Maurandya,</i> and Fuchsia. The daisy seed sent from England as
double, came up very poor and single. Dahlias do not thrive, nor
double balsams. Now they have erected small but airy green-houses,
and sunlight is the only desideratum.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of June, we started for the northern or Assam face of
the mountains. The road runs between the extensive and populous
native village, or poonji, on the left, and a deep valley on the
right, and commands a beautiful view of more waterfalls. Beyond
this it ascends steeply, and the sandstone on the road itself is
curiously divided into parallelograms, like hollow bricks,*
enclosing irregularly shaped nodules, while in other places it
looks as if it had been run or fused: spherical concretions of
sand, coloured concentrically by infiltration, are common in it,
which have been regarded as seeds, shells, etc.; it also contained
spheres of iron pyrites. The general appearance of much of this
rock is as if it had been bored by <i>Teredines</i> (ship worms),
but I never detected any trace of fossils. It is often beautifully
ripple-marked, and in some places much honeycombed, and full of
shales and narrow seams of coal, resting on a white under-clay full
of root-fibres, like those of <i>Stigmaria.</i></p>

<p>At about 5000 feet the country is very open and bare, the ridges
being so uniform and flat-topped, that the broad valleys they
divide are hidden till their precipitous edges are reached; and the
eye wanders far east and west over a desolate level grassy country,
unbroken, save by the curious flat-topped hills I have described as
belonging to the limestone formation, which lie to the south-west.
These features continue for eight miles, when a sudden descent of
600 or 700 feet, leads into the valley of the Kala-panee (Black
water) river, where there is a very dark and damp bungalow, which
proved a very great accommodation to us.†</p>

<p class="fnote">* I have seen similar bricks in the sandstones of
the coal-districts of Yorkshire; they are very puzzling, and are
probably due to some very obscure crystalline action analogous to
jointing and cleavage.<br>
 † It may be of use to the future botanist in this country
to mention a small wood on the right of this road, near the village
of Surureem, as an excellent botanical station: the trees are
chiefly <i>Rhododendron arboreum,</i> figs, oaks, laurels,
magnolias, and chestnuts, on whose limbs are a profusion of <i>
Orchideæ,</i> and amongst which a Rattan palm occurs.</p>

<p>Lailang-kot is another village full of iron forges, from a
height near which a splendid view is obtained over the Churra flat.
A few old and very stunted shrubs of laurel and <i>Symplocos</i>
grow on its bleak surface, and these are often sunk from one to
three feet in a well in the horizontally stratified sandstone. I
could only account for this by supposing it to arise from the drip
from the trees, and if so, it is a wonderful instance of the
wearing effects of water, and of the great age which small bushes
sometimes attain.</p>

<p>The vegetation is more alpine at Kala-panee (elevation, 5,300
feet); <i>Benthamia, Kadsura, Stauntonia, Illicium, Actinidia,
Helwingia, Corylopsis,</i> and berberry—all Japan and
Chinese, and most of them Dorjiling genera—appear here, with
the English yew, two rhododendrons, and <i>Bucklandia.</i> There
are no large trees, but a bright green jungle of small ones and
bushes, many of which are very rare and curious. <i>Luculia
Pinceana</i> makes a gorgeous show here in October.</p>

<p>The sandstone to the east of Kala-panee is capped by some beds,
forty feet thick, of conglomerate worn into cliffs; these are the
remains of a very extensive horizontally stratified formation, now
all but entirely denuded. In the valley itself, the sandstone
alternates with alum shales, which rest on a bed of quartz
conglomerate, and the latter on black greenstone. In the bed of the
river, whose waters are beautifully clear, are hornstone rocks,
dipping north-east, and striking north-west. Beyond the Kalapanee
the road ascends about 600 feet, and is well quarried in hard
greenstone; and passing through a narrow gap of</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 287">[ 287 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">conglomerate rock,* enters a shallow, wild, and
beautiful valley, through which it runs for several miles. The
hills on either side are of greenstone capped by tabular sandstone,
immense masses of which have been precipitated on the floor of the
valley, producing a singularly wild and picturesque scene. In the
gloom of the evening it is not difficult for a fertile imagination
to fancy castles and cities cresting the heights above.†</p>

<p>There is some cultivation here of potatoes, and of <i>Rhysicosia
vestita</i> a beautiful purple-flowered leguminous plant, with
small tuberous roots. Beyond this, a high ridge is gained above the
valley of the Boga-panee, the largest river in the Khasia; from
this the Bhotan Himalaya may be seen in clear weather, at the
astonishing distance of from 160 to 200 miles! The vegetation here
suddenly assumes a different aspect, from the quantity of stunted
fir-trees clothing the north side of the valley, which rises very
steeply 1000 feet above the river: quite unaccountably, however,
not one grows on the south face. A new oak also appears abundantly;
it has leaves like the English, whose gnarled habit it also
assumes.</p>

<p>The descent is very steep, and carried down a slope of
greenstone;‡ the road then follows a clear affluent of the
Boga-panee, and afterwards winds along the margin of that river,
which is a rapid turbulent stream, very muddy, and</p>

<p class="fnote">* Formed of rolled masses of greenstone and
sandstone, united by a white and yellow cement.<br>
† <i>Hydrangea</i> grows here, with ivy, <i>Mussœnda,
Pyrua,</i> willow, <i>Viburnum, Parnassia, Anemone, Leycesteria
formosa, Neillia, Rubus, Astilbe,</i> rose, <i>Panax,</i> apple,
<i>Bucklandia, Daphne,</i> pepper, <i>Scindapsus, Pierix,</i>
holly, <i>Lilium giganteum</i> (“Kalang tatti,” Khas.),
<i>Camellia, Elæocarpus, Buddleia,</i> etc. Large bees’
nests hang from the rocks.<br>
‡ This greenstone decomposes into a thick bed of red clay;
it is much intersected by fissures or cleavage planes at all
angles, whose surfaces are covered with a shining polished
superficial layer; like the fissures in the cleavage planes of the
gneiss granite of Kinchinjhow, whose adjacent surfaces are coated
with a glassy waved layer of hornblende. This polishing of the
surfaces is generally attributed to their having been in contact
and rubbed together, an explanation which is wholly unsatisfactory
to me; no such motion could take place in cleavage planes which
often intersect, and were it to occur, it would not produce two
polished surfaces of an interposed layer of a softer mineral. It is
more probably due to metamorphic action.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 288">[ 288 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">hence contrasting remarkably with the Kala-panee.
It derives its mud from the decomposition of granite, which is
washed by the natives for iron, and in which rock it rises to the
eastward. Thick beds of slate crop out by the roadside (strike
north-east and dip north-west), and are continued along the bed of
the river, passing into conglomerates, chert, purple slates, and
crystalline sandstones, with pebbles, and angular masses of schist.
Many of these rocks are much crumpled, others quite flat, and they
are overlaid by soft, variegated gneiss, which is continued
alternately with the slates to the top of the hills on the opposite
side.</p>

<p>Small trees of hornbeam grow near the river, with <i>Rhus,
Xanthoxylon, Vaccinium, Gualtheria,</i> and <i>Spiræa,</i>
while many beautiful ferns, mosses, and orchids cover the rocks. An
elegant iron suspension-bridge is thrown across the stream, from a
rock matted with tufts of little parasitic <i>Orchideæ.</i>
Crossing it, we came on many pine-trees; these had
five-years’ old cones on them, as well as those of all
succeeding years; they bear male flowers in autumn, which
impregnate the cones formed the previous year. Thus, the cones
formed in the spring of 1850 are fertilised in the following
autumn, and do not ripen their seeds till the second following
autumn, that of 1852.</p>

<p>A very steep ascent leads to the bungalow of Moflong, on a
broad, bleak hill-top, near the axis of the range (alt. 6,062
feet). Here there is a village, and some cultivation, surrounded by
hedges of <i>Erythrina, Pieris, Viburnum,</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 289">[ 289 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first"><i>Pyres, Colquhounia,</i> and <i>Corylopsis,</i>
amongst which grew an autumn-flowering lark-spur, with most
fœtid flowers.* The rocks are much contorted slates and
gneiss (strike north-east and dip south-east). In a deep gulley to
the northward, greenstone appears, with black basalt and jasper,
the latter apparently altered gneiss: beyond this the rocks strike
the opposite way, but are much disturbed.</p>

<p>We passed the end of June here, and experienced the same violent
weather, thunder, lightning, gales, and rain, which prevailed
during every midsummer I spent in India. A great deal of <i>
Coix</i> (Job’s tears) is cultivated about Moflong: it is of
a dull greenish purple, and though planted in drills, and carefully
hoed and weeded, is a very ragged crop. The shell of the cultivated
sort is soft, and the kernel is sweet; whereas the wild <i>Coix</i>
is so hard that it cannot be broken by the teeth. Each plant
branches two or three times from the base, and from seven to nine
plants grow in each square yard of soil: the produce is small, not
above thirty or forty fold.</p>

<p>From a hill behind Moflong bungalow, on which are some stone
altars, a most superb view is obtained of the Bhotan Himalaya to
the northward, their snowy peaks stretching in a broken series from
north 17° east to north 35° west; all are below the horizon
of the spectator, though from 17,000 to 20,000 feet above his
level. The finest view in the Khasia mountains, and perhaps a more
extensive one than has ever before been described, is that from</p>

<p class="fnote">* There is a wood a mile to the west of the
bungalow, worth visiting by the botanist: besides yew, oak, <i>
Sabia</i> and <i>Camellia,</i> it contains <i>Olea, Euonymus,</i>
and <i>Sphærocarya,</i> a small tree that bears a green
pear-shaped sweet fruit, with a large stone: it is pleasant, but
leaves a disagreeable taste in the mouth. On the grassy flats an
<i>Astragalus</i> occurs, and <i>Roscœa purpurea,
Tofieldia,</i> and various other fine plants are common.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 290">[ 290 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Chillong hill, the culminant point of the range,
about six miles north-east from Moflong bungalow. This hill, 6,660
feet above the sea, rises from an undulating grassy country,
covered with scattered trees and occasional clumps of wood; the
whole scenery about being park-like, and as little like that of
India at so low an elevation as it is possible to be.</p>

<p>I visited Chillong in October with Lieutenant Cave; starting
from Churra, and reaching the bungalow, two miles from its top, the
same night, with two relays of ponies, which he had kindly
provided. We were unfortunate in not obtaining a brilliant view of
the snowy mountains, their tops being partially clouded; but the
<i>coup d’œil</i> was superb. Northward, beyond the
rolling Khasia hills, lay the whole Assam valley, seventy miles
broad, with the Burrampooter winding through it, fifty miles
distant, reduced to a thread. Beyond this, banks of hazy vapour
obscured all but the dark range of the Lower Himalaya, crested by
peaks of frosted silver, at the immense distance of from 100 to 220
miles from Chillong. All are below the horizon of the observer; yet
so false is perspective, that they seem high in the air. The
mountains occupy sixty degrees of the horizon, and stretch over
upwards of 250 miles, comprising the greatest extent of snow
visible from any point with which I am acquainted.</p>

<p>Westward from Chillong the most distant Garrow hills visible are
about forty miles off; and eastward those of Cachar, which are
loftier, are about seventy miles. To the south the view is limited
by the Tipperah hills, which, where nearest, are 100 miles distant;
while to the south-west lies the sea-like Gangetic delta, whose
horizon, lifted by refraction, must be fully 120. The extent of
this view is</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 291">[ 291 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">therefore upwards of 340 miles in one direction,
and the visible horizon of the observer encircles an area of fully
thirty thousand square miles, which is greater than that of
Ireland!</p>

<p>Scarlet-flowered rhododendron bushes cover the north side of
Chillong,* whilst the south is grassy and quite bare; and except
some good <i>Orchideæ</i> on the trees, there is little to
reward the botanist. The rocks appeared to be sandstone at the
summit, but micaceous gneiss all around.</p>

<p>Continuing northward from Moflong, the road, after five miles,
dips into a very broad and shallow flat-floored valley, fully a
mile across, which resembles a lake-bed: it is bounded by low
hills, and is called “Lanten-tannia,” and is bare of
aught but long grass and herbs; amongst these are the large
groundsel (<i>Senecio</i>), <i>Dipsacus, Ophelia,</i> and <i>
Campanula.</i> On its south flank the micaceous slates strike
north-east, and dip north-west, and on the top repose beds, a foot
in thickness, of angular water-worn gravel, indicating an ancient
water-level, 400 feet above the floor of the valley. Other smaller
lake-beds, in the lateral valleys, are equally evident.</p>

<p>A beautiful blue-flowered <i>Clitoria</i> creeps over the path,
with the ground-raspberry of Dorjiling. From the top a sudden
descent of 400 feet leads to another broad flat valley, called
“Syong” (elevation, 5,725 feet), in which is a good
bungalow, surrounded by hedges of <i>Prinsepia utilis,</i> a common
north-west Himalayan plant, only found at 8000 feet in Sikkim. The
valley is grassy, but otherwise bare. Beyond this the road passes
over low rocky hills, wooded on their north or sheltered flanks
only, dividing flat-floored valleys: a red sandy gneiss is the
prevalent rock, but boulders of syenite are scattered about.
Extensive</p>

<p class="fnote">* These skirt a wood of prickly bamboo, in which
occur fig, laurel, <i>Aralia, Bœmeria, Smilax, Toddalia,</i>
wild cinnamon, and three kinds of oak.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 292">[ 292 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">moors (elevation, 6000 feet) succeed, covered with
stunted pines, brake, and tufts of harsh grasses.*</p>

<p>Near the Dengship-oong (river), which flows in a narrow valley,
is a low dome of gneiss altered by syenite. The prevalent dip is
uniformly south-east, and the strike north-east; and detached
boulders of syenite become more frequent, resting on a red gneiss,
full of black garnets, till the descent to the valley of Myrung,
one of the most beautiful spots in the Khasia, and a favourite
resort, having an excellent bungalow which commands a superb view
of the Himalaya: it is 5,650 feet above the sea, and is placed on
the north flank of a very shallow marshy valley, two miles broad,
and full of rice cultivation, as are the flat heads of all the
little valleys that lead into it. There is a guard here of light
infantry, and a little garden, boasting a gardener and some
tea-plants, so that we had vegetables during our four visits to the
place, on two of which occasions we stayed some days.</p>

<p>From Kala-panee to Myrung, a distance of thirty-two miles, the
road does not vary 500 feet above or below the mean level of 5,700
feet, and the physical features are the same throughout, of broad
flat-floored, steep-sided valleys, divided by bleak, grassy,
tolerably level-topped bills. Beyond Myrung the Khasia mountains
slope to the southward in rolling loosely-wooded hills, but the
spurs do not dip suddenly till beyond Nunklow, eight miles further
north.</p>

<p>On the south side of the Myrung valley is Nungbree wood, a dense
jungle, occupying, like all the other woods,</p>

<p class="fnote">* These are principally <i>Andropogon</i> and <i>
Brachypodium,</i> amongst which grow yellow <i>Corydalis,
Thalictrum, Anemone, Parnassia, Prunella,</i> strawberry, <i>
Eupatorium, Hypericum,</i> willow, a <i>Polygonum</i> like <i>
Bistorta, Osmunda regalis</i> and another species <i>Lycopodium
alpinum,</i> a <i>Senecio</i> like <i>Jacobæa,</i> thistles,
<i>Gnaphalium,</i> Gentians, <i>Iris, Paris, Sanguisorba</i> and
<i>Agrimonia.</i></p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 293">[ 293 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the steep north exposure of the hill; many good
plants grow in it, including some gigantic <i>Balanophoræ,
Pyrola,</i> and <i>Monotropa.</i> The bungalow stands on soft,
contorted, decomposing gneiss, which is still the prevalent rock,
striking north-east. On the hills to the east of it, enormous hard
blocks lie fully exposed, and are piled on one another, as if so
disposed by glacial action; and it is difficult to account for them
by denudation, though their surface scales, and similar blocks are
scattered around Myrung exactly similar to the syenite blocks of
Nunklow, and the granite ones of Nonkreem, to be described
hereafter, and which are undoubtedly due to the process of
weathering. A great mass of flesh-coloured crystalline granite
rises in the centre of the valley, to the east of the road: it is
fissured in various directions, and the surface scales
concentrically; it is obscurely stratified in some parts, and
appears to be half granite and half gneiss in mineralogical
character.</p>

<p>We twice visited a very remarkable hill, called Kollong, which
rises as a dome of granite 5,400 feet high, ten or twelve miles
south-west of Myrung, and conspicuous from all directions. The path
to it turns off from that to Nunklow, and strikes westerly along
the shallow valley of Monai, in which is a village, and much rice
and other cultivation. Near this there is a large square stockade,
formed of tall bamboos placed close together, very like a New
Zealand “Pa;” indeed, the whole country hereabouts much
recalls the grassy clay hills, marshy valleys, and bushy ridges of
the Bay of Islands.</p>

<p>The hills on either side are sometimes dotted with pinewoods,
sometimes conical and bare, with small clumps of pines on the
summit only; while in other places are broad tracts containing
nothing but young trees, resembling</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 294">[ 294 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">plantations, but which, I am assured, are not
planted; on the other hand, however, Mr. Yule states, that the
natives do plant fir-trees, especially near the iron forges, which
give employment to all the people of Monai.</p>

<p>All the streams rise in flat marshy depressions amongst the
hills with which the whole country is covered; and both these
features, together with the flat clay marshes into which the rivers
expand, are very suggestive of tidal action. Rock is hardly
anywhere seen, except in the immediate vicinity of Kollong, where
are many scattered boulders of fine-grained gneiss, of which are
made the broad stone slabs, placed as seats, and the other
erections of this singular people. We repeatedly remarked cones of
earth, clay, and pebbles, about twelve feet high, upon the hills,
which appeared to be artificial, but of which the natives could
give no explanation. Wild apple and birch are common trees, but
there is little jungle, except in the hollows, and on the north
slopes of the higher hills. Coarse long grass, with bushes of
Labiate and Composite plants, are the prevalent features.</p>

<p>Kollong rock is a steep dome of red granite,* accessible from
the north and east, but almost perpendicular to the southward,
where the slope is 80° for 600 feet. The elevation is 400 feet
above the mean level of the surrounding ridges, and 700 above the
bottom of the valleys. The south or steepest side is encumbered
with enormous detached blocks, while the north is clothed with a
dense forest, containing red tree-rhododendrons and oaks; on its
skirts grew a white bushy rhododendron, which we found nowhere
else. The hard granite of the top was covered with matted mosses,
lichens, Lycopodiums, and ferns,</p>

<p class="fnote">* This granite is highly crystalline, and does not
scale or flake, nor is its surface polished.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 295">[ 295 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">amongst which were many curious and beautiful
airplants.*</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images2/fig29.jpg" width="290" height="221" alt=

<p>The view from the top is very extensive to the northward, but
not elsewhere: it commands the Assam valley and the Himalaya, and
the billowy range of undulating grassy Khasia mountains. Few houses
were visible, but the curling smoke from the valleys betrayed their
lurking-places, whilst the tinkling sound of the hammers from the
distant</p>

<p class="fnote">* <i>Eria, Cœlogyne</i> (<i>Wallichii,
maculata,</i> and <i>elata</i>), <i>Cymbidium, Dendrobium,
Sunipia</i> some of them flowering profusely; and though freely
exposed to the sun and wind, dews and frosts, rain and droughts,
they were all fresh, bright, green and strong, under very different
treatment from that to which they are exposed in the damp,
unhealthy, steamy orchid-houses of our English gardens. A wild
onion was most abundant all over the top of the hill, with <i>
Hymenopogon, Vaccinium, Ophiopogon, Anisadenia, Commelyna,
Didymocarpus, Remusatia, Hedychium,</i> grass and small bamboos,
and a good many other plants. Many of the lichens were of European
kinds; but the mosses (except <i>Bryum argenteum</i>) and ferns
were different. A small <i>Staphylinus,</i> which swarmed under the
sods, was the only insect I remarked.</p>

<p class="first">forges on all sides was singularly musical and
pleasing; they fell on the ear like “bells upon the
wind,” each ring being exquisitely melodious, and chiming
harmoniously with the others. The solitude and beauty of the
scenery, and the emotions excited by the music of chimes, tended to
tranquillise our minds, wearied by the fatigues of travel, and the
excitement of pursuits that required unremitting attention; and we
rested for some time, our imaginations wandering to far-distant
scenes, brought vividly to our minds by these familiar sounds.</p>
