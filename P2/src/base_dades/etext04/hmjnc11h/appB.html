<p class="app">The following remarks, for which I am indebted to
the kindness of the able chemist and naturalist mentioned above,
will be highly valued, both by those who are interested in the many
curious physiological questions involved in the association of the
most obscure forms of vegetable life with the remarkable phenomena
of mineral springs; or in the exquisitely beautiful microscopic
structure of the lower Alg&aelig;, which has thrown so much light
upon a branch of natural history, whose domain, like that of
astronomy, lies to a great extent beyond the reach of the
unassisted eye.&mdash;J.D.H.</p>

<br>
<p class="app">1. Mineral water, Soorujkoond, Behar (vol. i., <a
href="chap2.html#page 27">p. 27</a>), contains chloride of sodium
and sulphate of soda.</p>

<p class="app">2. Mineral water, hot springs, Yeumtong, altitude
11,730 feet (see vol. ii., <a href="chap22.html#page 117">p.
117</a>). Disengages sulphuretted hydrogen when fresh.&mdash;This
water was inodorous when the bottle was opened. The saline matter
in solution was considerably less than in the Soorujkoond water,
but like that consisted of chloride of sodium and sulphate of soda.
Its alkaline character suggests the probability of its containing
carbonate of soda, but none was detected. The rocks decomposed by
the waters of the spring consist of granite impregnated with
sulphate of alumina. It appears that in this case the sulphurous
waters of Yeumtong became impregnated in the air with sulphuric
acid, which decomposed the felspar,* and united with its alumina. I
found traces only of potash in the salt.</p>

<p class="app">Sulphuretted hydrogen waters appear to give origin
to sulphuric acid, when the water impregnated with the gas reaches
the surface;</p>

<p class="fnote">* I have, in my journal, particularly alluded to
the garnets (an aluminous mineral) being thus entirely
decomposed.&mdash;J.D.H.</p>

lime accompanied with sulphur, from the hot springs of Pugha in
west Tibet, brought by Dr. T. Thomson.</p>

href="chap22.html#page 133">p. 133</a>).&mdash;When the bottle was
uncorked, a strong smell of sulphuretted hydrogen was perceived.
The water contains about twenty-five grains per imp. gallon, of
chloride of sodium, sulphate and carbonate of soda; the reaction
being strongly alkaline when the solution was concentrated.</p>

<p class="app">4. Effloresced earth from Behar (vol. i., <a href=

<br>
<p class="app">It is not my intention in the present appendix to
give specific characters or even accurately determined specific
names to the different objects within its scope, which have come
under investigation, as collected by Dr. Hooker and Dr. Thomson. To
do so would require far more time than I have at present been able
to devote to the subject, for though every species has been
examined microscopically, either by myself or Mr. Broome, and
working sketches secured at the same time, the specific
determination of fresh water Alg&aelig; from Herbarium specimens is
a matter which requires a very long and accurate comparison of
samples from every available locality, and in the case of such
genera as <i>Zygnema, Tyndaridea,</i> and <i>Conferva,</i> is,
after all, not a very satisfactory process.</p>

<p class="app">The object in view is merely to give some general
notion of the forms which presented themselves in the vast
districts visited by the above-mentioned botanists, comprising
localities of the greatest possible difference as regards both
temperature and elevation; but more especially in the hot-springs
which occur in two distant parts of the Himalayas and in Behar, and
these again under very different degrees of elevation and of
extrinsic temperature.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 376">[ 376 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app">The Alg&aelig; from lower localities are but few in
number, and some of these of very common forms. We have for
instance from the Ganges, opposite Bijnour, a <i>
Batrachospermum</i> and <i>Conferva crispata,</i> the former purple
below, with specimens of <i>Chantransia,</i> exactly as they might
occur in the Thames. The <i>Conferva,</i> or more properly <i>
Cladophora,</i> which occurs also under various forms, at higher
elevations, as in the neighbourhood of Simla and Iskardo, swarms
with little parasites, but of common or uninteresting species. In
the Bijnour specimens, these consist of common forms of <i>Synedra,
Meridion circulare,</i> and a <i>Cymbella,</i> on others from
Dacca, there are about three species of <i>Synedra,</i>* a minute
<i>Navicula</i> and <i>Gomphonema curvatum.</i> Nothing, in fact,
can well be more European. One splendid Alga, however, occurs at
Fitcoree, in Behar, on the banks of nullahs, which are dry in hot
weather, forming a purple fleece of coarse woolly hairs, which are
singularly compressed, and of extreme beauty under the microscope,
from the crystalline green of the articulated string which threads
the bright red investing sheath. This curious Alga calls to mind in
its colouring <i>C&aelig;nocoleus Smithii,</i> figured in English
Botany, t. 2940, but it has not the common sheath of that Alga, and
is on a far larger scale. One or two other allied forms, or
species, occur in East Nepal, to which I purpose giving, together
with the Behar plant, the generic name of <i>Erythronema.</i> From
the Soane River, also, is an interesting Alga, belonging to the
curious genus <i>Thwaitesia,</i> in which the division of the
endochrome in the fertile cells into four distinct masses,
sometimes entirely free, is beautifully marked. In some cases,
indeed, instead of the ordinary spores, the whole moss is broken up
into numerous bodies, as in the fertile joints of <i>Ulothrix,</i>
and probably, as in that case, the resultant corpuscles are endowed
with active motion. In Silhet, again, is a magnificent <i>
Zygnema,</i> allied to <i>Z. nitidum,</i> with large oval spores,
about 1/285 part of an inch long, and a dark golden brown colour,
and containing a spiral green endochrome.</p>

<p class="app">Leaving, however, the lower parts of India, I shall
first take the species which occur in Khasia, Sikkim, Eastern
Nepal, and the adjoining parts of Tibet.</p>

<p class="fnote">* Two of these appear to be <i>S.
Vaucheri&aelig;</i> and <i>S. in&aelig;qualis.</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 377">[ 377 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app">In the hot valleys of the Gtreat Rungeet, at an
elevation of about 2000 feet, we have the <i>Erythronema,</i> but
under a slightly different form; at Nunklow, at about the same
height; in Khasia, again, at twice that elevation; in Eastern
Nepal, at 12,000; and, finally, at Momay, reaching up to 16,000
feet. In water, highly impregnated with oxide of iron, at 4000 feet
in Sikkim, a <i>Leptothrix</i> occurred in great abundance,
coloured with the oxide, exactly as is the case with Alg&aelig;
which grow in iron springs in Europe. At elevations between 5000
and 7000 feet, several European forms occur, consisting of <i>
Ulothrix, Zygnema, Oscillatoria, Lyngbya, Sph&aelig;rozyga,
Scytonema, Conferva,</i> and <i>Cladophora.</i> The species may
indeed not be identical with European species, but they are all
more or less closely allied to well-known Hydrophytes. One very
interesting form, however, either belonging to the genus <i>
Zygnema,</i> or possibly constituting a distinct genus, occurs in
streams at 5000 feet in Sikkim, consisting of highly gelatinous
threads of the normal structure of the <i>Zygnema,</i> but forming
a reticulated mass. The threads adhere to each other laterally,
containing only a single spiral endochrome, and the articulations
are very long. Amongst the threads are mixed those of some species
of <i>Tyndaridea.</i> There is also a curious <i>Hormosiphon,</i>
at a height of 7000 feet; forming anastomosing gelatinous masses. A
fine new species of <i>Lyngbya</i> extends up as high as 11,000
feet. At 13,000 feet occurs either some simple <i>Conferva</i> or
<i>Zygnema,</i> it is doubtful which from the condition of the
specimens; and at the same elevation, in the nearly dry bed of the
stream which flows from the larger lake at Momay, amongst flat
cakes, consisting of felspathic silt from the glaciers above, and
the d&eacute;bris of Alg&aelig;, and abounding in Diatomace&aelig;,
some threads of a <i>Zygnema.</i> At 17,000 feet, an <i>
Oscillatoria,</i> attached or adherent to <i>Zannichellia</i>; and,
finally, on the bare ground, at 18,000 feet, on the Donkia
mountains, an obscure species of <i>C&aelig;nocoleus.</i> On the
surface of the glaciers at Kinchinjhow, on silt, there is a curious
<i>Palmella,</i> apparently quite distinct from any European
form.</p>

<p class="app">Amongst the greater part of the Alg&aelig;, from
4000 feet to 18,000 feet, various Diatomace&aelig; occur, which
will be best noticed in a tabular form, as follows; the specific
name, within brackets, merely indicating the species to which they
bear most resemblance:&mdash;</p>

<p class="app">We now turn to those portions of Tibet or the
neighbouring regions, explored by Dr. Thomson and Captain Strachey.
The principal feature in the Algology is the great prevalence of
species of <i>Zygnema</i> and <i>Tyndaridea,</i> which occur under
a variety of forms, sometimes with very thick gelatinous coats. In
not a single instance, however, is there the slightest tendency to
produce fructification. <i>Conferva crispata</i> again, as
mentioned above, occurs in several localities; and in one locality
a beautiful unbranched <i>Conferva,</i> with torulose
articulations. At Iskardo, Dr. Thomson gathered a very gelatinous
species of <i>Draparnaldia,</i> or more properly, a <i>
Stygeoclonium,</i> if we may judge from a little conglomeration of
cells which appeared amongst the threads. A <i>Tetraspora</i> in
Piti, an obscure <i>Tolypothrix,</i> and one or two <i>
Oscillatori&aelig;,</i> remarkable for their interrupted mode of
growth, complete the list of Alg&aelig;, with the exception of one,
to be mentioned presently; as also of <i>Diatomace&aelig;,</i> and
of the species of <i>Nostoc</i> and <i>Hormosiphon,</i> which
occurred in great profusion, and under several forms, sometimes
attaining a very large size (several inches across), especially in
the districts of Le and Piti, and where the soil or waters were
impregnated with saline matters. It is well known that some species
of <i>Nostoc</i> form an article of food in China, and one was used
for that purpose in a late Arctic expedition, as reported by Dr.
Sutherland; but it does not seem that any use is made of them in
Tibet, though probably all the large species would form tolerable
articles of food, and certainly, from their chemical composition,
prove very nutritious. One species is mentioned by Dr. Thomson as
floating, without any attachment, in the shallow</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 379">[ 379 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">water of the pools scattered over the plains, on
the Parang River, separated only by a ridge of mountains from Piti,
broad and foliaceous, and scarcely different from the common <i>
Nostoc,</i> which occurs in all parts of the globe. I must not,
however, neglect to record a very singular new genus, in which the
young threads have the characters of <i>Tyndaridea,</i> but, after
a time, little swellings occur on their sides, in which a distinct
endochrome is formed, extending backwards into the parent
endochrome, separated from it by a well defined membrane, and
producing, either by repeated pullulation, a compound mass like
that of <i>Calothrix,</i> or simply giving rise to a forked thread.
In the latter case, however, there is no external swelling, but a
lateral endochrome is formed, which, as it grows, makes its way
through an aperture, whose sides are regularly inflected. I have
given to this curious production the name of <i>Cladozygia
Thomsoni.</i></p>

<p class="app">The whole of the above Alg&aelig; occurred at
heights varying from 10,000 to 15,500 feet. As in the Southern
Himalayan Alg&aelig;, the specimens were infested with many
Diatomace&aelig;, amongst which the moat conspicuous were various
<i>Cymbell&aelig;</i> and <i>Epithemi&aelig;.</i> The following is
a list of the species observed.</p>

<p class="app">There is very little identity between this list and
that before given from the Southern Himalayas, as is the case also
with the other Alg&aelig;. Till the species, however, have been
more completely studied, a very accurate comparison cannot be
made.</p>

<p class="app">In both instances the species which grow in hot
springs have been reserved in order to make their comparison more
easy. I shall begin in an inverse order, with those of the springs
of Pugha in Tibet, which attain a temperature of 174&deg;. Two <i>
Conferv&aelig;</i> only occur in the specimens which have been
preserved, viz., an <i>Oscillatoria</i> allied to that which I have
called <i>O. interrupta,</i> and a true <i>Conferva</i></p>

<p class="app">Scarcely any one of these except the <i>Navicula</i>
is peculiar to the locality. A fragment apparently of some <i>
Closterium,</i> the only one which I have met with in the
collection, accompanies one of the specimens.</p>

<p class="app">The hot springs of Momay, (temp. 110&deg;) at 16,000
feet, produce a golden brown <i>C&aelig;nocoleus</i> representing a
small form of <i>C. cirrhosus,</i> and a very delicate <i>
Sph&aelig;rozyga,</i> an <i>Anabaina,</i> and <i>Tolypothrix</i>;
and at 17,000 feet, a delicate green <i>Conferva</i> with long even
articulations. With the latter is an <i>Odontidium</i> allied to,
or identical with <i>O. turgidulum,</i> and with the former a fine
species of <i>Epithemia</i> resembling in form, but not in marking,
<i>E. Faba, E. (Zebra)</i> a fine <i>Navicula,</i> perhaps the same
with <i>N. major</i> and <i>Fragilaria (virescens).</i>* In mud
from one of the Momay springs (<i>a</i>), I detected <i>Epithemia
(Broomeii n.s.),</i> and two small <i>Navicul&aelig;,</i> and in
the spring (<i>c</i>) two species of <i>Epithemia</i> somewhat like
<i>E. Faba,</i> but different from that mentioned above.</p>

<p class="app">The hot springs of Soorujkoond, of the vegetation of
which very numerous specimens have been preserved, are extremely
poor in species. In the springs themselves and on their banks, at
temperatures varying from 80&deg; to 158&deg;, at which point
vegetation entirely ceases, a minute <i>Leptothrix</i> abounds
everywhere, varying a little in the regularity of the threads in
different specimens, but scarcely presenting two species. Between
84&deg; and 112&deg; there is an imperfect <i>Zygnema</i> with very
long articulations, and where the green scum passes into brown,
there is sometimes an <i>Oscillatoria,</i> of a very minute
stellate <i>Scytonema,</i> probably in an imperfect state. <i>
Epithemia ocellata</i> also contributes often to produce the tint.
An <i>Anabaina</i> occurs at a temperature of 125&deg;, but the
same species was found also in the stream from the springs where
the water had become cold, as was also the case with the <i>
Zygnema.</i></p>

<p class="fnote">* Mr. Thomas Brightwell finds in a portion of the
same specimen <i>Epithemia alpestris, Surirella splendida, S.
linearis,</i> Smith, <i>Pinnularia viridis,</i> Smith, <i>Navicula
(lanceolata)</i> and <i>Himantidium (arcus).</i></p>

<p class="app">The vegetation in the three sets of springs was very
different. As regards the <i>Conferv&aelig;,</i> taking the word in
its older sense, the species in the three are quite different, and
even in respect of genera there is little identity, but amongst the
<i>Diatomace&aelig;</i> there is no striking difference, except in
those of the Behar springs where three out of the four did not
occur elsewhere. In the Pugha and Momay springs, the species were
either identical with, or nearly allied to those found in
neighbouring localities, where the water did not exceed the
ordinary temperature. A longer examination will doubtless detect
more numerous forms, but those which appear on a first examination
are sure to give a pretty correct general notion of the vegetation.
The species are certainly less numerous than I had expected, or
than might be supposed from the vegetation of those European hot
springs which have been most investigated.</p>

<p class="app">In conclusion, I shall beg to add a few words on the
Fungi of the Himalayas, so far as they have at present been
investigated. As regards these there is a marked difference, as
might be anticipated from the nature of the climates between those
parts of Tibet investigated by Dr. Thomson, and the more southern
regions. The fungi found by Dr. Thomson were but few in number, and
for the most part of very ordinary forms, differing but little from
the produce of an European wood. Some, however, grow to a very
large size, as for instance, <i>Polyporus fomentarius</i> on
poplars near Iskardo, exceeding in dimensions anything which this
species exhibits in Europe. A very fine <i>&AElig;cidium</i> also
infests the fir trees (<i>Abies Smithiana</i>), a figure of which
has been given in the &ldquo;Gardeners&rsquo; Chronicle,&rdquo;
1852, p. 627, under the name of <i>AEcidium Thomsoni.</i> This is
allied to the Hexenbesen of the German forests, but is a finer
species and quite distinct. <i>Polyporus oblectans, Geaster
limbatus, Geaster mammosus, Erysiphe taurica,</i> a <i>Boletus</i>
infested with <i>Sepedonium mycophilum, Scleroderma verrucosum,</i>
an <i>AEcidium,</i> and a <i>Uromyces,</i> both on <i>Mulgedium
Tataricum,</i> about half-a-dozen Agarics, one at an altitude of
16,000 feet above the Nubra river, a <i>Lycoperdon,</i> and <i>
Morchella semilibera,</i> which</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 382">[ 382 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">is eaten in Kashmir, and exported when dry to the
plains of India, make up the list of fungi.</p>

<p class="app">The region of Sikkim is perhaps the most productive
in fleshy fungi of any in the world, both as regards numbers and
species, and Eastern Nepal and Khasia yield also an abundant
harvest. The forms are for the most part European, though the
species are scarcely ever quite identical. The dimensions of many
are truly gigantic, and many species afford abundant food to the
natives. Mixed with European forms a few more decidedly tropical
occur, and amongst those of East Nepal is a <i>Lentinus</i> which
has the curious property of staining every thing which touches it
of a deep rhubarb yellow, and is not exceeded in magnificence by
any tropical species. The <i>Polypori</i> are often identical with
those of Java, Ceylon, and the Philippine Isles, and the curious
<i>Trichocoma paradoxum</i> which was first found by Junghuhn in
Java, and very recently by Dr. Harvey in Ceylon, occurs abundantly
on the decayed trunks of laurels, as it does in South Carolina. The
curious genus <i>Mitremyces</i> also is scattered here and there,
though not under the American form, but that which occurs in Java.
Though <i>Hymenomycetes</i> are so abundant, the <i>
Discomycetes</i> and <i>Ascomycetes</i> are comparatively rare, and
very few species indeed of <i>Sph&oelig;ria</i> were gathered. One
curious matter is, that amongst the very extensive collections
which have been made there is scarcely a single new genus. The
species moreover in Sikkim are quite different, except in the case
of some more or less cosmopolite species from those of Eastern
Nepal and Khasia: scarcely a single <i>Lactarius</i> or <i>
Cortinarius</i> for instance occurs in Sikkim, though there are
several in Khasia. The genus <i>Boletus</i> through the whole
district assumes the most magnificent forms, which are generally
very different from anything in Europe.<br>
