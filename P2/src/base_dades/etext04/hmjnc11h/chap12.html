<br>
<p class="first">On arriving at the bottom we found a party who
were travelling with sheep laden with salt; they told us that the
Yalloong village, which lay up the valley on the route to the
Kanglanamo pass (leading over the south shoulder of Kubra into
Sikkim) was deserted, the inhabitants having retired after the
October fall of snow to Yankutang, two marches down; also that the
Kanglanamo pass was impracticable, being always blocked up by the
October fall. I was, therefore, reluctantly obliged to abandon the
plan of pursuing that route to Sikkim, and to go south, following
the west flank of Singalelah to the first of the many passes over
it which I might find open.</p>

<p>These people were very civil, and gave me a handful of the root
of one of the many bitter herbs called in Bengal</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 272">[ 272 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;Teeta,&rdquo; and used as a febrifuge: the
present was that of <i>Picrorhiza,</i> a plant allied to Speedwell,
which grows at from 12,000 to 15,000 feet elevation, and is a
powerful bitter, called &ldquo;Hoonling&rdquo; by the Tibetans.
They had with them above 100 sheep, of a tall, long-legged,
Roman-nosed breed. Each carried upwards of forty pounds of salt,
done up in two leather bags, slung on either side, and secured by a
band going over the chest, and another round the loins, so that
they cannot slip off, when going up or down hill. These sheep are
very tame, patient creatures, travelling twelve miles a day with
great ease, and being indifferent to rocky or steep ground.</p>

<p>Looking east I had a splendid view of the broad snowy mass of
Kubra, blocking up, as it were, the head of the valley with a white
screen. Descending to about 10,000 feet, the <i>Abies
Brunoniana</i> appeared, with fine trees of <i>Rhododendron
Falconeri</i> forty feet high, and with leaves nineteen inches
long! while the upper part of the valley was full of <i>Abies
Webbiana.</i></p>

<p>At the elevation of 9000 feet, we crossed to the east bank, and
passed the junction of the gneiss and mica slate: the latter
crossed the river, striking north-west, and the stream cut a dark
chasm-like channel through it, foaming and dashing the spray over
the splintered ridges, and the broad water-worn hog-backed masses
that projected from its bed. Immense veins of granite permeated the
rocks, which were crumpled in the strangest manner: isolated
angular blocks of schist had been taken up by the granite in a
fluid state, and remained imbedded in it.</p>

<p>The road made great ascents to avoid landslips, and to surmount
the enormous piles of d&eacute;bris which encumber this valley more
than any other. We encamped at 10,050 feet, on a little flat 1000
feet above the bed of the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 273">[ 273 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">river, and on its east flank. A <i>Hydrangea</i>
was the common small wood, but <i>Abies Webbiana</i> formed the
forest, with great Rhododendrons. The weather was foggy, whence I
judged that we were in the sea of mist I saw beneath me from the
passes; the temperature, considering the elevation, was mild,
37&deg; and 38&deg;, which was partly due to the evolution of heat
that accompanies the condensation of these vapours, the atmosphere
being loaded with moisture. The thermometer fell to 28&deg; during
the night, and in the morning the ground was thickly covered with
hoar-frost.</p>

<p><i>December 7.</i>&mdash;We ascended the Yalloong ridge to a
saddle 11,000 feet elevation, whence the road dips south to the
gloomy gorges of the eastern feeders of the Tambur. Here we bade
adieu to the grand alpine scenery, and for several days our course
lay in Nepal in a southerly direction, parallel to Singalelah, and
crossing every spur and river sent off by that mighty range. The
latter flow towards the Tambur, and their beds, for forty or fifty
miles are elevated about 3000 or 4000 feet. Few of the spurs are
ascended above 5000 feet, but all of them rise to 12,000 or 14,000
feet to the westward, where they join the Singalelah range.</p>

<p>I clambered to the top of a lofty hummock, through a dense
thicket of interwoven Rhododendron bushes, the clayey soil under
which was slippery from the quantity of dead leaves. I had hoped
for a view of the top of Kinchinjunga, which bore north-east, but
it was enveloped in clouds, as were all the snows in that
direction; to the north-west, however, I obtained bearings of the
principal peaks, etc., of the Yangma and Kambachen valleys. To the
south and south-east, lofty, rugged and pine-clad mountains rose in
confused masses, and white sheets of</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 274">[ 274 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">mist came driving up, clinging to the
mountain-tops, and shrouding the landscape with extreme rapidity.
The remarkable mountain of Sidingbah bore south-south-east, raising
its rounded head above the clouds. I could, however, procure no
other good bearing.</p>

<p>The descent from the Yalloong ridge to the Khabili feeders of
the Tambur was very steep, and in some places almost precipitous,
first through dense woods of silver fir, with <i>Rhod.
Falconeri</i> and <i>Hodgsoni,</i> then through <i>Abies
Brunoniana,</i> with yew (now covered with red berries) to the
region of Magnolias and <i>Rhod. arboreum</i> and <i>barbatum.</i>
One bush of the former was in flower, making a gorgeous show. Here
also appeared the great oak with lamellated acorns, which I had not
seen in the drier valleys to the westward; with many other
Dorjiling trees and shrubs. A heavy mist clung to the rank
luxuriant foliage, tantalizing from its obscuring all the view.
Mica schist replaced the gneiss, and a thick slippery stratum of
clay rendered it very difficult to keep one&rsquo;s footing. After
so many days of bright sunshine and dry weather, I found this
quiet, damp, foggy atmosphere to have a most depressing effect:
there was little to interest in the meteorology, the atmospheric
fluctuations being far too small; geographical discovery was at an
end, and we groped our way along devious paths in wooded valleys,
or ascended spurs and ridges, always clouded before noon, and
clothed with heavy forest.</p>

<p>At 6000 feet we emerged from the mist, and found ourselves
clambering down a deep gully, hemmed in by frightful rocky steeps,
which exposed a fine and tolerably continuous section of schistose
rocks, striking north-west, and dipping north-east, at a very high
angle.</p>

<p>At the bottom three furious torrents met: we descended</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 275">[ 275 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the course of one of them, over slanting
precipices, or trees lashed to the rocks, and after a most winding
course our path conducted us to the village of Tarbu, high above a
feeder of the Khabili river, which flows west, joining the Tambur
three days&rsquo; march lower down. Having no food, we had made a
very long and difficult march to this place, but finding none here,
proceeded on to Tonghem village on the Khabili, descending through
thickets of <i>Rhod. arboreum</i> to the elevation of 5,560.</p>

<p>This village, or spur, called &ldquo;Tonghem&rdquo; by the
Limboos, and &ldquo;Yankutang&rdquo; by the Bhoteeas, is the winter
resort of the inhabitants of the upper Yalloong valley: they
received us very kindly, sold us two fowls, and rice enough to last
for one or two days, which was all they could spare, and gave me a
good deal of information. I found that the Kanglanamo pass had been
disused since the Nepal war, that it was very lofty, and always
closed in October.</p>

<p>The night was fine, clear, and warm, but the radiation so
powerful that the grass was coated with ice the following morning,
though the thermometer did not fall below 33&deg;. The next day the
sun rose with great power, and the vegetation reeked and steamed
with the heat. Crossing the river, we first made a considerable
descent, and then ascended a ridge to 5,750 feet, through a thick
jungle of <i>Camellia, Eurya,</i> and small oak: from the top I
obtained bearings of Yalloong and Choonjerma pass, and had also
glimpses of the Kinchin range through a tantalizing jungle; after
which a very winding and fatiguing up-and-down march southwards
brought us to the village of Khabang, in the magnificent valley of
the Tawa, about 800 feet above the river, and 5,500 feet above the
sea.</p>

<p>I halted here for a day, to refresh the people, and if possible
to obtain some food. I hoped, too, to find a pass</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 276">[ 276 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">into Sikkim, east over Singalelah, but was
disappointed: if there had ever been one, it had been closed since
the Nepal war; and there was none, for several marches further
south, which would conduct us to the Iwa branch of the Khabili.</p>

<p>Khabang is a village of Geroongs, or shepherds, who pasture
their flocks on the hills and higher valleys during summer, and
bring them down to this elevation in winter: the ground was
consequently infested with a tick, equal in size to that so common
in the bushes, and quite as troublesome, but of a different
species.</p>

<p>The temperature rose to 72&deg;, and the black-bulb thermometer
to 140&deg;. Magnolias and various almost tropical trees were
common, and the herbaceous vegetation was that of low elevations.
Large sugar-cane (<i>Saccharum</i>), palm (<i>Wallichia</i>), and
wild plantains grew near the river, and <i>Rhod. arboreum</i> was
very common on dry slopes of mica-slate rocks, with the gorgeous
and sweet-scented <i>Luculia gratissima.</i></p>

<p>Up the valley of the Tawa the view was very grand of a
magnificent rocky mountain called Sidingbah, bearing south-east by
south, on a spur of the Singalelah range that runs westerly, and
forms the south flank of the Tawa, and the north of the Khabili
valleys. This mountain is fully 12,000 feet high, crested with rock
and ragged black forest, which, on the north flank, extends to its
base: to the eastward, the bare ridges of Singalelah were patched
with snow, below which they too were clothed with black pines.</p>

<p>From the opposite side of the Tawa to Khabang (alt. 6,020 feet),
I was, during our march southwards, most fortunate in obtaining a
splendid view of Kinchinjunga (bearing north-east by north), with
its associates, rising over the dark mass of Singalelah, its flanks
showing like tier above tier of green glaciers: its distance was
fully</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 277">[ 277 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">twenty-five miles, and as only about 7000 feet or
8000 feet from its summit were visible, and Kubra was foreshortened
against it, its appearance was not grand; added to which, its top
was round and hummocky, not broken into peaks, as when seen from
the south and east. Villages and cultivation became more frequent
as we proceeded southward, and our daily marches were up ridges,
and down into deep valleys, with feeders from the flanks of
Sidingbah to the Tambur. We passed through the village of
Tchonboong, and camped at Yangyading (4,100 feet), sighted Yamroop,
a large village and military post to the west of our route, crossed
the Pangwa river, and reached the valley of the Khabili. During
this part of the journey, I did not once see the Tambur river,
though I was day after day marching only seven to ten miles distant
from it, so uneven is the country. The mountains around Taptiatok,
Mywa Guola, and Chingtam, were pointed out to me, but they
presented no recognizable feature.</p>

<p>I often looked for some slope, or strike of the slopes of the
spurs, in any one valley, or that should prevail through several,
but could seldom trace any, except on one or two occasions, at low
elevations. Looking here across the valleys, there was a tendency
in the gentle slopes of the spurs to have plane faces dipping
north-east, and to be bounded by a line of cliffs striking
north-west, and facing the south-east. In such arrangements, the
upheaved cliffs may be supposed to represent parallel lines of
faults, dislocation, or rupture, but I could never trace any
secondary valleys at right angles to these. There is no such
uniformity of strike as to give to the rivers a zig-zag course of
any regularity, or one having any apparent dependence on a
prevailing arrangement of the rocks; for, though the strike of the
chlorite and clay-slate at elevations below 6000 feet</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 278">[ 278 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">along its course, is certainly north-west, with a
dip to north-east, the flexures of the river, as projected on the
map, deviate very widely from these directions.</p>

<p>The valley of the Khabili is very grand, broad, open, and
intersected by many streams and cultivated spurs: the road from
Yamroop to Sikkim, once well frequented, runs up its north flank,
and though it was long closed we determined to follow and clear
it.</p>

<p>On the 11th of December we camped near the village of Sablakoo
(4,680 feet), and procured five days&rsquo; food, to last us as far
as the first Sikkim village. Thence we proceeded eastward up the
valley, but descending to the Iwa, an affluent of the Khabili,
through a tropical vegetation of <i>Pinus longifolia, Phyllanthus
Emblica,</i> dwarf date-palm, etc.</p>

<p>Gneiss was here the prevailing rock, uniformly dipping
north-east 20&deg;, and striking north-west. The same rock no doubt
forms the mass Sidingbah, which reared its head 8000 feet above the
Iwa river, by whose bed we camped at 3,780 feet. Sand-flies
abounded, and were most troublesome: troops of large monkeys were
skipping about, and the whole scene was thoroughly tropical; still,
the thermometer fell to 38&deg; in the night, with heavy dew.</p>

<p>Though we passed numerous villages, I found unusual difficulty
in getting provision, and received none of the presents so
uniformly brought by the villagers to a stranger. I was not long in
discovering, to my great mortification, that these were
appropriated by the Ghorkha Havildar, who seemed to have profited
by our many days of short allowance, and diverted the current of
hospitality from me to himself. His coolies I saw groaning under
heavy burdens, when those of my people were light; and the truth
only came out when he had the impudence to attempt to impose a part
of his coolies&rsquo; loads on mine, to enable the former to</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 279">[ 279 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">carry more food, whilst he was pretending that he
used every exertion to procure me a scanty supply of rice with my
limited stock of money. I had treated this man and his soldiers
with the utmost kindness, even nursing them and clothing them from
my own stock of flannels, when sick and shivering amongst the
snows. Though a high caste Hindoo, and one who assumed Brahmin
rank, he had, I found, no objection to eat forbidden things in
secret; and now that we were travelling amongst Hindoos, his caste
obtained him everything, while money alone availed me. I took him
roundly to task for his treachery, which caused him secretly to
throw away a leg of mutton he had concealed; I also threatened to
expose the humbug of his pretension to caste, but it was then too
late to procure more food. Having hitherto much liked this man, and
fully trusted him, I was greatly pained by his conduct.</p>

<p>We proceeded east for three days, up the valley, through gloomy
forests of tropical trees below 5000 feet; and ascended to oaks and
magnolias at 6000 feet. The path was soon obstructed, and we had to
tear and cut our way, from 6000 to 10,000 feet, which took two
days&rsquo; very hard work. Ticks swarmed in the small bamboo
jungle, and my body was covered with these loathsome insects, which
got into my bed and hair, and even attached themselves to my
eyelids during the night, when the constant annoyance and
irritation completely banished sleep. In the daytime they
penetrated my trousers, piercing to my body in many places, so that
I repeatedly took off as many as twelve at one time. It is indeed
marvellous how so large an insect can painlessly insert a stout
barbed proboscis, which requires great force to extract it, and
causes severe smarting in the operation. What the ticks feed upon
in these humid forests is a perfect mystery to me, for from</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 280">[ 280 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">6000 to 9000 feet they literally swarmed, where
there was neither path nor animal life. They were, however, more
tolerable than a commoner species of parasite, which I found it
impossible to escape from, all classes of mountaineers being
infested with it.</p>

<p>On the 14th, after an arduous ascent through the pathless
jungle, we camped at 9,300 feet on a narrow spur, in a dense
forest, amongst immense loose blocks of gneiss. The weather was
foggy and rainy, and the wind cold. I ate the last supply of animal
food, a miserable starved pullet, with rice and Chili vinegar; my
tea, sugar, and all other superfluities having been long before
exhausted.</p>

<p>On the following morning, we crossed the Islumbo pass over
Singalelah into Sikkim, the elevation being 11,000 feet. Above our
camp the trees were few and stunted, and we quickly emerged from
the forest on a rocky and grassy ridge, covered with withered <i>
Saxifrages, Umbellifer&aelig;, Parnassia, Hypericum,</i> etc. There
were no pines on either side of the pass; a very remarkable
peculiarity of the damp mountains of Sikkim, which I have elsewhere
had occasion to notice: we had left <i>Pinus longifolia</i> (a far
from common tree in these valleys) at 3000 feet in the Tawa three
days before, and ascended to 11,000 feet without passing a
coniferous tree of any kind, except a few yews, at 9000 feet,
covered with red berries.</p>

<p>The top of the pass was broad, grassy, and bushy with dwarf
Bamboo, Rose, and Berberry, in great abundance, covered with mosses
and lichens: it had been raining hard all the morning, and the
vegetation was coated with ice: a dense fog obscured everything,
and a violent south-east wind blew over the pass in our teeth. I
collected some very curious and beautiful mosses, putting these
frozen treasures into my box, in the form of</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 281">[ 281 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">exquisitely beautiful glass ornaments, or mosses
frosted with silver.</p>

<p>A few stones marked the boundary between Nepal and Sikkim, where
I halted for half an hour, and hung up my instruments: the
temperature was 32&deg;.</p>

<p>We descended rapidly, proceeding eastward down the broad valley
of the Kulhait river, an affluent of the Great Rungeet; and as it
had begun to sleet and snow hard, we continued until we reached
6,400 feet before camping.</p>

<p>On the following day we proceeded down the valley, and reached
habitations at 4000 feet: passing many villages and much
cultivation, we crossed the river, and ascended by 7 p.m., to the
village of Lingcham, just below the convent of Changachelling, very
tired and hungry. Bad weather had set in, and it was pitch dark and
raining hard when we arrived; but the Kajee, or head man, had sent
out a party with torches to conduct us, and he gave us a most
hospitable reception, honoured us with a salute of musketry, and
brought abundance of milk, eggs, fowls, plantains, and Murwa beer.
Plenty of news was awaiting me here, and a messenger with letters
was three marches further north, at Yoksun, waiting my expected
return over the Kanglanamo pass. Dr. Campbell, I was told, had left
Dorjiling; and was <i>en route</i> to meet the Rajah at Bhomsong on
the Teesta river, where no European had ever yet been; and as the
Sikkim authorities had for sixteen years steadily rejected every
overture for a friendly interview, and even refused to allow the
agent of the Governor-General to enter their dominions, it was
evident that grave doings were pending. I knew that Dr. Campbell
had long used every exertion to bring the Sikkim Rajah to a
friendly conference, without having to force his way into the
country for the purpose, but in vain. It will hardly</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 282">[ 282 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">be believed that though this chief&rsquo;s
dominions were redeemed by us from the Nepalese and given back to
him; though we had bound ourselves by a treaty to support him on
his throne, and to defend him against the Nepalese on the west, the
Bhutan people on the east, and the Tibetans on the north; and
though the terms of the treaty stipulated for free intercourse,
mutual protection, and friendship; the Sikkim authorities had
hitherto been allowed to obstruct all intercourse, and in every way
to treat the Governor-General&rsquo;s agent and the East India
Company with contempt. An affectation of timidity, mistrust, and
ignorance was assumed for the purpose of deception, and as a cloak
for every insult and resistance to the terms of our treaty, and it
was quoted by the Government in answer to every remonstrance on the
part of their resident agent at Dorjiling.</p>

<p>On the following morning the Kajee waited on me with a
magnificent present of a calf, a kid, fowls, eggs, rice, oranges,
plantains, egg-apples, Indian corn, yams, onions, tomatos, parsley,
fennel, turmeric, rancid butter, milk, and, lastly, a coolie-load
of fermenting millet-seeds, wherewith to make the favourite Murwa
beer. In the evening two lads arrived from Dorjiling, who had been
sent a week beforehand by my kind and thoughtful friend, Mr.
Hodgson, with provisions and money.</p>

<p>The valley of the Kulhait is one o&pound; the finest in Sikkim,
and it is accordingly the site of two of the oldest and richest
conventual establishments. Its length is sixteen miles, from the
Islumbo pass to the Great Rungeet, for ten of which it is
inhabited, the villages being invariably on long meridional spurs
that project north and south from either flank; they are about 2000
feet above the river, and from 4,500 to 5000 feet above the sea.
Except where these</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 283">[ 283 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">spurs project, the flanks of the valley are very
steep, the mountains rising to 7000 or 8000 feet.</p>

<p>Looking from any spur, up or down the valley, five or six others
might be seen on each side of the river, at very nearly the same
average level, all presenting great uniformity of contour, namely,
a gentle slope towards the centre of the valley, and then an abrupt
descent to the river. They were about a quarter of a mile broad at
the widest, and often narrower, and a mile or so long; some parts
of their surfaces and sides were quite flat, and occasionally
occupied by marshes or ponds. Cultivation is almost confined to
these spurs, and is carried on both on their summits and steep
flanks; between every two is a very steep gulley and water-course.
The timber has long since been either wholly or partially cleared
from the tops, but, to a great extent, still clothes their flanks
and the intervening gorges. I have been particular in describing
these spurs, because it is impossible to survey them without
ascribing their comparative uniformity of level to the action of
water. Similar ones are characteristic features of the valleys of
Sikkim between 2000 and 8000 feet, and are rendered conspicuous by
being always sites for villages and cultivation: the soil is a
vegetable mould, over a deep stratum of red clay.</p>

<p>I am far from supposing that any geologically recent action of
the sea has levelled these spurs; but as the great chain of the
Himalaya has risen from the ocean, and as every part of it has been
subjected to sea-action, it is quite conceivable that intervals of
rest during the periods of elevation or submergence would effect
their levelling. In a mountain mass so tumbled as is that of
Sikkim, any level surface, or approach to it, demands study; and
when, as in the Kulhait valley, we find several similar spurs with
comparatively flat tops, to occupy about the same level, it</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 284">[ 284 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">is necessary to look for some levelling cause. The
action of denudation is still progressing with astonishing
rapidity, under an annual fall of from 100 to 150 inches of rain;
but its tendency is to obliterate all such phenomena, and to give
sharp, rugged outlines to these spurs, in spite of the conservative
effects of vegetation.</p>

<p>The weather at Lingcham was gloomy, cold, and damp, with much
rain and fog, and the mean temperature (45&middot;25&deg;) was cold
for the elevation (4,860 feet): 52&middot;5&deg; was the highest
temperature observed, and 39&deg; the lowest.</p>

<p>A letter from Dr. Campbell reached me three days after my
arrival, begging me to cross the country to the Teesta river, and
meet him at Bhomsong, on its west bank, where he was awaiting my
arrival. I therefore left on the 20th of December, accompanied by
my friend the Kajee, who was going to pay his respects to the
Rajah. He was constantly followed by a lad, carrying a bamboo of
Murwa beer slung round his neck, with which he kept himself always
groggy. His dress was thoroughly Lepcha, and highly picturesque,
consisting of a very broad-brimmed round-crowned bamboo-platted
hat, scarlet jacket, and blue-striped cloth shirt, bare feet, long
knife, bow and quiver, rings and earrings, and a long pigtail. He
spoke no Hindoostanee, but was very communicative through my
interpreters.</p>

<p>Leaving the Lingcham spur, we passed steep cliffs of mica and
schist, covered with brushwood and long grass, about 1000 feet
above which the Changachelling convent is perched. Crossing a
torrent, we came to the next village, on the spur of Kurziuk, where
I was met by a deputation of women, sent by the Lamas of
Changachelling, bearing enormous loads of oranges, rice, milk,
butter, ghee, and the everflowing Murwa beer.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 285">[ 285 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The villagers had erected a shady bower for me to rest under, of
leaves and branches, and had fitted up a little bamboo stage, on
which to squat cross-legged as they do, or to hang my legs from, if
I preferred: after conducting me to this, the parties advanced and
piled their cumbrous presents on the ground, bowed, and retired;
they were succeeded by the beer-carrier, who plunged a clean
drinking-tube to the bottom of the steaming bamboo jug (described
at <a href="chap7.html#page 175">p. 175</a>), and held it to my
mouth, then placing it by my side, he bowed and withdrew. Nothing
can be more fascinating than the simple manners of these kind
people, who really love hospitality for its own sake, and make the
stranger feel himself welcome. Just now too, the Durbar had ordered
every attention to be paid me; and I hardly passed a village
however small, without receiving a present, or a cottage, where
beer was not offered. This I found a most grateful beverage; and of
the occasional rests under leafy screens during a hot day&rsquo;s
march, and sips at the bamboo jug, I shall ever retain a grateful
remembrance. Happily the liquor is very weak, and except by
swilling, as my friend the Kajee did, it would be impossible to get
fuddled by it.</p>

<p>At Kurziuk I was met by a most respectable Lepcha, who, as a
sort of compliment, sent his son to escort us to the next village
and spur of Pemiongchi, to reach which we crossed another gorge, of
which the situation and features were quite similar to those of
Kurziuk and Lingcham.</p>

<p>The Pemiongchi and Changachelling convents and temples stand a
few miles apart, on the ridge forming the north flank of the
Kulhait valley; and as they will be described hereafter, I now only
allude to the village, which is fully 1000 feet below the convent,
and large and populous.</p>

<p>At Pemiongchi a superior Lama met me with another</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 286">[ 286 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">overwhelming present: he was a most jolly fat
monk, shaven and girdled, and dressed in a scarlet gown: my Lepchas
kotowed to him, and he blessed them by the laying on of hands.</p>

<br>

<p>There is a marsh on this spur, full of the common English <i>
Acorus Calamus,</i> or sweet-flag, whose roots being very aromatic,
are used in griping disorders of men and cattle. Hence we descended
suddenly to the Great Rungeet, which we reached at its junction
with the Kulhait: the path was very steep and slippery, owing to
micaceous rocks, and led along the side of an enormous Mendong,*
which ran</p>

<p class="fnote">* This remarkable structure, called the Kaysing
Mendong, is 200 yards long, 10 feet high, and 6 or 8 feet broad: it
is built of flat, slaty stones, and both faces are covered with
inscribed slates, of which there are upwards of 700, and the
inscriptions, chiefly &ldquo;Om Mani,&rdquo; etc., are in both the
Uchen and Lencha Ranja characters of Tibet. A tall stone, nine feet
high, covered also with inscriptions, terminates it at the lower
end.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 287">[ 287 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">down the hill for several hundred yards, and had a
large chait at each end, with several smaller ones at intervals.
Throughout its length were innumerable inscriptions of &ldquo;Om
Mani Padmi om,&rdquo; with well carved figures of Boodh in his many
incarnations, besides Lamas, etc. At the lower end was a great flat
area, on which are burnt the bodies of Sikkim people of
consequence: the poorer people are buried, the richer burned, and
their ashes scattered or interred, but not in graves proper, of
which there are none. Nor are there any signs of Lepcha interment
throughout Sikkim; though chaits are erected to the memory of the
departed, they have no necessary connection with the remains, and
generally none at all. Corpses in Sikkim are never cut to pieces
and thrown into lakes, or exposed on hills for the kites and crows
to devour, as is the case in Tibet.</p>

<p>We passed some curious masses of crumpled chlorite slate,
presenting deep canals or furrows, along which a demon once drained
all the water from the Pemiongchi spur, to the great annoyance of
the villagers: the Lamas, however, on choosing this as a site for
their temples, easily confounded the machinations of the evil
spirit, who, in the eyes of the simple Lepchas, was answerable for
all the mischief.</p>

<p>I crossed the Great Rungeet at 1840 feet above the sea, where
its bed was twenty yards in width; a rude bridge, composed of two
culms of bamboo and a handrail, conducted me to the other side,
where we camped (on the east bank) in a thick tropical jungle. In
the evening</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 288">[ 288 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">I walked down the banks of the river, which flowed
in a deep gorge, cumbered with enormous boulders of granite,
clay-slate, and mica-slate; the rocks <i>in situ</i> were all of
the latter description, highly inclined, and much dislocated. Some
of the boulders were fully ten feet in diameter, permeated and
altered very much by granite veins which had evidently been
injected when molten, and had taken up angular masses of the
chlorite which remained, as it were, suspended in the veins.</p>

<p>It is not so easy to account for the present position of these
blocks of granite, a rock not common at elevations below 10,000
feet. They have been transported from a considerable distance in
the interior of the lofty valley to the north, and have descended
not less than 8000 feet, and travelled fully fifteen miles in a
straight line, or perhaps forty along the river bed. It may be
supposed that moraines have transported them to 8000 feet (the
lowest limit of apparent moraines), and the power of river water
carried them further; if so, the rivers must have been of much
greater volume formerly than they are now.</p>

<p>Our camp was on a gravel flat, like those of the Nepal valleys,
about sixty feet above the river; its temperature was 52&deg;,
which felt cool when bathing.</p>

<p>From the river we proceeded west, following a steep and clayey
ascent up the end of a very long spur, from the lofty mountain
range called Mungbreu, dividing the Great Rungeet from the Teesta.
We ascended by a narrow path, accomplishing 2,500 feet in an hour
and a quarter, walking slowly but steadily, without resting; this I
always found a heavy pull in a hot climate.</p>

<p>At about 4000 feet above the sea, the spur became more open and
flat, like those of the Kulhait valley, with alternate slopes and
comparative flats: from this elevation the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 289">[ 289 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">view north, south, and west, was very fine; below
us flowed the river, and a few miles up it was the conical wooded
hill of Tassiding, rising abruptly from a fork of the deep river
gorge, crowned with its curious temples and mendongs, and bristling
with chaits: on it is the oldest monastery in Sikkim, occupying a
singularly picturesque and prominent position. North of this spur,
and similar to it, lay that of Raklang, with the temple and
monastery of the same name, at about this elevation. In front,
looking west, across the Great Rungeet, were the monasteries of
Changachelling and Pemiongchi, perched aloft; and south of these
were the flat-topped spurs of the Kulhait valley, with their
villages, and the great mendong which I had passed on the previous
day, running like a white line down the spur. To the north, beyond
Tassiding, were two other monasteries, Doobdee and Sunnook, both
apparently placed on the lower wooded flanks of Kinchinjunga;
whilst close by was Dholing, the seventh religious establishment
now in sight.</p>

<p>We halted at a good wooden house to refresh ourselves with Murwa
beer, where I saw a woman with cancer in the face, an uncommon
complaint in this country. I here bought a little black puppy, to
be my future companion in Sikkim: he was of a breed between the
famous Tibet mastiff and the common Sikkim hunting-dog, which is a
variety of the sorry race called Pariah in the plains. Being only a
few weeks old, he looked a mere bundle of black fur; and I carried
him off, for he could not walk.</p>

<p>We camped at the village of Lingdam (alt. 5,550 feet), occupying
a flat, and surrounded by extensive pools of water (for this
country) containing <i>Acorus, Potamogeton,</i> and duckweed. Such
ponds I have often met with on these terraces, and they are very
remarkable, not being dammed in by any conspicuous barrier, but
simply occupying</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 290">[ 290 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">depressions in the surface, from which, as I have
repeatedly observed, the land dips rapidly to the valleys
below.</p>

<p>This being the high-road from Tumloong or Sikkim Durbar (the
capital, and Rajah&rsquo;s residence) to the numerous monasteries
which I had seen, we passed many Lamas and monks on their way home
from Tumloong, where they had gone to be present at the marriage of
the Tupgain Lama, the eldest son of the Rajah. A dispensation
having previously been procured from Lhassa, this marriage had been
effected by the Lamas, in order to counteract the efforts of the
Dewan, who sought to exercise an undue influence over the Rajah and
his family. The Tupgain Lama having only spiritual authority, and
being bound to celibacy, the temporal authority devolved on the
second son, who was heir apparent of Sikkim; he, however, having
died, an illegitimate son of the Rajah was favoured by the Dewan as
heir apparent. The bride was brought from Tibet, and the marriage
party were feasted for eighteen days at the Rajah&rsquo;s expense.
All the Lamas whom I met were clad in red robes, with girdles, and
were shaven, with bare feet and heads, or mitred; they wore
rosaries of onyx, turquoise, quartz, lapis lazuli, coral, glass,
amber, or wood, especially yellow berberry and sandal-wood: some
had staves, and one a trident like an eel-fork, on a long staff, an
emblem of the Hindoo Trinity, called Trisool Mahadeo, which
represents Brahma, Siva, and Vishnu, in Hindoo; and Boodh, Dhurma,
and Sunga, in Boodhist theology. All were on foot, indeed ponies
are seldom used in this country; the Lamas, however, walked with
becoming gravity and indifference to all around them.</p>

<p>The Kajee waited upon me in the evening; full of importance,
having just received a letter from his Rajah, which he wished to
communicate to me in private; so I accompanied him to a house close
by, where he was a guest, when the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 291">[ 291 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">secret came out, that his highness was dreadfully
alarmed at my coming with the two Ghorka Sepoys, whom I accordingly
dismissed.</p>

<p>The house was of the usual Bhoteea form, of wood, well built on
posts, one-storied, containing a single apartment hung round with
bows, quivers, shields, baskets of rice, and cornucopias of Indian
corn, the handsomest and most generous looking of all the Cerealia.
The whole party were deep in a carouse on Murwa beer, and I saw the
operation of making it. The millet-seed is moistened, and ferments
for two days: sufficient for a day&rsquo;s allowance is then put
into a vessel of wicker-work, lined with India-rubber to make it
water-tight; and boiling water is poured on it with a ladle of
gourd, from a huge iron cauldron that stands all day over the fire.
The fluid, when quite fresh, tastes like negus of Cape sherry,
rather sour. At this season the whole population are swilling,
whether at home or travelling, and heaps of the red-brown husks are
seen by the side of all the paths.</p>
