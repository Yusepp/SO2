<br>
<p class="first">My little tent was pitched in a commanding
situation, on a rock fifty feet above the Zemu, overlooking the
course of that river to its junction with the Thlonok. The descent
of the Zenlu in one thousand feet is more precipitous than that of
any other river of its size with which I am acquainted in Sikkim,
yet immediately above my camp it was more tranquil than at any part
of its course onwards to the plains of India, whether as the Zemu,
Lachen or Teesta. On the west bank a fine mountain rose in steep
ridges and shrubby banks to 15,000 feet; on the east a rugged cliff
towered above the stream, and from this, huge masses of rock were
ever and anon precipitated into the torrent, with a roar that
repeatedly spread consternation amongst us. During rains
especially, and at night, when the chilled atmospheric currents of
air descend, and the sound is not</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 57">[ 57 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">dissipated as in the day-time, the noise of these
falls is sufficiently alarming. My tent was pitched near the base
of the cliff, and so high above the river, that I had thought it
beyond the reach of danger; but one morning I found that a large
fragment of granite had been hurled during the night to my very
door, my dog having had a very narrow escape. To what depth the
accumulation at the base of this cliff may reach, I had no means of
judging, but the rapid slope of the river-bed is mainly due to
this, and to old moraines at the mouth of the valley below. I have
seen few finer sights than the fall of these stupendous blocks into
the furious torrent, along which they are carried amid feathery
foam for many yards before settling to rest.</p>

<p>Across the Thlonok to the southwards, rose the magnificent
mountain of Tukcham, but I only once caught a glimpse of its
summit, which even then clouded over before I could get my
instruments adjusted for ascertaining its height. Its top is a
sharp cone, surrounded by rocky shoulders, that rise from a mass of
snow. Its eastern slope of 8000 feet is very rapid (about 38&deg;)
from its base at the Zemu river to its summit.</p>

<p>Glaciers in the north-west Himalaya descend to 11,000 feet; but
I could not discover any in these valleys even so low as 14,000
feet, though at this season extensive snowbeds remain unmelted at
but little above 10,000 feet. The foot of the stupendous glacier
filling the broad head of the Thlonok is certainly not below 14,000
feet; though being continuous with the perpetual snow (or
n&eacute;v&eacute;) of the summit of Kinchinjunga, it must have
14,000 feet of ice, in perpendicular height, to urge it
forwards.</p>

<p>All my attempts to advance up the Zemu were fruitlesss and a
snow bridge by which I had hoped to cross to the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 58">[ 58 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">opposite bank was carried away by the daily
swelling river, while the continued bad weather prevented any
excursions for days together. Botany was my only resource, and as
vegetation was advancing rapidly under the influence of the
southerly winds, I had a rich harvest: for though <i>
Composit&aelig;, Pedicularis,</i> and a few more of the finer
Himalayan plants flower later, June is still the most glorious
month for show.</p>

<p>Rhododendrons occupy the most prominent place, clothing the
mountain slopes with a deep green mantle glowing with bells of
brilliant colours; of the eight or ten species growing here, every
bush was loaded with as great a profusion of blossoms as are their
northern congeners in our English gardens. Primroses are next, both
in beauty and abundance; and they are accompanied by yellow
cowslips, three feet high, purple polyanthus, and pink
large-flowered dwarf kinds nestling in the rocks, and an
exquisitely beautiful blue miniature species, whose blossoms
sparkle like sapphires on the turf. Gentians begin to unfold their
deep azure bells, aconites to rear their tall blue spikes, and
fritillaries and <i>Meconopsis</i> burst into flower. On the black
rocks the gigantic rhubarb forms pale pyramidal towers a yard high,
of inflated reflexed bracts, that conceal the flowers, and
over-lapping one another like tiles, protect them from the wind and
rain: a whorl of broad green leaves edged with red spreads on the
ground at the base of the plant, contrasting in colour with the
transparent bracts, which are yellow, margined with pink. This is
the handsomest herbaceous plant in Sikkim: it is called
&ldquo;Tchuka,&rdquo; and the acid stems are eaten both raw and
boiled; they are hollow and full of pure water: the root resembles
that of the medicinal rhubarb, but it is spongy and inert; it
attains a length of four</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 59">[ 59 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">feet, and grows as thick as the arm. The dried
leaves afford a substitute for tobacco; a smaller kind of rhubarb
is however more commonly used in Tibet for this purpose; it is
called &ldquo;Chula.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The elevation being 12,080 feet, I was above the limit of trees,
and the ground was covered with many kinds of small-flowered
honeysuckles, berberry, and white rose.*</p>

<p>I saw no birds, and of animals only an occasional muskdeer.
Insects were scarce, and quite different from what I had seen
before; chiefly consisting of <i>Phryganea</i> (Mayfly) and some
<i>Carabid&aelig;</i> (an order that is very scarce in the
Himalaya); with various moths, chiefly <i>Geometr&aelig;.</i></p>

<p>The last days of June (as is often the case) were marked by
violent storms, and for two days my tent proved no protection;
similar weather prevailed all over India, the barometer falling
very low. I took horary observations of the barometer in the height
of the storm on the 30th: the tide was very small indeed
(&middot;024 inch, between 9.50 a.m. and 4 p.m.), and the
thermometer ranged between 47&deg; and 57&middot;8&deg;, between 7
a.m. and midnight. Snow fell abundantly as low as 13,000 feet, and
the rivers were much swollen, the size and number of the stones
they rolled along producing a deafening turmoil. Only 3&middot;7
inches of rain fell between the 23rd of June and the 2nd of July;
whilst 21 inches fell at Dorjiling, and 6&middot;7 inches at
Calcutta. During the same period the mean temperature was 48&deg;;
extremes, 62&deg;/36.5&deg;. The humidity was nearly at
saturation-point, the wind southerly, very raw and cold, and
drizzling rain constantly</p>

<p class="fnote">* Besides these I found a prickly <i>Aralia,</i>
maple, two currants, eight or nine rhododendrons, many <i>Sedums,
Rhodiola,</i> white <i>Clematis,</i> red-flowered cherry, birch,
willow, <i>Viburnum,</i> juniper, a few ferns, two <i>Andromedas,
Menziesia,</i> and <i>Spirc&aelig;a.</i> And in addition to the
herbs mentioned above, may be enumerated <i>Parnassia,</i> many
Saxifrages, <i>Soldanella, Draba,</i> and various other <i>
Crucifer&aelig;, Nardostachys,</i> (spikenard), <i>Epilobium,
Thalictrum,</i> and very many other genera, almost all typical of
the Siberian, North European, and Arctic floras.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 60">[ 60 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">fell. A comparison of thirty observations with
Dorjiling gave a difference of 14&deg; temperature, which is at the
rate of 1&deg; for every 347 feet of ascent.*</p>

<p>The temperature of these rivers varies extremely at different
parts of their course, depending on that of their affluents. The
Teesta is always cool in summer (where its bed is below 2000 feet),
its temperature being 20&deg; below that of the air; whereas in
mid-winter, when there is less cloud, and the snows are not
melting, it is only a few degrees colder than the air.&dagger; At
this season, in descending from 12,000 feet to 1000 feet, its
temperature does not rise 10&deg;, though that of the air rises
30&deg; or 40&deg;. It is a curious fact, that the temperature of
the northern feeders of the Teesta, in some parts of their course,
rises with the increasing elevation! Of this the Zemu afforded a
curious example: during my stay at its junction with the Thlonok it
was 46&deg;, or 6&deg; warmer than that river; at 1,100 feet higher
it was 48&deg;, and at 1,100 feet higher still it was 49&deg;!
These observations were repeated in different weeks, and several
times on the same day, both in ascending and descending, and always
with the same result: they told, as certainly as if I had followed
the river to its source, that it rose in a drier and comparatively
sunny climate, and flowed amongst little snowed mountains.</p>

<p class="fnote">* Forty-seven observations, comparative with
Calcutta, gave 34&middot;8&deg; difference, and if 5.5&deg; of
temperature be deducted for northing in latitude, the result is
1&deg; for every 412 feet of ascent. My observations at the
junction of the rivers alt. 10,850 feet), during the early part of
the mouth, gave 1&deg; to 304 feet, as the result of twenty-four
observations with Dorjiling, and 1&deg; to 394 feet, from
seventy-four observations with Calcutta.<br>
&dagger; During my sojourn at Bhomsong in mid-winter of 1848 (see
v. i. <a href="chap13.html#page 305">p.305</a>), the mean
temperature of the Teesta was 51&deg;, and of the air
52&middot;3&deg;; at that elevation the river water rarely exceeds
60&deg; at midsummer. Between 4000 feet and 300 (the plains) its
mean temperature varies about 10&deg; between January and July; at
6000 feet it varies from 55&deg; to 43&deg; during the same period;
and at 10,000 feet it freezes at the edges in winter and rises to
50&deg; in July.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 61">[ 61 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Meanwhile, the Lachen Phipun continued to threaten
us, and I had to send back some of the more timorous of my party.
On the 28th of June fifty men arrived at the Thlonok, and turned my
people out of the shed at the junction of the rivers, together with
the plants they were preserving, my boards, papers, and utensils.
The boys came to me breathless, saying that there were Tibetan
soldiers amongst them, who declared that I was in Cheen, and that
they were coming on the following morning to make a clean sweep of
my goods, and drive me back to Dorjiling. I had little fear for
myself, but was anxious with respect to my collections: it was
getting late in the day, and raining, and I had no mind to go down
and expose myself to the first brunt of their insolence, which I
felt sure a night of such weather would materially wash away. Meepo
was too frightened, but Nimbo, my Bhotan coolie Sirdar, volunteered
to go, with two stout fellows; and he accordingly brought away my
plants and papers, having held a parley with the enemy, who, as I
suspected, were not Tibetans. The best news he brought was, that
they were half clad and without food; the worst, that they
swaggered and bullied: he added, with some pride, that he gave them
as good as he got, which I could readily believe, Nimbo being
really a resolute fellow,* and accomplished in Tibet slang.</p>

<p>On the following morning it rained harder than ever, and the
wind was piercingly cold. My timid Lepchas huddled behind my tent,
which, from its position, was only to be stormed in front. I
dismantled my little observatory, and packed up the instruments,
tied my dog, Kinchin, to one of the tent-pegs, placed a line of
stones opposite</p>

<p class="fnote">* In East Nepal he drew his knife on a Ghorka
sepoy; and in the following winter was bold enough to make his
escape in chains from Tumloong.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 62">[ 62 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the door, and seated myself on my bed on the
ground, with my gun beside me.</p>

<p>The dog gave tongue as twenty or thirty people defiled up the
glen, and gathered in front of my tent; they were ragged Bhoteeas,
with bare heads and legs, in scanty woollen garments sodden with
rain, which streamed off their shaggy hair, and furrowed their
sooty faces: their whole appearance recalled to my mind Dugald
Dalgetty&rsquo;s friends, the children of the mist.</p>

<p>They appeared nonplussed at seeing no one with me, and at my
paying no attention to them, whilst the valiant Kinchin effectually
scared them from the tent-door. When they requested a parley, I
sent the interpreter to say that I would receive three men, and
that only provided all the rest were sent down immediately; this,
as I anticipated, was acceded to at once, and there remained only
the Lachen Phipun and his brother. Without waiting to let him
speak, I rated him soundly, saying, that I was ready to leave the
spot when he could produce any proof of my being in Bhote (or
Cheen), which he knew well I was not; that, since my arrival at
Lachen, he had told me nothing but lies, and had contravened every
order, both of the Rajah and of Tchebu Lama. I added, that I had
given him and his people kindness and medicine, their return was
bad, and he must go about his business at once, having, as I knew,
no food, and I having none for him. He behaved very humbly
throughout, and finally took himself off much discomfited, and two
days afterwards sent men to offer to assist me in moving my
things.</p>

<p>The first of July was such a day as I had long waited for to
obtain a view, and I ascended the mountain west of my camp, to a
point where water boiling at 185&middot;7&deg; (air 42&deg;), gave
an elevation of 14,914 feet. On the top of the range,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 63">[ 63 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">about 1000 feet above this, there was no snow on
the eastern exposures, except in hollows, but on the west slopes it
lay in great fields twenty or thirty feet thick; while to the
north, the mountains all appeared destitute of snow, with grassy
flanks and rugged tops.</p>

<p>Drizzling mist, which had shrouded Tukcham all the morning, soon
gathered on this mountain, and prevented any prospect from the
highest point reached; but on the ascent I had an excellent view up
the Zemu, which opened into a broad grassy valley, where I saw with
the glass some wooden sheds, but no cattle or people. To reach
these, however, involved crossing the river, which was now
impossible; and I reluctantly made up my mind to return on the
morrow to Zemu Samdong, and thence try the other river.</p>

<p>On my descent to the Thlonok, I found that the herbaceous plants
on the terraces had grown fully two feet during the fortnight, and
now presented almost a tropical luxuriance and beauty. Thence I
reached Zemu Samdong in one day, and found the vegetation there
even more gay and beautiful: the gigantic lily was in full flower,
and scenting the air, with the lovely red rose, called
&ldquo;Chirring&rdquo; by the Tibetans. <i>Neillia</i> was
blossoming profusely at my old camping-ground, to which I now
returned after a month&rsquo;s absence.</p>

<p>Soon after my arrival I received letters from Dr. Campbell, who
had strongly and repeatedly represented to the Rajah his opinion of
the treatment I was receiving; and this finally brought an explicit
answer, to the effect that his orders had been full and peremptory
that I should be supplied with provisions, and safely conducted to
the frontier. With these came letters on the Rajah&rsquo;s part
from Tchebu Lama to the Lachen Phipun, ordering him to take me to
the pass, but not specifying its position; fortunately,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 64">[ 64 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">however, Dr. Campbell sent me a route, which
stated the pass to be at Kongra Lama, several marches beyond this,
and in the barren country of Tibet.</p>

<p>On the 5th of July the Singtam Soubah arrived from Chola (the
Rajah&rsquo;s summer residence): he was charged to take me to the
frontier, and brought letters from his highness, as well as a
handsome present, consisting of Tibet cloth, and a dress of China
silk brocaded with gold: the Ranee also sent me a basket of Lhassa
sweetmeats, consisting of Sultana raisins from Bokhara, sliced and
dried apricots from Lhassa, and <i>Diospyros</i> fruit from China
(called &ldquo;Gubroon&rdquo; by the Tibetans). The Soubah wanted
to hurry me on to the frontier and back at once, being no doubt
instigated to do so by the Dewan&rsquo;s party, and by his having
no desire to spend much time in the dreary lofty regions I wanted
to explore. I positively refused, however, to start until more
supplies arrived, except he used his influence to provide me with
food; and as he insisted that the frontier was at Tallum Samdong,
only one march up the Lachen, I foresaw that this move was to be
but one step forward, though in the right direction. He went
forward to Tallum at once, leaving me to follow.</p>

<p>The Lamteng people had all migrated beyond that point to Tungu,
where they were pasturing their cattle: I sent thither for food,
and procured a little meal at a very high price, a few fowls and
eggs; the messenger brought back word that Tungu was in Tibet, and
that the villagers ignored Kongra Lama. A large piece of yak-flesh
being brought for sale, I purchased it; but it proved the toughest
meat I ever ate, being no doubt that of an animal that had
succumbed to the arduous duties of a salt-carrier over the passes:
at this season, however, when the calves are not a month old, it
was in vain to expect better.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 65">[ 65 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Large parties of women and children were daily
passing my tent from Tungu, to collect arum-roots at the Thlonok,
all with baskets at their backs, down to rosy urchins of six years
old: they returned after several days, their baskets neatly lined
with broad rhododendron leaves, and full of a nauseous-looking
yellow acid pulp, which told forcibly of the extreme poverty of the
people. The children were very fair; indeed the young Tibetan is as
fair as an English brunette, before his perennial coat of smoke and
dirt has permanently stained his face, and it has become bronzed
and wrinkled by the scorching sun and rigorous climate of these
inhospitable countries. Children and women were alike decked with
roses, and all were good-humoured and pleasant, behaving with great
kindness to one another, and unaffected politeness to me.</p>

<p>During my ten days&rsquo; stay at Zemu Samdong, I formed a large
collection of insects, which was in great part destroyed by damp:
many were new, beautiful, and particularly interesting, from
belonging to types whose geographical distribution is analogous to
that of the vegetation. The caterpillar of the swallow-tail
butterfly (<i>Papilio Machaon</i>), was common, feeding on
umbelliferous plants, as in England; and a <i>Sphynx</i> (like <i>
S. Euphorbi&aelig;</i>) was devouring the euphorbias; the English
<i>Cynthia Cardui</i> (painted-lady butterfly) was common, as were
&ldquo;sulphurs,&rdquo; &ldquo;marbles,&rdquo; <i>Pontia</i>
(whites), &ldquo;blues,&rdquo; and <i>Thecla,</i> of British aspect
but foreign species. Amongst these, tropical forms were rare,
except one fine black swallow-tail. Of moths, <i>Noctu&aelig;</i>
and <i>Geometr&aelig;</i> abounded, with many flies and <i>
Tipul&aelig;. Hymenoptera</i> were scarce, except a yellow <i>
Ophion,</i> which lays its eggs in the caterpillars
above-mentioned. Beetles were most rare, and (what is remarkable)
the wood-borers (<i>longicorns</i> and <i>Curculio</i>)
particularly so. A large <i>Telephora</i> was</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 66">[ 66 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">very common, and had the usual propensity of its
congeners for blood; <i>lamellicorns</i> were also abundant.</p>

<p>On the 11th of July five coolies arrived with rice: they had
been twenty days on the road, and had been obliged to make great
detours, the valley being in many places impassable. They brought
me a parcel of English letters; and I started up the Lachen on the
following day, with renewed spirits and high hopes. The road first
crossed the Zemu and the spur beyond, and then ascended the west
bank of the Lachen, a furious torrent for five or six miles, during
which it descends 1000 feet, in a chasm from which rise lofty black
pine-clad crags, topped by snowy mountains, 14,000 to 16,000 feet
high. One remarkable mass of rock, on the east bank, is called
&ldquo;Sakya-zong&rdquo; (or the abode of Sakya, often pronounced
Thakya, one of the Boodhist Trinity); at its base a fine cascade
falls into the river.</p>

<p>Above 11,000 feet the valley expands remarkably, the mountains
recede, become less wooded, and more grassy, while the stream is
suddenly less rapid, meandering in a broader bed, and bordered by
marshes, covered with <i>Carex, Blysmus,</i> dwarf Tamarisk, and
many kinds of yellow and red <i>Pedicularis,</i> both tall and
beautiful. There are far fewer rhododendrons here than in the
damper Zemu valley at equal elevations, and more Siberian, or dry
country types of vegetation, as <i>Astragali</i> of several kinds,
<i>Habenaria, Epipactis,</i> dandelion, and a caraway, whose stems
(called in Tibet &ldquo;Gzira&rdquo;) are much sought for as a
condiment.* The Singtam Soubah and Lachen Phipun</p>

<p class="fnote">* <i>Umbellifer&aelig;</i> abound here; with sage,
<i>Ranunculus, Anemone,</i> Aconites, <i>Halenia,</i> Gentians, <i>
Panax, Euphrasia,</i> speedwell, <i>Prunella vulgaris,</i>
thistles, bistort, <i>Parnassia,</i> purple orchis, <i>
Prenanthes,</i> and <i>Lactuca.</i> The woody plants of this region
are willows, birch, <i>Cotoneaster,</i> maple, three species of <i>
Viburnum,</i> three of <i>Spir&aelig;a, Vaccinium, Aralia, Deutzia,
Philadelphus,</i> rhododendrons, two junipers, silver fir, larch,
three honeysuckles, <i>Neillia,</i> and a <i>Pieris,</i> whose
white blossoms are so full of honey as to be sweet and
palatable.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 67">[ 67 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">received me at the bridge (Samdong), at Tallum,
and led me across the river (into Cheen they affirmed) to a pretty
green sward, near some gigantic gneiss boulders, where I camped,
close by the river, and 11,480 feet above the sea.</p>

<p>The village of Tallum consists of a few wretched stone huts,
placed in a broad part of the valley, which is swampy, and crossed
by several ancient moraines, which descend from the gulleys on the
east flank.* The cottages are from four to six feet high, without
windows, and consist of a single apartment, containing neither
table, chair, stool, nor bed; the inmates huddle together amid
smoke, filth, and darkness, and sleep on a plank; and their only
utensils are a bamboo churn, copper, bamboo, and earthenware
vessels, for milk, butter, etc.</p>

<p>Grassy or stony mountains slope upwards, at an angle of
20&deg;,&dagger; from these flats to 15,000 feet, but no snow is
visible, except on Kinchinjhow and Chomiomo, about fifteen miles up
the valley. Both these are flat-topped, and dazzlingly white,
rising into small peaks, and precipitous on all sides; they are
grand, bold, isolated masses, quite unlike the ordinary snowy
mountains in form, and far more imposing even than Kinchinjunga,
though not above 22,000 feet in elevation.</p>

<p>Herbaceous plants are much more numerous here than in any other
part of Sikkim; and sitting at my tent-door, I could, without
rising from the ground, gather forty-three plants,&Dagger; of which
all but two belonged to English genera.</p>

<p class="fnote">* I have elsewhere noticed that in Sikkim, the
ancient moraines above 9000 feet are almost invariably deposited
from valleys opening to the westward.<br>
&dagger; At Lamteng and up the Zemu the slopes are 40&deg; and
50&deg;, giving a widely different aspect to the valleys.<br>
&Dagger; In England thirty is, on the average, the equivalent
number of plants, which in favourable localities I have gathered in
an equal space. In both cases many are seedlings of short-lived
annuals, and in neither is the number a test of the luxuriance of
the vegetation; it but shows the power which the different species
exert in their struggle to obtain a place.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 68">[ 68 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">In the rich soil about the cottages were crops of
dock, shepherd&rsquo;s-purse, <i>Thlaspi arvense, Cynoglossum</i>
of two kinds (one used as a pot-herb), balsams, nettle, <i>
Galeopsis,</i> mustard, radish, and turnip. On the neighbouring
hills, which I explored up to 15,000 feet, I found many fine
plants, partaking more or less of the Siberian type, of which <i>
Corydalis, Leguminos&aelig;, Artemisia,</i> and <i>Pedicularis,</i>
are familiar instances. I gathered upwards of 200 species, nearly
all belonging to north European genera. Twenty-five were woody
shrubs above three feet high, and six were ferns;* sedges were in
great profusion, amongst them three of British kinds: seven or
eight were <i>Orchide&aelig;,</i> including a fine <i>
Cypripedium.</i></p>

<p>The entomology of Tallum, like its botany, was Siberian, Arctic
types occurring at lower elevations than in the wetter parts of
Sikkim. Of beetles the honey-feeding ones prevailed, with European
forms of others that inhabit yak-droppings.&dagger; Bees were
common, both <i>Bombus</i> and <i>Andr&aelig;na,</i> but there were
no wasps, and but few ants. Grasshoppers and other <i>
Orthoptera</i> were rare, as were <i>Hemiptera</i>; <i>Tipula</i>
was the common dipterous insect, with a small sand-fly: there were
neither leeches, mosquitos, ticks, nor midges. Pigeons, red-legged
crows, and hawks were the common birds; with a few waders in the
marshes.</p>

<p>Being now fairly behind most of the great snow and
rain-collecting mountains, I experienced a considerable</p>

<p class="fnote">* <i>Cryptogramma crispa, Davallia,</i> two <i>
Aspidia,</i> and two <i>Polypodia.</i> I gathered ten at the same
elevation, in the damper Zemu valley (see <a href=
"chap19.html#page 49">p. 49,</a> note). I gathered in this valley a
new species of the remarkable European genus <i>Struthiopteris,</i>
which has not been found elsewhere in the Himalaya.<br>
&dagger; As <i>Aphodius</i> and <i>Geotrupes.</i> Predaceous genera
were very rare, as <i>Carabus</i> and <i>Staphylinus,</i> so
typical of boreal regions. <i>Coccinella</i> (lady-bird), which
swarms at Dorjiling, does not ascend so high, and a <i>Clytus</i>
was the only longicorn. <i>Bupretis, Elater,</i> and <i>Blaps</i>
were found but rarely. Of butterflies, the <i>Machaon</i> seldom
reaches this elevation, but the painted-lady, <i>Pontia, Colias,
Hipparchia, Argynnis,</i> and <i>Polyommatus,</i> are all
found.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">change in the climate, which characterises all
these rearward lofty valleys, where very little rain falls, and
that chiefly drizzle; but this is so constant that the weather
feels chilly, raw, and comfortless, and I never returned dry from
botanising. The early mornings were bright with views northwards of
blue sky and Kinchinjhow, while to the south the lofty peak of
Tukcham, though much nearer, was seldom seen, and black cumuli and
nimbi rolled up the steep valley of the Lachen to be dissipated in
mist over Tallum. The sun&rsquo;s rays were, however, powerful at
intervals during the forenoon, whence the mean maximum temperature
of July occurred at about 10 a.m. The temperature of the river was
always high, varying with the heat of the day from 47&deg; to
52&deg;; the mean being 50&deg;.</p>

<p>These streams do not partake of the diurnal rise and fall, so
characteristic of the Swiss rivers and those of the western
Himalaya, where a powerful sun melts the glaciers by day, and their
head-streams are frozen by night. Here the clouds alike prevent
solar and nocturnal radiation, the temperature is more uniform, and
the corroding power of the damp southerly wind that blows strongly
throughout the day is the great melting agent. One morning I saw a
vivid and very beautiful halo 20&deg; distant from the sun&rsquo;s
disc; it was no doubt caused by snow in the higher regions of the
atmosphere, as a sharp shower of rain fell immediately afterwards:
these are rare phenomena in mountainous countries.</p>

<p>The Singtam Soubah visited me daily, and we enjoyed long
friendly conversations: he still insisted that the Yangchoo (the
name he gave to the Lachen at this place) was the boundary, and
that I must not go any further. His first question was always
&ldquo;How long do you intend to remain here? have you not got all
the plants and stones</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 70">[ 70 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">you want? you can see the sun much better with
those brasses and glasses* lower down; it is very cold here, and
there is no food:&rdquo;&mdash;to all which I had but one reply,
that I should not return till I had visited Kongra Lama. He was a
portly man, and, I think, at heart good-natured: I had no
difficulty in drawing him on to talk about Tibet, and the holy city
of Teshoo Loombo, with its thousands of gilt temples, nunneries,
and convents, its holiest of all the holy grand Lamas of Tibet, and
all the wide Boodhist world besides. Had it even been politic, I
felt it would be unfair to be angry with a man who was evidently in
a false position between myself and his two rulers, the Rajah and
Dewan; who had a wife and family on the smiling flanks of Singtam,
and who longed to be soaking in the warm rain of Sikkim, drinking
Murwa beer (a luxury unknown amongst these Tibetans) and gathering
in his crops of rice, millet, and buckwheat. Though I may owe him a
grudge for his subsequent violence, I still recall with pleasure
the hours we spent together on the banks of the Lachen. In all
matters respecting the frontier, his lies were circumstantial; and
he further took the trouble of bringing country people to swear
that this was Cheen, and that there was no such place as Kongra
Lama. I had written to ask Dr. Campbell for a definite letter from
Tchebu Lama on this point, but unfortunately my despatches were
lost; the messenger who conveyed them missed his footing in
crossing the Lachen, and escaped narrowly with life, while the
turban in which the letters were placed was carried down the
current.</p>

<p>Finally the Soubah tried to persuade my people that one so
incorrigibly obstinate must be mad, and that they had better leave
me. One day, after we had had a long</p>

<p class="fnote">* Alluding to the sextant, etc.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 71">[ 71 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">discussion about the geography of the frontier, he
inflamed my curiosity by telling me that Kinchinjhow was a very
holy mountain; more so than its sister-peaks of Chumulari and
Kinchinjunga; and that both the Sikkim and Tibetan Lamas, and
Chinese soldiers, were ready to oppose my approach to it. This led
to my asking him for a sketch of the mountains; he called for a
large sheet of paper, and some charcoal, and wanted to form his
mountains of sand; I however ordered rice to be brought, and though
we had but little, scattered it about wastefully. This had its
effect: he stared at my wealth, for he had all along calculated on
starving me out, and retired, looking perplexed and crestfallen.
Nothing puzzled him so much as my being always occupied with such,
to him, unintelligible pursuits; a Tibetan &ldquo;cui bono?&rdquo;
was always in his mouth: &ldquo;What good will it do <i>
you</i>?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why should you spend weeks on the coldest,
hungriest, windiest, loftiest place on the earth, without even
inhabitants?&rdquo; Drugs and idle curiosity he believed were my
motives, and possibly a reverence for the religion of Boodh, Sakya,
and Tsongkaba. Latterly he had made up his mind to starve me out,
and was dismayed when he found I could hold out better than
himself, and when I assured him that I should not retrace my steps
until his statements should be verified by a letter from Tchebu;
that I had written to him, and that it would be at least thirty
days before I could receive an answer.</p>

<p>On the 19th of July he proposed to take me to Tungu, at the foot
of Kinchinjhow, and back, upon ponies, provided I would leave my
people and tent, which I refused to do. After this I saw little of
him for several days, and began to fear he was offended, when one
morning his attendant came to me for medicine with a dismal
countenance, and</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 72">[ 72 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">in great alarm: he twisted his fingers together
over his stomach to symbolise the nature of the malady which
produced a commotion in his master&rsquo;s bowels, and which was
simply the colic. I was aware that he had been reduced to feed upon
&ldquo;Tong&rdquo; (the arum-root) and herbs, and had always given
him half the pigeons I shot, which was almost the only animal food
I had myself. Now I sent him a powerful dose of medicine; adding a
few spoonfuls of China tea and sugar for friendship.</p>

<p>On the 22nd, being convalescent, he visited me, looking wofully
yellow. After a long pause, during which he tried to ease himself
of some weighty matter, he offered to take me to Tungu with my tent
and people, and, thence to Kongra Lama, if I would promise to stay
but two nights. I asked whether Tungu was in Cheen or Sikkim; he
replied that after great enquiry he had heard that it was really in
Sikkim; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we will both go
to-morrow morning to Tungu, and I will stay there as long as I
please:&rdquo; he laughed, and gave in with apparent good
grace.</p>

<p>After leaving Tallum, the valley contracts, passing over great
ancient moraines, and again expanding wider than before into broad
grassy flats. The vegetation rapidly diminishes in stature and
abundance, and though the ascent to Tungu is trifling, the change
in species is very great. The <i>Spir&aelig;a,</i> maple, <i>
Pieris,</i> cherry, and larch disappear, leaving only willow,
juniper, stunted birch, silver fir, white rose, <i>Aralia,</i>
berberry, currant, and more rhododendrons than all these put
together;*</p>

<p class="fnote">* <i>Cyananthus,</i> a little blue flower allied
to <i>Campanula,</i> and one of the most beautiful alpines I know,
covered the turfy ground, with <i>Orchis, Pedicularis, Gentian,
Potentilla, Geranium,</i> purple and yellow <i>Meconopsis,</i> and
the <i>Artemisia</i> of Dorjiling, which ascends to 12,000 feet,
and descends to the plains, having a range of 11,500 feet in
elevation. Of ferns, <i>Hymenophyllum, Cistopteris,</i> and <i>
Cryptogramma crispa</i> ascend thus high.</p>

<p>Tungu occupies a very broad valley, at the junction of the
Tungu-choo from the east, and the Lachen from the north. The hills
slope gently upwards to 16,000 feet, at an average angle of
15&deg;; they are flat and grassy at the base, and no snow is
anywhere to be seen.&dagger; A stupendous rock, about fifty feet
high, lay in the middle of the valley,</p>

<p class="fnote">* One of great size, growing in large clumps, is
the English <i>Agaricus comans,</i> Fr., and I found it here at
12,500 feet, as also the beautiful genus <i>Crucibulum,</i> which
is familiar to us in England, growing on rotten sticks, and
resembling a diminutive bird&rsquo;s nest with eggs in it.<br>
&dagger; In the wood-cut the summit of Chomiomo is introduced, as
it appears from a few hundred feet above the point of view.</p>

<p class="first">broken in two: it may have been detached from a
cliff, or have been transported thither as part of an ancient
moraine which extends from the mouth of the Tungu-choo valley
across that of the Lachen. The appearance and position of this
great block, and of the smaller piece lying beside it, rather
suggest the idea of the whole mass having fallen perpendicularly
from a great height through a <i>crevasse</i> in a glacier, than of
its having been hurled from so considerable a distance as from the
cliffs on the flanks of the valley: it is faithfully represented in
the accompanying woodcut. A few wooden houses were collected near
this rock, and several black tents were scattered about. I encamped
at an elevation of 12,750 feet, and was waited on by the Lachen
Phipun with presents of milk, butter, yak-flesh, and curds; and we
were not long before we drowned old enmity in buttered and salted
tea.</p>

<p>On my arrival I found the villagers in a meadow, all squatted
cross-legged in a circle, smoking their brass and iron pipes,
drinking tea, and listening to a letter from the Rajah, concerning
their treatment of me. Whilst my men were pitching my tent, I
gathered forty plants new to me, all of Tartarian types.* Wheat or
barley I was assured had been cultivated at Tungu when it was
possessed by Tibetans, and inhabited by a frontier guard, but I saw
no appearance of any cultivation. The fact is an important one, as
barley requires a mean summer temperature of 48&deg; to come to
maturity. According to my observations, the</p>

<p class="fnote">* More Siberian plants appeared, as <i>Astragali,
Chenopodium, Artemisia,</i> some grasses, new kinds of <i>
Pedicularis, Delphinium,</i> and some small Orchids. Three species
of <i>Parnassia</i> and six primroses made the turf gay, mixed with
saxifrages, <i>Androsace</i> and <i>Campanula.</i> By the cottages
was abundance of shepherd&rsquo;s-purse, <i>Lepidium,</i> and
balsams, with dock, <i>Galeopsis,</i> and <i>Cuscuta.</i> Several
low dwarf species of honeysuckle formed stunted bushes like
heather; and <i>Anisodus,</i> a curious plant allied to <i>
Hyoscyamus,</i> whose leaves are greedily eaten by yaks, was very
common.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 75">[ 75 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">mean temperature of Tungu in July is upwards of
50&deg;, and, by calculation, that of the three summer months,
June, July, and August, should be about 46&middot;5&deg;. As,
however, I do not know whether these cerealia were grown as
productive crops, much stress cannot be laid upon the fact of their
having been cultivated, for in a great many parts of Tibet the
barley is annually cut green for fodder.</p>

<p>In the evening the sick came to me: their complaints, as usual,
being rheumatism, ophthalmia, goitres, cuts, bruises, and poisoning
by Tong (<i>Arum</i>), fungi, and other deleterious vegetables. At
Tallum I attended an old woman who dressed her ulcers with <i>
Plantago</i> (plantain) leaves, a very common Scotch remedy; the
ribs being drawn out from the leaf, which is applied fresh: it is
rather a strong application.</p>

<p>On the following morning I was awakened by the shrill cries of
the Tibetan maidens, calling the yaks to be milked,
&ldquo;Toosh&mdash;toosh&mdash;toooosh,&rdquo; in a gradually
higher key; to which Toosh seemed supremely indifferent, till
quickened in her movements by a stone or stick, levelled with
unerring aim at her ribs; these animals were changing their long
winter&rsquo;s wool for sleek hair, and the former hung about them
in ragged masses, like tow. Their calves gambolled by their sides,
the drollest of animals, like ass-colts in their antics, kicking up
their short hind-legs, whisking their bushy tails in the air,
rushing up and down the grassy slopes, and climbing like cats to
the top of the rocks.</p>

<p>The Soubah and Phipun came early to take me to Kongra Lama,
bringing ponies, genuine Tartars in bone and breed. Remembering the
Dewan&rsquo;s impracticable saddle at Bhomsong, I stipulated for a
horse-cloth or pad, upon which I had no sooner jumped than the
beast threw back his ears, seated himself on his haunches, and, to
my</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 76">[ 76 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">consternation, slid backwards down a turfy slope,
pawing the earth with his fore-feet as he went, and leaving me on
the ground, amid shrieks of laughter from my Lepchas. My steed
being caught, I again mounted, and was being led forward, when he
took to shaking himself like a dog till the pad slipped under his
belly, and I was again unhorsed. Other ponies displayed equal
prejudices against my mode of riding, or having my weight anywhere
but well on their shoulders, being all-powerful in their
fore-quarters; and so I was compelled to adopt the high demi-pique
saddle with short stirrups, which forced me to sit with my knees up
to my nose, and to grip with the calves of my legs and heels. All
the gear was of yak or horse-hair, and the bit was a curb and ring,
or a powerful twisted snaffle.</p>

<p>The path ran N.N.W. for two miles, and then crossed the Lachen
above its junction with the Nunee* from the west: the stream was
rapid, and twelve yards in breadth; its temperature was 48&deg;.
About six miles above Tungu, the Lachen is joined by the
Chomio-choo, a large affluent from Chomiomo mountain. Above this
the Lachen meanders along a broad stony bed; and the path rises
over a great ancient moraine, whose level top is covered with
pools, but both that and its south face are bare, from exposure to
the south wind, which blows with fury through this contracted part
of the valley to the rarified atmosphere of the lofty, open, and
dry country beyond. Its north slope, on the contrary, is covered
with small trees and brushwood, rhododendron, birch, honeysuckle,
and mountain-ash. These are the most northern shrubs in Sikkim, and
I regarded them with deep interest, as being possibly the</p>

<p class="fnote">* I suspect there is a pass by the Nunee to the
sheds I saw up the Zemu valley on the 2nd of July, as I observed
yaks grazing high up the mountains: the distance cannot be great,
and there is little or no snow to interfere.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 77">[ 77 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">last of their kind to be met with in this
meridian, for many degrees further north: perhaps even no similar
shrubs occur between this and the Siberian Altai, a distance of
1,500 miles. The magnificent yellow cowslip (<i>Primula
Sikkimensis</i>) gilded the marshes, and <i>Caltha,</i>* <i>
Trollius,</i> Anemone, <i>Arenaria, Draba,</i> Saxifrages,
Potentillas, Ranunculus, and other very alpine plants abounded.</p>

<p>At the foot of the moraine was a Tibetan camp of broad, black,
yak-hair tents, stretched out with a complicated system of ropes,
and looking at a distance&mdash;(to borrow M. Huc&rsquo;s graphic
simile)&mdash;like fat-bodied, long-legged spiders! Their general
shape is hexagonal, about twelve feet either way, and they are
stretched over six short posts, and encircled with a low stone
wall, except in front. In one of them I found a buxom girl, the
image of good humour, making butter and curd from yak-milk. The
churns were of two kinds; one being an oblong box of birch-bark, or
close bamboo wicker-work, full of branched rhododendron twigs, in
which the cream is shaken: she good-naturedly showed me the inside,
which was frosted with snow-white butter, and alive with maggots.
The other churn was a goat-skin, which was rolled about, and shaken
by the four legs. The butter is made into great squares, and packed
in yak-hair cloths; the curd is eaten either fresh, or dried and
pulverised (when it is called &ldquo;Ts&rsquo;cheuzip&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Except bamboo and copper milk-vessels, wooden ladles, tea-churn,
and pots, these tents contained no furniture but goat-skins and
blankets, to spread on the ground as a bed. The fire was made of
sheep and goats&rsquo;-droppings, lighted with juniper-wood; above
it hung tufts of yaks&rsquo;-hair, one</p>

<p class="fnote">* This is the <i>C. scaposa,</i> n. sp. The common
<i>Caltha palustris,</i> or &ldquo;marsh marigold&rdquo; of
England, which is not found in Sikkim, is very abundant in the

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">for every animal lost during the season,* by which
means a reckoning is kept. Although this girl had never before seen
a European, she seemed in no way discomposed at my visit, and gave
me a large slice of fresh curd.</p>

<p>Beyond this place (alt. 14,500 feet), the valley runs up
north-east, becoming very stony and desolate, with green patches
only by the watercourses: at this place, however, thick fogs came
on, and obscured all view. At 15,000 feet, I passed a small glacier
on the west side of the valley, the first I had met with that
descended nearly to the river, during the whole course of the
Teesta.</p>

<p>Five miles further on we arrived at the tents of the Phipun,
whose wife was prepared to entertain us with Tartar hospitality:
magnificent tawny Tibet mastiffs were baying at the tent-door, and
some yaks and ponies were grazing close by. We mustered twelve in
number, and squatted cross-legged in a circle inside the tent, the
Soubah and myself being placed on a pretty Chinese rug. Salted and
buttered tea was immediately prepared in a tea-pot for us on the
mat, and in a great caldron for the rest of the party; parched rice
and wheat-flour, curd, and roasted maize&dagger; were offered us,
and we each produced our wooden cup, which was kept constantly full
of scalding tea-soup, which, being made with fresh butter, was very
good. The flour was the favourite food, of which each person
dexterously formed little dough-balls in his cup, an operation I
could not well manage, and only succeeded in making a nauseous
paste, that stuck to my jaws and in my throat. Our</p>

<p class="first">hostess&rsquo; hospitality was too <i>exigeant</i>
for me, but the others seemed as if they could not drink enough of
the scalding tea.</p>

<p>We were suddenly startled from our repast by a noise like loud
thunder, crash following crash, and echoing through the valley. The
Phipun got up, and coolly said, &ldquo;The rocks are falling, it is
time we were off, it will rain soon.&rdquo; The moist vapours had
by this time so accumulated, as to be condensed in rain on the
cliffs of Chomiomo and Kinchinjhow; which, being loosened,
precipitated avalanches of rocks and snow. We proceeded amidst
dense fog, soon followed by hard rain; the roar of falling rocks on
either hand increasing as these invisible giants spoke to one
another in voices of thunder through the clouds. The effect was
indescribably grand: and as the weather cleared, and I obtained
transient peeps of their precipices of blue ice and black rock
towering 5000 feet above me on either hand, the feeling of awe
produced was almost overpowering. Heavy banks of vapour still
veiled the mountains, but the rising mist exposed a broad stony
track, along which the Lachen wandered, split into innumerable
channels, and enclosing little oases of green vegetation, lighted
up by occasional gleams of sunshine. Though all around was
enveloped in gloom, there was in front a high blue arc of cloudless
sky, between the beetling cliffs that formed the stern portals of
the Kongra Lama pass.</p>
