<br>
<p class="first">Tassiding hill is the steep conical termination of
a long spur from a pine-clad shoulder of Kinchinjunga, called
Powhungri: it divides the Great Rungeet from its main feeder, the
Ratong, which rises from the south face of Kinchin. We crossed the
former by a bridge formed of two bamboo stems, slung by canes from
two parallel arches of stout branches lashed together.</p>

<p>The ascent for 2,800 feet was up a very steep, dry, zigzag path,
amongst mica slate rocks (strike north-east), on which grew many
tropical plants, especially the &ldquo;Tukla,&rdquo; (<i>Rottlera
tinctoria</i>), a plant which yields a brown dye. The top was a
flat, curving north-west and south-east, covered with temples,
chaits, and mendongs of the most picturesque forms and in elegant
groups, and fringed with brushwood, wild plantains, small palms,
and apple-trees. Here I saw for the first time the funereal
cypress, of which some very old trees spread their weeping limbs
and pensile</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">branchlets over the buildings.* It is not wild in
Sikkim, but imported there and into Bhotan from Tibet: it does not
thrive well above 6000 feet elevation. It is called &ldquo;Tchenden
&rdquo; by the Lepchas, Bhoteeas, and Tibetans, and its fragrant
red wood is burnt in the temples.</p>

<center><img src="images/fig32.jpg" width="295" height="264" alt=
"Group of chaits at Tassiding"></center>

<p>The Lamas met us on the top of the hill, bringing a noble
present of fowls, vegetables and oranges, the latter most
acceptable after our long and hot march. The site is admirably
chosen, in the very heart of Sikkim, commanding a fine view, and
having a considerable river on either side,</p>

<p class="fnote">* I was not then aware of this tree having been
introduced into England by the intrepid Mr. Fortune from China; and
as I was unable to procure seeds, which are said not to ripen in
Sikkim, it was a great and unexpected pleasure, on my return home,
to find it alive and flourishing at Kew.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 317">[ 317 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">with the power of retreating behind to the
convents of Sunnook and Powhungri, which are higher up on the same
spur, and surrounded by forest enough to conceal an army.
Considering the turbulent and warlike character of their
neighbours, it is not wonderful that the monks should have chosen
commanding spots, and good shelter for their indolent lives: for
the same reason these monasteries secured views of one another:
thus from Tassiding the great temple of Pemiongchi was seen
towering 3000 feet over head, whilst to the north-west, up the
course of the river, the hill-sides seemed sprinkled with
monasteries.</p>

<p>We camped on a saddle near the village of Sunnook, at 4000 feet
above the sea; and on the last day of the year we visited this most
interesting monastic establishment: ascending from our camp along
the ridge by a narrow path, cut here and there into steps, and
passing many rocks covered with inscriptions, broken walls of
mendongs, and other remains of the <i>via sacra</i> between the
village and temple. At one spot we found a fissure emitting hot
vapour of the temperature of 65&middot;5&deg;, that of the air
being about 50&deg;. It was simply a hole amongst the rocks; and
near the Rungeet a similar one is said to occur, whose temperature
fluctuates considerably with the season. It is very remarkable that
such an isolated spring should exist on the top of a sharp ridge,
2,800 feet above the bottom of this deep valley.</p>

<p>The general arrangement on the summit was, first the
Lamas&rsquo; houses with small gardens, then three large temples
raised on rudely paged platforms, and beyond these, a square walled
enclosure facing the south, full of chaits and mendongs, looking
like a crowded cemetery, and planted with funereal cypress
(<i>Cupressus funebris</i>).</p>

<p>The house of the principal Lama was an oblong square,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 318">[ 318 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the lower story of stone, and the upper of wood:
we ascended a ladder to the upper room, which was 24 feet by 8
wattled all round, with prettily latticed windows opening upon a
bamboo balcony used for drying grain, under the eaves of the broad
thatched roof. The ceiling (of neat bamboo work) was hung with
glorious bunches of maize, yellow, red, and brown; an altar and
closed wicker cage at one end of the room held the Penates, and a
few implements of worship. Chinese carpets were laid on the floor
for us, and the cans of Murwa brought round.</p>

<p>The Lama, though one of the red sect, was dressed in a yellow
flowered silk robe, but his mitre was red: he gave us much
information relative to the introduction of Boodhism into
Sikkim.</p>

<p>The three temples stand about fifty yards apart, but are not
parallel to one another, although their general direction is east
and west.* Each is oblong, and narrowed upwards, with the door at
one end; the middle (and smallest) faces the west, the others the
east: the doorways are all broad, low and deep, protected by a
projecting carved portico. The walls are immensely thick, of
well-masoned slaty stones; the outer surface of each slopes upwards
and inwards, the inner is perpendicular. The roofs are low and
thickly thatched, and project from eight to ten feet all round, to
keep off the rain, being sometimes supported by long poles. There
is a very low upper story, inhabited by the attendant monks and
servants, accessible by a ladder at one end of the building. The
main body of the temple is one large apartment, entered through a
small transverse vestibule, the breadth of the temple, in which are
tall cylindrical</p>

<p class="fnote">* Timkowski, in his travels through Mongolia (i.
p. 193), says, &ldquo;According to the rules of Tibetan
architecture, temples should face the south:&rdquo; this is
certainly not the rule in Sikkim, nor, so far as I could learn, in
Tibet either.</p>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><img src="images/fig33.jpg" width="299" height="251" alt=
"Doorway"></center>

<p class="first">praying-machines. The carving round the doors is
very beautiful, and they are gaudily painted and gilded. The
northern temple is quite plain: the middle one is simply painted
red, and encircled with a row of black heads, with goggle eyes and
numerous teeth, on a white ground; it is said to have been
originally dedicated to the evil spirits of the Lepcha creed. The
southern, which contains the library, is the largest and best, and
is of an irregular square shape. The inside walls and floors are
plastered with clay, and painted with allegorical representations
of Boodh, etc. From the vestibule the principal apartment is
entered by broad folding-doors, studded with circular copper
bosses, and turning on iron hinges. It is lighted by latticed
windows, sometimes protected outside by a bamboo screen. Owing to
the great thickness of the walls</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 320">[ 320 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">(three to four feet), a very feeble light is
admitted. In the principal temple, called &ldquo;Dugang,&rdquo; six
hexagonal wooden columns, narrowed above, with peculiar broad
transverse capitals, exquisitely gilded and painted, support the
cross-beams of the roof, which are likewise beautifully ornamented.
Sometimes a curly-maned gilt lion is placed over a column, and it
is always furnished with a black bushy tail: squares, diamonds,
dragons, and groups of flowers, vermilion, green, gold, azure, and
white, are dispersed with great artistic taste over all the beams;
the heavier masses of colour being separated by fine white
lines.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images/fig34.jpg" width="312" height="260" alt=
"Southern temple"></center>

<p>The altars and idols are placed at the opposite end; and two
long parallel benches, like cathedral stalls, run down the centre
of the building: on these the monks sit at</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 321">[ 321 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">prayer and contemplation, the head Lama occupying
a stall (often of very tasteful design) near the altar.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images/fig35.jpg" width="293" height="260" alt=
"Middle temple"></center>

<p>The principal Boodh, or image, is placed behind the altar under
a canopy, or behind a silk screen: lesser gods, and gaily dressed
and painted effigies of sainted male or female persons are ranged
on either side, or placed in niches around the apartment, sometimes
with separate altars before them; whilst the walls are more or less
covered with paintings of monks in prayer or contemplation. The
principal Boodh (Sakya Sing) sits cross-legged, with the left heel
up: his left-hand always rests on his thigh, and holds the padmi or
lotus and jewel, which is often a mere cup; the right-hand is
either raised, with the two forefingers up, or holds the dorje, or
rests on the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 322">[ 322 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">calf of the upturned leg. Sakya has generally
curled hair, Lamas have mitres, females various head-dresses; most
wear immense ear-rings, and some rosaries. All are placed on rude
pediments, so painted as to convey the idea of their rising out of
the petals of the pink, purple, or white lotus. None are in any way
disagreeable; on the contrary most have a calm and pleasing
expression, suggestive of contemplation.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images/fig36.jpg" width="235" height="303" alt=
"Altar and images"></center>

<p>The great or south temple contained a side altar of very elegant
shape, placed before an image encircled by a glory. Flowers,
juniper, peacock&rsquo;s feathers, pastiles, and rows of brass cups
of water were the chief ornaments of the altars,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 323">[ 323 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">besides the instruments I have elsewhere
enumerated. In this temple was the library, containing several
hundred books, in pigeon-holes, placed in recesses.*</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images/fig37.jpg" width="233" height="270" alt=
"Plan of the south temple"></center>

<p>The effect on entering these cold and gloomy temples is very
impressive; the Dugang in particular is exquisitely ornamented and
painted, and the vista from the vestibule to the principal idol, of
carved and coloured pillars and beams, is very picturesque. Within,
the general arrangement of the colours and gilding is felt to be
harmonious and pleasing, especially from the introduction of
slender white streaks between the contrasting masses of colour,</p>

<p class="fnote">* For a particular account of the images and
decorations of these temples, sea Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s paper in
&ldquo;Bengal Asiatic Society&rsquo;s Trans.,&rdquo; May, 1849. The
principal object of veneration amongst the Ningma or red sect of
Boodhists in Sikkim and Bhotan is Gorucknath, who is always
represented sitting cross-legged, holding the dorje in one hand,
which is raised; whilst the left rests in the lap and holds a cup
with a jewel in it. The left arm supports a trident, whose staff
pierces three sculls (a symbol of Shiva), a rosary hangs round his
neck, and he wears a red mitre with a lunar crescent and sun in
front.</p>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">as adopted in the Great Exhibition building of
1851. It is also well worthy of remark that the brightest colours
are often used in broad masses, and when so, are always arranged
chromatically, in the sequence of the rainbow&rsquo;s hues, and are
hence never displeasing to the eye. The hues, though bright, are
subdued by the imperfect light: the countenances of the images are
all calm, and their expression solemn. Whichever way you turn, the
eye is met by some beautiful specimen of colouring or carving, or
some object of veneration. The effect is much heightened by the
incense of juniper and sweet-smelling herbs which the priests burn
on entering, by their grave and decorous conduct, and by the
feeling of respect that is demanded by a religion which
theoretically inculcates and adores virtue in the abstract, and
those only amongst men who practise virtue. To the idol itself the
Boodhist attaches no real importance; it is an object of reverence,
not of worship, and no virtue or attribute belong to it <i>per
se</i>; it is a symbol of the creed, and the adoration is paid to
the holy man whom it represents.</p>

<p>Beyond the temples are the chaits and mendongs, scattered
without much order; and I counted nearly twenty-five cbaits of the
same form,* between eight and thirty feet high. The largest is
consecrated to the memory of the Rajah&rsquo;s eldest son, who,
however, is not buried here. A group of these structures is, as I
have often remarked, extremely picturesque, and those at Tassiding,
from their</p>

<p class="fnote">* In Sikkim the form of the cube alone is always
strictly preserved; that of the pyramid and hemisphere being often
much modified. The cube stands on a flight of usually three steps,
and is surmounted by a low pyramid of five steps; on this is placed
a swelling, urn-shaped body, which represents the hemisphere, and
is surmounted by another cube. On the latter is a slender, round or
angled spire (represented by a pyramid in Burma), crowned with a
crescent and disc, or sun, in moon. Generally, the whole is of
stone, with the exception of the spire, which is of wood, painted
red.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 325">[ 325 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">number, variety, and size, their commanding and
romantic position, and their being interspersed with weeping
cypresses, are particularly so.</p>

<p>The Tassiding temples and convents were founded upwards of 300
years ago, by the Lamas who accompanied the first Rajah to Sikkim;
and they have been continuously served by Lamas of great sanctity,
many of whom have been educated at Lhassa. They were formerly very
wealthy, but during the Nepal war they were plundered of all their
treasures, their silver gongs and bells, their best idols, dorjes,
and manis, and stripped of their ornaments; since which time
Pemiongchi has been more popular. In proof of their antiquity, it
was pointed out that most of the symbols and decorations were those
of pure Lama Boodhism, as practised in Tibet.</p>

<p>Although the elevation is but 4,840 feet, the weather was cold
and raw, with rain at noon, followed by thunder and lightning.
These electrical disturbances are frequent about midsummer and
midwinter, prevailing over many parts of India.</p>

<p><i>January 1st, 1849.</i>&mdash;The morning of the new year was
bright and beautiful, though much snow had fallen on the mountains;
and we left Sunnook for Pemiongchi, situated on the summit of a
lofty spur on the opposite side of the Ratong. We descended very
steeply to the bed of the river (alt. 2,480 feet) which joins the
Great Rungeet below the convents. The rocks were micaceous, dipping
west and north-west 45&deg;, and striking north and north-east,
which direction prevailed for 1000 feet or so up the opposite spur.
I had observed the same dip and stroke on the east flank of the
Tassiding spur; but both the Ratong on its west side, and the Great
Rungeet on the east, flow in channels that show no relation to
either the dip or strike.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 326">[ 326 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">I have generally remarked in Sikkim that the
channels of the rivers when cutting through or flowing at the base
of bluff cliffs, are neither parallel to nor at right angles to the
strike of the rocks forming the cliffs. I do not hence conclude
that there is no original connection between the directions of the
rivers, and the lines of fracture; but whatever may have once
subsisted between the direction of the fissures and that of the
strike, it is in the Sikkim Himalaya now wholly masked by
shiftings, which accompanied subsequent elevations and
depressions.</p>

<p>Mr. Hopkins has mathematically demonstrated that the continued
exertion of a force in raising superimposed strata would tend to
produce two classes of fractures in those strata; those of the
first order at right angles to the direction of the wave or ridge
(or line of strike); those of the second order parallel to the
strike. Supposing the force to be withdrawn after the formation of
the two fractures, the result would be a ridge, or mountain chain,
with diverging fissures from the summit, crossed by concentric
fissures; and the courses which the rivers would take in flowing
down the ridge, would successively be at right angles and parallel
to the strike of the strata. Now, in the Himalaya, a prevalent
strike to the north-west has been recognised in all parts of the
chain, but it is everywhere interfered with by mountains presenting
every other direction of strike, and by their dip never remaining
constant either in amount or direction. Consequently, as might be
expected, the directions of the river channels bear no apparent
relation to the general strike of the rocks.</p>

<p>We crossed the Ratong (twenty yards broad) by a cane bridge,
suspended between two rocks of green chlorite, full of veins of
granite. Ascending, we passed the village of Kameti on a spur, on
the face of which</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 327">[ 327 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">were strewed some enormous detached blocks of
white and pink stratified quartz: the rocks <i>in situ</i> were all
chlorite schist.</p>

<p>Looking across the valley to the flank of Mainom, the
disposition of the ridges and ravines on its sides was very
evident; many of the latter, throughout their westerly course, from
their commencement at 10,000 feet, to their debouchure in the Great
Rungeet at 2000, had a bluff, cliffy, northern flank, and a sloping
southern one. The dip of the surfaces is, therefore, north-west,
the exposure consequently of the villages which occupy terraces on
the south flanks of the lateral valleys. The Tassiding spur
presented exactly the same arrangement of its ravines, and the dip
of the rocks being north-west, it follows that the planes of the
sloping surfaces coincide in direction (though not in amount of
inclination) with that of the dip of the subjacent strata, which is
anything but a usual phenomenon in Sikkim.</p>

<p>The ascent to Pemiongchi continued very steep, through woods of
oaks, chesnuts, and magnolias, but no tree-fern, palms, <i>
Pothos,</i> or plantain, which abound at this elevation on the
moister outer ranges of Sikkim. The temple (elev. 7,083 feet) is
large, eighty feet long, and in excellent order, built upon the
lofty terminal point of the great east and west spur that divides
the Kulhait from the Ratong and Rungbee rivers; and the great
Changachelling temple and monastery stand on another eminence of
the same ridge, two miles further west.</p>

<p>The view of the snowy range from this temple is one of the
finest in Sikkim; the eye surveying at one glance the vegetation of
the Tropics and the Poles. Deep in the valleys the river-beds are
but 3000 feet above the sea, and are choked with fig-trees,
plantains, and palms; to</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 328">[ 328 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">these succeed laurels and magnolias, and higher up
still, oaks, chesnuts, birches, etc.; there is, however, no marked
line between the limits of these two last forests, which form the
prevailing arboreous vegetation between 4000 and 10,000 feet, and
give a lurid line to the mountains. Pine forests succeed for 2000
feet higher, when they give place to a skirting of rhododendron and
berberry. Among these appear black naked rocks, rising up in
cliffs, between which are gulleys, down which the snow now (on the
1st January) descended to 12,000 feet. The mountain flanks are much
more steep and rocky than those at similar heights on the outer
ranges, and cataracts are very numerous, and of considerable
height, though small in volume.</p>

<p>Pemiongchi is at the same elevation as Dorjiling, and the
contrast between the shoulders of 8000 to 10,000 feet on
Kinchinjunga, and those of equal height on Tendong and Tonglo, is
very remarkable: looking at the latter mountains from Dorjiling,
the observer sees no rock, waterfall, or pine, throughout their
whole height; whereas the equally wooded flanks of these inner
ranges are rocky, streaked with thread-like waterfalls, and
bristling with silver firs.</p>

<p>This temple, the most ancient in Sikkim, is said to be 400 years
old; it stands on a paved platform, and is of the same form and
general character as those of Tassiding. Inside, it is most
beautifully decorated, especially the beams, columns, capitals and
architraves, but the designs are coarser than those of Tassiding.*
The square end of every beam in the roof is ornamented either with
a lotus flower or with a Tibetan character, in endless
diversity</p>

<p class="fnote">* Mr. Hodgson informed me that many of the figures
and emblems in this temple are those of Tantrica Boodhism,
including Shiva, Devi, and other deities usually called
Brahminical; Kakotak, or the snake king, a figure terminating below
in a snake, is also seen; with the tiger, elephant, and curly-maned
lion.</p>

<p class="first">of colour and form, and the walls are completely
covered with allegorical paintings of Lamas and saints expounding
or in contemplation, with glories round their heads, mitred, and
holding the dole and jewel.</p>

<p>The principal image is a large and hideous figure of
Sakya-thoba, in a recess under a blue silk canopy, contrasting with
a calm figure of the late Rajah, wearing a cap and coronet.</p>

<p>Pemiongchi was once the capital of Sikkim, and called the Sikkim
Durbar: the Rajah&rsquo;s residence was on a curious flat to the
south of the temple, and a few hundred feet below it, where are the
remains of (for this country) extensive walls and buildings. During
the Nepal war, the Rajah was driven west across the Teesta, whilst
the Ghorkas plundered Tassiding, Pemiongchi, Changachelling, and
all the temples and convents to the east of that river. It was then
that the famous history of Sikkim,* compiled by the Lamas of
Pemiongchi, and kept at this temple, was destroyed, with the
exception of a few sheets, with one of which Dr. Campbell and
myself were each presented. We were told that the monks of
Changachelling and those of this establishment had copied what
remained, and were busy compiling from oral information, etc.:
whatever value the original may have possessed, however, is
irretrievably lost. A magnificent copy of the Boodhist Scriptures
was destroyed at the same time; it consisted of 400 volumes, each
containing several hundred sheets of Daphne paper.</p>

<p>The ground about the temple was snowed; and we descended a few
hundred feet, to encamp in a most picturesque grove, among chaits
and inscribed stones, with</p>

<p class="fnote">* This remarkable and beautiful manuscript was
written on thick oblong sheets of Tibet paper, painted black to
resist decay, and the letters were yellow and gold. The Nepalese
soldiers wantonly employed the sheets to roof the sheds they
erected, as a protection from the weather.</p>

<p class="first">a peep of the temples above. Nightingales warbled
deliciously night and morning, which rather surprised us, as the
minimum thermometer fell to 27&middot;8&deg;, and the ground next
day was covered with hoar-frost; the elevation being 6,580 feet.
These birds migrate hither in October and November, lingering in
the Himalayan valleys till the cold of early spring drives them
further south, to the plains of India, whence they return north in
March and April.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of January I parted from my friend, who was obliged
to hurry to the great annual fair at Titalya. I regretted much
being unable to accompany Dr. Campbell to this scene of his
disinterested labours, especially as the Nawab of Moorshedabad was
to be present, one of the few wealthy native princes of Bengal who
still keep a court worth seeing; but I was more anxious to continue
my explorations northward till the latest moment: I however
accompanied him for a short distance on his way towards Dorjiling.
We passed the old Durbar, called Phieungoong
(&ldquo;Bamboo-hill,&rdquo; so named from the abundance of a small
bamboo, &ldquo;Phieung.&rdquo;) The buildings, now in ruins, occupy
a little marshy flat, hemmed in by slate rocks, and covered with
brambles and <i>Andromeda</i> bushes. A wall, a bastion, and an
arched gateway, are the only traces of fortifications; they are
clothed with mosses, lichens, and ferns.</p>

<p>A steep zigzag path, descending amongst long grass and scarlet
rhododendrons, leads to the Kaysing Mendong.* Here I bade adieu to
Dr. Campbell, and toiled up the hill, feeling very lonely. The zest
with which he had entered into all my pursuits, and the aid he had
afforded me, together with the charm that always attends
companionship with one who enjoys every incident of travel, had so
attracted me to him that I found it difficult to recover my
spirits.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">It is quite impossible for anyone who cannot from
experience realise the solitary wandering life I had been leading
for months, to appreciate the desolate feeling that follows the
parting from one who has heightened every enjoyment, and taken far
more than his share of every annoyance and discomfort: the few days
we had spent together appeared then, and still, as months.</p>

<p>On my return to Pemiongchi I spent the remainder of the day
sketching in the great temple, gossiping with the Lamas, and
drinking salted and buttered tea-soup, which I had begun to like,
when the butter was not rancid.</p>

<p>My route hence was to be along the south flank of Kinchinjunga,
north to Jongri, which lay about four or five marches off, on the
road to the long deserted pass of Kanglanamo, by which I had
intended entering Sikkim from Nepal, when I found the route up the
Yalloong valley impracticable. The village and ruined convents of
Yoksun lay near the route, and the temples of Doobdi, Catsuperri
and Molli, on the Ratong river.</p>

<p>I descended to the village of Tchonpong (alt. 4,980 feet), where
I was detained a day to obtain rice, of which I required ten
days&rsquo; supply for twenty-five people. On the way I passed
groves of the paper-yielding <i>Edgeworthia Gardneri</i>: it bears
round heads of fragrant, beautiful, yellow flowers, and would be a
valuable acquisition to an English conservatory.</p>

<p>From Tchonpong we descended to the bed of the Rungbee (alt.
3,160 feet), an affluent of the Ratong, flowing in a deep galley
with precipitous sides of mica schist full of garnets, dipping west
and north-west 45&deg;: it was spanned by a bridge of two loose
bamboo culms, about fifteen yards long, laid across without
handrails; after wet sand had been thrown on it the bare-footed
coolies crossed</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 334">[ 334 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">easily enough, but I, having shoes on, required a
hand to steady me. From this point we crossed a lofty spur to the
Ratong (alt. 3000 feet), where we encamped, the coolies being
unable to proceed further on such very bad roads. This river
descends from the snows of Kinchin, and consequently retains the
low temperature 42&deg;, being fully 7&deg; colder than the
Rungbee, which at an elevation of but 3000 feet appears very
remarkable: it must however be observed that scarcely anywhere does
the sun penetrate to the bottom of its valley.</p>

<p>We encamped on a gravelly flat, fifty feet above the river,
strewn with water-worn boulders, and so densely covered with tall
<i>Artemisi&aelig;,</i> gigantic grasses, bamboo, plantain, fern,
and acacia, that we had to clear a space in the jungle, which
exhaled a rank heavy smell.</p>

<p>Hoar-frost formed copiously in the night, and though above the
sun&rsquo;s rays were very powerful, they did not reach this spot
till 7.30 a.m., the frost remaining in the shade till nearly 9
a.m.; and this on plantains, and other inhabitants of hot-houses in
England.</p>

<p>Hence I ascended to Yoksun, one of the most curious and
picturesque spots in Sikkim, and the last inhabited place towards
Kinchinjunga. The path was excessively steep and rocky for the
first mile or two, and then alternately steep and flat. Mixed with
many tropical trees, were walnuts of the common English variety; a
tree, which, though planted here, is wild near Dorjiling, where it
bears a full-sized fruit, as hard as a hickory-nut: those I
gathered in this place were similar, whereas in Bhotan the
cultivated nut is larger, thin-shelled, and the kernel is easily
removed. We ascended one slope, of an angle of 36&deg; 30&prime;,
which was covered with light black mould, and had been recently
cleared by fire: we found millet</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 335">[ 335 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">now cultivated on it. From the top the view of the
Ratong valley was very fine: to the north lay Yoksun, appearing
from this height to occupy a flat, two miles long and one broad,
girdled by steep mountains to the north and east, dipping very
suddenly 2,200 feet to the Ratong on the west. To the right was a
lofty hill, crowned with the large temple and convents of Doobdi,
shadowed by beautiful weeping cypresses, and backed by lofty
pine-clad mountains. Northward, the gorge of the Ratong opened as a
gloomy defile, above which rose partially snowed mountains, which
shut out Kinchinjunga. To the west, massive pine-clad mountains
rose steeply; while the little hamlet of Lathiang occupied a
remarkable shelf overhanging the river, appearing inaccessible
except by ropes from above. South-west, the long spurs of Molli and
Catsuperri, each crowned with convents or temples, descended from
Singalelah; and parallel to them on the south; but much longer and
more lofty, was the great mountain range north of the Kulbait, with
the temples and convents of Pemiongchi, and Changachelling,
towering in the air. The latter range dips suddenly to the Great
Rungeet, where Tassiding, with its chaits and cypresses, closed the
view. The day was half cloud, half sunshine; and the various
effects of light and shade, now bringing out one or other of the
villages and temples, now casting the deep valleys into darker
gloom, was wonderfully fine.</p>

<p>Yoksun was the earliest civilised corner of Sikkim, and derived
its name (which signifies in Lepcha &ldquo;three chiefs&rdquo;)
from having been the residence of three Lamas of great influence,
who were the means of introducing the first Tibetan sovereign into
the country. At present it boasts of but little cultivation, and a
scattered population, inhabiting a few hamlets, 5,500 feet above
the sea: beautiful lanes</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 336">[ 336 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and paths wind everywhere over the gentle slopes,
and through the copsewood that has replaced the timber-trees of a
former period. Mendongs and chaits are very numerous, some of great
size; and there are also the ruins of two very large temples, near
which are some magnificent weeping cypresses, eighty feet high.
These fine trees are landmarks from all parts of the flat; they
form irregular cones of pale bright green, with naked gnarled tops,
the branches weep gracefully, but not like the picture in
Macartney&rsquo;s Embassy to China, whence originated the famous
willow-pattern of our crockery. The ultimate branchlets are very
slender and pendulous; my Lepcha boys used to make elegant chaplets
of them, binding the withes with scarlet worsted. The trunk is
quite erect, smooth, cylindrical, and pine-like; it harbours no
moss, but air-plants, Orchids, and ferns, nestle on the limbs, and
pendulous lichens, like our beard-moss, wave from the branches.</p>

<p>In the evening I ascended to Doobdi. The path was broad, and
skilfully conducted up a very steep slope covered with forest: the
top, which is 6,470 feet above the sea, and nearly 1000 above
Yoksun, is a broad partially paved platform, on which stand two
temples, surrounded by beautiful cypresses: one of these trees
(perhaps the oldest in Sikkim) measured sixteen and a half feet in
girth, at five feet from the ground, and was apparently ninety feet
high: it was not pyramidal, the top branches being dead and broken,
and the lower limbs spreading; they were loaded with masses of
white-flowered C&oelig;logynes, and Vacciniums. The younger trees
were pyramidal.</p>

<p>I was received by a monk of low degree, who made many apologies
for the absence of his superior, who had</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 337">[ 337 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">been ordered an eight years&rsquo; penance and
seclusion from the world, of which only three had passed. On
inquiry, I learnt the reason for this; the holy father having found
himself surrounded by a family, to which there would have been no
objection, had he previously obtained a dispensation. As, however,
he had omitted this preliminary, and was able to atone by prayer
and payment, he had been condemned to do penance; probably at his
own suggestion, as the seclusion will give him sanctity, and
eventually lead to his promotion, when his error shall have been
forgotten.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images/fig39.jpg" width="320" height="251" alt=
"Temple and weeping cypress"></center>

<p>Both temples are remarkable for their heavily ornamented,
two-storied porticos, which occupy nearly the whole of one end. The
interior decorations are in a ruinous</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 338">[ 338 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">condition, and evidently very old; they have no
Hindoo emblems.</p>

<p>The head Lama sent me a present of dried peaches, with a bag of
walnuts, called &ldquo;Koal-kun&rdquo; by the Lepchas, and
&ldquo;Taga-sching&rdquo; by the Bhoteeas; the two terminations
alike signifying &ldquo;tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The view of Yoksun from this height was very singular: it had
the appearance of an enormous deposit banked up against a spur to
the south, and mountains to the east, and apparently levelled by
the action of water: this deposit seemed as though, having once
completely filled the valley of the Ratong, that river had cut a
gorge 2000 feet deep between it and the opposite mountain.</p>

<p>Although the elevation is so low, snow falls abundantly at
Doobdi in winter; I was assured that it has been known of the depth
of five feet, a statement I consider doubtful; the quantity is,
however, certainly greater than at equal heights about Dorjiling,
no doubt owing to its proximity to Kinchinjunga.</p>

<p>I was amused here by watching a child playing with a popgun,
made of bamboo, similar to that of quill, with which most English
children are familiar, which propels pellets by means of a
spring-trigger made of the upper part of the quill. It is easy to
conclude such resemblances between the familiar toys of different
countries to be accidental, but I question their being really so.
On the plains of India, men may often be seen for hours together,
flying what with us are children&rsquo;s kites; and I procured a
jews&rsquo;-harp from Tibet. These are not the toys of savages, but
the amusements of people more than half-civilised, and with whom we
have had indirect communication from the earliest ages. The Lepchas
play at quoits, using slate for the purpose, and at the
Highland</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 339">[ 339 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">games of &ldquo;putting the stone&rdquo; and
&ldquo;drawing the stone.&rdquo; Chess, dice, draughts, Punch,
hockey, and battledore and shuttlecock, are all Indo-Chinese or
Tartarian; and no one familiar with the wonderful instances of
similarity between the monasteries, ritual, ceremonies, attributes,
vestments, and other paraphernalia of the eastern and western
churches, can fail to acknowledge the importance of recording even
the most trifling analogies or similarities between the manners and
customs of the young as well as of the old.</p>
