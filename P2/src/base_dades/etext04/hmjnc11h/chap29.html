<br>
<p class="first">The snowy Himalaya was not visible during our
first stay at Myrung, from the 5th to the 10th of July; but on
three subsequent occasions, viz., 27th and 28th of July, 13th to
17th October, and 22nd to 25th October, we saw these magnificent
mountains, and repeatedly took angular heights and bearings of the
principal peaks. The range, as seen from the Khasia, does not form
a continuous line of snowy mountains, but the loftiest eminences
are conspicuously grouped into masses, whose position is probably
between the great rivers which rise far beyond them and flow
through Bhotan. This arrangement indicates that relation of the
rivers to the masses of snow, which I have dwelt upon in the
Appendix;</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 298">[ 298 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and further tends to prove that the snowy
mountains, seen from the southward, are not on the axis of a
mountain chain, and do not even indicate its position; but that
they are lofty meridional spurs which, projecting southward, catch
the moist vapours, become more deeply snowed, and protect the dry
loftier regions behind.</p>

<p>The most conspicuous group of snows seen from the Khasia bears
N.N.E. from Myrung, and consists of three beautiful mountains with
wide-spreading snowy shoulders. These are distant (reckoning from
west to east) respectively 164, 170, and 172 miles from Myrung, and
subtend angles of +0&deg; 4&prime; 0&Prime;, &ndash;0&deg; 1&prime;
30&Prime;, and &ndash;0&deg; 2&prime; 28&Prime;.* From Nunklow (940
feet lower than Myrung) they appear higher, the western peak rising
14&deg; 35&prime; above the horizon; whilst from Moflong (32 miles
further south, and elevation 6,062 feet) the same is sunk 2&deg;
below the horizon. My computations make this western mountain
upwards of 24,000 feet high; but according to Col. Wilcox&rsquo;s
angles, taken from the Assam valley, it is only 21,600, the others
being respectively 20,720 and 21,475. Captain Thuillier (the Deputy
Surveyor General) agrees with me in considering that Colonel
Wilcox&rsquo;s altitudes are probably much</p>

<p class="fnote">* These angles were taken both at sunrise and
sunset, and with an excellent theodolite, and were repeated after
two considerable intervals. The telescopes were reversed after each
observation, and every precaution used to insure accuracy;
nevertheless the mean of one set of observations of angular height
often varied 1 degree from that of another set. This is probably
much due to atmospheric refraction, whose effect and amount it is
impossible to estimate accurately in such cases. Here the objects
are not only viewed through 160 miles of atmosphere, but through
belts from between 6000 to 20,000 feet of vertical height, varying
in humidity and transparency at different parts of the interval. If
we divide this column of atmosphere into sections parallel to those
of latitude, we have first a belt fifteen miles broad, hanging over
the Khasia, 2000 to 4000 feet above the sea; beyond it, a second
belt, seventy miles broad, hangs over the Assam valley, which is
hardly 300 feet above the level of the sea; and thirdly, the
northern part of the column, which reposes on 60 to 100 miles of
the Bhotan lower Himalaya: each of these belts has probably a
different refractive power.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 299">[ 299 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">under-estimated, as those of other Himalayan peaks
to the westward were by the old surveyors. It is further evident
that these mountains have (as far as can be estimated by angles)
fully 6&ndash;8000 feet of snow on them, which would not be the
case were the loftiest only 21,600 feet high.</p>

<p>It is singular, that to the eastward of this group, no snowy
mountains are seen, and the lower Himalaya also dip suddenly. This
depression is no doubt partly due to perspective; but as there is
no such sudden disappearance of the chain to the westward, where
peaks are seen 35&deg; to the west of north, it is far more
probable that the valley of the Soobansiri river, which rises in
Tibet far behind these peaks, is broad and open; as is that of the
Dihong, still farther east, which we have every reason to believe
is the Tibetan Yaru or Burrampooter.</p>

<p>Supposing then the eastern group to indicate the mountain mass
separating the Soobansiri from the Monass river, no other mountains
conspicuous for altitude or dimension rise between N.N.E. and
north, where there is another immense group. This, though within
120 miles of Myrung, is below its horizon, and scarcely above that
of Nunklow (which is still nearer to it), and cannot therefore
attain any great elevation.</p>

<p>Far to the westward again, is a very lofty peaked mountain
bearing N.N.W., which subtends an angle of &ndash;3&prime;
30&Prime; from Myrung, and +6&prime; 0&Prime; from Nunklow. The
angles of this seem to indicate its being either Chumulari, or that
great peak which I saw due east from Bbomtso top, and which I then
estimated at ninety miles off and 23,500 feet high. From the Khasia
angles, its latitude and longitude are 28&deg; 6&prime; and 89&deg;
30&prime;, its elevation 27,000 feet, and its distance from Myrung
200 miles. I need hardly add</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 300">[ 300 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">that neither the position nor the elevation
computed from such data is worthy of confidence. Further still, to
the extreme west, is an immense low hog-backed mass of snow, with a
small peak on it; this bears north-west, both from Myrung and
Nunklow, subtending an angle of &ndash;25&prime; from the former,
and &ndash;17&prime; from the latter station. It is in all
probability Chumulari, 210 miles distant from Nunklow. Donkia, if
seen, would be distant 230 miles from the same spot in the Khasia,
and Kinchinjunga 260; possibly they are visible (by refraction)
from Chillong, though even further from it.</p>

<p>The distance from Myrung to Nunklow is ten miles, along an
excellent road. The descent is at first sudden, beyond which the
country is undulating, interspersed with jungle (of low trees,
chiefly oaks) and marshes, with much rice cultivation. Grasses are
exceedingly numerous; we gathered fifty kinds, besides twenty <i>
Cyperace&aelig;</i>: four were cultivated, namely sugar-cane, rice,
<i>Coix,</i> and maize. Most of the others were not so well suited
to pasturage as those of higher localities. Dwarf Ph&oelig;nix palm
occurs by the roadside at 5000 feet elevation.</p>

<p>Gneiss (with garnets) highly inclined, was the prevalent rock
(striking north-east), and scattered boulders of syenite became
very frequent. In one place the latter rock is seen bursting
through the gneiss, which is slaty and very crystalline at the
junction.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images2/plate11.jpg" width="424" height="312"
alt="The Bhotan Himalaya, Assam Valley, and Burrampooter River, from Nunklow, looking north.">
</center>

<p>Nunklow is placed at the northern extremity of a broad spur that
over-hangs the valley of the Burrampooter river, thirty miles
distant. The descent from it is very rapid, and beyond it none of
the many spurs thrown out by the Khasia attain more than 1000 feet
elevation; hence, though the range does not present so abrupt a</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 301">[ 301 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">face to the Burrampooter as it does to the Jheels,
Nunklow is considered as on the brink of its north slope. The
elevation of the bungalow is 4,688 feet, and the climate being hot,
it swarms with mosquitos, fleas, and rats. It commands a superb
view to the north, of the Himalayan snows, of the Burrampooter, and
intervening malarious Terai forest; and to the south, of the
undulating Khasia, with Kollong rock bearing south-west. All the
hills between this and Myrung look from Nunklow better wooded than
they do from Myrung, in consequence of the slopes exposed to the
south being bare of forest.</p>

<p>A thousand feet below the bungalow, a tropical forest begins, of
figs, birch, horse-chestnut, oak, nutmeg. <i>Cedrela, Engelhardtia,
Artocarpe&aelig;,</i> and <i>El&aelig;ocarpus,</i> in the gullies,
and tall pines on the dry slopes, which are continued down to the
very bottom of the valley in which flows the Bor-panee, a broad and
rapid river that descends from Chillong, and winds round the base
of the Nunklow spur. Many of the pines are eighty feet high, and
three or four in diameter, but none form gigantic trees. The
quantity of balsams in the wet ravines is very great, and
tree-ferns of several kinds are common.</p>

<p>The Bor-panee is about forty yards wide, and is spanned by an
elegant iron suspension-bridge, that is clamped to the gneiss rock
(strike north-east, dip north-west) on either bank; beneath is a
series of cascades, none high, but all of great beauty from the
broken masses of rocks and picturesque scenery on either side. We
frequently botanised up and down the river with great success: many
curious plants grow on its stony and rocky banks; and amongst them
<i>Rhododendron formosum</i> at the low elevation of 2000 feet. A
most splendid fern, <i>Dipteris Wallichii,</i> is abundant, with
the dwarf Ph&oelig;nix palm and <i>Cycas pectinata.</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 302">[ 302 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wild animals are very abundant here, though extremely rare on
the higher part of the Khasia range; tigers, however, and bears,
ascend to Nunklow. We saw troops of wild dogs
(&ldquo;Kuleam,&rdquo; Khas.), deer, and immense quantities of the
droppings of the wild elephant; an animal considered in Assam
dangerous to meet, whereas in other parts of India it is not
dreaded till provoked. There is, however, no quadruped that varies
more in its native state than this: the Ceylon kind differs from
the Indian in the larger size and short tusks, and an experienced
judge at Calcutta will tell at once whether the newly caught
elephant is from Assam, Silhet, Cuttack, Nepal, or Chittagong. Some
of the differences, in size, roundness of shoulders and back,
quantity of hair, length of limb, and shape of head, are very
marked; and their dispositions are equally various.</p>

<p>The lowest rocks seen are at a considerable distance down the
Bor-panee; they are friable sandstones that strike uniformly with
the gneiss. From the bridge upwards the rocks are all gneiss,
alternating with chert and quartz. The Nunklow spur is covered with
enormous rounded blocks of syenite, reposing on clay or on one
another. These do not descend the hill, and are the remains of an
extensive formation which we could only find <i>in situ</i> at one
spot on the road to Myrung (see earlier), but which must have been
of immense thickness.* One block within ten yards of the bungalow
door was fifteen feet long, six high, and eight broad; it appeared
half buried, and was rapidly decomposing from the action of the
rain. Close by, to the westward, in walking amongst the masses
we</p>

<p class="fnote">* The tendency of many volcanic rocks to decompose
in spheres is very well known: it is conspicuous in the black
basalts north of Edinburgh, but I do not know any instance equal to
this of Nunklow, for the extent of decomposition and dimensions of
the resulting spheres.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 303">[ 303 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">were reminded of a moraine of most gigantic sized
blocks; one which I measured was forty feet long and eleven above
the ground; its edges were rounded, and its surface flaked off in
pieces a foot broad and a quarter of an inch thick. Trees and
brushwood often conceal the spaces between these fragments, and
afford dens for bears and leopards, into which man cannot follow
them.</p>

<p>Sitting in the cool evenings on one of these great blocks, and
watching the Himalayan glaciers glowing with the rays of sunset,
appearing to change in form and dimensions with the falling
shadows, it was impossible to refrain from speculating on the
possibility of these great boulders heaped on the Himalayan-ward
face of the Khasia range, having been transported hither by ice at
some former period; especially as the Mont Blanc granite, in
crossing the lake of Geneva to the Jura, must have performed a
hardly less wonderful ice journey: but this hypothesis is clearly
untenable; and unparalleled in our experience as the results
appear, if attributed to denudation and weathering alone, we are
yet compelled to refer them to these causes. The further we travel,
and the longer we study, the more positive becomes the conviction
that the part played by these great agents in sculpturing the
surface of our planet, is as yet but half recognised.</p>

<p>We returned on the 7th of August to Churra, where we employed
ourselves during the rest of the month in collecting and studying
the plants of the neighbourhood. We hired a large and good
bungalow, in which three immense coal fires* were kept up for
drying plants and</p>

<p class="fnote">* This coal is excellent for many purposes. We
found it generally used by the Assam steamers, and were informed on
board that in which we traversed the Sunderbunds, some months
afterwards, that her furnaces consumed 729 lbs. per hour; whereas
the consumption of English coal was 800 lbs., of Burdwan coal
8401bs., and of Assam 900 lbs.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 304">[ 304 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">papers, and fifteen men were always employed, some
in changing, and some in collecting, from morning till night. The
coal was procured within a mile of our door, and cost about six
shillings a month; it was of the finest quality, and gave great
heat and few ashes. Torrents of rain descended almost daily, twelve
inches in as many hours being frequently registered; and we
remarked that it was impossible to judge of the quantity by
estimation, an apparent deluge sometimes proving much less in
amount than much lighter but steadier falls; hence the greatest
fall is probably that in which the drops are moderately large; very
close together, and which pass through a saturated atmosphere. The
temperature of the rain here and elsewhere in India was always a
degree or two below that of the air.</p>

<p>Though the temperature in August rose to 75&deg;, we never felt
a fire oppressive, owing to the constant damp, and absence of sun.
The latter, when it broke through the clouds, shone powerfully,
raising the thermometer 20&deg; and 30&deg; in as many minutes. On
such occasions, hot blasts of damp wind ascend the valleys, and
impinge suddenly against different houses on the flat, giving rise
to extraordinary differences between the mean daily temperatures of
places not half a mile apart.</p>

<p>On the 4th of September we started for the village of Chela,
which lies west from Churra, at the embouchure of the Boga-panee on
the Jheels. The path runs by Mamloo, and down the spur to the
Jasper hill (see <a href="chap28.html#page 280">p. 280</a>): the
vegetation all along is very tropical, and pepper, ginger, maize,
and Betel palm, are cultivated around small cottages, which are
only distinguishable in the forest by their yellow thatch of dry
<i>Calamus</i> (Rattan) leaves. From Jasper hill a very steep ridge
leads to another, called Lisouplang, which is</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 305">[ 305 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">hardly so high as Mamloo; the rocks are the same
sandstone, with fragments of coal, and remains of the limestone
formation capping it.</p>

<p>Hot gusts of wind blow up the valleys, alternating with clouds
and mists, and it is curious to watch the effects of the latter in
stilling the voices of insects (Cicadas) and birds. Common crows
and vultures haunt the villages, but these, and all other large
birds, are very rare in the Khasia. A very few hawks are
occasionally seen, also sparrows and kingfishers, and I once heard
a cuckoo; pheasants are sometimes shot, but we never saw any. Kites
become numerous after the rains, and are regarded as a sign of
their cessation. More remarkable than the rarity of birds is the
absence of all animals except domestic rats, as a more suitable
country for hares and rabbits could not be found. Reptiles, and
especially Colubrid&aelig;, are very common in the Khasia
mountains, and I procured sixteen species and many specimens. The
natives repeatedly assured us that these were all harmless, and Dr.
Gray, who has kindly examined all my snakes, informs me of the
remarkable fact (alluded to in a note in <a href=
"chap18.html#page 25">p. 25</a>), that whereas none of these are
poisonous, four out of the eleven species which I found in Sikkim
are so. One of the Khasia blind-worms (a new species) belongs to a
truly American genus (<i>Ophisaurus</i>), a fact as important as is
that of the Sikkim skink and <i>Agama</i> being also American
forms.</p>

<p><i>Arundina,</i> a beautiful purple grassy-leaved orchid, was
abundantly in flower on the hill-top, and the great white
swallow-tailed moth (<i>Saturnia Atlas</i>) was extremely common,
with tropical butterflies and other insects. The curious
leaf-insect (<i>Mantis</i>) was very abundant on the orange trees,
on the leaves of which the natives believe</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 306">[ 306 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">it to feed; nor indeed could we persuade some of
our friends that its thin sharp jaws are unsuited for masticating
leaves, and that these and its prehensile feet indicate its
predacious nature: added to which, its singular resemblance to a
leaf is no less a provision against its being discovered by its
enemies, than an aid in deceiving its prey.</p>

<p>We descended rapidly for many miles through beautiful rocky
woods, with villages nestling amongst groves of banana and
trellised climbers; and from the brow of a hill looked down upon a
slope covered with vegetation and huts, which formed the mart of
Chela, and below which the Boga-panee flowed in a deep gorge. The
view was a very striking one: owing to the steepness of the valley
below our feet, the roofs alone of the cottages were visible, from
which ascended the sounds and smells of a dense native population,
and to which there appeared to be no way of descending. The
opposite side rose precipitously in lofty table-topped mountains,
and the river was studded with canoes.</p>

<p>The descent was fully 800 feet, on a slope averaging 25&deg; to
35&deg;. The cottages were placed close together, each within a
little bamboo enclosure, eight to ten yards deep; and no two were
on the same level. Each was built against a perpendicular wall
which supported a cutting in the bank behind; and a similar wall
descended in front of it, forming the back of the compartment in
which the cottage next below it was erected. The houses were often
raised on platforms, and some had balconies in front, which
overhung the cottage below. All were mere hovels of wattle or mud,
with very high-pitched roofs: stone tanks resembling fonts, urns,
coffins, and sarcophagi, were placed near the better houses, and
blocks of stone were scattered everywhere.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 307">[ 307 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We descended from hovel to hovel, alternately along the
gravelled flat of each enclosure, and perpendicularly down steps
cut in the sandstone or let into the walls. I counted 800 houses
from the river, and there must be many more: the inhabitants are
Bengalees and Khasias, and perhaps amount to 3000 or 4000; but this
is a very vague estimate.</p>

<br>
<center><img src="images2/fig30.jpg" width="303" height="254" alt=
"Chela village"></center>

<p>We lodged in a curious house, consisting of one apartment,
twenty feet long, and five high, raised thirty feet upon bamboos:
the walls were of platted bamboo matting, fastened to strong wooden
beams, and one side opened on a balcony that overhung the river.
The entrance was an oval aperture reached by a ladder, and closed
by folding-doors that turned on wooden pivots.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 308">[ 308 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">The roof was supported by tressels of great
thickness, and like the rest of the woodwork, was morticed, no
nails being used throughout the building. The floor was of split
bamboos laid side by side.</p>

<p>We ascended the Boga-panee in canoes, each formed of a hollowed
trunk fifty feet long and four broad; we could not, however,
proceed far, on account of the rapids. The rocks in its bed are
limestone, but a great bluff cliff of sandy conglomerate (strike
east-south-east and dip south-south-west 70&deg;), several hundred
feet high, rises on the east bank close above the village, above
which occurs amygdaloidal basalt. The pebbles in the river (which
was seventy yards broad, and turbid) were of slate, basalt,
sandstone, and syenite: on the opposite bank were sandstones
over-lain by limestone, both dipping to the southward.</p>

<p>Beautiful palms, especially <i>Caryota urens</i> (by far the
handsomest in India), and groves of betel-nut bordered the river,
with oranges, lemons, and citrons; intermixed with feathery
bamboos, horizontally-branched acacias, oaks, with pale red young
leaves, and deep green foliaged figs. Prickly rattans and <i>
Plectocomia</i> climbed amongst these, their enormous plumes of
foliage upborne by the matted branches of the trees, and their
arrowy tops shooting high above the forest.</p>

<p>After staying three days at Chela, we descended the stream in
canoes, shooting over pebbly rapids, and amongst rocks of
limestone, water-worn into fantastic shapes, till we at last found
ourselves gliding gently along the still canals of the Jheels. Many
of these rapids are so far artificial, that they are enclosed by
gravel banks, six feet high, which, by confining the waters, give
them depth; but, Chela being hardly above the level of the sea,
their fall is</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 309">[ 309 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">very trifling. We proceeded across the Jheels* to
Chattuc, and then north again to Pundua, and so to Churra.</p>

<p>Having pretty well exhausted the botany of Churra, Dr. Thomson
and I started on the 13th of September for the eastern part of the
Khasia and Jyntea mountains. On the Kala-panee road,&dagger; which
we followed, we passed crowds of market people, laden with dried
fish in a half-putrid state, which scented the air for many yards:
they were chiefly carp, caught and dried at the foot of the hills.
Large parties were bringing down baskets of bird-cherries,
cinnamon-bark, iron, pine planks, fire-wood, and potatoes. Of
these, the bird-cherries (like damsons) are made into an excellent
preserve by the English residents, who also make capital
cherry-brandy of them: the trade in cinnamon is of recent
introduction, and is much encouraged by the Inglis family, to whose
exertions these people are so greatly indebted; the cinnamon is the
peeled bark of a small species of <i>Cinnamomum</i> allied to that
of Ceylon, and though inferior in flavour and mucilaginous (like
cassia), finds a ready market at Calcutta. It has been used to
adulterate the Ceylon cinnamon; and an extensive fraud was
attempted by some Europeans at Calcutta, who sent boxes of this,
with a top layer of the genuine, to England. The smell of the
cinnamon loads was as fragrant as that of the fish was
offensive.</p>

<p>The road from Kala-panee bungalow strikes off north-easterly,
and rounds the head of the deep valley to the east of Churra; it
then crosses the head-waters of the</p>

<p class="fnote">* The common water-plants of the Jheels are <i>
Vallisneria serrata, Damasonium,</i> 2 <i>Myriophylla,</i> 2 <i>
Villarsi&aelig;, Trapa,</i> blue, white, purple and scarlet
water-lilies, <i>Hydrilla, Utricularia, Limnophila, Azolla,
Salvinia, Ceratopteris,</i> and floating grasses.<br>
&dagger; The Pea-violet (<i>Crotalaria occulta</i>) was very common
by the road-side, and smelt deliciously of violets: the English
name suggests the appearance of the flower, for which and for its
fragrance it is well worth cultivation.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 310">[ 310 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Kala-panee river, still a clear stream, the bed of
which is comparatively superficial: the rocks consist of a little
basalt and much sandstone, striking east by north, and dipping
north by west. The Boga-panee is next reached, flowing in a shallow
valley, about 200 feet below the general level of the hills, which
are grassy and treeless. The river* is thirty yards across, shallow
and turbid; its bed is granite, and beyond it scattered stunted
pines are met with; a tree which seems to avoid the sandstone. In
the evening we arrived at Nonkreem, a large village in a broad
marshy valley, where we procured accommodation with some
difficulty, the people being by no means civil, and the Rajah, Sing
Manuk, holding himself independent of the British Government.</p>

<p>Atmospheric denudation and weathering have produced remarkable
effects on the lower part of the Nonkreem valley, which is blocked
up by a pine-crested hill, 200 feet high, entirely formed of round
blocks of granite, heaped up so as to resemble an old moraine; but
like the Nunklow boulders, these are not arranged as if by glacial
action. The granite is micaceous, and usually very soft,
decomposing into a coarse reddish sand, that colours the
Boga-panee. To procure the iron-sand, which is disseminated through
it, the natives conduct water over the beds of granite sand, and as
the lighter particles are washed away, the remainder is removed to
troughs, where the separation of the ore is completed. The smelting
is very rudely carried on in charcoal fires, blown by enormous
double-action bellows, worked by two persons, who stand on the
machine, raising the flaps with their hands, and expanding them
with their feet, as shown in the cut at <a href="#page 312">p.

<p class="fnote">* The fall of this river, between this elevation
(which may be considered that of its source) and Chela, is about
5,500 feet.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 311">[ 311 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">There is neither furnace nor flux used in the
reduction. The fire is kindled on one aide of an upright stone
(like the head-stone of a grave), with a small arched hole close to
the ground: near this hole the bellows are suspended; and a bamboo
tube from each of its compartments, meets in a larger one, by which
the draught is directed under the hole in the stone to the fire.
The ore is run into lumps as large as two fists, with a rugged
surface: these lumps are afterwards cleft nearly in two, to show
their purity.</p>

<p>The scenery about Nonkreem village is extremely picturesque, and
we procured many good plants on the rocks, which were covered with
the purple-flowered Orchid, <i>C&oelig;logyne Wallichii.</i> The
country is everywhere intersected</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 312">[ 312 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">with trenches for iron-washing, and some large
marshes were dammed up for the same purpose: in these we found some
beautiful balsams, <i>Hypericum</i> and <i>Parnassia</i>; also a
diminutive water-lily, the flower of which is no larger than a
half-crown; it proves to be the <i>Nymph&aelig;a pygm&aelig;a</i>
of China and Siberia&mdash;a remarkable fact in the geographical
distribution of plants.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images2/fig32.jpg" width="232" height="324" alt=
"Bellows"></center>

<p>From Nonkreem we proceeded easterly to Pomrang, leaving Chillong
hill on the north, and again crossing the Bega-panee, beyond which
the sandstone appeared (strike</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">north-east and dip north-west 60&deg;); the soil
was poor in the extreme; not an inhabitant or tree was to be seen
throughout the grassy landscape, and hardly a bush, save an
occasional rhododendron, dwarf oak, or <i>Pieris,</i> barely a few
inches high.</p>

<p>At Pomrang we took up our quarters in an excellent empty
bungalow, built by Mr. Stainforth (Judge of Silhet), who kindly
allowed us the use of it. Its elevation was 5,143 feet, and it
occupied the eastern extremity of a lofty spur that overhangs the
deep fir-clad valley of the Oongkot, dividing Khasia from Jyntea.
The climate of Pomrang is so much cooler and less rainy than at
Churra, that this place is more eligible for a station; but the
soil is quite impracticable, there is an occasional scarcity of
water, the pasture is wholly unsuited for cattle or sheep, and the
distance from the plains is too great.</p>

<p>A beautiful view extends eastwards to the low Jyntea hills,
backed by the blue mountains of Cachar, over the deep valley in
front; to the northward, a few peaks of the Himalaya are seen, and
westward is Chillong. We staid here till the 23rd September, and
then proceeded south-eastward to Mooshye. The path descends into
the valley of the Oongkot, passing the village of Pomrang, and then
through woods of pine, <i>Gordonia,</i> and oak, the latter closely
resembling the English, and infested with galls. The slopes are
extensively cultivated with black awnless unirrigated rice, and
poor crops of <i>Coix,</i> protected from the birds by scarecrows
of lines stretched across the fields, bearing tassels and tufts of
fern, shaken by boys. This fern proved to be a very curious and
interesting genus, which is only known to occur elsewhere at
Hong-Kong in China, and has been called <i>Bowringia,</i> after the
eminent Dr. Bowring.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 314">[ 314 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">We crossed the river* twice, proceeding south-west
to Mooshye, a village placed on an isolated, flat-topped, and very
steep-sided hill, 4,863 feet above the sea, and perhaps 3,500 above
the Oongkot, which winds round its base. A very steep path led up
slate rocks to the top (which was of sandstone), where there is a
stockaded guard-house, once occupied by British troops, of which we
took possession. A Labiate plant (<i>Mesona Wallichiana</i>) grew
on the ascent, whose bruised leaves smelt as strongly of patchouli,
as do those of the plant producing that perfume, to which it is
closely allied. The <i>Pogostemon Patchouli</i> has been said to
occur in these parts of India, but we never met with it, and doubt
the accuracy of the statement. It is a native of the Malay
peninsula, whence the leaves are imported into Bengal, and so to
Europe.</p>

<p>The summit commands a fine view northward of some Himalayan
peaks, and southwards of the broad valley of the Oongkot, which is
level, and bounded by steep and precipitous hills, with flat tops.
On the 25th we left Mooshye for Amwee in Jyntea, which lies to the
south-east. We descended by steps cut in the sandstone, and fording
the Oongkot, climbed the hills on its east side, along the grassy
tops of which we continued, at an elevation of 4000 feet. Marshy
flats intersect the hills, to which wild elephants sometimes
ascend, doing much damage to the rice</p>

<p class="fnote">* <i>Podostemom</i> grew on the stones at the
bottom: it is a remarkable waterplant, resembling a liver-wort in
its mode of growth. Several species occur at different elevations
in the Khasia, and appear only in autumn, when they often carpet
the bottom of the streams with green. In spring and summer no
traces of them are seen; and it is difficult to conceive what
becomes of the seeds in the interval, and how these, which are well
known, and have no apparent provision for the purpose, attach
themselves to the smooth rocks at the bottom of the torrents. All
the kinds flower and ripen their seeds under water; the stamens and
pistil being protected by the closed flower from the wet. This
genus does not inhabit the Sikkim rivers, probably owing to the
great changes of temperature to which these are subject.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 315">[ 315 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">crops. We crossed a stream by a bridge formed of
one gigantic block of sandstone, 20 feet long, close to the
village, which is a wretched one, and is considered unhealthy: it
stands on the high road from Jynteapore (at the foot of the hills
to the southward) to Assam: the only road that crosses the
mountains east of that from Churra to Nunklow.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images2/fig33.jpg" width="283" height="212" alt=
"Old bridge at Amwee"></center>

<p>Though so much lower, this country, from the barrenness of the
soil, is more thinly inhabited than the Khasia. The pitcher-plant
(<i>Nepenthes</i>) grows on stony and grassy hills about Amwee, and
crawls along the ground; its pitchers seldom contain insects in the
wild state, nor can we suggest any special function for the
wonderful organ it possesses.</p>

<p>About eight miles south of the village is a stream, crossed by a
bridge, half of which is formed of slabs of stone (of which one is
twenty-one feet long, seven broad, and two feet three and a half
inches thick), supported on piers, and the rest is a well turned
arch, such as I have not</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 316">[ 316 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">seen elsewhere among the hill tribes of India. It
is fast crumbling away, and is covered with tropical plants, and a
beautiful white-flowered orchis* grew in the mossy crevices of its
stones.</p>

<p>From Amwee our route lay north-east across the Jyntea hills to
Joowye, the hill-capital of the district. The path gradually
ascended, dipping into valleys scooped out in the horizontal
sandstone down to the basalt; and boulders of the same rock were
scattered about. Fields of rice occupy the bottoms of these
valleys, in which were placed gigantic images of men, dressed in
rags, and armed with bows and arrows, to scare away the wild
elephants! Slate rocks succeed the sandstone (strike north-east,
dip north-west), and with them pines and birch appear, clothing the
deep flanks of the Mintadoong valley, which we crossed.</p>

<p>The situation of Joowye is extremely beautiful: it occupies the
broken wooded slope of a large open flat valley, dotted with pines;
and consists of an immense number of low thatched cottages,
scattered amongst groves of bamboo, and fields of plantain,
tobacco, yams, sugar-cane, maize, and rice, surrounded by hedges of
bamboo, <i>Colquhounia,</i> and <i>Erythrina.</i> Narrow steep
lanes lead amongst these, shaded with oak, birch, <i>
Podocarpus,</i> Camellia, and <i>Araliace&aelig;</i>; the larger
trees being covered with orchids, climbing palms, <i>Pothos,
Scindapsus,</i> pepper, and <i>Gnetum</i>; while masses of
beautiful red and violet balsams grew under every hedge and rock.
The latter was of sandstone, overlying highly inclined schists, and
afforded magnificent blocks for the natives to rear on end, or make
seats of. Some erect stones</p>

<p class="fnote">* <i>Diplomeris; Apostasia</i> also grew in this
gulley, with a small <i>Arundina,</i> some beautiful species of <i>
Sonerila,</i> and <i>Argostemma.</i> The neighbourhood was very
rich in plants.</p>

<p class="first">on a hill at the entrance are immensely large, and
surround a clump of fine fig and banyan trees.*</p>

<p>We procured a good house after many delays, for the people were
far from obliging; it was a clean, very long cottage, with low
thatched eaves almost touching the ground, and was surrounded by a
high bamboo paling that enclosed out-houses built on a well-swept
floor of beaten earth. Within, the woodwork was carved in curious
patterns, and was particularly well fitted. The old lady to whom it
belonged got tired of us before two days were over, and first tried
to smoke us out by a large fire of green wood at that end of the
cottage which she retained; and afterwards by inviting guests to a
supper, with whom she kept up a racket all night. Her son, a tall,
sulky fellow, came to receive the usual gratuity on our departure,
which we made large to show we bore no ill-will: he, however,
behaved so scornfully, pretending to despise it, that I had no
choice but to pocket it again; a proceeding which was received with
shouts of laughter, at his expense, from a large crowd of
bystanders.</p>

<p>On the 30th of September we proceeded north-east from Joowye to
Nurtiung, crossing the watershed of the Jyntea range, which is
granitic, and scarcely raised above the mean level of the hills; it
is about 4,500 feet elevation. To the north the descent is at first
rather abrupt for 500 feet, to a considerable stream, beyond which
is the village of Nurtiung. The country gradually declines hence to
the north-east, in grassy hills;</p>

<p class="fnote">* In some tanks we found <i>Hydropeltis,</i> an
American and Australian plant allied to <i>Nymph&aelig;a.</i> Mr.
Griffith first detected it here, and afterwards in Bhotan, these
being the only known habitats for it in the Old World. It grows
with <i>Typha, Acorus Calamus</i> (sweet flag), <i>Vallisneria,
Potamogeton, Sparganium,</i> and other European water-plants.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">which to the east become higher and more wooded:
to the west the Khasia are seen, and several Himalayan peaks to the
north.</p>

<p>The ascent to the village from the river is by steps cut in a
narrow cleft of the schist rocks, to a flat, elevated 4,178 feet
above the sea: we here procured a cottage, and found the people
remarkably civil. The general appearance is the same as at Joowye,
but there are here extensive and very unhealthy marshes, whose evil
effects we experienced, in having the misfortune to lose one of our
servants by fever. Except pines, there are few large trees; but the
quantity of species of perennial woody plants contributing to form
the jungles is quite extraordinary: I enumerated 140, of which 60
were trees or large shrubs above twenty feet high. One of these was
the <i>Hamamelis chinensis,</i> a plant hitherto only known as a
native of China. This, the <i>Bowringia,</i> and the little <i>
Nymph&aelig;a,</i> are three out of many remarkable instances of
our approach to the eastern Asiatic flora.</p>

<p>From Nurtiung we walked to the Bor-panee river, sixteen or
twenty miles to the north-east (not the river of that name below
Nunklow), returning the same night; a most fatiguing journey in so
hot and damp a climate. The path lay for the greatest part of the
way over grassy hills of mica-schist, with boulders of granite, and
afterwards of syenite, like those of Nunklow. The descent to the
river is through noble woods of spreading oaks,* chesnuts,
magnolias, and tall pines: the vegetation is very tropical, and
with the exception of there being no sal, it resembles that of the
dry hills of the Sikkim Terai. The Bor-panee is</p>

<p class="fnote">* We collected upwards of fifteen kinds of oak and
chesnut in these and the Khasia mountains; many are magnificent
trees, with excellent wood, while others are inferior as
timber.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 319">[ 319 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">forty yards broad, and turbid; its bed, which is
of basalt, is 2,454 feet above the sea: it is crossed by a raft
pulled to and fro by canes.</p>

<p>Nurtiung contains a most remarkable collection of those
sepulchral and other monuments, which form so curious a feature in
the scenery of these mountains and in the habits of their savage
population. They are all placed in a fine grove of trees, occupying
a hollow; where several acres are covered with gigantic, generally
circular, slabs of stone, from ten to twenty-five feet broad,
supported five feet above the ground upon other blocks. For the
most part they are buried in brushwood of nettles and shrubs, but
in one place there is an open area of fifty yards encircled by
them, each with a gigantic headstone behind it. Of the latter the
tallest was nearly thirty feet high, six broad, and two feet eight
inches in thickness, and must have been sunk at least five feet,
and perhaps much more, in the ground. The flat slabs were generally
of slate or hornstone; but many of them, and all the larger ones,
were of syenitic granite, split by heat and cold water with great
art. They are erected by dint of sheer brute strength, the lever
being the only aid. Large blocks of syenite were scattered amongst
these wonderful erections.</p>

<p>Splendid trees of <i>Bombax,</i> fig and banyan, overshadowed
them: the largest banyan had a trunk five feet in diameter, clear
of the buttresses, and numerous small trees of <i>Celtic</i> grew
out of it, and an immense flowering tuft of <i>Vanda
c&aelig;rulea</i> (the rarest and most beautiful of Indian orchids)
flourished on one of its limbs. A small plantain with austere
woolly scarlet fruit, bearing ripe seeds, was planted in this
sacred grove, where trees of the most tropical genera grew mixed
with the pine, birch, <i>Myrica,</i> and <i>Viburnum.</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 320">[ 320 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Nurtiung Stonehenge is no doubt in part religious, as the
grove suggests, and also designed for cremation, the bodies being
burnt on the altars. In the Khasia these upright stones are
generally raised simply as memorials of great events, or of men
whose ashes are not necessarily, though frequently, buried or
deposited in hollow stone sarcophagi near them, and sometimes in an
urn placed inside a sarcophagus, or under horizontal slabs.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images2/fig34.jpg" width="315" height="263" alt=
"Stones at Nurtiung"></center>

<p>The usual arrangement is a row of five, seven, or more erect
oblong blocks with round heads (the highest being placed in the
middle), on which are often wooden discs and cones: more rarely
pyramids are built. Broad slabs for seats are also common by the
wayside. Mr. Yule, who first drew attention to these monuments,
mentions one</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 321">[ 321 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">thirty-two feet by fifteen, and two in thickness;
and states that the sarcophagi (which, however, are rare) formed of
four slabs, resemble a drawing in Bell&rsquo;s Circassia, and
descriptions in Irby and Mangles&rsquo; Travels in Syria. He adds
that many villages derive their names from these stones,
&ldquo;mau&rdquo; signifying &ldquo;stone:&rdquo; thus
&ldquo;Mausmai&rdquo; is &ldquo;the stone of oath,&rdquo; because,
as his native informant said, &ldquo;there was war between Churra
and Mausmai, and when they made peace, they swore to it, and placed
a stone as a witness;&rdquo; forcibly recalling the stone Jacob set
up for a pillar, and other passages in the old Testament:
&ldquo;Mamloo&rdquo; is &ldquo;the stone of salt,&rdquo; eating
salt from a sword&rsquo;s point being the Khasia form of oath:
&ldquo;Mauflong&rdquo; is &ldquo;the grassy stone,&rdquo; etc.*
Returning from this grove, we crossed a stream by a single squared
block, twenty-eight feet long, five broad, and two thick, of gray
syenitic granite with large crystals of felspar.</p>

<p>We left Nurtiung on the 4th of October, and walked to Pomrang, a
very long and fatiguing day&rsquo;s work. The route descends
north-west of the village, and turns due east along bare grassy
hills of mica-schist and slate (strike east and west, and dip
north). Near the village of Lernai oak woods are passed, in which
<i>Vanda c&oelig;rulea</i> grows in profusion, waving its panicles
of azure flowers in the wind. As this beautiful orchid is at
present attracting great attention, from its high price, beauty,
and difficulty of culture, I shall point out how totally at
variance with its native habits, is the cultivation thought
necessary for it in England.&dagger; The</p>

Lieutenant H. Yule, Bengal Engineers. Analogous combinations occur
in the south of England and in Brittany, etc., where similar

&dagger; We collected seven men&rsquo;s loads of this superb plant
for the Royal Gardens at Kew; but owing to unavoidable accidents
and difficulties, few specimens reached England alive. A gentleman
who sent his gardener with us to be shown the locality, was more
successful: he sent one man&rsquo;s load to England on commission,
and though it arrived in a very poor state, it sold for
300<i>l</i>, the individual plants fetching prices varying from
3<i>l</i> to 10<i>l.</i> Had all arrived alive, they would have
cleared 1000 pounds. An active collector, with the facilities I
possessed, might easily clear from 2000<i>l</i> to 3000<i>l</i>, in
one season, by the sale of Khasia orchids.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">dry grassy hills which it inhabits are elevated
3000 to 4000 feet: the trees are small, gnarled, and very sparingly
leafy, so that the Vanda which grows on their limbs is fully
exposed to sun, rain, and wind. There is no moss or lichen on the
branches with the Vanda, whose roots sprawl over the dry rough
bark. The atmosphere is on the whole humid, and extremely so during
the rains; but there is no damp heat, or stagnation of the air, and
at the flowering season the temperature ranges between 60&deg; and
80&deg;, there is much sunshine, and both air and bark are dry
during the day: in July and August, during the rains, the
temperature is a little higher than above, but in winter it falls
much lower, and hoar-frost forms on the ground. Now this
winter&rsquo;s cold, summer&rsquo;s heat, and autumn&rsquo;s
drought, and above all, this constant free exposure to fresh air
and the winds of heaven, are what of all things we avoid exposing
our orchids to in England. It is under these conditions, however,
that all the finer Indian <i>Orchide&aelig;,</i> grow, of which we
found <i>Dendrobium Farmeri, Dalhousianum, Devonianum,</i> etc.,
with <i>Vanda c&oelig;rulea</i>; whilst the most beautiful species
of <i>C&oelig;logyne, Cymbidium, Bolbophyllum,</i> and <i>
Cypripedium,</i> inhabit cool climates at elevations above 4000
feet in Khasia, and as high as 6000 to 7000 in Sikkim.</p>

<p>On the following day we turned out our Vanda to dress the
specimens for travelling, and preserve the flowers for botanical
purposes. Of the latter we had 360 panicles, each composed of from
six to twenty-one broad pale-blue</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 323">[ 323 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">tesselated flowers, three and a half to four
inches across and they formed three piles on the floor of the
verandah, each a yard high: what would we not have given to have
been able to transport a single panicle to a Chiswick
f&ecirc;te!</p>

<p>On the 10th of October we sent twenty-four strong mountaineers
to Churra, laden with the collections of the previous month; whilst
we returned to Nonkreem, and crossing the shoulder of Chillong,
passed through the village of Moleem in a north-west direction to
the Syong bungalow. From this we again crossed the range to Nunklow
and the Bor-panee, and returned by Moflong and the Kala-panee to
Churra during the latter part of the month.</p>

<p>In November the vegetation above 4000 feet turns wintry and
brown, the weather becomes chilly, and though the cold is never
great, hoar-frost forms at Churra, and water freezes at Moflong. We
prepared to leave as these signs of winter advanced: we had
collected upwards of 2,500 species, and for the last few weeks all
our diligence, and that of our collectors, had failed to be
rewarded by a single novelty. We however procured many species in
fruit, and made a collection of upwards of 300 kinds of woods, many
of very curious structure. As, however, we projected a trip to
Cachar before quitting the neighbourhood, we retained our
collectors, giving orders for them to meet us at Chattuc, on our
way down the Soormah in December, with their collections, which
amounted to 200 men&rsquo;s loads, and for the conveyance of which
to Calcutta, Mr. Inglis procured us boats.</p>

<p>Before dismissing the subject of the Khasia mountains, it will
be well to give a slight sketch of their prominent geographical
features, in connection with their geology. The general geological
characters of the chain may be summed up in a few words. The
nucleus or axis is of</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 324">[ 324 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">highly inclined stratified metamorphic rocks,
through which the granite has been protruded, and the basalt and
syenite afterwards injected. After extensive denudations of these,
the sandstone, coal, and limestone were successively deposited.
These are altered and displaced along the southern edge of the
range, by black amygdaloidal trap, and have in their turn been
extensively denuded; and it is this last operation that has
sculptured the range, and given the mountains their present aspect;
for the same gneisses, slates, and basalts in other countries,
present rugged peaks, domes, or cones, and there is nothing in
their composition or arrangement here that explains the tabular or
rounded outline they assume, or the uniform level of the spurs into
which they rise, or the curious steep sides and flat floors of the
valleys which drain them.</p>

<p>All these peculiarities of outline are the result of denudation,
of the specific action of which agent we are very ignorant. The
remarkable difference between the steep cliffs on the south face of
the range, and the rounded outline of the hills on the northern
slopes, may be explained on the supposition that when the Khasia
was partially submerged, the Assam valley was a broad bay or gulf;
and that while the Churra cliffs were exposed to the full sweep of
the ocean, the Nunklow shore was washed by a more tranquil sea.</p>

<p>The broad flat marshy heads of all the streams in the central
and northern parts of the chain, and the rounded hills that
separate them, indicate the levelling action of a tidal sea, acting
on a low flat shore;* whilst the steep flat-</p>

<p class="fnote">* Since our return to England, we have been much
struck with the similarity in contour of the Essex and Suffolk
coasts, and with the fact that the tidal coast sculpturing of this
surface is preserved in the very centre of High Suffolk, twenty to
thirty miles distant from the sea, in rounded outlines and broad
flat marshy valleys.</p>

attributed to the scouring action of higher tides on a boisterous
rocky coast. These views are confirmed by an examination of the
east shores of the Bay of Bengal, and particularly by a comparison
of the features of the country about Silhet, now nearly 280 miles
distant from the sea, with those of the Chittagong coast, with
which they are identical.</p>

<p>The geological features of the Khasia are in many respects so
similar to those of the Vindhya, Kymore, Behar, and Rajmahal
mountains, that they have been considered by some observers as an
eastern prolongation of that great chain, from which they are
geographically separated by the delta of the Ganges and
Burrampooter. The general contour of the mountains, and of their
sandstone cliffs, is the same, and the association of this rock
with coal and lime is a marked point of similarity; there is,
however, this difference between them, that the coal-shales of
Khasia and limestone of Behar are non-fossiliferous, while the lime
of Khasia and the coal-shales of Behar contain fossils.</p>

<p>The prevalent north-east strike of the gneiss is the same in
both, differing from the Himalaya, where the stratified rocks
generally strike north-west. The nummulites of the limestone are
the only known means we have of forming an approximate estimate of
the age of the Khasia coal, which is the most interesting feature
in the geology of the range: these fossils have been examined by
MM. Archiac and Jules Haines,* who have pronounced the species
collected by Dr. Thomson and myself to be the same as those found
in the nummulite rocks of north-west India, Scinde, and Arabia.</p>
