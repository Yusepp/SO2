<p class="first">From this place there were two routes to Tibet,
each of about six days&rsquo; journey. One lay to the north-west up
the Lachen valley to the Kongra Lama pass, the other to the east up
the Lachoong to the Donkia pass. The latter river has its source in
small lakes in Sikkim, south of the Donkia mountain, a shoulder of
which the pass crosses, commanding a magnificent view into Tibet.
The Lachen, on the other hand (the principal source of the Teesta),
rises beyond Sikkim in the Cholamoo lakes. The frontier at Kongra
Lama was described to me as being a political, and not a natural
boundary, marked out by cairns, standing on a plain, and crossing
the Lachen river. To both Donkia and Kongra Lama I had every right
to go, and was determined, if possible, to reach them, in spite of
Meepo&rsquo;s ignorance, our guide&rsquo;s endeavours to frighten
my party</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 30">[ 30 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and mislead myself, and the country people&rsquo;s
dread of incurring the Dewan&rsquo;s displeasure.</p>

<p>The Lachen valley being pronounced impracticable in the height
of the rains, a month later, it behoved me to attempt it first, and
it possessed the attraction of leading to a frontier described as
far to the northward of the snowy Himalaya, on a lofty plateau,
whose plants and animals were different from anything I had
previously seen.</p>

<p>After a week the coolies arrived with supplies: they had been
delayed by the state of the paths, and had consequently consumed a
great part of my stock, reducing it to eight days&rsquo; allowance.
I therefore divided my party, leaving the greater number at
Choongtam, with a small tent, and instructions to forward all food
to me as it arrived. I started with about fifteen attendants, on
the 25th of May, for Lamteng, three marches up the Lachen.</p>

<p>Descending the step-formed terraces, I crossed the Lachen by a
good cane bridge. The river is a headstrong torrent, and turbid
from the vast amount of earthy matter which it bears along; and
this character of extreme impetuosity, unbroken by any still bend,
or even swirling pool, it maintains uninterruptedly at this season
from 4000 to 10,000 feet. It is crossed three times, always by cane
bridges, and I cannot conceive any valley of its nature to be more
impracticable at such a season. On both sides the mountains rose,
densely forest-clad, at an average angle of 35&deg; to 40&deg;, to
10,000 and 15,000 feet. Its extreme narrowness, and the grandeur of
its scenery, were alike recalled to my mind, on visiting the Sachs
valley in the Valais of Switzerland; from which, however, it
differs in its luxuriant forest, and in the slopes being more
uniform and less broken up into those imposing precipices so
frequent in Switzerland,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 31">[ 31 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">but which are wanting in the temperate regions of
the Sikkim Himalaya.</p>

<p>At times we scrambled over rocks 1000 feet above the river, or
descended into gorges, through whose tributary torrents we waded,
or crossed swampy terraced flats of unstratified shingle above the
stream; whilst it was sometimes necessary to round rocky
promontories in the river, stemming the foaming torrent that
pressed heavily against the chest as, one by one, we were dragged
along by powerful Lepchas. Our halting-places were on flats close
to the river, covered with large trees, and carpeted with a most
luxuriant herbage, amongst which a wild buckwheat
(<i>Polygonum</i>*) was abundant, which formed an excellent
spinach: it is called &ldquo;Pullop-bi&rdquo;; a name I shall
hereafter have occasion to mention with gratitude.</p>

<p>A few miles above Choongtam, we passed a few cottages on a very
extensive terrace at Tumlong; but between this and Lamteng, the
country is uninhabited, nor is it frequented during the rains. We
consequently found that the roads had suffered, the little bridges
and aids to climb precipices and cross landslips had been carried
away, and at one place we were all but turned back. This was at the
Taktoong river, a tributary on the east bank, which rushes down at
an angle of 15&deg;, in a sheet of silvery foam, eighteen yards
broad. It does not, where I crossed it, flow in a deep gulley,
having apparently raised its bed by an accumulation of enormous
boulders; and a plank bridge was thrown across it, against whose
slippery and narrow foot-boards the water dashed, loosening the
supports on either bank, and rushing between their foundation
stones.</p>

<p>My unwilling guide had gone ahead with some of the</p>

<p class="fnote">* <i>Polygonum cymosum,</i> Wall. This is a common
Himalayan plant, and is also found in the Khasia mountains.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 32">[ 32 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">coolies: I had suspected him all along (perhaps
unjustly) of avoiding the most practicable routes; but when I found
him waiting for me at this bridge, to which he sarcastically
pointed with his bow, I felt that had he known of it, to have made
difficulties before would have been a work of supererogation. He
seemed to think I should certainly turn back, and assured me there
was no other crossing (a statement I afterwards found to be
untrue); so, comforting myself with the hope that if the danger
were imminent, Meepo would forcibly stop me, I took off my shoes,
and walked steadily over: the tremor of the planks was like that
felt when standing on the paddle-box of a steamer, and I was jerked
up and down, as my weight pressed them into the boiling flood,
which shrouded me with spray. I looked neither to the right nor to
the left, lest the motion of the swift waters should turn my head,
but kept my eye on the white jets d&rsquo;eau springing up between
the woodwork, and felt thankful when fairly on the opposite bank:
my loaded coolies followed, crossing one by one without fear or
hesitation. The bridge was swept into the Lachen very shortly
afterwards.</p>

<p>Towards Lamteng, the path left the river, and passed through a
wood of <i>Abies Smithiana.</i>* Larch appears at 9000 feet, with
<i>Abies Brunoniana.</i> An austere crab-apple, walnut, and the
willow of Babylon (the two latter perhaps cultivated), yellow
jessamine and ash, all scarce trees in Sikkim, are more or less
abundant in the valley, from 7000 to 8000 feet; as is an ivy, very
like the English, but with fewer and smaller yellow or reddish
berries;</p>

<p class="fnote">* Also called <i>A. Khutrow</i> and <i>
Morinda.</i> I had not before seen this tree in the Himalaya: it is
a spruce fir, much resembling the Norway spruce in general
appearance, but with longer pendulous branches. The wood is white,
and considered indifferent, though readily cleft into planks; it is
called &ldquo;Seh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and many other plants,* not found at equal
elevations on the outer ranges of the Himalaya.</p>

<p>Chateng, a spur from the lofty peak of Tukcham,&dagger; 19,472
feet high, rises 1000 feet above the west bank of the river; and
where crossed, commands one of the finest alpine views in Sikkim.
It was grassy, strewed with huge boulders of gneiss, and adorned
with clumps of park-like pines: on the summit was a small pool,
beautifully fringed with bushy trees of white rose, a
white-blossomed apple, a <i>Pyrus</i> like <i>Aria,</i> another
like mountain-ash, scarlet rhododendrons (<i>arboreum</i> and <i>
barbatum</i>), holly, maples, and <i>Goughia,</i>&Dagger; a curious
evergreen laurel-like tree: there were also Daphnes, purple
magnolia, and a pink sweet-blossomed <i>Sph&aelig;rostema.</i> Many
English water-plants<sup>&sect;</sup> grew in the water, but I
found no shells; tadpoles, however, swarmed, which later in the
season become large frogs. The &ldquo;painted-lady&rdquo; butterfly
(<i>Cynthia Cardui</i>), and a pretty &ldquo;blue&rdquo; were
flitting over the flowers, together with some great tropical kinds,
that wander so far up these valleys, accompanying <i>Marlea,</i>
the only subtropical tree that ascends to 8,500 feet in the
interior of Sikkim.</p>

<p>The river runs close tinder the eastern side of the</p>

<p class="fnote">* Wood-sorrel, a white-stemmed bramble, birch,
some maples, nut gigantic lily (<i>Lilium giganteum</i>), <i>
Euphorbia, Pedicularis, Spir&aelig;a, Philadelphus, Deutzia,
Indigofera,</i> and various other South Europe and North American
genera.<br>
&dagger; &ldquo;Tuk&rdquo; signifies head in Lepcha, and
&ldquo;cheam&rdquo; or &ldquo;chaum,&rdquo; I believe, has
reference to the snow. The height of Tukcham has been re-calculated
by Capt. R. Strachey, with angles taken by myself, at Dorjiling and
Jillapahar, and is approximate only.<br>
&Dagger; This fine plant was named (Wight, &ldquo;Ic.
Plant.&rdquo;) in honour of Capt. Gough, son of the late
commander-in-chief, and an officer to whom the botany of the
peninsula of India is greatly indebted. It is a large and handsome
evergreen, very similar in foliage to a fine rhododendron, and
would prove an invaluable ornament on our lawns, if its hardier
varieties were introduced into this country.<br>
&sect; <i>Sparganium, Typha, Potamogeton, Callitriche,
Utricularia,</i> sedges and rushes.</p>

<p class="first">valley, which slopes so steeply as to appear for
many miles almost a continuous landslip, 2000 feet high.</p>

<p>Lamteng village, where I arrived on the 27th of May, is quite
concealed by a moraine to the south, which, with a parallel ridge
on the north, forms a beautiful bay in the mountains, 8,900 feet
above the sea, and 1000 above the Lachen. The village stands on a
grassy and bushy flat, around which the pine-clad mountains rise
steeply to the snowy peaks and black cliffs which tower above. It
contains about forty houses, forming the winter-quarters of the
inhabitants of the valley, who, in summer, move with their flocks
and herds to the alpine pastures of the Tibet frontier. The
dwellings are like those described at Wallanchoon, but the
elevation being lower, and the situation more sheltered, they are
more scattered; whilst on account of the dampness of the climate,
they are raised higher from the ground, and the shingles with which
they are tiled (made of <i>Abies Webbiana</i>) decay in two or
three years. Many are painted lilac, with the gables in diamonds of
red, black, and white: the roofs are either of wood, or of the bark
of <i>Abies Brunoniana,</i> held down by large stones: within they
are airy and comfortable. They are surrounded by a little
cultivation of buck-wheat, radishes, turnips, and mustard. The
inhabitants, though paying rent to the Sikkim Rajah, consider
themselves as Tibetans, and are so in language, dress, features,
and origin: they seldom descend to Choongtam, but yearly travel to
the Tibetan towns of Jigatzi, Kambajong, Giantchi, and even to
Lhassa, having always commercial and pastoral transactions with the
Tibetans, whose flocks are pastured on the Sikkim mountains during
summer, and who trade with the plains of India through the medium
of these villagers.</p>

<p class="first">11,000 feet, the yaks, sheep, and ponies had just
been driven 2000 feet up the valley, and the inhabitants were
preparing to follow, with their tents and goats, to summer quarters
at Tallum and Tungu. Many had go&icirc;tres and rheumatism, for the
cure of which they flocked to my tent; dry-rubbing for the latter,
and tincture of iodine for the former, gained me some credit as a
doctor: I could, however, procure no food beyond trifling presents
of eggs, meal, and more rarely, fowls.</p>

<p>On arriving, I saw a troop of large monkeys* gambolling in a
wood of <i>Abies Brunoniana</i>: this surprised me, as I was not
prepared to find so tropical an animal associated with a vegetation
typical of a boreal climate. The only other quadrupeds seen here
were some small earless rats, and musk-deer; the young female of
which latter sometimes afforded me a dish of excellent venison;
being, though dark-coloured and lean, tender, sweet, and
short-fibred. Birds were scarce, with the exception of alpine
pigeons (<i>Columba leuconota</i>), red-legged crows (<i>Corvus
graculus,</i> L.), and the horned pheasant (<i>Meleagris
Satyra,</i> L.). In this month insects are scarce, <i>Elater</i>
and a black earwig being the most frequent: two species of <i>
Serica</i> also flew into my tent, and at night moths, closely
resembling European ones, came from the fir-woods. The vegetation
in the, neighbourhood of Lamteng is European and North American;
that is to say, it unites the boreal and temperate floras of the
east and west hemispheres; presenting also a few features peculiar
to Asia. This is a subject of very great importance in physical
geography; as a country combining the botanical characters of
several others, affords materials for tracing the direction in
which genera and</p>

<p class="fnote">* <i>Macacus Pelops?</i> Hodgson. This is a very
different species from the tropical kind seen in Nepal, and
mentioned at vol. i, <a href="chap12.html#page 278">p. 278.</a></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 38">[ 38 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">species have migrated, the causes that favour
their migrations, and the laws that determine the types or forms of
one region, which represent those of another. A glance at the map
will show that Sikkim is, geographically, peculiarly well situated
for investigations of this kind, being centrically placed, whether
as regards south-eastern Asia or the Himalayan chain. Again, the
Lachen valley at this spot is nearly equi-distant from the tropical
forests of the Terai and the sterile mountains of Tibet, for which
reason representatives both of the dry central Asiatic and
Siberian, and of the humid Malayan floras meet there.</p>

<p>The mean temperature of Lamteng (about 50&deg;) is that of the
isothermal which passes through Britain in lat. 52&deg;, and east
Europe in lat. 48&deg;, cutting the parallel of 45&deg; in Siberia
(due north of Lamteng itself), descending to lat. 42&deg; on the
east coast of Asia, ascending to lat. 48&deg; on the west of
America, and descending to that of New York in the United States.
This mean temperature is considerably increased by descending to
the bed of the Lachen at 8000 feet, and diminished by ascending
Tukcham to 14,000 feet, which gives a range of 6000 feet of
elevation, and 20&deg; of mean temperature. But as the climate and
vegetation become arctic at 12,000 feet, it will be as well to
confine my observations to the flora of 7000 to 10,000 feet; of the
mean temperature, namely, between 53&deg; and 43&deg;, the
isothermal lines corresponding to which embrace, on the surface of
the globe, at the level of the sea, a space varying in different
meridians from three to twelve degrees of latitude.* At first sight
it appears incredible that such a limited area, buried in the
depths of the Himalaya, should present nearly all the types of the
flora of the north</p>

<p class="fnote">* On the west coast of Europe, where the distance
between these isothermal lines is greatest, this belt extends
almost from Stockholm and the Shetlands to Paris.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 39">[ 39 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">temperate zone; not only, however, is this the
case, but space is also found at Lamteng for the intercalation of
types of a Malayan flora, otherwise wholly foreign to the north
temperate region.</p>

<p>A few examples will show this. Amongst trees the Conifers are
conspicuous at Lamteng, and all are of genera typical both of
Europe and North America: namely, silver fir, spruce, larch, and
juniper, besides the yew: there are also species of birch, alder,
ash, apple, oak, willow, cherry, bird-cherry, mountain-ash, thorn,
walnut, hazel, maple, poplar, ivy, holly, Andromeda, <i>
Rhamnus.</i> Of bushes; rose, berberry, bramble, rhododendron,
elder, cornel, willow, honeysuckle, currant, <i>Spir&aelig;a,
Viburnum, Cotoneaster, Hippoph&aelig;.</i> Herbaceous plants* are
far too numerous to be enumerated, as a list would include most of
the common genera of European and North American plants.</p>

<p>Of North American genera, not found in Europe, were <i>Buddleia,
Podophyllum, Magnolia, Sassafras? Tetranthera, Hydrangea, Diclytra,
Aralia, Panax, Symplocos, Trillium,</i> and <i>Clintonia.</i> The
absence of heaths is also equally a feature in the flora of North
America. Of European genera, not found in North America, the Lachen
valley has <i>Coriaria, Hypecoum,</i> and various <i>
Crucifer&aelig;.</i> The Japanese and Chinese floras are
represented in Sikkim by <i>Camellia, Deutzia, Stachyurus, Aucuba,
Helwingia, Stauntonia, Hydrangea, Skimmia, Eurya, Anthogonium,</i>
and <i>Enkianthus.</i> The Malayan by Magnolias, <i>Talauma,</i>
many vacciniums and rhododendrons, <i>Kadsura, Goughia, Marlea,</i>
both coriaceous and deciduous-leaved <i>C&aelig;logyne, Oberonia,
Cyrtosia, Calanthe,</i></p>

<p class="fnote">* As an example, the ground about my tent was
covered with grasses and sedges, amongst which grew primroses,
thistles, speedwell, wild leeks, <i>Arum, Convallaria, Callitriche,
Oxalis, Ranunculus, Potentilla, Orchis, Ch&aelig;rophyllum, Galium,
Paris,</i> and <i>Anagallis</i>; besides cultivated weeds of
shepherd&rsquo;s-purse, dock, mustard, Mithridate cress, radish,
turnip, <i>Thlaspi arvense,</i> and <i>Poa annua.</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 40">[ 40 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and other orchids; <i>Ceropegia, Parochetus,
Balanophora,</i> and many <i>Scitamine&aelig;</i>; and amongst
trees, by <i>Engelhardtia, Goughia,</i> and various laurels.</p>

<p>Shortly after my arrival at Lamteng, the villagers sent to
request that I would not shoot, as they said it brought on
excessive rain,* and consequent damage to the crops. My necessities
did not admit of my complying with their wish unless I could
procure food by other means; and I at first paid no attention to
their request. The people, however, became urgent, and the
Choongtam Lama giving his high authority to the superstition, it
appeared impolitic to resist their earnest supplication; though I
was well aware that the story was trumped up by the Lama for the
purpose of forcing me to return. I yielded on the promise of
provisions being supplied from the village, which was done to a
limited extent; and I was enabled to hold out till more arrived
from Dorjiling, now, owing to the state of the roads, at the
distance of twenty days&rsquo; march. The people were always civil
and kind: there was no concealing the fact that the orders were
stringent, prohibiting my party being supplied with food, but many
of the villagers sought opportunities by night of replenishing my
stores. Superstitious and timorous, they regard a doctor with great
veneration; and when to that is added his power of writing,
drawing, and painting, their admiration knows no bounds: they
flocked round my tent all day, scratching their ears, lolling out
their tongues, making a clucking noise, smiling, and timidly
peeping over my shoulder, but flying in alarm when my little dog
resented their familiarity by snapping at their legs. The</p>

<p class="fnote">* In Griffith&rsquo;s narrative of
&ldquo;Pemberton&rsquo;s Mission to Bhotan&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Posthumous Papers, Journal,&rdquo; p. 283), it is mentioned
that the Gylongs (Lamas) attributed a violent storm to the members
of the mission shooting birds.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 41">[ 41 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">men spend the whole day in loitering about,
smoking and spinning wool: the women in active duties; a few were
engaged in drying the leaves of a shrub (<i>Symplocos</i>) for the
Tibet market, which are used as a yellow dye; whilst, occasionally,
a man might be seen cutting a spoon or a yak-saddle out of
rhododendron wood.</p>

<p>During my stay at Lamteng, the weather was all but uniformly
cloudy and misty, with drizzling rain, and a southerly, or
up-valley wind, during the day, which changed to an easterly one at
night: occasionally distant thunder was heard. My rain-gauges
showed very little rain compared with what fell at Dorjiling during
the same period; the clouds were thin, both sun and moon shining
through them, without, however, the former warming the soil: hence
my tent was constantly wet, nor did I once sleep in a dry bed till
the 1st of June, which ushered in the month with a brilliant sunny
day. At night it generally rained in torrents, and the roar of
landslips and avalanches was then all but uninterrupted for hour
after hour: sometimes it was a rumble, at others a harsh grating
sound, and often accompanied with the crashing of immense
timber-trees, or the murmur of the distant snowy avalanches. The
amount of denudation by atmospheric causes is here quite
incalculable; and I feel satisfied that the violence of the river
at this particular part of its course (where it traverses those
parts of the valleys which are most snowy and rainy), is
proximately due to impediments thus accumulated in its bed.</p>

<p>It was sometimes clear at sunrise, and I made many ascents of
Tukcham, hoping for a view of the mountains towards the passes; but
I was only successful on one occasion, when I saw the table top of
Kinchinjhow, the most remarkable, and one of the most distant peaks
of</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 42">[ 42 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">dazzling snow which is seen from Dorjiling, and
which, I was told, is far beyond Sikkim, in Tibet.* I kept up a
constant intercourse with Choongtam, sending my plants thither to
be dried, and gradually reducing my party as our necessities urged
my so doing; lastly, I sent back the shooters, who had procured
very little, and whose occupation was now gone.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of June, I received the bad news that a large party
of coolies had been sent from Dorjiling with rice, but that being
unable or afraid to pass the landslips, they had returned: we had
now no food except a kid, a few handfuls of flour, and some
potatos, which had been sent up from Choongtam. All my endeavours
to gain information respecting the distance and position of the
frontier were unavailing; probably, indeed, the Lama and Phipun (or
chief man of the village), were the only persons who knew; the
villagers calling all the lofty pastures a few marches beyond
Lamteng &ldquo;Bhote&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cheen&rdquo; (Tibet). Dr.
Campbell had procured for me information by which I might recognise
the frontier were I once on it; but no description could enable me
to find my way in a country so rugged and forest-clad, through
tortuous and perpetually forking valleys, along often obliterated
paths, and under cloud and rain. To these difficulties must be
added the deception of the rulers, and the fact (of which I was not
then aware), that the Tibet frontier was formerly at Choongtam; but
from the Lepchas constantly harassing the Tibetans, the latter,
after the establishment of the Chinese rule over their country,
retreated first to Zemu Samdong, a few hours walk above Lamteng,
then to Tallum Samdong, 2000 feet higher; and, lastly, to</p>

<p class="fnote">* Such, however, is not the case; Kinchinjhow is
on the frontier of Sikkim, though a considerable distance behind
the most snowy of the Sikkim mountains.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 43">[ 43 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Kongra Lama, 16,000 feet up the west flank of
Kinchinjhow.</p>

<p>On the third of June I took a small party, with my tent, and
such provisions as I had, to explore up the river. On hearing of my
intention, the Phipun volunteered to take me to the frontier, which
he said was only two hours distant, at Zemu Samdong, where the
Lachen receives the Zemu river from the westward: this I knew must
be false, but I accepted his services, and we started, accompanied
by a large body of villagers, who eagerly gathered plants for me
along the road.</p>

<p>The scenery is very pretty; the path crosses extensive and
dangerous landslips, or runs through fine woods of spruce and <i>
Abies Brunoniana,</i> and afterwards along the river-banks, which
are fringed with willow (called &ldquo;Lama&rdquo;), and <i>
Hippoph&aelig;.</i> The great red rose (<i>Rosa macrophylla</i>),
one of the most beautiful Himalayan plants, whose single flowers
are as large as the palm of the hand, was blossoming, while golden
<i>Potentillas</i> and purple primroses flowered by the stream, and
<i>Pyrola</i> in the fir-woods.</p>

<p>Just above the fork of the valley, a wooden bridge (Samdong)
crosses the Zemu, which was pointed out to me as the frontier, and
I was entreated to respect two sticks and a piece of worsted
stretched across it; this I thought too ridiculous, so as my
followers halted on one side, I went on the bridge, threw the
sticks into the stream, crossed, and asked the Phipun to follow;
the people laughed, and came over: he then told me that he had
authority to permit of my botanising there, but that I was in
Cheen, and that he would show me the guard-house to prove the truth
of his statement. He accordingly led me up a steep bank to an
extensive broad flat, several hundred feet above the river, and
forming a triangular base to the great spur which,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 44">[ 44 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">rising steeply behind, divides the valley. This
flat was marshy and covered with grass; and buried in the jungle
were several ruined stone houses, with thick walls pierced with
loopholes: these had no doubt been occupied by Tibetans at the time
when this was the frontier.</p>

<p>The elevation which I had attained (that of the river being
8,970 feet) being excellent for botanising, I camped; and the
villagers, contented with the supposed success of their strategy,
returned to Lamteng.</p>

<p>My guide from the Durbar had staid behind at Lainteng, and
though Meepo and all my men well knew that this was not the
frontier, they were ignorant as to its true position, nor could we
even ascertain which of the rivers was the Lachen.* The only routes
I possessed indicated two paths northwards from Lamteng, neither
crossing a river: and I therefore thought it best to remain at Zemu
Samdong till provisions should arrive. I accordingly halted for
three days, collecting many new and beautiful plants, and exploring
the roads, of which five (paths or yak-tracks) diverged from this
point, one on either bank of each river, and one leading up the
fork.</p>

<p>On one occasion I ascended the steep hill at the fork; it was
dry and rocky, and crowned with stunted pines. Stacks of different
sorts of pine-wood were stored on the flat at its base, for export
to Tibet, all thatched with the bark of <i>Abies Brunoniana.</i> Of
these the larch (<i>Larix Griffithii,</i> &ldquo;Sah&rdquo;),
splits well, and is the most durable of any; but the planks are
small, soft, and white.&dagger; The silver fir (<i>Abies
Webbiana,</i> &ldquo;Dunshing&rdquo;) also splits well; it is
white, soft, and highly prized for durability. The wood</p>

<p class="fnote">* The eastern afterwards proved to be the
Lachen.<br>
&dagger; I never saw this wood to be red, close-grained, and hard,
like that of the old Swiss larch; nor does it ever reach so great a
size.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 45">[ 45 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">of <i>Abies Brunoniana</i>
(&ldquo;Semadoong&rdquo;) is like the others in appearance, but is
not durable; its bark is however very useful. The spruce (<i>Abies
Smithiana,</i> &ldquo;Seh&rdquo;) has also white wood, which is
employed for posts and beams.* These are the only pines whose woods
are considered very useful; and it is a curious circumstance that
none produce any quantity of resin, turpentine, or pitch; which may
perhaps be accounted for by the humidity of the climate.</p>

<p><i>Pinus longifolia</i> (called by the Lepchas
&ldquo;Gniet-koong,&rdquo; and by the Bhoteeas
&ldquo;Teadong&rdquo;) only grows in low valleys, where better
timber is abundant. The weeping blue juniper (<i>Juniperus
recurva,</i> &ldquo;Deschoo&rdquo;), and the arboreous black one
(called &ldquo;Tchokpo&rdquo;)&dagger; yield beautiful wood, like
that of the pencil cedar,&Dagger; but are comparatively scarce, as
is the yew (<i>Taxus baccata,</i> &ldquo;Tingschi&rdquo;), whose
timber is red. The &ldquo;Tchenden,&rdquo; or funereal cypress,
again, is valued only for the odour of its wood: <i>Pinus
excelsa,</i> &ldquo;Tongschi,&rdquo; though common in Bhotan, is,
as I have elsewhere remarked, not found in east Nepal or Sikkim;
the wood is admirable, being durable, close-grained, and so
resinous as to be used for flambeaux and candles. On the flat were
flowering a beautiful magnolia with globular sweet-scented flowers
like snow-balls, several balsams, with species of <i>Convallaria,
Cotoneaster, Gentian, Spir&aelig;a, Euphorbia, Pedicularis,</i> and
honeysuckle. On the hill-side were creeping brambles, lovely
yellow, purple, pink, and</p>

<p class="fnote">* These woods are all soft and loose in grain,
compared with their European allies.<br>
&dagger; This I have, vol. i. <a href="chap11.html#page 256">p.
256,</a> referred to the <i>J. excelsa</i> of the north-west
Himalaya, a plant which under various names is found in many parts
of Europe and many parts of Europe and North America; but since
then Dr. Thomson and I have had occasion to compare my Sikkim
conifers with the north-west Himalayan ones and we have found that
this Sikkim species is probably new, and that <i>J. excelsa</i> is
not found east of Nepal.<br>
&Dagger; Also a juniper, from Bermuda (<i>J. Bermudiana</i>).</p>

<br>

<p class="first">white primroses, white-flowered <i>Thalictrum</i>
and <i>Anemone,</i> berberry, <i>Podophyllum,</i> white rose,
fritillary, <i>Lloydia,</i> etc. On the flanks of Tukcham, in the
bed of a torrent, I gathered many very alpine plants, at the
comparatively low elevation of 10,000 feet, as dwarf willows, <i>
Pinguicula,</i> (a genus not previously found in the Himalaya), <i>
Oxyria, Adrosace, Tofieldia, Arenaria,</i> saxifrages, and two
dwarf heath-like <i>Andromedas.</i>* The rocks were all of gneiss,
with granite veins, tourmaline, and occasionally pieces of pure
plumbago.</p>

<p>Our guide had remained at Lamteng, on the plea of a sore on his
leg from leech-bites: his real object, however, was to stop a party
on their way to Tibet with madder and canes, who, had they
continued their journey, would inevitably have pointed out the road
to me. The villagers themselves now wanted to proceed to the
pasturing-grounds on the frontier; so the Phipun sent me word that
I might proceed as far as I liked up the east bank of the Zemu. I
had explored the path, and finding it practicable, and likely to
intersect a less frequented route to the frontier (that crossing
the Tekonglah pass from Bah, see <a href="chap18.html#page 13">p.
13</a>), I determined to follow it. A supply of food arrived from
Dorjiling on the 5th of June, reduced, however, to one bag of rice,
but with encouraging letters, and the assurance that more would
follow at once. My men, of whom I bad eight, behaved admirably,
although our diet had for five days chiefly consisted of <i>
Polygonum</i> (&ldquo;Pullop-bi&rdquo;), wild</p>

<p class="fnote">* Besides these, a month later, the following
flowered in profusion: scarlet <i>Buddleia?</i> gigantic lily,
yellow jasmine, <i>Aster, Potentilla,</i> several kinds of orchids,
willow-herb (<i>Epilobium</i>), purple <i>Rosc&oelig;a, Neillia,
Morina,</i> many grasses and <i>Umbellifer&aelig;.</i> These formed
a rank and dense herbaceous, mostly annual vegetation, six feet
high, bound together with <i>Cuscuta,</i> climbing <i>
Leguminos&aelig;,</i> and <i>Ceropegia.</i> The great summer heat
and moisture here favour the ascent of various tropical genera, of
which I found in August several <i>Orchide&aelig;</i> (<i>Calanthe,
Microstylis,</i> and <i>C&oelig;logyne</i>), also <i>Begonia,
Bryonia, Cynanchum, Aristolochia, Eurya, Procris,
Acanthace&aelig;,</i> and <i>Cyrtandrase&aelig;.</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 47">[ 47 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">leeks (&ldquo;Lagook&rdquo;), nettles and <i>
Procris</i> (an allied, and more succulent herb), eked out by eight
pounds of Tibet meal (&ldquo;Tsamba&rdquo;), which I had bought for
ten shillings by stealth from the villagers. What concerned me most
was the destruction of my plants by constant damp, and the want of
sun to dry the papers; which reduced my collections to a tithe of
what they would otherwise have been.</p>

<p>From Zemu Samdong the valley runs north-west, for two marches,
to the junction of the Zemu with the Thlonok, which rises on the
north-east flank of Kinchinjunga: at this place I halted for
several days, while building a bridge over the Thlonok. The path
runs first through a small forest of birch, alder, and maple, on
the latter of which I found <i>Balanophora</i>* growing abundantly:
this species produces the great knots on the maple roots, from
which the Tibetans form the cups mentioned by MM. Huc and Gabet. I
was so fortunate as to find a small store of these knots, cleaned,
and cut ready for the turner, and hidden behind a stone by some
poor Tibetan, who had never retained to the spot: they had
evidently been there a very long time.</p>

<p>In the ravines there were enormous accumulations of ice, the
result of avalanches; one of them crossed the river, forming a
bridge thirty feet thick, at an elevation of only 9,800 feet above
the sea. This ice-bridge was 100 yards broad, and flanked by heaps
of boulders, the effects of combined land and snowslips. These
stony places were covered with a rich herbage of rhubarb,
primroses, <i>Euphorbia, Sedum, Polygonum, Convallaria,</i> and a
purple <i>Dentaria</i> (&ldquo;Kenroop-bi&rdquo;) a cruciferous
plant much eaten as a pot-herb. In the pinewoods a large mushroom
(&ldquo;Onglau,&rdquo;&dagger; Tibet.) was abundant,</p>

<p class="fnote">* A curious leafless parasite, mentioned at vol.
i, <a href="chap5.html#page 133">p. 133.</a><br>
&dagger; <i>Cortinarius Emodensis</i> of the Rev. M. J. Berkeley,
who has named and described it from my specimens and drawings. It
is also called &ldquo;Yungla tchamo&rdquo; by the Tibetans, the
latter word signifying a toadstool. Mr. Berkeley informs me that
the whole vast genus <i>Cortinarius</i> scarcely possesses a single
other edible species; he adds that <i>C. violaceus</i> and <i>
violaceo-cinereus</i> are eaten in Austria and Italy, but not
always with safety.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 48">[ 48 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">which also forms a favourite article of food.
Another pot-herb (to which I was afterwards more indebted than any)
was a beautiful <i>Smilacina,</i> which grows from two to five feet
high, and has plaited leaves and crowded panicles of white
bell-shaped flowers, like those of its ally the lily of the valley,
which it also resembles in its mucilaginous properties. It is
called &ldquo;Chokli-bi,&rdquo;* and its young flower-heads,
sheathed in tender green leaves, form an excellent vegetable. Nor
must I forget to include amongst the eatable plants of this hungry
country, young shoots of the mountain-bamboo, which are good either
raw or boiled, and may be obtained up to 12,000 feet in this
valley. A species of <i>Asarum</i> (Asarabacca) grows in the
pine-woods; a genus not previously known to be Himalayan. The root,
like its English medicinal congener, has a strong and peculiar
smell. At 10,000 feet <i>Abies Webbiana</i> commences, with a close
undergrowth of a small twiggy holly. This, and the dense thicket of
rhododendron&dagger; on the banks of the river and edges of the
wood, rendered the march very fatiguing, and swarms of midges kept
up a tormenting irritation.</p>

<p>The Zemu continued an impetuous muddy torrent, whose hoarse
voice, mingled with the deep grumbling noise&Dagger; of</p>

Dorjiling.<br>

valley.<br>
&Dagger; The dull rumbling noise thus produced is one of the most
singular phenomena in these mountains, and cannot fail to strike
the observer. At night, especially, the sound seems increased, the
reason of which is not apparent, for in these regions, so wanting
in animal life, the night is no stiller than the day, and the
melting of snow being less, the volume of waters must be somewhat,
though not conspicuously, diminished. The interference of sound by
heated currents of different density is the most obvious cause of
the diminished reverberation during the day, to which Humboldt adds
the increased tension of vapour, and possibly an echo from its
particles.</p>

<p class="first">the boulders rolling along its bed, was my lullaby
for many nights. Its temperature at Zemu Samdong was 45&deg; to
46&deg; in June. At its junction with the Thlonok, it comes down a
steep gulley from the north, foreshortened into a cataract 1000
feet high, and appearing the smaller stream of the two; whilst the
Thlonok winds down from the snowy face of Kinchinjunga, which is
seen up the valley, bearing W.S.W., about twenty miles distant. All
around are lofty and rocky mountains, sparingly wooded with pines
and larch, chiefly on their south flanks, which receive the warm,
moist, up-valley winds; the faces exposed to the north being colder
and more barren: exactly the reverse of what is the case at
Choongtam, where the rocky and sunny south-exposed flanks are the
driest.</p>

<p>My tent was pitched on a broad terrace, opposite the junction of
the Zemu and Thlonok, and 10,850 feet above the sea. It was
sheltered by some enormous transported blocks of gneiss, fifteen
feet high, and surrounded by a luxuriant vegetation of most
beautiful rhododendrons in full flower, willow, white rose, white
flowered cherry, thorn, maple and birch. Some great tuberous-rooted
<i>Arums</i>* were very abundant; and the ground was covered with
small pits, in which were large wooden pestles: these are used in
the preparation of food from the arums, to which the miserable
inhabitants of the valley have recourse in spring, when their yaks
are calving. The roots are bruised with the pestles, and thrown
into these holes with water. Acetous fermentation commences in
seven or eight days, which is a sign that the acrid poisonous
principle is dissipated: the pulpy, sour, and fibrous mass is then
boiled and eaten; its nutriment</p>

&ldquo;Tong&rdquo; by the Tibetans, and &ldquo;Sinkree&rdquo; by

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">being the starch, which exists in small
quantities, and which they have not the skill to separate by
grating and washing. This preparation only keeps a few days, and
produces bowel complaints, and loss of the skin and hair,
especially when insufficiently fermented. Besides this, the
&ldquo;chokli-bi,&rdquo; and many other esculents, abounded here;
and we had great need of them before leaving this wild uninhabited
region.</p>

<p>I repeatedly ascended the north flank of Tukcham along a
watercourse, by the side of which were immense slips of rocks and
snow-beds; the mountain-side being excessively steep. Some of the
masses of gneiss thus brought down were dangerously poised on
slopes of soft shingle, and daily moved a little downwards. All the
rocks were gneiss and granite, with radiating crystals of
tourmaline as thick as the thumb. Below 12,000 to 13,000 feet the
mountain-sides were covered with a dense scrub of rhododendron
bushes, except where broken by rocks, landslips, and torrents:
above this the winter&rsquo;s snow lay deep, and black rocks and
small glaciers, over which avalanches were constantly falling with
a sullen roar, forbade all attempts to proceed. My object in
ascending was chiefly to obtain views and compass-bearings, in
which I was generally disappointed: once only I had a magnificent
prospect of Kinchinjunga, sweeping down in one unbroken mass of
glacier and ice, fully 14,000 feet high, to the head of the Thlonok
river, whose upper valley appeared a broad bay of ice; doubtless
forming one of the largest glaciers in the Himalaya, and increased
by lateral feeders that flow into it from either flank of the
valley. The south side of this (the Thlonok) valley is formed by a
range from Kinchinjunga, running east to Tukcham, where it
terminates: from it rises the beautiful mountain Liklo,* 22,582
feet</p>

<p class="fnote">* D<sup>2</sup> of the peaks laid down in Colonel
Waugh&rsquo;s &ldquo;Trigonometrical Survey from Dorjiling,&rdquo;
I believe to be the &ldquo;Liklo&rdquo; of Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s
itineraries from Dorjiling to Lhassa, compiled from the information
of the traders (See &ldquo;Bengal Asiatic Society&rsquo;s
Journal&rdquo; for 1848); the routes in which proved of the utmost
value to me.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 51">[ 51 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">high, which, from Dorjiling, appears as a sharp
peak, but is here seen to be a jagged crest running north and
south. On the north flank of the valley the mountains are more
sloping and black, with patches of snow above 15,000 feet, but
little anywhere else, except on another beautiful peak (alt. 19,240
feet) marked D<sup>3</sup> on the map. This flank is also
continuous from Kinchin; it divides Sikkim from Tibet, and runs
north-east to the great mountain Chomiomo (which was not visible),
the streams from its north flank flowing into the Arun river (in
Tibet). A beautiful blue arch of sky spanned all this range,
indicating the dry Tibetan climate beyond.</p>

<p>I made two futile attempts to ascend the Thlonok river to the
great glaciers at the foot of Kinchinjunga, following the south
bank, and hoping to find a crossing-place, and so to proceed north
to Tibet. The fall of the river is not great at this part of its
course, nor up to 12,000 feet, which was the greatest height I
could attain, and about eight miles beyond my tents; above that
point, at the base of Liklo, the bed of the valley widens, and the
rhododendron shrubbery was quite impervious, while the sides of the
mountain were inaccessible. We crossed extensive snow-beds, by
cutting holes in their steep faces, and rounded rocks in the bed of
the torrent, dragging one another through the violent current,
whose temperature was below 40&deg;.</p>

<p>On these occasions, the energy of Meepo, Nimbo (the chief of the
coolies) and the Lepcha boys, was quite remarkable, and they were
as keenly anxious to reach the holy country of Tibet as I could
possibly be. It was</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 52">[ 52 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">sometimes dark before we got back to our tents,
tired, with torn clothes and cut feet and hands, returning to a
miserable dinner of boiled herbs; but never did any of them
complain, or express a wish to leave me. In the evenings and
mornings they were always busy, changing my plants, and drying the
papers over a sulky fire at my tent-door; and at night they slept,
each wrapt in his own blanket, huddled together under a rock, with
another blanket thrown over them all. Provisions reached us so
seldom, and so reduced in quantity, that I could never allow more
than one pound of rice to each man in a day, and frequently during
this trying month they had not even that; and I eked out our meagre
supply with a few ounces of preserved meats, occasionally
&ldquo;splicing the main brace&rdquo; with weak rum and water.</p>

<p>At the highest point of the valley which I reached, water boiled
at 191&middot;3, indicating an elevation of 11,903 feet. The
temperature at 1 p.m. was nearly 70&deg;, and of the wet bulb
55&deg;, indicating a dryness of 0&middot;462, and dew point
47&middot;0. Such phenomena of heat and dryness are rare and
transient in the wet valleys of Sikkim, and show the influence here
of the Tibetan climate.*</p>

<p>After boiling my thermometer on these occasions, I generally
made a little tea for the party; a refreshment to which they looked
forward with child-like eagerness. The fairness with which these
good-hearted people used to divide the scanty allowance, and
afterwards the leaves, which are greatly relished, was an engaging
trait in their simple character: I have still vividly before me
their sleek swarthy faces and twinkling Tartar eyes, as they
lay</p>

<p class="fnote">* I gathered here, amongst an abundance of alpine
species, all of European and arctic type, a curious trefoil, the
<i>Parochetus communis,</i> which ranges through 9000 feet of
elevation on the Himalaya, and is also found in Java and
Ceylon.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 53">[ 53 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">stretched on the ground in the sun, or crouched in
the sleet and snow beneath some sheltering rock; each with his
little polished wooden cup of tea, watching my notes and
instruments with curious wonder, asking, &ldquo;How high are
we?&rdquo; &ldquo;How cold is it?&rdquo; and comparing the results
with those of other stations, with much interest and
intelligence.</p>

<p>On the 11th June, my active people completed a most ingenious
bridge of branches of trees, bound by withes of willow; by which I
crossed to the north bank, where I camped on an immense flat
terrace at the junction of the rivers, and about fifty feet above
their bed. The first step or ascent from the river is about five
feet high, and formed of water-worn boulders, pebbles, and sand,
scarcely stratified: the second, fully 1000 yards broad, is ten
feet high, and swampy. The uppermost is fifteen feet above the
second, and is covered with gigantic boulders, and vast rotting
trunks of fallen pines, buried in an impenetrable jungle of dwarf
small-leaved holly and rhododendrons. The surface was composed of a
rich vegetable mould, which, where clear of forest, supported a
rank herbage, six to eight feet high.*</p>

<p>Our first discovery, after crossing, was of a good bridge across
the Zemu, above its junction, and of a path leading</p>

<p class="fnote">* This consisted of grasses, sedges, <i>
Bupleurum,</i> rhubarb, <i>Ranunculus, Convallaria, Smilacina,</i>
nettles, thistles, <i>Arum,</i> balsams, and the superb yellow <i>
Meconopsis Nepalensis,</i> whose racemes of golden poppy-like
flowers were as broad as the palm of the hand; it grows three and
even six feet high, and resembles a small hollyhock; whilst a
stately <i>Heracleum,</i> ten feet high, towered over all. Forests
of silver fir, with junipers and larch, girdled these flats and on
their edges grew rhododendrons, scarlet <i>Spir&aelig;a,</i>
several honeysuckles, white <i>Clematis,</i> and <i>Viburnum.</i>
Ferns are much scarcer in the pine-woods than elsewhere in the
forest regions of the Himalaya. In this valley (alt. 10,850 feet),
I found only two kinds; <i>Hymenophyllum, Lomaria, Cystopteris,
Davallia,</i> two <i>Polypodia,</i> and several <i>Aspidia</i> and
<i>Asplenia. Selaginella</i> ascends to Zemu Samdong (9000 feet).
The <i>Pteris aquilina</i> (brake) does not ascend above 10,000
feet.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 54">[ 54 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">down to Zemu Samdong; this was, however, scarcely
traceable up either stream. My men were better housed here in
sheds: and I made several more ineffectual attempts to ascend the
valley to the glaciers. The path, gradually vanishing, ran
alternately through fir-woods, and over open grassy spots, covered
with vegetation, amongst which the gigantic arum was plentiful,
whose roots seemed to be the only attraction in this wet and
miserable valley.</p>

<p>On my return one day, I found my people in great alarm, the
Phipun having sent word that we were on the Tibet side of the
rivers, and that Tibetan troops were coming to plunder my goods,
and carry my men into slavery. I assured them he only wanted to
frighten them; that the Cheen soldiers were civil orderly people;
and that as long as Meepo was with us, there was no cause for fear.
Fortunately a young musk-deer soon afterwards broke cover close to
the tent, and its flesh wonderfully restored their courage: still I
was constantly harassed by threats; some of my people were
suffering from cold and bowel complaints, and I from rheumatism;
while one fine lad, who came from Dorjiling, was delirious with a
violent fever, contracted in the lower valleys, which sadly
dispirited my party.</p>

<p>Having been successful in finding a path, I took my tent and a
few active lads 1000 feet up the Zemu, camping on a high rock above
the forest region, at 12,070 feet; hoping thence to penetrate
northwards. I left my collections in the interim at the junction of
the rivers, where the sheds and an abundance of firewood were great
advantages for preserving the specimens. At this elevation we were
quite free from midges and leeches (the latter had not appeared
above 11,500 feet), but the weather continued so uniformly rainy
and bad, that we could make no progress. I repeatedly followed the
river for several miles,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 55">[ 55 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">ascending to 13,300 feet; but though its valley
widened, and its current was less rapid, the rhododendron thickets
below, and the cliffs above, defeated all endeavours to reach the
drier climate beyond, of which I had abundant evidence in the arch
of brilliant blue that spanned the heavens to the north, beyond a
black canopy of clouds that hid everything around, and poured down
rain without one day&rsquo;s intermission, during the eight which I
spent here.</p>
