<br>
<p class="first">Owing to the unsatisfactory nature of our
relations with the Sikkim authorities, to which I have elsewhere
alluded, my endeavours to procure leave to penetrate further beyond
the Dorjiling territory than Tonglo, were attended with some
trouble and delay.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1848, the Governor-General communicated with
the Rajah, desiring him to grant me honourable and safe escort
through his dominions; but this was at once met by a decided
refusal, apparently admitting of no compromise. Pending further
negotiations, which Dr. Campbell felt sure would terminate
satisfactorily, though perhaps too late for my purpose, he applied
to the Nepal Rajah for permission for me to visit the Tibetan
passes, west of Kinchinjunga; proposing in the meanwhile to</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 178">[ 178 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">arrange for my return through Sikkim. Through the
kindness of Col. Thoresby, the Resident at that Court, and the
influence of Jung Bahadoor, this request was promptly acceded to,
and a guard of six Nepalese soldiers and two officers was sent to
Dorjiling to conduct me to any part of the eastern districts of
Nepal which I might select. I decided upon following up the Tambur,
a branch of the Arun river, and exploring the two easternmost of
the Nepalese passes into Tibet (Wallanchoon and Kanglachem), which
would bring me as near to the central mass and loftiest part of the
eastern flank of Kinchinjunga as possible.</p>

<p>For this expedition (which occupied three months), all the
arrangements were undertaken for me by Dr. Campbell, who aforded me
every facility which in his government position he could command,
besides personally superintending the equipment and provisioning of
my party. Taking horses or loaded animals of any kind was not
expedient: the whole journey was to be performed on foot, and
everything carried on men&rsquo;s backs. As we were to march
through wholly unexplored countries, where food was only procurable
at uncertain intervals, it was necessary to engage a large body of
porters, some of whom should carry bags of rice for the coolies and
themselves too. The difficulty of selecting these carriers, of whom
thirty were required, was very great. The Lepchas, the best and
most tractable, and over whom Dr. Campbell had the most direct
influence, disliked employment out of Sikkim, especially in so
warlike a country as Nepal: and they were besides thought unfit for
the snowy regions. The Nepalese, of whom there were many residing
as British subjects in Dorjiling, were mostly run-aways from their
own country, and afraid of being claimed, should they return to it,
by the lords of the soil. To employ Limboos, Moormis,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 179">[ 179 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Hindoos, or other natives of low elevations, was
out of the question; and no course appeared advisable but to engage
some of the Bhotan run-aways domiciled in Dorjiling, who are
accustomed to travel at all elevations, and fear nothing but a
return to the country which they have abandoned as slaves, or as
culprits: they are immensely powerful, and though intractable to
the last degree, are generally glad to work and behave well for
money. The choice, as will hereafter be seen, was unfortunate,
though at the time unanimously approved.</p>

<p>My party mustered fifty-six persons. These consisted of myself,
and one personal servant, a Portuguese half-caste, who undertook
all offices, and spared me the usual train of Hindoo and Mahometan
servants. My tent and equipments (for which I was greatly indebted
to Mr. Hodgson), instruments, bed, box of clothes, books and
papers, required a man for each. Seven more carried my papers for
drying plants, and other scientific stores. The Nepalese guard had
two coolies of their own. My interpreter, the coolie Sirdar (or
headman), and my chief plant collector (a Lepcha), had a man each.
Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s bird and animal shooter, collector, and
stuffer, with their ammunition and indispensables, had four more;
there were besides, three Lepcha lads to climb trees and change the
plant-papers, who had long been in my service in that capacity; and
the party was completed by fourteen Bhotan coolies laden with food,
consisting chiefly of rice with ghee, oil, capsicums, salt, and
flour.</p>

<p>I carried myself a small barometer, a large knife and digger for
plants, note-book, telescope, compass, and other instruments;
whilst two or three Lepcha lads who accompanied me as satellites,
carried a botanising box, thermometers, sextant and artificial
horizon, measuring-tape,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 180">[ 180 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">azimuth compass and stand, geological hammer,
bottles and boxes for insects, sketch-book, etc., arranged in
compartments of strong canvass bags. The Nepal officer (of the rank
of serjeant, I believe) always kept near me with one of his men,
rendering innumerable little services. Other sepoys were
distributed amongst the remainder of the party; one went ahead to
prepare camping-ground, and one brought up the rear.</p>

<p>The course generally pursued by Himalayan travellers is to march
early in the morning, and arrive at the camping-ground before or by
noon, breakfasting before starting, or <i>en route.</i> I never
followed this plan, because it sacrificed the mornings, which were
otherwise profitably spent in collecting about camp; whereas, if I
set off early, I was generally too tired with the day&rsquo;s march
to employ in any active pursuit the rest of the daylight, which in
November only lasted till 6 p.m. The men breakfasted early in the
morning, I somewhat later, and all had started by 10 a.m., arriving
between 4 and 6 p.m. at the next camping-ground. My tent was formed
of blankets, spread over cross pieces of wood and a ridge-pole,
enclosing an area of 6 to 8 feet by 4 to 6 feet. The bedstead,
table, and chair were always made by my Lepchas, as described in
the Tonglo excursion. The evenings I employed in writing up notes
and journals, plotting maps, and ticketing the plants collected
during the day&rsquo;s march.</p>

<p>I left Dorjiling at noon, on the 27th October, accompanied by
Dr. Campbell, who saw me fairly off, the coolies having preceded
me. Our direct route would have been over Tonglo, but the threats
of the Sikkim authorities rendered it advisable to make for Nepal
at once; we therefore kept west along the Goong ridge, a western
prolongation of Sinchul.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 181">[ 181 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">On overtaking the coolies, I proceeded for six or
seven miles along a zig-zag road, at about 7,500 feet elevation,
through dense forests, and halted at a little hut within sight of
Dorjiling. Rain and mist came on at nightfall, and though several
parties of my servants arrived, none of the Bhotan coolies made
their appearance, and I spent the night without food or bed, the
weather being much too foggy and dark to send back to meet the
missing men. They joined me late on the following day, complaining
unreasonably of their loads, and without their Sirdar, who, after
starting his crew, had returned to take leave of his wife and
family. On the following day he appeared, and after due
admonishment we started, but four miles further on were again
obliged to halt for the Bhotan coolies, who were equally deaf to
threats and entreaties. As they did not come up till dusk, we were
obliged to encamp here, (alt. 7,400 feet) at the common source of
the Balasun, which flows to the plains, and the Little Rungeet,
whose course is north.</p>

<p>The contrast between the conduct of the Bhotan men and that of
the Lepchas and Nepalese was so marked, that I seriously debated in
my own mind the propriety of sending the former back to Dorjiling,
but yielded to the remonstrances of their Sirdar and the Nepal
guard, who represented the great difficulty we should have in
replacing them, and above all, the loss of time, at this season a
matter of great importance. We accordingly started again the
following morning, and still keeping in a western direction,
crossed the posts in the forest dividing Sikkim from Nepal, and
descended into the Myong valley of the latter country, through
which flows the river of that name, a tributary of the Tambur. The
Myong valley is remarkably fine: it runs south-west from Tonglo,
and its open</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 182">[ 182 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">character and general fertility contrast strongly
with the bareness of the lower mountain spurs which flank it, and
with the dense, gloomy, steep, and forest-clad gorges of Sikkim. At
its lower end, about twenty miles from the frontier, is the
military fort of Ilam, a celebrated stockaded post and cantonment
of the Ghorkas: its position is marked by a conspicuous conical
hill. The inhabitants are chiefly Brahmins, but there are also some
Moormis, and a few Lepchas who escaped from Sikkim during the
general massacre in 1825. Among these is a man who had formerly
much influence in Sikkim; he still retains his title of Kazee,* and
has had large lands assigned to him by the Nepalese Government: he
sent the usual present of a kid, fowls, and eggs, and begged me to
express to Dr. Campbell his desire to return to his native country,
and settle at Dorjiling.</p>

<p>The scenery of this valley is the most beautiful I know of in
the lower Himalaya, and the Cheer Pine (<i>P. longifolia</i>) is
abundant, cresting the hills; which are loosely clothed with clumps
of oaks and other trees, bamboos, and bracken (<i>Pteris</i>). The
slopes are covered with red clay, and separate little ravines
luxuriantly clothed with tropical vegetation, amongst which flow
pebbly streams of transparent cool water. The villages, which are
merely scattered collections of huts, are surrounded with fields of
rice, buckwheat, and Indian corn, which latter the natives were now
storing in little granaries, mounted on four posts, men, women, and
children being all equally busy. The quantity of gigantic nettles
(<i>Urtica heterophylla</i>) on the skirts of these maize fields is
quite wonderful: their long white stings look most formidable, but
though they sting</p>

<p class="fnote">* This Mahometan title, by which the officers of
state are known in Sikkim, is there generally pronounced Kajee.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 183">[ 183 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">virulently, the pain only lasts half an hour or
so. These, however, with leeches, mosquitos, peepsas, and ticks,
sometimes keep the traveller in a constant state of irritation.</p>

<p>However civilised the Hindoo may be in comparison with the
Lepcha, he presents a far less attractive picture to the casual
observer; he comes to your camping-ground, sits down, and stares
with all his might, but offers no assistance; if he bring a present
at all, he expects a return on the spot, and goes on begging till
satisfied. I was amused by the cool way in which my Ghorka guard
treated the village lads, when they wanted help in my service,
taking them by the shoulder, pulling out their knives for them,
placing them in their bands, and setting them to cut down a tree,
or to chop firewood, which they seldom refused to do, when a little
such douce violence was applied.</p>

<p>My object being to reach the Tambur, north of the great east and
west mountain ridge of Sakkiazung, without crossing the innumerable
feeders of the Myong and their dividing spurs, we ascended the
north flank of the valley to a long spur from Tonglo, intending to
follow winding ridges of that mountain to the sources of the Pemmi
at the Phulloot mountains, and thence descend.</p>

<p>On the 3rd November I encamped on the flank of Tonglo (called
Nanki in Nepal), at 9,300 feet, about 700 feet below the western
summit, which is rocky, and connected by a long flat ridge with
that which I had visited in the previous May. The Bhotan coolies
behaved worse than ever; their conduct being in all respects
typical of the turbulent, mulish race to which they belong. They
had been plundering my provisions as they went along, and neither
their Sirdar nor the Ghorka soldiers</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 184">[ 184 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">had the smallest authority over them. I had hired
some Ghorka coolies to assist and eventually to replace them, and
had made up my mind to send back the worst from the more populous
banks of the Tambur, when I was relieved by their making off of
their own accord. The dilemma was however awkward, as it was
impossible to procure men on the top of a mountain 10,000 feet
high, or to proceed towards Phulloot. No course remained but to
send to Dorjiling for others, or to return to the Myong valley, and
take a more circuitous route over the west end of Sakkiazung, which
led through villages from which I could procure coolies day by day.
I preferred the latter plan, and sent one of the soldiers to the
nearest village for assistance to bring the loads down, halting a
day for that purpose.</p>

<p>From the summit of Tonglo I enjoyed the view I had so long
desired of the Snowy Himalaya, from north-east to north-west;
Sikkim being on the right, Nepal on the left, and the plains of
India to the southward; and I procured a set of compass bearings,
of the greatest use in mapping the country. In the early morning
the transparency of the atmosphere renders this view one of
astonishing grandeur. Kinchinjunga bore nearly due north, a
dazzling mass of snowy peaks, intersected by blue glaciers, which
gleamed in the slanting rays of the rising sun, like aquamarines
set in frosted silver. From this the sweep of snowed mountains to
the eastward was almost continuous as far as Chola (bearing
east-north-east), following a curve of 150 miles, and enclosing the
whole of the northern part of Sikkim, which appeared a billowy mass
of forest-clad mountains. On the north-east horizon rose the Donkia
mountain (23,176 feet), and Chumulari (23,929). Though both were
much more distant than the snowy ranges,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 185">[ 185 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">being respectively eighty and ninety miles off,
they raised their gigantic heads above, seeming what they really
were, by far the loftiest peaks next to Kinchinjunga; and the
perspective of snow is so deceptive, that though 40 to 60 miles
beyond, they appeared as though almost in the same line with the
ridges they overtopped. Of these mountains, Chumulari presents many
attractions to the geographer, from its long disputed position, its
sacred character, and the interest attached to it since
Turner&rsquo;s mission to Tibet in 1783. It was seen and recognised
by Dr. Campbell, and measured by Colonel Waugh, from Sinchul, and
also from Tonglo, and was a conspicuous object in my subsequent
journey to Tibet. Beyond Junnoo, one of the western peaks of
Kinchinjunga, there was no continuous snowy chain; the Himalaya
seemed suddenly to decline into black and rugged peaks, till in the
far north-west it rose again in a white mountain mass of stupendous
elevation at 80 miles distance, called, by my Nepal people,
&ldquo;Tsungau.&rdquo;* From the bearings I took of it from several
positions, it is in about lat. 27&deg; 49&prime; and long. 86&deg;
24&prime;, and is probably on the west flank of the Arun valley and
river, which latter, in its course from Tibet to the plains of
India, receives the waters from the west flank of Kinchinjunga, and
from the east flank of the mountain in question. It is perhaps one
which has been seen and measured from the Tirhoot district by some
of Colonel Waugh&rsquo;s party, and which has been reported to be
upwards of 28,000 feet in elevation; and it is the only mountain of
the first class in magnitude between Gosainthan (north-east of
Katmandoo) and Kinchinjunga.</p>

<p class="fnote">* This is probably the easternmost and loftiest
peak seen from Katmandoo, distant 78 miles, and estimated elevation
20,117 feet by Col. Crawford&rsquo;s observations. See
&ldquo;Hamilton&rsquo;s Nepal,&rdquo; p. 346, and plate 1.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 186">[ 186 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">To the west, the black ridge of Sakkiazung,
bristling with pines, (<i>Abies Webbiana</i>) cut off the view of
Nepal; but south-west, the Myong valley could be traced to its
junction with the Tambur about thirty miles off: beyond which to
the south-west and south, low hills belonging to the outer ranges
of Nepal rose on the distant horizon, seventy or eighty miles off;
and of these the most conspicuous were the Mahavarati which skirt
the Nepal Terai. South and south-east, Sinchul and the Goong range
of Sikkim intercepted the view of the plains of India, of which I
had a distant peep to the south-west only.</p>

<p>The west top of Tonglo is very open and grassy, with occasional
masses of gneiss of enormous size, but probably not in situ. The
whole of this flank, and for 1000 feet down the spur to the
south-west, had been cleared by fire for pasturage, and flocks of
black-faced sheep were grazing. During my stay on the mountain,
except in the early morning, the weather was bleak, gloomy, and
very cold, with a high south-west wind. The mean temperature was
41&deg;, extremes 53&middot;2/26&deg;: the nights were very clear,
with sharp hoar-frost; the radiating thermometer sank to 21&deg;,
the temperature at 3&middot;5 feet depth was 51&middot;5&deg;.</p>

<p>A few of the Bhotan coolies having voluntarily returned, I left
Tonglo on the 5th, and descended its west flank to the Mai, a
feeder of the Myong. The descent was as abrupt as that on the east
face, but through less dense forest; the Sikkim side (that facing
the east) being much the dampest. I encamped at dark by a small
village, (Jummanoo) at 4,360 feet, having descended 5000 feet in
five hours. Hence we marched eastward to the village of Sakkiazung,
which we reached on the third day, crossing <i>en route</i> several
spurs 4000 to 6000 feet high, from the same ridge, and as many
rivers, which all fall</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 187">[ 187 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">into the Myong, and whose beds are elevated from
2,500 to 3000 feet.</p>

<p>Though rich and fertile, the country is scantily populated, and
coolies were procured with difficulty: I therefore sent back to
Dorjiling all but absolute indispensables, and on the 9th of
November started up the ridge in a northerly direction, taking the
road from Ilam to Wallanchoon. The ascent was gradual, through a
fine forest, full of horn-bills (<i>Buceros</i>), a bird resembling
the Toucan (&ldquo;Dhunass&rdquo; Lepcha); at 7000 feet an oak
(<i>Quercus semecarpifolia</i>), &ldquo;Khasrou&rdquo; of the
Nepalese, commences, a tree which is common as far west as Kashmir,
but which I never found in Sikkim, though it appears again in
Bhotan.* No oak in Sikkim attains a greater elevation than 10,000.]
It forms a broad-headed tree, and has a very handsome appearance;
its favourite locality is on grassy open shoulders of the
mountains. It was accompanied by an <i>Astragalus, Geranium,</i>
and several other plants of the drier interior parts of Sikkim.
Water is very scarce along the ridge; we walked fully eight miles
without finding any, and were at length obliged to encamp at 8,350
feet by the only spring that we should be able to reach. With
respect to drought, this ridge differs materially from Sikkim,
where water abounds at all elevations; and the cause is obviously
its position to the westward of the great ridge of Singalelah
(including Tonglo) by which the S.W. currents are drained of their
moisture. Here again, the east flank was much the dampest and most
luxuriantly wooded.</p>

<p>While my men encamped on a very narrow ridge, I ascended a rocky
summit, composed of great blocks of gneiss, from which I obtained a
superb view to the westward. Immediately below a fearfully sudden
descent, ran</p>

<p class="fnote">* This oak ascends in the N.W. Himalaya to the
highest limit of forest (12,000 feet).</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 188">[ 188 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the Daomy River, bounded on the opposite side by
another parallel ridge of Sakkiazung, enclosing, with that on which
I stood, a gulf from 6000 to 7000 feet deep, of wooded ridges,
which, as it were, radiated outwards as they ascended upwards in
rocky spurs to the pine-clad peaks around. To the south-west, in
the extreme distance, were the boundless plains of India, upwards
of 100 miles off, with the Cosi meandering through them like a
silver thread.</p>

<p>The firmament appeared of a pale steel blue, and a broad low
arch spanned the horizon, bounded by a line of little fleecy clouds
(moutons); below this the sky was of a golden yellow, while in
successively deeper strata, many belts or ribbons of vapour
appeared to press upon the plains, the lowest of which was of a
dark leaden hue, the upper more purple, and vanishing into the pale
yellow above. Though well defined, there was no abrupt division
between the belts, and the lowest mingled imperceptibly with the
hazy horizon. Gradually the golden lines grew dim, and the blues
and purples gained depth of colour; till the sun set behind the
dark-blue peaked mountains in a flood of crimson and purple,
sending broad beams of grey shade and purple light up to the
zenith, and all around. As evening advanced, a sudden chill
succeeded, and mists rapidly formed immediately below me in little
isolated clouds, which coalesced and spread out like a heaving and
rolling sea, leaving nothing above their surface but the ridges and
spurs of the adjacent mountains. These rose like capes,
promontories, and islands, of the darkest leaden hue, bristling
with pines, and advancing boldly into the snowy white ocean, or
starting from its bed in the strongest relief. As darkness came on,
and the stars arose, a light fog gathered round me, and I quitted
with reluctance one of the most impressive and magic scenes I ever
beheld.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 189">[ 189 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Returning to my tent, I was interested in observing how well my
followers had accommodated themselves to their narrow
circumstances. Their fires gleamed everywhere amongst the trees,
and the people, broken up into groups of five, presented an
interesting picture of native, savage, and half-civilised life. I
wandered amongst them in the darkness, and watched unseen their
operations; some were cooking, with their rude bronzed faces
lighted up by the ruddy glow, as they peered into the pot, stirring
the boiling rice with one hand, while with the other they held back
their long tangled hair. Others were bringing water from the spring
below, some gathering sprigs of fragrant <i>Artemisia</i> and other
shrubs to form couches&mdash;some lopping branches of larger trees
to screen them from nocturnal radiation; their only protection from
the dew being such branches stuck in the ground, and slanting over
their procumbent forms. The Bhotanese were rude and boisterous in
their pursuits, constantly complaining to the Sirdars, and
wrangling over their meals. The Ghorkas were sprightly, combing
their raven hair, telling interminably long stories, of which money
was the burthen, or singing Hindoo songs through their noses in
chorus; and being neater and better dressed, and having a servant
to cook their food, they seemed quite the gentlemen of the party.
Still the Lepcha was the most attractive, the least restrained, and
the most natural in all his actions, the simplest in his wants and
appliances, with a bamboo as his water-jug, an earthen-pot as his
kettle, and all manner of herbs collected during the day&rsquo;s
march to flavour his food.</p>

<p>My tent was made of a blanket thrown over the limb of a tree; to
this others were attached, and the whole was supported on a frame
like a house. One half was occupied by my bedstead, beneath which
was stowed my box of</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 190">[ 190 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">clothes, while my books and writing materials were
placed under the table. The barometer hung in the most
out-of-the-way corner, and my other instruments all around. A small
candle was burning in a glass shade, to keep the draught and
insects from the light, and I had the comfort of seeing the knife,
fork, and spoon laid on a white napkin, as I entered my snug little
house, and flung myself on the elastic couch to ruminate on the
proceedings of the day, and speculate on those of the morrow, while
waiting for my meal, which usually consisted of stewed meat and
rice, with biscuits and tea. My thermometers (wet and dry bulb, and
minimum) hung under a temporary canopy made of thickly plaited
bamboo and leaves close to the tent, and the cooking was performed
by my servant under a tree.</p>

<p>After dinner my occupations were to ticket and put away the
plants collected during the day, write up journals, plot maps, and
take observations till 10 p.m. As soon as I was in bed, one of the
Nepal soldiers was accustomed to enter, spread his blanket on the
ground, and sleep there as my guard. In the morning the collectors
were set to change the plant-papers, while I explored the
neighbourhood, and having taken observations and breakfasted, we
were ready to start at 10 a.m.</p>

<p>Following the same ridge, after a few miles of ascent over much
broken gneiss rock, the Ghorkas led me aside to the top of a knoll,
9,300 feet high, covered with stunted bushes, and commanding a
splendid view to the west, of the broad, low, well cultivated
valley of the Tambur, and the extensive town of Dunkotah on its
banks, about twenty-five miles off; the capital of this part of
Nepal, and famous for its manufactory of paper from the bark of the
<i>Daphne.</i> Hence too I gained a fine view of the plains of
India, including the course of the Cosi river, which, receiving
the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Arun and Tambur, debouches into the Ganges
opposite Colgongl (see <a href="chap4.html#page 95">p.95</a>).</p>

<p>A little further on we crossed the main ridge of Sakkiazung, a
long flexuous chain stretching for miles to the westward from
Phulloot on Singalelah, and forming the most elevated and
conspicuous transverse range in this part of Nepal: its streams
flow south to the Myong, and north to feeders of the Tambur. Silver
firs (<i>Abies Webbiana</i>) are found on all the summits; but to
my regret none occurred in our path, which led just below their
limit (10,000 feet), on the southern Himalayan ranges. There were,
however, a few yews, exactly like the English. The view that opened
on cresting this range was again magnificent, of Kinchinjunga, the
western snows of Nepal, and the valley of the Tambur winding
amongst wooded and cultivated hills to a long line of black-peaked,
rugged mountains, sparingly snowed, which intervene between
Kinchinjunga and the great Nepal mountain before mentioned. The
extremely varied colouring on the infinite number of hill-slopes
that everywhere intersected the Tambur valley was very pleasing.
For fully forty miles to the northward there were no lofty
forest-clad mountains, nor any apparently above 4000 to 5000 feet:
villages and hamlets appeared everywhere, with crops of golden
mustard and purple buckwheat in full flower; yellow rice and maize,
green hemp, pulse, radishes, and barley, and brown millet. Here and
there deep groves of oranges, the broad-leafed banana, and
sugar-cane, skirted the bottoms of the valleys, through which the
streams were occasionally seen, rushing in white foam over their
rocky beds. It was a goodly sight to one who had for his only
standard of comparison the view from Sinchul, of the gloomy
forest-clad ranges of 6000 to 10,000 feet, that intervene between
that mountain and the snowy girdle of Sikkim;</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 192">[ 192 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">though I question whether a traveller from more
favoured climes would see more in this, than a thinly inhabited
country, with irregular patches of poor cultivation, a vast amount
of ragged forest on low hills of rather uniform height and contour,
relieved by a dismal back-ground of frowning black mountains,
sprinkled with snow! Kinchinjunga was again the most prominent
object to the north-east, with its sister peaks of Kubra (24,005
feet), and Junnoo (25,312 feet). All these presented bare
cliff&rsquo;s for several thousand feet below their summits,
composed of white rock with a faint pink tint:&mdash;on the other
hand the lofty Nepal mountain in the far west presented cliffs of
black rocks. From the summit two routes to the Tambur presented
themselves; one, the main road, led west and south along the ridge,
and then turned north, descending to the river; the other was
shorter, leading abruptly down to the Pemmi river, and thence along
its banks, west to the Tambur. I chose the latter.</p>

<p>The descent was very abrupt on the first day, from 9,500 feet to
5000 feet, and on that following to the bed of the Pemmi, at 2000
feet; and the road was infamously bad, generally consisting of a
narrow, winding, rocky path among tangled shrubs and large
boulders, brambles, nettles, and thorny bushes, often in the bed of
the torrent, or crossing spurs covered with forest, round whose
bases it flowed. A little cultivation was occasionally met with on
the narrow flat pebbly terraces which fringed the stream, usually
of rice, and sometimes of the small-leaved variety of hemp
(<i>Cannabis</i>), grown as a narcotic.</p>

<p>The rocks above 5000 feet were gneiss; below this, cliffs of
very micaceous schist were met with, having a north-west strike,
and being often vertical; the boulders again were always of gneiss.
The streams seemed rather to occupy faults, than to have eroded
courses for themselves;</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 193">[ 193 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">their beds were invariably rocky or pebbly, and
the waters white and muddy from the quantity of alumina. In one
little rocky dell the water gushed through a hole in a soft stratum
in the gneiss; a trifling circumstance which was not lost upon the
crafty Brahmins, who had cut a series of regular holes for the
water, ornamented the rocks with red paint, and a row of little
iron tridents of Siva, and dedicated the whole to Mahadeo.</p>

<p>In some spots the vegetation was exceedingly fine, and several
large trees occurred: I measured a Toon (<i>Cedrela</i>) thirty
feet in girth at five feet above the ground. The skirts of the
forest were adorned with numerous jungle flowers, rice crops, blue
<i>Acanthace&aelig;</i> and <i>Pavetta,</i> wild cherry-trees
covered with scarlet blossoms, and trees of the purple and lilac
<i>Bauhinia</i>; while <i>Thunbergia, Convolvulus,</i> and other
climbers, hung in graceful festoons from the boughs, and on the dry
micaceous rocks the <i>Luculia gratissima,</i> one of our common
hot-house ornaments, grew in profusion, its gorgeous heads of
blossoms scenting the air.</p>

<p>At the junction of the Pemmi and Khawa rivers, there are high
rocks of mica-slate, and broad river-terraces of stratified sand
and pebbles, apparently alternating with deposits of shingle. On
this hot, open expanse, elevated 2250 feet, appeared many trees and
plants of the Terai and plains, as pomegranate, peepul, and sal;
with extensive fields of cotton, indigo, and irrigated rice.</p>

<p>We followed the north bank of the Khawa, which runs westerly
through a gorge, between high cliffs of chlorite, containing thick
beds of stratified quartz. At the angles of the river broad
terraces are formed, fifteen to thirty feet above its bed, similar
to those just mentioned, and planted with rows of <i>Acacia
Serissa,</i> or laid out in rice fields, or sugar plantations.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 194">[ 194 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I reached the east bank of the Tambur, on the 13th of November,
at its junction with the Khawa, in a deep gorge. It formed a grand
stream, larger than the Teesta, of a pale, sea-green, muddy colour,
and flowed rapidly with a strong ripple, but no foam; it rises six
feet in the rains, but ice never descends nearly so low; its
breadth was sixty to eighty yards, its temperature 55&deg; to
58&deg;. The breadth of the foaming Khawa was twelve to fifteen
yards, and its temperature 56&middot;5&deg;. The surrounding
vegetation was entirely tropical, consisting of scrubby sal trees,
acacia, <i>Grislea, Emblica, Hibiscus,</i> etc.; the elevation
being but 1,300 feet, though the spot was twenty-five miles in a
straight line from the plains. I camped at the fork of the rivers,
on a fine terrace fifty feet above the water, about seventy yards
long, and one hundred broad, quite flat-topped, and composed of
shingle, gravel, etc., with enormous boulders of gneiss, quartz,
and hornstone, much water-worn; it was girt by another broken
terrace, twelve feet or so above the water, and covered with long
grass and bushes.</p>

<p>The main road from Ilam to Wallanchoon, which I quitted on
Sakkiazung, descends steeply on the opposite bank of the river,
which I crossed in a canoe formed of a hollow trunk (of Toon),
thirty feet long. There is considerable traffic along this road;
and I was visited by numbers of natives, all Hindoos, who coolly
squatted before my tent-door, and stared with their large black,
vacant, lustrous eyes: they appear singularly indolent, and great
beggars.</p>

<p>The land seems highly favoured by nature, and the population,
though so scattered, is in reality considerable, the varied
elevation giving a large surface; but the natives care for no more
than will satisfy their immediate wants. The river swarms with
fish, but they are too lazy to catch them, and they have seldom
anything better to give or sell</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 195">[ 195 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">than sticks of sugar-cane, which when peeled form
a refreshing morsel in these scorching marches. They have few and
poor oranges, citrons, and lemons, very bad plantains, and but
little else;&mdash;eggs, fowls, and milk are all scarce. Horned
cattle are of course never killed by Hindoos, and it was but seldom
that I could replenish my larder with a kid. Potatos are unknown,
but my Sepoys often brought me large coarse radishes and
legumes.</p>

<p>From the junction of the rivers the road led up the Tambur to
Mywa Guola; about sixteen miles by the river, but fully
thirty-five, as we wound, ascended, and descended, during three
days&rsquo; marches. We were ferried across the stream in a canoe
much ruder than that of the New Zealander. I watched my party
crossing by boat-loads of fifteen each; the Bhotan men hung little
scraps of rags on the bushes before embarking, the votive offerings
of a Booddhist throughout central Asia;&mdash;the Lepcha, less
civilised, scooped up a little water in the palm of his hand, and
scattered it about, invoking the river god of his simple creed.</p>

<p>We always encamped upon gravelly terraces a few feet above the
river, which flows in a deep gorge; its banks are very steep for
600 feet above the stream, though the mountains which flank it do
not exceed 4000 to 5000 feet: this is a constant phenomenon in the
Himalaya, and the roads, when low and within a few hundred feet of
the river, are in consequence excessively steep and difficult; it
would have been impossible to have taken ponies along that we
followed, which was often not a foot broad, running along very
steep cliffs, at a dizzy height above the river, and engineered
with much trouble and ingenuity: often the bank was abandoned
altogether, and we ascended several thousand feet to descend again.
Owing to the steepness of these banks, and the reflected</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 196">[ 196 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">heat, the valley, even at this season, was
excessively hot and close during the day, even when the temperature
was below 70&deg;, and tempered by a brisk breeze which rushes
upwards from sunrise to sunset. The sun at this season does not, in
many places, reach the bottom of these valleys until 10 a.m., and
is off again by 3 p.m.; and the radiation to a clear sky is so
powerful that dew frequently forms in the shade, throughout the
day, and it is common at 10 a.m. to find the thermometer sink from
70&deg; in a sheltered spot, dried by the sun, to 40&deg; in the
shade close by, where the sun has not yet penetrated. Snow never
falls.</p>

<p>The rocks throughout this part of the river-course are
mica-schists (strike north-west, dip south-west 70&deg;, but very
variable in inclination and direction); they are dry and grassy,
and the vegetation wholly tropical, as is the entomology, which
consists chiefly of large butterflies, <i>Mantis</i> and <i>
Diptera.</i> Snowy mountains are rarely seen, and the beauty of the
scenery is confined to the wooded banks of the main stream, which
flows at an average inclination of fifty feet to the mile. Otters
are found in the stream, and my party shot two, but could not
procure them.</p>

</center>

<p>In one place the road ascended for 2000 feet above the river, to
the village of Chingtam, situated on a lofty spur of the west bank,
whence I obtained a grand view of the upper course of the river,
flowing in a tremendous chasm, flanked by well-cultivated hills,
and emerging fifteen miles to the northward, from black mountains
of savage grandeur, whose rugged, precipitous faces were streaked
with snow, and the tops of the lower ones crowned with the
tabular-branched silver-fir, contrasting strongly with the tropical
luxuriance around. Chingtam is an extensive village, covering an
area of two miles, and surrounded with abundant</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 197">[ 197 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">cultivation; the houses, which are built in
clusters, are of wood, or wattle and mud, with grass thatch. The
villagers, though an indolent, staring race, are quiet and
respectable; the men are handsome, the women, though less so, often
good-looking. They have fine cattle, and excellent crops.</p>

<p>Immediately above Chingtam, the Tambur is joined by a large
affluent from the west, the Mywa, which is crossed by an excellent
iron bridge, formed of loops hanging from two parallel chains,
along which is laid a plank of sal timber. Passing through the
village, we camped on a broad terrace, from sixty to seventy feet
above the junction of the rivers, whose beds are 2100 feet above
the sea.</p>

<p>Mywa Guola (or bazaar) is a large village and mart, frequented
by Nepalese and Tibetans, who bring salt, wool, gold, musk, and
blankets, to exchange for rice, coral, and other commodities; and a
custom-house officer is stationed there, with a few soldiers. The
houses are of wood, and well built: the public ones are large, with
verandahs, and galleries of carved wood; the workmanship is of
Chinese character, and inferior to that of Katmandoo; but in the
same style, and quite unlike anything I had previously seen.</p>

<p>The river-terrace is in all respects similar to that at the
junction of the Tambur and Khawa, but very extensive: the stones it
contained were of all sizes, from a nut to huge boulders upwards of
fifteen feet long, of which many strewed the surface, while others
were in the bed of the river: all were of gneiss, quartz, and
granite, and had doubtless been transported from great elevations,
as the rocks <i>in situ</i>&mdash;both here and for several
thousand feet higher up the river&mdash;were micaceous schists,
dipping in various directions, and at all angles, with, however, a
general strike to the north-west.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 198">[ 198 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was here overtaken by a messenger with letters from Dr.
Campbell, announcing that the Sikkim Rajah had disavowed the
refusal to the Governor-General&rsquo;s letter, and authorising me
to return through any part of Sikkim I thought proper. The bearer
was a Lepcha attached to the court: his dress was that of a
superior person, being a scarlet jacket over a white cotton dress,
the breadth of the blue stripes of which generally denotes wealth;
he was accompanied by a sort of attache, who wore a magnificent
pearl and gold ear-ring, and carried his master&rsquo;s bow, as
well as a basket on his back; while an attendant coolie bore their
utensils and food. Meepo, or Teshoo (in Tibetan, Mr.), Meepo, as he
was usually called, soon attached himself to me, and proved an
active, useful, and intelligent companion, guide, and often
collector, during many months afterwards.</p>

<p>The vegetation round Mywa Guola is still thoroughly tropical:
the banyan is planted, and thrives tolerably, the heat being great
during the day. Like the whole of the Tambur valley below 4000
feet, and especially on these flats, the climate is very malarious
before and after the rains; and I was repeatedly applied to by
natives suffering under attacks of fever. During the two days I
halted, the mean temperature was 60&deg; (extremes,
80&deg;/41&deg;), that of the Tambur, 53&deg;, and of the Mywa,
56&deg;; each varying a few&deg; (the smaller stream the most)
between sunrise and 4 p.m.: the sunk thermometer was 72&deg;.</p>

<p>As we should not easily be able to procure food further on, I
laid in a full stock here, and distributed blankets, etc.,
sufficient for temporary use for all the people, dividing them into
groups or messes.</p>
