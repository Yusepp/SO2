<br>
<p class="first">Since his confinement, Dr. Campbell had been
desired to attend the Durbar for the purpose of transacting
business, but had refused to go, except by compulsion, considering
that in the excited state of the authorities, amongst whom there
was not one person of responsibility or judgment, his presence
would not only be useless, but he might be exposed to further
insult or possibly violence.</p>

<p>On the 15th of November we were informed that the Dewan was on
his way from Tibet: of this we were glad, for knave as he was, we
had hitherto considered him to possess sense and understanding. His
agents were beginning to find out their mistake, and summoned
to</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 216">[ 216 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">council the principal Lamas and Kajees of the
country, who, to a man, repudiated the proceedings, and refused to
attend. Our captors were extremely anxious to induce us to write
letters to Dorjiling, and sent spies of all kinds to offer us
facilities for secret correspondence. The simplicity and clumsiness
with which these artifices were attempted would have been ludicrous
under other circumstances; while the threat of murdering Campbell
only alarmed us, inasmuch as it came from people too stupid to be
trusted. We made out that all Sikkim people were excluded from
Dorjiling, and the Amlah consequently could not conceal their
anxiety to know what had befallen their letters to government.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we were but scantily fed, and our imprisoned coolies
got nothing at all. Our guards, were supplied with a handful of
rice or meal as the day&rsquo;s allowance; they were consequently
grumbling,* and were daily reduced in number. The supplies of rice
from the Terai, beyond Dorjiling, were cut off by the interruption
of communication, and the authorities evidently could not hold us
long at this rate: we sent up complaints, but of course received no
answer.</p>

<p>The Dewan arrived in the afternoon in great state; carried in an
English chair given him by Campbell some years before, habited in a
blue silk cloak lined with lambskin, and wearing an enormous straw
hat with a red tassel,</p>

<p class="fnote">* The Rajah has no standing army; not even a
body-guard, and these men were summoned to Tumloong before our
arrival: they had no arms and received no pay, but were fed when
called out on duty. There is no store for grain, no bazaar or
market, in any part of the country, each family growing little
enough for its own wants and no more; consequently Sikkim could not
stand on the defensive for a week. The Rajah receives his supply of
grain in annual contributions from the peasantry, who thus pay a
rent in kind, which varies from little to nothing, according to the
year, etc. He had also property of his own in the Terai, but the
slender proceeds only enabled him to trade with Tibet for tea,
etc.</p>

<br>

<p class="first">and black velvet butterflies on the flapping brim.
He was accompanied by a household of women, who were laden with
ornaments, and wore boots, and sat astride on ponies; many Lamas
were also with him, one of whom wore a broad Chinese-like hat
covered with polished copper foil. Half a dozen Sepoys with
matchlocks preceded him, and on approaching Tumloong, bawled out
his titles, dignities, etc., as was formerly the custom in
England.</p>

</center>

<p>At Dorjiling our seizure was still unknown: our letters were
brought to us, but we were not allowed to answer them. Now that the
Dewan had arrived, we hoped to come to a speedy explanation with
him, but he shammed sickness, and sent no answer to our messages;
if indeed he</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 218">[ 218 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">received them. Our guards were reduced to one
Sepoy with a knife, who was friendly; and a dirty, cross-eyed
fellow named Thoba-sing, who, with the exception of Tchebu Lama,
was the only Bhoteea about the Durbar who could speak Hindostanee,
and who did it very imperfectly: he was our attendant and spy, the
most barefaced liar I ever met with, even in the east; and as
cringing and obsequious when alone with us, as he was to his
masters on other occasions, when he never failed to show off his
authority over us in an offensive manner. Though he was the most
disagreeable fellow we were ever thrown in contact with, I do not
think that he was therefore selected, but solely from his
possessing a few words of Hindostanee, and his presumed capability
of playing the spy.</p>

<p>The weather was generally drizzling or rainy, and we were
getting very tired of our captivity; but I beguiled the time by
carefully keeping my meteorological register,* and by reducing many
of my previous observations. Each morning we were awakened at
daybreak by the prolonged echos of the conchs, trumpets, and
cymbals, beaten by the priests before the many temples in the
valley: wild and pleasing sounds, often followed by</p>

<p class="fnote">* During the thirty days spent at Tumloong, the
temperature was mild and equable, with much cloud and drizzle, but
little hard rain; and we experienced violent thunder-storms,
followed by transient sunshine. Unlike 1848, the rains did not
cease this year before the middle of December; nor had there been
one fine month since April. The mean temperature, computed from 150
observations, was 50&middot;2&deg;, and from the maximum and
minimum thermometer 49&middot;6&deg;, which is a fair approximation
to the theoretical temperature calculated for the elevation and
month, and allows a fall of 1&deg; for 320 feet of ascent. The
temperature during the spring (from 50 observations) varied during
the day from 2&middot;4&deg; to 5&middot;8&deg; higher than that of
the air, the greatest differences occurring morning and evening.
The barometric tide amounted to 0&middot;091 between 9.50 a.m. and
4 p.m., which is less than at the level of the plains of India, and
more than at any greater elevation than Tumloong. The air was
always damp, nearly saturated at night, and the mean amount of
humidity for ninety-eight observations taken during the day was
only 0&middot;850, corresponding to a dew-point of
49&middot;6&deg;, or 5&middot;2&deg; below that of the air.</p>

<p class="first">their choral chants. After dark we sat over the
fire, generally in company with a little Lepcha girl, who was
appointed to keep us in fire-wood, and who sat watching our
movements with childish curiosity. Dolly, as we christened her, was
a quick child and a kind one, intolerably dirty, but very
entertaining from her powers of mimicry. She was fond of hearing me
whistle airs, and procured me a Tibetan Jews&rsquo;-harp,* with
which, and coarse tobacco, which I smoked out of a Tibetan brass
pipe, I wiled away the dark evenings, whilst my cheerful companion
amused himself with an old harmonicon, to the enchantment of Dolly
and our guards and neighbours.</p>

<center><img src="images2/fig22.jpg" width="301" height="176" alt=

<p>The messengers from Dorjiling were kept in utter ignorance of
our confinement till their arrival at Tumloong, when they were
cross-questioned, and finally sent to us. They gradually became too
numerous, there being only one apartment for ourselves, and such of
our servants as</p>

<p class="fnote">* This instrument (which is common in Tibet) is
identical with the European, except that the tongue is produced
behind the bow, in a strong steel spike, by which the instrument is
held firmer to the mouth.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 220">[ 220 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">were not imprisoned elsewhere. Some of them were
frightened out of their senses, and the state of abject fear and
trembling in which one Limboo arrived, and continued for nearly a
week, was quite distressing* to every one except Dolly, who
mimicked him in a manner that was irresistibly ludicrous. Whether
he had been beaten or threatened we could not make out, nor whether
he had heard of some dark fate impending over ourselves&mdash;a
suspicion which would force itself on our minds; especially as
Thoba-sing had coolly suggested to the Amlah the dispatching of
Campbell, as the shortest way of getting out of the scrape! We were
also ignorant whether any steps were being taken at Dorjiling for
our release, which we felt satisfied must follow any active
measures against these bullying cowards, though they themselves
frequently warned us that we should be thrown into the Teesta if
any such were pursued.</p>

<p>So long as our money lasted, we bought food, for the Durbar had
none to give; and latterly my ever charitable companion fed our
guards, including Dolly and Thoba-sing, in pity to their pinched
condition. Several families sent us small presents, especially that
of the late estimable Dewan, Ilam-sing, whose widow and daughters
lived close by, and never failed to express in secret their
sympathy and good feeling.</p>

<p>Tchebu Lama&rsquo;s and Meepo&rsquo;s families were equally
forward in their desire to serve us; but they were marked men, and
could only communicate by stealth.</p>

<p class="fnote">* It amounted to a complete prostration of bodily
and mental powers: the man trembled and started when spoken to, or
at any noise, a cold sweat constantly bedewed his forehead, and he
continued in this state for eight days. No kindness on
Campbell&rsquo;s part could rouse him to give any intelligible
account of his fears or their cause. His companions said he had
lost his goroo, <i>i.e.,</i> his charm, which the priest gives him
while yet a child, and which he renews or gets re-sanctified as
occasion requires. To us the circumstance was extremely
painful.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 221">[ 221 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our coolies were released on the 18th, more than half starved,
but the Sirdars were still kept in chains or the stocks: some were
sent back to Dorjiling, and the British subjects billetted off
amongst the villagers, and variously employed by the Dewan: my lad,
Cheytoong, was set to collect the long leaves of a <i>Tupistra,</i>
called &ldquo;Purphiok,&rdquo; which yield a sweet juice, and were
chopped up and mixed with tobacco for the Dewan&rsquo;s hookah.</p>

<p><i>November 20th.</i>&mdash;The Dewan, we heard this day,
ignored all the late proceedings, professing to be enraged with his
brother and the Amlah, and refusing to meddle in the matter. This
was no doubt a pretence: we had sent repeatedly for an explanation
with himself or the Rajah, from which he excused himself on the
plea of ill-health, till this day, when he apprized us that he
would meet Campbell, and a cotton tent was pitched for the
purpose.</p>

<p>We went about noon, and were received with great politeness and
shaking of hands by the Dewan, the young Gangtok Kajee, and the old
monk who had been present at my examination at Phadong. Tchebu
Lama&rsquo;s brother was also there, as a member of the Amlah,
lately taken into favour; while Tchebu himself acted as
interpreter, the Dewan speaking only Tibetan. They all sat
cross-legged on a bamboo bench on one side, and we on chairs
opposite them: walnuts and sweetmeats were brought us, and a small
present in the Rajah&rsquo;s name, consisting of rice, flour, and
butter.</p>

<p>The Dewan opened the conversation both in this and another
conference, which took place on the 22nd, by requesting Campbell to
state his reasons for having desired these interviews. Neither he
nor the Amlah seemed to have the smallest idea of the nature and
consequences of the acts they had committed, and they therefore
anxiously</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 222">[ 222 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">sought information as to the view that would be
taken of them by the British Government. They could not see why
Campbell should not transact business with them in his present
condition, and wanted him to be the medium of communication between
themselves and Calcutta. The latter confined himself to pointing
out his own views of the following subjects:&mdash;1. The seizing
and imprisoning of the agent of a friendly power, travelling
unarmed and without escort, under the formal protection of the
Rajah, and with the authority of his own government. 2. The
aggravation of this act of the Amlah, by our present detention
under the Dewan&rsquo;s authority. 3. The chance of collision, and
the disastrous consequences of a war, for which they had no
preparation of any kind. 4. The impossibility of the supreme
government paying any attention to their letters so long as we were
illegally detained.</p>

<p>All this sank deep into the Dewan&rsquo;s heart: he answered,
&ldquo;You have spoken truth, and I will submit it all to the
Rajah;&rdquo; but at the same time he urged that there was nothing
dishonourable in the imprisonment, and that the original violence
being all a mistake, it should be overlooked by both parties. We
parted on good terms, and heard shortly after the second conference
that our release was promised and arranged: when a communication*
from Dorjiling changed their plans, the Dewan conveniently fell
sick on the spot, and we were thrown back again.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, we were allowed to write to our
friends, and to receive money and food, of which</p>

<p class="fnote">* I need scarcely say that every step was taken at
Dorjiling for our release, that the most anxious solicitude for our
safety could suggest. But the first communication to the Rajah,
though it pointed out the heinous nature of his offence, was,
through a natural fear of exasperating our captors, couched in very
moderate language. The particulars of our seizure, and the reasons
for it, and for our further detention, were unknown at Dorjiling,
or a very different line of policy would have been pursued.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 223">[ 223 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">we stood in great need. I transmitted a private
account of the whole affair to the Governor-General, who was
unfortunately at Bombay, but to whose prompt and vigorous measures
we were finally indebted for our release. His lordship expedited a
despatch to the Rajah, such as the latter was accustomed to receive
from Nepal, Bhotan, or Lhassa, and such as alone commands attention
from these half-civilized Indo-Chinese, who measure power by the
firmness of the tone adopted towards them; and who, whether in
Sikkim, Birmah, Siam, Bhotan, or China, have too long been
accustomed to see every article of our treaties contravened, with
no worse consequences than a protest or a threat, which is never
carried into execution till some fatal step calls forth the dormant
power of the British Government.*</p>

<p>The end of the month arrived without bringing any prospect of
our release, whilst we were harassed by false reports of all kinds.
The Dewan went on the 25th to a hot bath, a few hundred feet down
the hill; he was led past our hut, his burly frame tottering as if
in great weakness, but a more transparent fraud could not have been
practised: he was, in fact, lying on his oars, pending further
negotiations. The Amlah proposed that Campbell should sign a bond,
granting immunity for all past offences on their part, whilst they
were to withdraw the letter of grievances against him. The Lamas
cast horoscopes for the</p>

<p class="fnote">* We forget that all our concessions to these
people are interpreted into weakness; that they who cannot live on
an amicable equality with one another, cannot be expected to do so
with us; that all our talk of power and resources are mere boasts
to habitual bullies, so long as we do not exert ourselves in the
correction of premeditated insults. No Government can be more
tolerant, more sincerely desirous of peace, and more anxious to
confine its sway within its own limits than that of India, but it
can only continue at peace by demanding respect, and the
punctilious enforcement of even the most trifling terms in the
treaties it makes with Indo-Chinese.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 224">[ 224 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">future, little presents continually arrived for
us, and the Ranee sent me some tobacco, and to Campbell brown sugar
and Murwa beer. The blacksmiths, who had been ostentatiously making
long knives at the forge hard by, were dismissed; troops were said
to be arriving at Dorjiling, and a letter sternly demanding our
release bad been received.</p>

<p>The Lamas of Pemiongchi, Changachelling, Tassiding, etc., and
the Dewan&rsquo;s enemies, and Tchebu Lama&rsquo;s friends, began
to flock from all quarters to Tumloong, demanding audience of the
Rajah, and our instant liberation. The Dewan&rsquo;s game was
evidently up; but the timidity of his opponents, his own craft, and
the habitual dilatoriness of all, contributed to cause endless
delays. The young Gangtok Kajee tried to curry favour with us,
sending word that he was urging our release, and adding that he had
some capital ponies for us to see on our way to Dorjiling! Many
similar trifles showed that these people had not a conception of
the nature of their position, or of that of an officer of the
British Government.</p>

<p>The Tchebu Lama visited us only once, and then under
surveillance; he renewed his professions of good faith, and we had
every reason to know that he had suffered severely for his
adherence to us, and consistent repudiation of the Amlah&rsquo;s
conduct; he was in great favour with his brother Lamas, but was not
allowed to see the Rajah, who was said to trust to him alone of all
his counsellors. He told us that peremptory orders had arrived from
Calcutta for our release, but that the Amlah had replied that they
would not acknowledge the despatch, from its not bearing the
Governor-General&rsquo;s great seal! The country-people refusing to
be saddled with the keep of our coolies, they were sent to
Dorjiling in small parties, charged to say that we were free, and
following them.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 225">[ 225 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The weather continued rainy and bad, with occasionally a few
hours of sunshine, which, however, always rendered the ditch before
our door offensive: we were still prevented leaving the hot, but as
a great annual festival was going on, we were less disagreeably
watched. Campbell was very unwell, and we had no medicine; and as
the Dewan, accustomed to such duplicity himself, naturally took
this for a <i>ruse,</i> and refused to allow us to send to
Dorjiling for any, we were more than ever convinced that his own
sickness was simulated.</p>

<p>On the 2nd and 3rd December we had further conferences with the
Dewan, who said that we were to be taken to Dorjiling in six days,
with two Vakeels from the Rajah. The Pemiongchi Lama, as the oldest
and most venerated in Sikkim, attended, and addressed Campbell in a
speech of great feeling and truth. Having heard, he said, of these
unfortunate circumstances a few days ago, he had come on feeble
limbs, and though upwards of seventy winters old, as the
representative of his holy brotherhood, to tender advice to his
Rajah, which he hoped would be followed: Since Sikkim had been
connected with the British rule, it had experienced continued peace
and protection; whereas before they were in constant dread of their
lives and properties, which, as well as their most sacred temples,
were violated by the Nepalese and Bhotanese. He then dwelt upon
Campbell&rsquo;s invariable kindness and good feeling, and his
exertions for the benefit of their country, and for the cementing
of friendship, and hoped he would not let these untoward events
induce an opposite course in future but that he would continue to
exert his influence with the Governor-General in their favour.</p>

<p>The Dewan listened attentively; he was anxious and</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 226">[ 226 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">perplexed, and evidently losing his presence of
mind: he talked to us of Lhassa and its gaieties, dromedaries,
Lamas, and everything Tibetan; offered to sell us ponies cheap, and
altogether behaved in a most, undignified manner; ever and anon
calling attention to his pretended sick leg, which he nursed on his
knee. He gave us the acceptable news that the government at
Calcutta had sent up an officer to carry on Campbell&rsquo;s
duties, which had alarmed him exceedingly. The Rajah, we were told,
was very angry at our seizure and detention; he had no fault to
find with the Governor-General&rsquo;s agent, and hoped he would be
continued as such. In fact, all the blame was thrown on the
brothers of the Dewan, and of the Gangtok Kajee, and more
irresponsible stupid boors could not have been found on whom to lay
it, or who would have felt less inclined to commit such folly if it
had not been put on them by the Dewan. On leaving, white silk
scarfs were thrown over our shoulders, and we went away, still
doubtful, after so many disappointments, whether we should really
be set at liberty at the stated period.</p>

<p>Although there was so much talk about our leaving, our
confinement continued as rigorous as ever. The Dewan curried favour
in every other way, sending us Tibetan wares for purchase, with
absurd prices attached, he being an arrant pedlar. All the
principal families waited on us, desiring peace and friendship. The
coolies who had not been dismissed were allowed to run away, except
my Bhotan Sirdar, Nimbo, against whom the Dewan was inveterate;*
he, however, managed soon afterwards to break a great chain with
which his legs were shackled, and</p>

<p class="fnote">* The Sikkim people are always at issue with the
Bhotanese. Nimbo was a runaway slave of the latter country, who had
been received into Sikkim, and retained there until he took up his
quarters at Dorjiling.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 227">[ 227 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">marching at night, eluded a hot pursuit, and
proceeded to the Teesta, swam the river, and reached Dorjiling in
eight days; arriving with a large iron ring on each leg, and a link
of several pounds weight attached to one.</p>

<p>Parting presents arrived from the Rajah on the 7th, consisting
of ponies, cloths, silks, woollens, immense squares of butter, tea,
and the usual et ceteras, to the utter impoverishment of his
stores: these he offered to the two Sahibs, &ldquo;in token of his
amity with the British government, his desire for peace, and
deprecation of angry discussions.&rdquo; The Ranee sent silk
purses, fans, and such Tibetan paraphernalia, with an equally
amicable message, that &ldquo;she was most anxious to avert the
consequences of whatever complaints had gone forth against Dr.
Campbell, who might depend on her strenuous exertions to persuade
the Rajah to do whatever he wished!&rdquo; These friendly messages
were probably evoked by the information that an English regiment,
with three guns, was on its way to Sikkim, and that 300 of the
Bhaugulpore Rangers had already arrived there. The government of
Bengal sending another agent* to Dorjiling, was also a contingency
they had not anticipated, having fully expected to get rid of any
such obstacle to direct communication with the
Governor-General.</p>

<p>A present from the whole population followed that of the Ranee,
coupled with earnest entreaties that Campbell would resume his
position at Dorjiling; and on the following day forty coolies
mustered to arrange the baggage. Before we left, the Ranee sent
three rupees to buy a</p>

<p class="fnote">* Mr. Lushington, the gentleman sent to conduct
Sikkim affairs during Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s detention: to whom I
shall ever feel grateful for his activity in our cause, and his
unremitting attention to every little arrangement that could
alleviate the discomforts and anxieties of our position.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">yard of chal&eacute; and some gloves, accompanying
them with a present of white silk, etc., for Mrs. Campbell, to whom
the commission was intrusted: a singular instance of the <i>
insouciant</i> simplicity of these odd people.</p>

<p>The 9th of December was a splendid and hot day, one of the very
few we had had during our captivity. We left at noon, descending
the hill through an enormous crowd of people, who brought farewell
presents, all wishing us well. We were still under escort as
prisoners of the Dewan, who was coolly marching a troop of forty
unloaded mules and ponies, and double that number of men&rsquo;s
loads of merchandize, purchased during the summer in Tibet, to
trade with at Dorjiling and the Titalya fair! His impudence or
stupidity was thus quite inexplicable; treating us as prisoners,
ignoring every demand of the authorities at Dorjiling, of the
Supreme Council of Calcutta, and of the Governor-General himself;
and at the same time acting as if he were to enter the British
territories on the most friendly and advantageous footing for
himself and his property, and incurring so great an expense in all
this as to prove that he was in earnest in thinking so.</p>

<p>Tchebu Lama accompanied us, but we were not allowed to converse
with him. We halted at the bottom of the valley, where the Dewan
invited us to partake of tea; from this place he gave us mules* or
ponies to ride, and we ascended to Yankoong, a village 3,867 feet
above the sea. On the following day we crossed a high ridge from
the Ryott valley to that of the Rungmi; where we camped at
Tikbotang (alt. 3,763 feet), and, on the 11th at Gangtok Sampoo, a
few miles lower down the same valley.</p>

<p>We were now in the Soubahship of the Gangtok Kajee; a</p>

<p class="fnote">* The Tibet mules are often as fine as the
Spanish: I rode one which had performed a journey from Choombi to
Lhassa in fifteen days, with a man and load.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 229">[ 229 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">member of the oldest and most wealthy family in
Sikkim; he had from the first repudiated the late acts of the
Amlah, in which his brother had taken part, and had always been
hostile to the Dewan. The latter conducted himself with
disagreeable familiarity towards us, and <i>hauteur</i> towards the
people; he was preceded by immense kettle-drums, carried on
men&rsquo;s backs, and great hand-bells, which were beaten and rung
on approaching villages; on which occasions he changed his dress of
sky-blue for yellow silk robes worked with Chinese dragons, to the
indignation of Tchebu Lama, an amber robe in polite Tibetan society
being sacred to royalty and the Lamas. We everywhere perceived
unequivocal symptoms of the dislike with which he was regarded.
Cattle were driven away, villages deserted, and no one came to pay
respects, or bring presents, except the Kajees, who were ordered to
attend, and his elder brother, for whom he had usurped an estate
near Gangtok.</p>

<p>On the 13th, he marched us a few miles, and then halted for a
day at Serriomsa (alt. 2,820 feet), at the bottom of a hot valley
full of irrigated rice-crops and plantain and orange-groves. Here
the Gangtok Kajee waited on us with a handsome present, and
informed us privately of his cordial hatred of the &ldquo;upstart
Dewan,&rdquo; and hopes for his overthrow; a demonstration of which
we took no notice.* The Dewan&rsquo;s brother (one of the Amlah)
also sent a large present, but was ashamed to appear. Another
letter reached the Dewan here, directed to the Rajah; it was from
the Governor-General at Bombay, and had been sent across the
country by special messengers:</p>

<p class="fnote">* Nothing would have been easier than for the
Gangtok Kajee, or any other respectable man in Sikkim, to have
overthrown the Dewan and his party; but these people are
intolerably apathetic, and prefer being tyrannized over to the
trouble of shaking off the yoke.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 230">[ 230 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">it demanded our instant release, or his Raj would
be forfeited; and declared that if a hair of our heads were
touched, his life should be the penalty.</p>

<p>The Rajah was also incessantly urging the Dewan to hasten us
onwards as free men to Dorjiling, but the latter took all
remonstrances with assumed coolness, exercised his ponies, played
at bow and arrow, intruded on us at mealtimes to be invited to
partake, and loitered on the road, changing garments and hats,
which he pestered us to buy. Nevertheless, be was evidently
becoming daily more nervous and agitated.</p>

<p>From the Rungmi valley we crossed on the 14th southward to that
of Runniok, and descended to Dikkeeling, a large village of Dhurma
Bhoteeas (Bhotanese), which is much the most populous, industrious,
and at the same time turbulent, in Sikkim. It is 4,950 feet above
the sea, and occupies many broad cultivated spurs facing the south.
This district once belonged to Bhotan, and was ceded to the Sikkim
Rajah by the Paro Pilo,* in consideration of some military
services, rendered by the former in driving off the Tibetans, who
had usurped it for the authorities of Lhassa. Since then the Sikkim
and Bhotan people have repeatedly fallen out, and Dikkeeling has
become a refuge for runaway Bhotanese, and kidnapping is constantly
practised on this frontier.</p>

<p>The Dewan halted us here for three days, for no assigned cause.
On the 16th, letters arrived, including a most kind and encouraging
one from Mr. Lushington, who had taken charge of Campbell&rsquo;s
office at Dorjiling. Immediately after arriving, the messenger was
seized with violent vomitings and gripings: we could not help
suspecting poison,</p>

<p class="fnote">* The temporal sovereign, in contra-distinction to
the Dhurma Rajah, or spiritual sovereign of Bhotan.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 231">[ 231 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">especially as we were now amongst adherents of the
Dewan, and the Bhotanese are notorious for this crime. Only one
means suggested itself for proving this, and with Campbell&rsquo;s
permission I sent my compliments to the Dewan, with a request for
one of his hunting dogs to eat the vomit. It was sent at once, and
performed its duty without any ill effects. I must confess to
having felt a malicious pleasure in the opportunity thus afforded
of showing our jailor how little we trusted him; feeling indignant
at the idea that he should suppose he was making any way in our
good opinion by his familiarities, which we were not in
circumstances to resist.</p>

<p>The crafty fellow, however, outwitted me by inviting us to dine
with him the same day, and putting our stomachs and noses to a
severe test. Our dinner was served in Chinese fashion, but most of
the luxuries, such as <i>b&eacute;che-de-mer,</i> were very old and
bad. We ate, sometimes with chop-sticks, and at others with Tibetan
spoons, knives, and two-pronged forks. After the usual amount of
messes served in oil and salt water, sweets were brought, and a
strong spirit. Thoba-sing, our filthy, cross-eyed spy, was waiter,
and brought in every little dish with both hands, and raised it to
his greasy forehead, making a sort of half bow previous to
depositing it before us. Sometimes he undertook to praise its
contents, always adding, that in Tibet none but very great men
indeed partook of such sumptuous fare. Thus he tried to please both
us and the Dewan, who conducted himself with pompous hospitality,
showing off what he considered his elegant manners and graces. Our
blood boiled within us at being so patronised by the squinting
ruffian, whose insolence and ill-will had sorely aggravated the
discomforts of our imprisonment.</p>

<p>Not content with giving us what he considered a magnificent
dinner (and it had cost him some trouble), the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 232">[ 232 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Dewan produced a little bag from a double-locked
escritoire, and took out three dinner-pills, which he had received
as a great favour from the Rimbochay Lama, and which were a
sovereign remedy for indigestion and all other ailments; he handed
one to each of us, reserving the third for himself. Campbell
refused his; but there appeared no help for me, after my groundless
suspicion of poison, and so I swallowed the pill with the best
grace I could. But in truth, it was not poison I dreaded in its
contents, so much as being compounded of some very questionable
materials, such as the Rimbochay Lama blesses and dispenses far and
wide. To swallow such is a sanctifying work, according to Boodhist
superstition, and I believe there was nothing in the world, save
his ponies, to which the Dewan attached a greater value.</p>

<p>To wind up the feast, we had pipes of excellent mild yellow
Chinese tobacco called &ldquo;Tseang,&rdquo; made from <i>Nicotiana
rustica,</i> which is cultivated in East Tibet, and in West China
according to MM. Huc and Gabet. It resembles in flavour the finest
Syrian tobacco, and is most agreeable when the smoke is passed
through the nose. The common tobacco of India (<i>Nicotiana
Tabacum</i>) is much imported into Tibet, where it is called
&ldquo;Tamma,&rdquo; (probably a corruption of the Persian
&ldquo;Toombac,&rdquo;) and is said to fetch the enormous price of
30<i>s.</i> per lb. at Lhassa, which is sixty times its value in
India. Rice at Lhassa, when cheap, sells at 2<i>s.</i> for 5 lbs.;
it is, as I have elsewhere said, all bought up for rations for the
Chinese soldiery.</p>

<p>The Bhotanese are more industrious than the Lepchas, and better
husbandmen; besides having superior crops of all ordinary grains,
they grow cotton, hemp, and flax. The cotton is cleansed here as
elsewhere, with a simple gin. The Lepchas use no spinning wheel,
but a spindle and</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 233">[ 233 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">distaff; their loom, which is Tibetan is a very
complicated one framed of bamboo; it is worked by hand, without
beam treddle, or shuttle.</p>

<p>On the 18th we were marched, three miles only, to Singdong (alt.
2,116 feet), and on the following day five miles farther, to Katong
Ghat (alt. 750 feet), on the Teesta river, which we crossed with
rafts, and camped on the opposite bank, a few miles above the
junction of this river with the Great Rungeet. The water, which is
sea-green in colour, had a temperature of 53&middot;5&deg; at 4
p.m., and 51&middot;7&deg; the following morning; its current was
very powerful. The rocks, since leaving Tunlloong, had been
generally micaceous, striking north-west, and dipping north-east.
The climate was hot, and the vegetation on the banks tropical; on
the hills around, lemon-bushes (&ldquo;Kucheala,&rdquo; Lepcha)
were abundant, growing apparently wild.</p>

<p>The Dewan was now getting into a very nervous and depressed
state; he was determined to keep up appearances before his
followers, but was himself almost servile to us; he caused his men
to make a parade of their arms, as if to intimidate us, and in
descending narrow gullies we had several times the disagreeable
surprise of finding some of his men at a sudden turn, with drawn
bows and arrows pointed towards us. Others gesticulated with their
long knives, and made fell swoops at soft plantain-stems; but these
artifices were all as shallow as they were contemptible, and a
smile at such demonstrations was generally answered with another
from the actors.</p>

<p>From Katong we ascended the steep east flank of Tendong or Mount
Ararat, through forests of Sal and long-leaved pine, to Namten
(alt. 4,483 feet), where we again halted two days. The Dingpun
Tinli lived near and</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 234">[ 234 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">waited on us with a present, which, with all
others that had been brought, Campbell received officially, and
transferred to the authorities at Dorjiling.</p>

<p>The Dewan was thoroughly alarmed at the news here brought in,
that the Rajah&rsquo;s present of yaks, ponies, etc., which had
been sent forward, had been refused at Dorjiling; and equally so at
the clamorous messages which reached him from all quarters,
demanding our liberation; and at the desertion of some of his
followers, on hearing that large bodies of troops were assembling
at Dorjiling. Repudiated by his Rajah and countrymen, and paralysed
between his dignity and his ponies, which he now perceived would
not be welcomed at the station, and which were daily losing flesh,
looks, and value in these hot valleys, where there is no grass
pasture, he knew not what olive-branch to hold out to our
government, except ourselves, whom he therefore clung to as
hostages.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of December he marched us eight miles further, to
Cheadam, on a bold spur 4,653 feet high, overlooking the Great
Rungeet, and facing Dorjiling, from which it was only twenty miles
distant. The white bungalows of our friends gladdened our eyes,
while the new barracks erecting for the daily arriving troops
struck terror into the Dewan&rsquo;s heart. The six Sepoys* who had
marched valiantly beside us for twenty days, carrying the muskets
given to the Rajah the year before by the Governor-General, now
lowered their arms, and vowed that if a red coat crossed the Great
Rungeet, they would throw down their guns and run away. News
arrived</p>

<p class="fnote">* These Sepoys, besides the loose red jacket and
striped Lepcha kirtle, wore a very curious national black hat of
felt, with broad flaps turned up all round: this is represented in
the right-hand figure. A somewhat similar bat is worn by some
classes of Nepal soldiery.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 235">[ 235 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<center><img src="images2/fig23.jpg" width="264" height="258" alt=
"Lepcha sepoys. Tibetan sepoys in the back-ground."></center>

<p class="first">that the Bhotan inhabitants of Dorjiling headed by
my bold Sirdar Nimbo, had arranged a night attack for our release;
an enterprise to which they were quite equal, and in which they
have had plenty of practice in their own misgoverned country.
Watch-fires gleamed amongst the bushes, we were thrust into a
doubly-guarded house, and bows and arrows were ostentatiously
levelled so as to rake the doorway, should we attempt to escape.
Some of the ponies were sent back to Dikkeeling, though the Dewan
still clung to his merchandise and the feeble hope of traffic. The
confusion increased daily, but though Tchebu Lama looked brisk and
confident, we were extremely anxious;</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 236">[ 236 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">scouts were hourly arriving from the road to the
Great Rungeet, and if our troops had advanced, the Dewan might have
made away with us from pure fear.</p>

<p>In the forenoon he paid us a long visit, and brought some
flutes, of which he gave me two very common ones of apricot wood
from Lhassa, producing at the same time a beautiful one, which I
believe he intended for Campbell, but his avarice got the better,
and he commuted his gift into the offer of a tune, and pitching it
in a high key, he went through a Tibetan air that almost deafened
us by its screech. He tried bravely to maintain his equanimity, but
as we preserved a frigid civility and only spoke when addressed,
the tears would start from his eyes in the pauses of conversation.
In the evening he came again; he was excessively agitated and
covered with perspiration, and thrust himself unceremoniously
between us on the bench we occupied. As his familiarity increased,
he put his arm round my neck, and as he was armed with a small
dagger, I felt rather uneasy about his intentions, but he ended by
forcing on my acceptance a coin, value threepence, for he was in
fact beside himself with terror.</p>

<p>Next morning Campbell received a hint that this was a good
opportunity for a vigorous remonstrance. The Dewan came with Tchebu
Lama, his own younger brother (who was his pony driver), and the
Lassoo Kajee. The latter had for two months placed himself in an
attitude of hostility opposite Dorjiling, with a ragged company of
followers, but he now sought peace and friendship as much as the
Dewan; the latter told us he was waiting for a reply to a letter
addressed to Mr. Lushington, after which he would set us free.
Campbell said: &ldquo;As you appear to have made up your mind, why
not dismiss us at once?&rdquo; He</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 237">[ 237 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">answered that we should go the next day at all
events: Here I came in, and on hearing from Campbell what had
passed, I added, that he had better for his own sake let us go at
once; that the next day was our great and only annual Poojah
(religious festival) of Christmas, when we all met; whereas he and
his countrymen had dozens in the year. As for me, he knew I had no
wife, nor children, nor any relation, within thousands of miles,
and it mattered little where I was, he was only bringing ruin on
himself by his conduct to me as the Governor-General&rsquo;s
friend; but as regarded Campbell, the case was different; his home
was at Dorjiling, which was swarming with English soldiers, all in
a state of exasperation, and if he did not let us depart before
Christmas, he would find Dorjiling too hot to hold him, let him
offer what reparation he might for the injuries he had done us. I
added: &ldquo;We are all ready to go&mdash;dismiss us.&rdquo; The
Dewan again turned to Campbell, who said, &ldquo;I am quite ready;
order us ponies at once, and send our luggage after us.&rdquo; He
then ordered the ponies, and three men, including Meepo, to attend
us; whereupon we walked out, mounted, and made off with all
speed.</p>

<p>We arrived at the cane bridge over the Great Rungeet at 4 p.m.,
and to our chagrin found it in the possession of a posse of ragged
Bhoteeas, though there were thirty armed Sepoys of our own at the
guard-house above. At Meepo&rsquo;s order they cut the network of
fine canes by which they had rendered the bridge impassable, and we
crossed. The Sepoys at the guard-house turned out with their
clashing arms and bright accoutrements, and saluted to the sound of
bugles; scaring our three companions, who ran back as fast as they
could go. We rode up that night to Dorjiling, and I arrived at 8
p.m. at Hodgson&rsquo;s house,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 238">[ 238 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">where I was taken for a ghost, and received with
shouts of welcome by my kind friend and his guest Dr. Thomson, who
had been awaiting my arrival for upwards of a month.</p>

<p>Thus terminated our Sikkim captivity, and my last Himalayan
exploring journey, which in a geographical point of view had
answered my purposes beyond my most sanguine expectations, though
my collections had been in a great measure destroyed by so many
untoward events. It enabled me to survey the whole country, and to
execute a map of it, and Campbell had further gained that knowledge
of its resources which the British government should all along have
possessed, as the protector of the Rajah and his territories.</p>

<p>It remains to say a few words of the events that succeeded our
release, in so far as they relate to my connection with them. The
Dewan moved from Cheadam to Namtchi, immediately opposite
Dorjiling, where he remained throughout the winter. The supreme
government of Bengal demanded of the Rajah that he should deliver
up the most notorious offenders, and come himself to Dorjiling, on
pain of an army marching to Tumloong to enforce the demand; a step
which would have been easy, as there were neither troops, arms,
ammunition, nor other means of resistance, even had there been the
inclination to stop us, which was not the case. The Rajah would in
all probability have delivered himself up at Tumloong, throwing
himself on our mercy, and the army would have sought the culprits
in vain, both the spirit and the power to capture them being
wanting on the part of the people and their ruler.</p>

<p>The Rajah expressed his willingness, but pleaded his inability
to fulfil the demand, whereupon the threat was</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 239">[ 239 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">repeated, and additional reinforcements were moved
on to Dorjiling. The general officer in command at Dinapore was
ordered to Dorjiling to conduct operations: his skill and bravery
had been proved during the progress of the Nepal war so long ago as
1815. From the appearance of the country about Dorjiling, he was
led to consider Sikkim to be impracticable for a British army. This
was partly owing to the forest-clad mountains, and partly to the
fear of Tibetan troops coming to the Rajah&rsquo;s aid, and the
Nepalese* taking the opportunity to attack us. With the latter we
were in profound peace, and we had a resident at their court; and I
have elsewhere shown the impossibility of a Tibet invasion, even if
the Chinese or Lhassan authorities were inclined to interfere in
the affairs of Sikkim, which they long ago formally declined doing
in the case of aggressions of the Nepalese and Bhotanese, the
Sikkim Rajah being under British protection.&dagger;</p>

<p class="fnote">* Jung Bahadoor was at this time planning his
visit to England, and to his honour I must say, that on hearing of
our imprisonment he offered to the government at Calcutta to
release us with a handful of men. This he would no doubt have
easily effected, but his offer was wisely declined, for the
Nepalese (as I have elsewhere stated) want Sikkim and Bhotan too,
and we had undertaken the protection of the former country, mainly
to keep the Nepalese out of it.<br>
&dagger; The general officer considered that our troops would have
been cut to pieces if they entered the country; and the late
General Sir Charles Napier has since given evidence to the same
effect. Having been officially asked at the time whether I would
guide a party into the country, and having drawn up (at the request
of the general officer) plans for the purpose, and having given it
as my opinion that it would not only have been feasible but easy to
have marched a force in peace and safety to Tumloong, I feel it
incumbent on me here to remark, that I think General Napier, who
never was in Sikkim, and wrote from many hundred miles&rsquo;
distance, must have misapprehended the state of the case. Whether
an invasion of Sikkim was either advisable or called for, was a
matter in which I had no concern: nor do I offer an opinion as to
the impregnability of the country if it were defended by natives
otherwise a match for a British force, and having the advantage of
position. I was not consulted with reference to any difference of
opinion between the civil and military powers, such as seems to
have called for the expression of Sir Charles Napier&rsquo;s
opinion on this matter, and which appears to be considerably
overrated in his evidence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The general officer honoured me with his
friendship at Dorjiling, and to Mr. Lushington, I am, as I have
elsewhere stated, under great obligations for his personal
consideration and kindness, and vigorous measures during my
detention. On my release and return to Dorjiling, any interference
on my part would have been meddling with what was not my concern. I
never saw, nor wished to see, a public document connected with the
affair, and have only given as many of the leading features of the
case as I can vouch for, and as were accessible to any other
bystander.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 240">[ 240 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">There were not wanting offers of leading a company
of soldiers to Tumloong, rather than that the threat should have
twice been made, and then withdrawn; but they were not accepted. A
large body of troops was however, marched from Dorjiling, and
encamped on the north bank of the Great Rungeet for some weeks: but
after that period they were recalled, without any further
demonstration; the Dewan remaining encamped the while on the
Namtchi hill, not three hours&rsquo; march above them. The simple
Lepchas daily brought our soldiers milk, fowls, and eggs, and would
have continued to do so had they proceeded to Tumloong, for I
believe both Rajah and people would have rejoiced at our occupation
of the country.</p>

<p>After the withdrawal of the troops, the threat was modified into
a seizure of the Terai lands, which the Rajah had originally
received as a free gift from the British, and which were the only
lucrative or fertile estates he possessed. This was effected by
four policemen taking possession of the treasury (which contained
exactly twelve shillings, I believe), and announcing to the
villagers the confiscation of the territory to the British
government, in which they gladly acquiesced. At the same time there
was annexed to it the whole southern part of Sikkim, between the
Great Rungeet and the plains of India, and from Nepal on the west
to the Bhotan frontier and the Teesta river on the east; thus
confining the Rajah to his</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 241">[ 241 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">mountains, and cutting off all access to the
plains, except through the British territories. To the inhabitants
(about 5000 souls) this was a matter of congratulation, for it only
involved the payment of a small fixed tax in money to the treasury
at Dorjiling, instead of a fluctuating one in kind, with service to
the Rajah, besides exempting them from further annoyance by the
Dewan. At the present time the revenues of the tract thus acquired
have doubled, and will very soon be quadrupled: every expense of
our detention and of the moving of troops, etc., has been already
repaid by it, and for the future all will be clear profit; and I am
given to understand that this last year it has realized upwards of
30,000 rupees (&pound;3000).</p>

<p>Dr. Campbell resumed his duties immediately afterwards, and the
newly-acquired districts were placed under his jurisdiction. The
Rajah still begs hard for the renewal of old friendship, and the
restoration of his Terai land, or the annual grant of &pound;300 a
year which he formerly received. He has forbidden the culprits his
court, but can do no more. The Dewan, disgraced and turned out of
office, is reduced to poverty, and is deterred from entering Tibet
by the threat of being dragged to Lhassa with a rope round his
neck. Considering, however, his energy, a rare quality in these
countries, I should not be surprised at his yet cutting a figure in
Bhotan, if not in Sikkim itself: especially if, at the
Rajah&rsquo;s death, the British government should refuse to take
the country under its protection. The Singtam Soubah and the other
culprits live disgraced at their homes. Tchebu Lama has received a
handsome reward, and a grant of land at Dorjiling, where he
resides, and whence he sends me his salaams by every
opportunity.</p>
