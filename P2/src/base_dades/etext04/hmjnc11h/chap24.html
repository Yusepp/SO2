<p class="first">In the afternoon we crossed the valley, and
ascended Bhomtso, fording the river, whose temperature was 48&deg;.
Some stupendous boulders of gneiss from Kinchinjhow are deposited
in a broad sandy track on the north bank, by ancient glaciers,
which once crossed this valley from Kinchinjhow.</p>

<p>The ascent was alternately over steep rocky slopes, and broad
shelf-like flats; many more plants grew here than I had expected,
in inconspicuous scattered tufts.* The rocks</p>

<p class="fnote">* Besides those before mentioned, there were
Fescue-grass (<i>Festuca ovina</i> of Scotland), a strong-scented
silky wormwood (<i>Artemisia</i>), and round tufts of <i>Oxytropis
chiliophylla,</i> a kind of <i>Astralagus</i> that inhabits eastern
and western Tibet; this alone was green: it formed great circles on
the ground, the centre decaying, and the annual shoots growing
outwards, and thus constantly enlarging the circle. A woolly <i>
Leontopodium, Androsace,</i> and some other plants assumed nearly
the same mode of growth. The rest of the vegetation consisted of a
<i>Sedum, Nardostachys Jatamansi, Meconopsis horridula,</i> a
slender <i>Androsace, Gnaphalium, Stipa, Salvia, Draba,
Pedicularis, Potentilla</i> or <i>Sibbaldia, Gentiana</i> and <i>
Erigeron alpinus</i> of Scotland. All these grow nearly up to
18,000 feet.</p>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">were nearly vertical strata of quartz, hornstone,
and conglomerate, striking north-west, and dipping south-west
80&deg;. The broad top of the hill was also of quartz, but covered
with angular pebbles of the rocks transported from Kinchinjhow.
Some clay-stone fragments were stained red with oxide of iron, and
covered with <i>Parmelia miniata</i>;* this, with <i>Borrera,</i>
another lichen, which forms stringy masses blown along by the wind,
were the only plants, and they are among the most alpine in the
world.</p>

<p>Bhomtso is 18,590 feet above the sea by barometer, and 18,305 by
boiling-point: it presented an infinitely more extensive prospect
than I had ventured to anticipate, commanding all the most
important Sikkim, North Bhotan, and Tibetan mountains, including
Kinchinjunga thirty-seven miles to the south-west, and Chumulari
thirty-nine miles south-east. Due south, across the sandy valley of
the Lachen, Kinchinjhow reared its long wall of glaciers and rugged
precipices, 22,000 feet high, and under its cliffs lay the lake to
which we had walked in the morning: beyond Kongra Lama were the
Thlonok mountains, where I had spent the month of June, with
Kinchinjunga in the distance. Westward Chomiomo rose abruptly from
the rounded hills we were on, to 22,000 feet elevation, ten miles
distant. To the east of Kinchinjhow were the Cholamoo lakes, with
the rugged mass of Donkia stretching in cliffs of ice and snow
continuously southwards to forked Donkia, which overhung Momay
Samdong.</p>

<p>A long sloping spur sweeps from the north of Donkia first north,
and then west to Bhomtso, rising to a height of more</p>

<p class="fnote">* This minute lichen, mentioned at chapter xxxii,
is the most Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine in the world; often
occurring so abundantly as to colour the rocks of an orange red.
This was the case at Bhomtso, and is so also in Cockburn Island in
the Antarctic ocean, which it covers so profusely that the rocks
look as if brightly painted. See &ldquo;Ross&rsquo;s Voyage,&rdquo;
vol. ii. p. 339.</p>

<p class="first">than 20,000 feet without snow. Over this spur the
celebrated Chumulari* peeps, bearing south-east, and from its
isolated position and sharpness looking low and small; it appeared
quite near, though thirty-nine miles distant.</p>

</center>

<p>North-east of Chumulari, and far beyond it, are several
meridional ranges of very much loftier snowy mountains, which
terminated the view of the snowy Himalaya; the distance embraced
being fully 150 miles, and perhaps much more. Of one of these
eastern masses&dagger; I afterwards took</p>

<p class="fnote">* Some doubt still hangs over the identity of this
mountain, chiefly owing to Turner&rsquo;s having neglected to
observe his geographical positions. I saw a much loftier mountain
than this, bearing from Bhomtso north 87&deg; east, and it was
called Chumulari by the Tibetan Sepoys; but it does not answer to
Turner&rsquo;s description of an isolated snowy peak, such as he
approached within three miles; and though in the latitude he
assigned to it, is fully sixty miles to the east of his route. A
peak, similar to the one he describes, is seen from Tonglo and
Sinchul (see vol. i., <a href="chap5.html#page 125">p. 125</a> and
<a href="chap8.html#page 185">p. 185</a>); this is the one alluded
to above, and it is identified by both Tibetans and Lepchas at
Dorjiling as the true Chumulari, and was measured by Colonel Waugh,
who placed it in lat. 27&deg; 49&prime; north, long. 89&deg;
18&prime; east. The latter position, though fifteen miles south of
what Turner gives it, is probably correct; as Pemberton found that
Turner had put other places in Bhotan twenty miles too far north.
Moreover, in saying that it is visible from Purnea in the plains of
Bengal, Turner refers to Kinchinjunga, whose elevation was then
unknown. Dr. Campbell (&ldquo;Bengal As. Soc. Jour.,&rdquo; 1848),
describes Chumulari from oral information, as an isolated mountain
encircled by twenty-one goompas, and perambulated by pilgrims in
five days; the Lachoong Phipun, on the other hand, who was a Lama,
and well acquainted with the country, affirmed that Chumulari has
many tops, and cannot be perambulated; but that detached peaks near
it may be, and that it is to a temple near one of these that
pilgrims resort. Again, the natives use these names very vaguely,
and as that of Kinchinjunga is often applied equally to all or any
part of the group of snows between the Lachen and Tambur rivers, so
may the term Chumulari have been used vaguely to Captain Turner or
to me. I have been told that an isolated, snow-topped, venerated
mountain rises about twenty miles south of the true Chumulari, and
is called &ldquo;Sakya-khang&rdquo; (Sakya&rsquo;s snowy mountain),
which may be that seen from Dorjiling; but I incline to consider
Campbell&rsquo;s and Waugh&rsquo;s mountain as the one alluded to
by Turner, and it is to it that I here refer as bearing north
115&deg; 30&prime; east from Bhomtso.<br>
&dagger; These are probably the Ghassa mountains of Turners
narrative: bearings which I took of one of the loftiest of them,
from the Khasia mountains, together with those from Bhomtso, would
appear to place it in latitude 28&deg; 10&prime; and longitude
90&deg;, and 200 miles from the former station, and 90&deg; east of
the latter. Its elevation from Bhomtso angles is 24,160 feet. I
presume I also saw Chumulari from the Khasia; the most western peak
seen thence being in the direction of that mountain. Captain R.
Strachey has most kindly paid close attention to these bearings and
distances, and recalculated the distances and heights: no
confidence is, however, to be placed in the results of such minute
angles, taken from immense distances. Owing in part no doubt to
extraordinary refraction, the angles of the Ghassa mountain taken
from the Khasia give it an elevation of 26,500 feet! which is very
much over the truth; and make that of Chumulari still higher: the
distance from my position in the Khasia being 210 miles from
Chumulari! which is probably the utmost limit at which the human
eye has ever discerned a terrestrial object.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 167">[ 167 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">bearings and angular heights from the Khasia
mountains, in Bengal, upwards of 200 miles south-east of its
position.</p>

<p>Turning to the northward, a singular contrast in the view was
presented: the broad sandy valley of the Arun lay a few miles off,
and perhaps 1,500 feet below me; low brown and red ridges, 18,000
to 19,000 feet high, of stony sloping mountains with rocky tops,
divided its feeders, which appeared to be dry, and to occupy flat
sandy valleys. For thirty miles north no mountain was above the
level of the theodolite, and not a particle of snow was to be seen
beyond that, rugged purple-flanked and snowy-topped mountains
girdled the horizon, appearing no nearer than they did from the
Donkia pass, and their angular heights and bearings being almost
the same as from that point of view. The nearer of these are said
to form the Kiang-lah chain, the furthest I was told by different
authorities are in the salt districts north of Jigatzi.</p>

<p>To the north-east was the lofty region traversed by Turner on
his route by the Ramchoo lakes to Teshoo Loombo; its elevation may
be 17,000 feet* above the sea. Beyond it a gorge led through rugged
mountains, by which I was told the Painom river flows north-west to
the Yaru; and at an immense distance to the north-east were the
Khamba mountains, a long blue range, which it is said</p>

<p class="fnote">* It is somewhat remarkable that Turner nowhere
alludes to difficulty of breathing, and in one place only to
head-ache (p. 209) when at these great elevations. This is in a
great measure accounted for by his having been constantly mounted.
I never suffered either in my breathing, head, or stomach when
riding, even when at 18,300 feet.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 168">[ 168 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">divides the Lhassan or &ldquo;U&rdquo; from the
&ldquo;Tsang&rdquo; (or Jigatzi) province of Tibet; it appeared
fully 100 miles off, and was probably much more; it bore from N.
57&deg; E. to N. 70&deg; E., and though so lofty as to be heavily
snowed throughout, was much below the horizon-line of Bhomtso; it
is crossed on the route from Jigatzi, and from Sikkim to Lhassa,*
and is considered very lofty, from affecting the breathing. About
twenty miles to the north-east are some curious red conical
mountains, said to be on the west side of the Ramchoo lakes; they
were unsnowed, and bore N. 45&deg; 30&prime; E. and N. 60&deg;
30&prime; E. A sparingly-snowed group bore N. 26&deg; 30&prime; E.,
and another N. 79&deg; E., the latter being probably that mentioned
by Turner as seen by him from near Giantchi.</p>

<p>But the mountains which appeared both the highest and the most
distant on the northern landscape, were those I described when at
Donkia, as being north of Nepal and beyond the Arun river, and the
culminant peak of which bore N. 55&deg;. Both Dr. Campbell and I
made repeated estimates of its height and distance by the eye;
comparing its size and snow-level with those of the mountains near
us; and assuming 4000 to 5000 feet as the minimum height of its
snowy cap; this would give it an elevation of 23,000 to 25,000
feet. An excellent telescope brought out no features on its flanks
not visible to the naked eye, and by the most careful levellings
with the theodolite, it was depressed more than 0&deg; 7&prime;
below the horizon of Bhomtso, whence the distance must be above 100
miles.</p>

<p>The transparency of the pale-blue atmosphere of these</p>

<p class="fnote">* Lhassa, which lies north-east, may be reached in
ten days from this, with relays of ponies; many mountains are
crossed, where the breath is affected, and few villages are passed
after leaving Giantchi, the &ldquo;Jhansi jeung&rdquo; of
Turner&rsquo;s narrative. See Campbell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Routes from
Dorjiling to Lhassa.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Bengal As. Soc.
Journal.&rdquo;)</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 169">[ 169 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">lofty regions can hardly be described, nor the
clearness and precision with which the most distant objects are
projected against the sky. From having afterwards measured peaks
200 and 210 miles distant from the Khasia mountains, I feel sure
that I underrated the estimates made at Bhomtso, and I have no
hesitation in saying, that the mean elevation of the
sparingly-snowed* watershed between the Yaru and the Arun will be
found to be greater than that of the snowy Himalaya south of it,
and to follow the chain running from Donkia, north of the Arun,
along the Kiang-lah mountains, towards the Nepal frontier, at
Tingri Maidan. No part of that watershed perhaps rises so high as
24,000 feet, but its lowest elevation is probably nowhere under
18,000 feet.</p>

<p>This broad belt of lofty country, north of the snowy Himalaya,
is the Dingcham province of Tibet, and runs along the frontier of
Sikkim, Bhotan, and Nepal. It gives rise to all the Himalayan
rivers, and its mean elevation is probably 15,000 to 15,500 feet:
its general appearance, as seen from greater heights, is that of a
much less mountainous country than the snowy and wet Himalayan
regions; this is because its mean elevation is so enormous, that
ranges of 20,000 to 22,000 feet appear low and insignificant upon
it. The absence of forest and other obstructions to the view, the
breadth and flatness of the valleys, and the undulating character
of the lower ranges that</p>

<p class="fnote">* Were the snow-level in Dingcham, as low as it is
in Sikkim, the whole of Tibet from Donkia almost to the Yaru-Tsampu
river would be everywhere intersected by glaciers and other
impassable barriers of snow and ice, for a breadth of fifty miles,
and the country would have no parallel for amount of snow beyond
the Polar circles. It is impossible to conjecture what would have
been the effects on the climate of northern India and central Asia
under these conditions. When, however, we reflect upon the
evidences of glacial phenomena that abound in all the Himalayan
valleys at and above 9000 feet elevation, it is difficult to avoid
the conclusion that such a state of things once existed, and that
at a comparatively very recent period.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 170">[ 170 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">traverse its surface, give it a comparatively
level appearance, and suggest the term &ldquo;maidan&rdquo; or
&ldquo;plains&rdquo; to the Tibetan, when comparing his country
with the complicated ridges of the deep Sikkim valleys. Here one
may travel for many miles without rising or falling 3000 feet, yet
never descending below 14,000 feet, partly because the flat winding
valleys are followed in preference to exhausting ascents, and
partly because the passes are seldom more than that elevation above
the valleys; whereas, in Sikkim, rises and descents of 6000, and
even 9000 feet, are common in passing from valley to valley,
sometimes in one day&rsquo;s march.</p>

<p>The swarthy races of Dingcham have been elsewhere described;
they are an honest, hospitable, and very hardy people, differing
from the northern Tibetans chiefly in colour, and in invariably
wearing the pigtail, which MM. Huc and Gabet assure us is not usual
in Lhassa.* They are a pastoral race, and Campbell saw a flock of
400 hornless sheep, grazing on short sedges (<i>Carex</i>) and
fescue-grass, in the middle of October, at 18,000 feet above the
sea. An enormous ram attended the flock, whose long hair hung down
to the ground; its back was painted red.</p>

<p>There is neither tree nor shrub in this country; and a very
little wheat (which seldom ripens), barley, turnips, and radishes
are, I believe, the only crops, except occasionally</p>

<p class="fnote">* Amongst Lhassan customs alluded to by these
travellers, is that of the women smearing their faces with a black
pigment, the object of which they affirm to be that they may render
themselves odious to the male sex, and thus avoid temptation. The
custom is common enough, but the real object is to preserve the
skin, which the dry cold wind peels from the face. The pigment is
mutton-fat, blackened, according to Tchebu Lama, with catechu and
other ingredients; but I believe more frequently by the dirt of the
face itself. I fear I do not slander the Tibetan damsels in saying
that personal cleanliness and chastity are both lightly esteemed
amongst them; and as the Lama na&iuml;vely remarked, when
questioned on the subject, &ldquo;the Tibetan women are not so
different from those of other countries as to wish to conceal what
charms they possess.&rdquo;</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 171">[ 171 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">peas. Other legumes, cabbages, etc., are
cultivated in the sheltered valleys of the Yaru feeders, where
great heat is reflected from the rocks; and there also stunted
trees grow, as willows, walnuts, poplars, and perhaps ashes; all of
which, however, are said to be planted and scarce. Even at Teshoo
Loombo and Jigatzi* buckwheat is a rare crop, and only a prostrate
very hardy kind is grown. Clay teapots and pipkins are the most
valuable exports to Sikkim from the latter city, after salt and
soda. Jewels and woollen cloaks are also exported, the latter
especially from Giantchi, which is famous for its woollen fabrics
and mart of ponies.</p>

<p>Of the Yaru river at Jigatzi, which all affirm becomes the
Burrampooter in Assam, I have little information to add to
Turner&rsquo;s description: it is sixty miles north of Bhomtso, and
I assume its elevation to be 13-14,000 feet;&dagger; it takes an
immense bend to the northward after</p>

<p class="fnote">* Digarchi, Jigatzi, or Shigatzi jong (the fort of
Shigatzi) is the capital of the &ldquo;Tsang&rdquo; province, and
Teshoo Loombo is the neighbouring city of temples and monasteries,
the ecclesiastical capital of Tibet, and the abode of the grand
(Teshoo) Lama, or ever-living Boodh. Whether we estimate this man
by the number of his devotees, or the perfect sincerity of their
worship, he is without exception one of the most honoured beings
living in the world. I have assumed the elevation of Jigatzi to be
13&ndash;14,000 feet, using as data Turner&rsquo;s October mean
temperature of Teshoo Loombo, and the decrement for elevation of
400 feet to 1&deg; Fahr.; which my own observations indicate as an
approximation to the truth. Humboldt (&ldquo;Asie Centrale,&rdquo;
iii., p. 223) uses a much smaller multiplier, and infers the
elevation of Teshoo Loombo to be between 9,500 and 10,000 feet. Our
data are far too imperfect to warrant any satisfactory conclusions
on this interesting subject; but the accounts I have received of
the vegetation of the Yaru valley at Jigatzi seem to indicate an
elevation of at least 13,000 feet for the bed of that river. Of the
elevation of Lhassa itself we have no idea: if MM. Huc and
Gabet&rsquo;s statement of the rivers not being frozen there in
March be correct, the climate must be very different from what we
suppose.<br>
&dagger; The Yaru, which approaches the Nepal frontier west of
Tingri, and beyond the great mountain described at vol. i. <a href=
"chap11.html#page 265">p. 265</a>, makes a sweep to the northward,
and turns south to Jigatzi, whence it makes another and greater
bend to the north, and again turning south flows west of Lhassa,
receiving the Kechoo river from that holy city. From Jigatzi it is
said to be navigable to near Lhassa by skin and plank-built boats.
Thence it flows south-east to the Assam frontier, and while still
in Tibet, is said to enter a warm climate, where tea, silk, cotton,
and rice, are grown. Of its course after entering the Assam
Himalaya little is known, and in answer to my enquiries why it had
not been followed, I was always told that the country through which
it flowed was inhabited by tribes of savages, who live on snakes
and vermin, and are fierce and warlike. These are no doubt the
Singpho, Bor and Bor-abor tribes who inhabit the mountains of upper
Assam. A travelling mendicant was once sent to follow up the Dihong
to the Burrampooter, under the joint auspices of Mr. Hodgson and
Major Jenkins, the Commissioner of Assam; but the poor fellow was
speared on the frontier by these savages. The concurrent testimony
of the Assamese, that the Dihong is the Yaru, on its southern
course to become the Burrampooter, renders this point as
conclusively settled as any, resting on mere oral evidence, is
likely to be.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 172">[ 172 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">passing Jigatzi, and again turns south, flowing to
the west of Lhassa, and at some distance from that capital. Lhassa,
as all agree, is at a much lower elevation than Jigatzi; and
apricots (whose ripe stones Dr. Campbell procured for me) and
walnuts are said to ripen there, and the Dama or Himalayan furze
(<i>Caragana</i>), is said to grow there. The Bactrian camel also
thrives and breeds at Lhassa, together with a small variety of cow
(not the yak), both signs of a much more temperate climate than
Jigatzi enjoys. It is, however, a remarkable fact that there are
two tame elephants near the latter city, kept by the Teshoo Lama.
They were taken to Jigatzi, through Bhotan, by Phari; and I have
been informed that they have become clothed with long hair, owing
to the cold of the climate; but Tchebu Lama contradicted this,
adding, that his countrymen were so credulous, that they would
believe blankets grew on the elephants&rsquo; backs, if the Lamas
told them so.</p>

<p>No village or house is seen throughout the extensive area over
which the eye roams from Bhomtso, and the general character of the
desolate landscape was similar to that which I have described as
seen from Donkia Pass (<a href="chap22.html#page 124">p. 124</a>).
The wild ass* grazing with its foal on the sloping downs,</p>

<p class="fnote">* This, the <i>Equus Hemionus</i> of Pallas, the
untameable Kiang of Tibet, abounds in Dingcham, and we saw several.
It resembles the ass more than the horse, from its size, heavy
head, small limbs, thin tail, and the stripe over the shoulder. The
flesh is eaten and much liked. The Kiang-lah mountains are so named
from their being a great resort of this creature. It differs widely
from the wild ass of Persia, Sind, and Beloochistan, but is
undoubtedly the same as the Siberian animal.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 173">[ 173 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the hare bounding over the stony soil, the
antelope scouring the sandy flats, and the fox stealing along to
his burrow, are all desert and Tartarian types of the animal
creation. The shrill whistle of the marmot alone breaks the silence
of the scene, recalling the snows of Lapland to the mind; the kite
and raven wheel through the air, 1000 feet over head, with as
strong and steady a pinion as if that atmosphere possessed the same
power of resistance that it does at the level of the sea. Still
higher in the heavens, long black V-shaped trains of wild geese
cleave the air, shooting over the glacier-crowned top of
Kinchinjhow, and winging their flight in one day, perhaps, from the
Yaru to the Ganges, over 500 miles of space, and through 22,000
feet of elevation. One plant alone, the yellow lichen
(<i>Borrera</i>), is found at this height, and only as a visitor;
for, Tartar-like, it emigrates over these lofty slopes and ridges,
blown about by the violent winds. I found a small beetle on the
very top,* probably blown up also, for it was a flower-feeder, and
seemed benumbed with cold.</p>

<p>Every night that we spent in Tibet, we enjoyed a magnificent
display of sunbeams converging to the east, and making a false
sunset. I detailed this phenomenon when seen from the Kymore
mountains, and I repeatedly saw it again in the Khasia, but never
in the Sikkim Himalaya, whence I assume that it is most frequent in
mountain plateaus. As the sun set, broad purple beams rose from a
dark, low, leaden bank on the eastern horizon, and spreading up to
the zenith, covered the intervening space: they lasted through the
twilight, from fifteen to twenty minutes, fading gradually into the
blackness of</p>

<p class="fnote">* I observed a small red <i>Acarus</i> (mite) at
this elevation, both on Donkia and Kinchinjhow, which reminds me
that I found a species of the same genus at Cockburn Island (in
latitude 64&deg; south, longitude 64&deg; 49&prime; west). This
genus hence inhabits a higher southern latitude than any other land
animal attains.</p>

<p class="first">night. I looked in vain for the beautiful lancet
beam of the zodiacal light; its position was obscured by
Chomiomo.</p>

<p>On the 18th of October we had another brilliant morning, after a
cold night, the temperature having fallen to 4&deg;. I took the
altitude of Yeumtso by carefully boiling two thermometers, and the
result was 16,279 feet, the barometrical observations giving 16,808
feet. I removed a thermometer sunk three feet in the gravelly soil,
which showed a temperature of 43&deg;,* which is 12&middot;7&deg;
above the mean temperature of the two days we camped here.</p>

<p>Our fires were made of dry yak droppings which soon burn out
with a fierce flame, and much black smoke; they give a disagreeable
taste to whatever is cooked with them.</p>

<p>Having sent the coolies forward to Cholamoo lake, we re-ascended
Bhomtso to verify my observations. As on the previous occasion a
violent dry north-west wind blew, peeling the skin from our faces,
loading the air with grains of sand, and rendering theodolite
observations very uncertain; besides injuring all my instruments,
and exposing them to great risk of breakage.</p>

<p>The Tibetan Sepoys did not at all understand our ascending
Bhomtso a second time; they ran after Campbell, who was ahead on a
stout pony, girding up their long garments, bracing their
matchlocks tight over their shoulders, and gasping for breath at
every step, the long horns of their muskets bobbing up and down as
they toiled amongst the rocks. When I reached the top I found
Campbell seated behind a little stone wall which he had raised to
keep off the violent wind, and the uncouth warriors in a circle
round him, puzzled beyond measure at his admiration of the view. My
instruments perplexed them extremely, and in crowding round me,
they</p>

<p class="fnote">* It had risen to 43&middot;5&deg; during the
previous day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">broke my azimuth compass. They left us to
ourselves when the fire I made to boil the thermometers went out,
the wind being intensely cold. I had given my barometer to one of
Campbell&rsquo;s men to carry, who not coming up, the latter kindly
went to search for him, and found him on the ground quite knocked
up and stupified by the cold, and there, if left alone, he would
have lain till overtaken by death.</p>

<p>The barometer on the summit of Bhomtso stood at 15&middot;548
inches;* the temperature between 11.30 a.m. and 2.30 p.m.
fluctuated between 44&deg; and 56&deg;: this was very high for so
great an elevation, and no doubt due to the power of the sun on the
sterile soil, and consequent radiated heat. The tension of vapour
was &middot;0763, and the dew-point was 5&middot;8&deg;, or
43&middot;5&deg; below the temperature of the air. Such
extraordinary dryness&dagger; and consequent evaporation, increased
by the violent wind, sufficiently accounts for the height of the
snow line; in further evidence of which, I may add that a piece of
ice or snow laid on the ground here, does not melt, but disappears
by evaporation.</p>

<p>The difference between the dry cold air of this elevation and
that of the heated plains of India, is very great. During the
driest winds of the Terai, in spring, the temperature is 80&deg; to
90&deg;, the tension of vapour is .400 to .500, with a dew-point
22&deg; below the temperature, and upwards of six grains of vapour
are suspended in the cubic foot of air; a thick haze obscures the
heavens, and clouds of dust rise high in the air; here on the other
hand (probably</p>

<p class="fnote">* The elevation of Bhomtso, worked by
Bessel&rsquo;s tables, and using corrected observations of the
Calcutta barometer for the lower station, is 18,590 feet. The
corresponding dew-point 4&middot;4&deg; (49&middot;6&deg; below
that of the air at the time of observation). By Oltmann&rsquo;s
tables the elevation is 18,540 feet. The elevation by boiling water
is 18,305.<br>
&dagger; The weight of vapour in a cubic foot of air was no more
than &middot;087 of a grain, and the saturation-point
&middot;208.</p>

<p class="first">owing to the rarity of the atmosphere and the low
tension of its vapours), the drought is accompanied by perfect
transparency, and the atmosphere is too attenuated to support the
dust raised by the wind.</p>

<p>We descended in the afternoon, and on our way up the Lachen
valley examined a narrow gulley in a lofty red spur from
Kinchinjhow, where black shales were <i>in situ,</i> striking
north-east, and dipping north-west 45&deg;. These shales were
interposed between beds of yellow quartz conglomerate, upon the
latter of which rested a talus of earthy rocks, angular fragments
of which were strewed about opposite this spur, but were not seen
elsewhere.</p>

<p>It became dark before we reached the Cholamoo lake, where we
lost our way amongst glaciers, moraines, and marshes. We expected
to have seen the lights of the camp, but were disappointed, and as
it was freezing hard, we began to be anxious, and shouted till the
echos of our voices against the opposite bank were heard by Tchebu
Lama, who met us in great alarm for our safety. Our camp was
pitched some way from the shore, on a broad plain, 16,900 feet
above the sea.* A cold wind descended from Donkia; yet, though more
elevated than Yeumtso, the climate of Cholamoo, from being damper
and misty, was milder. The minimum thermometer fell to 14&deg;.</p>

<p>Before starting for Donkia pass on the following morning, we
visited some black rocks which rose from the flat to the east of
the lake. They proved to be of fossiliferous limestone, the strata
of which were much disturbed: the strike</p>

<p class="fnote">* This, which is about the level of the lake,
gives the Lachen river a fall of about 1,500 feet between its
source and Kongra Lama, or sixty feet per mile following its
windings. From Kongra Lama to Tallum it is 140 feet per mile; from
Tallum to Singtam 160 feet; and from Singtam to the plains of India
50 feet per mile. The total fall from Cholamoo lake to its exit on
the plains of India is eighty-five feet per mile. Its length,
following its windings, is 195 miles, upwards of double the direct
distance.</p>

<p class="first">appeared in one part north-west, and the dip
north-east 45&deg;: a large fault passed east by north through the
cliff, and it was further cleft by joints running northwards. The
cliff was not 100 yards long, and was about 70 thick; its surface
was shivered by frost into cubical masses, and glacial boulders of
gneiss lay on the top. The limestone rock was chiefly a blue
pisolite conglomerate, with veins and crystals of white carbonate
of lime, seams of shale, and iron pyrites. A part was compact and
blue, very crystalline, and full of encrinitic fossils, and
probably nummulites, but all were too much altered for
determination.</p>

<p>This, from its mineral characters, appears to be the same
limestone formation which occurs throughout the Himalaya and
Western Tibet; but the fossils I collected are in too imperfect a
state to warrant any conclusions on this subject. Its occurrence
immediately to the northward of the snowy mountains, and in such
very small quantities, are very remarkable facts. The neighbouring
rocks of Donkia were gneiss with granite veins, also striking
north-west and dipping north-east 10&deg;, as if they overlay the
limestone, but here as in all similar situations there was great
confusion of the strata, and variation in direction and strike.</p>

<p>And here I may once for all confess that though I believe the
general strike of the rocks on this frontier to be north-west, and
the dip north-east, I am unable to affirm it positively; for though
I took every opportunity of studying the subject, and devoted many
hours to the careful measuring and recording of dips and strikes,
on both faces of Kinchinjhow, Donkia, Bhomtso, and Kongra Lama, I
am unable to reduce these to any intelligible system.*</p>

<p>The coolies of Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s party were completely</p>

the north-west Himalaya generally, and throughout Western Tibet,
Kashmir, etc., according to Dr. Thomson.</p>

<p class="first">knocked up by the rarified air; they had taken a
whole day to march here from Yeumtso, scarcely six miles, and could
eat no food at night. A Lama of our party offered up prayers* to
Kinchinjhow for the recovery of a stout Lepcha lad (called Nurko),
who showed no signs of animation, and had all the symptoms of
serous apoplexy. The Lama perched a saddle on a stone, and burning
incense before it, scattered rice to the winds, invoking Kinchin,
Donkia, and all the neighbouring peaks. A strong dose of calomel
and jalap, which we poured down the sick lad&rsquo;s throat,
contributed materially to the success of these incantations.</p>

<p>The Tibetan Sepoys were getting tired of our delays, which so
much favoured my operations; but though showing signs of impatience
and sulkiness, they behaved well to the last; taking the sick man
to the top of the pass on their yaks, and assisting all the party:
nothing, however, would induce them to cross into Sikkim, which
they considered as &ldquo;Company&rsquo;s territory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before proceeding to the pass, I turned off to the east, and
re-ascended Donkia to upwards of 19,000 feet, vainly hoping to get
a more distant view, and other bearings of the Tibetan mountains.
The ascent was over enormous piles of loose rocks split by the
frost, and was extremely fatiguing. I reached a peak overhanging a
steep precipice, at whose base were small lakes and glaciers, from
which flowed several sources of the Lachen, afterwards swelled by
the great affluent from Cholamoo lake. A few rocks striking
north-east and dipping north-west, projected</p>

Propitiatory offerings are made to the deities of these elements,
but never sacrifices.</p>

<p class="first">at the very summit, with frozen snow amongst them,
beyond which the ice and precipices rendered it impossible to
proceed: but though exposed to the north, there was no perpetual
snow in the ordinary acceptation of the term, and an arctic
European lichen (<i>Lecidea oreina</i>) grew on the top, so faintly
discolouring the rocks as hardly to be detected without a
magnifying-glass.</p>

<p>I descended obliquely, down a very steep slope of 35&deg;, over
upwards of a thousand feet of d&eacute;bris, the blocks on which
were so loosely poised on one another, that it was necessary to
proceed with the utmost circumspection, for I was alone, and a
false step would almost certainly have been followed by breaking a
leg. The alternate freezing and thawing of rain amongst these
masses, must produce a constant downward motion in the whole pile
of d&eacute;bris (which was upwards of 2000 feet high), and may
account for the otherwise unexplained phenomenon of continuous
shoots of angular rocks reposing on very gentle slopes in other
places.*</p>

<p>The north ascent to the Donkia pass is by a path well selected
amongst immense angular masses of rock, and over vast piles of
d&eacute;bris: the strike on this, the north face, was again
north-east, and dip north-west: I arrived at the top at 3 p.m.,
throughly fatigued, and found my faithful Lepcha lads (Cheytoong
and Bassebo) nestling under a rock with my theodolite and
barometers, having been awaiting my arrival in the biting wind for
three hours. My pony stood there too, the picture of patience, and
laden with</p>

blocks that fill gently sloping broad valleys several miles long,
in the Falkland Islands, be thus explained? (See
&ldquo;Darwin&rsquo;s Journal,&rdquo; in Murray&rsquo;s Home and
Col. Lib.) The extraordinary shifting in the position of my
thermometer left among the rocks of the Donkia pass (see <a href=
"chap22.html#page 129">p. 129</a>), and the mobile state of the
slopes I descended on this occasion, first suggested this
explanation to me. When in the Falkland Islands I was wholly unable
to offer any explanation of the phenomenon there, to which my
attention had been drawn by Mr. Darwin&rsquo;s narrative.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 180">[ 180 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">minerals. After repeating my observations, I
proceeded to Momay Samdong, where I arrived after dusk. I left a
small bottle of brandy and some biscuits with the lads, and it was
well I did so, for the pony knocked up before reaching Momay, and
rather than leave my bags of stones, they passed the night by the
warm flank of the beast, under a rock at 18,000 feet elevation,
without other food, fire, or shelter.</p>

<p>I found my companion encamped at Momay, on the spot I had
occupied in September; he had had the utmost difficulty in getting
his coolies on, as they threw down their light loads in despair,
and lying with their faces to the ground, had to be roused from a
lethargy that would soon have been followed by death.</p>

<p>We rested for a day at Momay, and on the 20th, attempted to
ascend to the Donkia glacier, but were driven back by a heavy
snow-storm. The scenery on arriving here, presented a wide
difference to that we had left; snow lying at 16,500 feet, whereas
immediately to the north of the same mountain there was none at
19,000 feet. Before leaving Momay; I sealed two small glass flasks
containing the air of this elevation, by closing with a spirit lamp
a very fine capillary tube, which formed the opening to each;
avoiding the possibility of heating the contents by the hand or
otherwise. The result of its analysis by Mr. Muller (who sent me
the prepared flasks), was that it contained 36&middot;538 per cent.
in volume of oxygen; whereas his repeated analysis of the air of
Calcutta gives 21 per cent. Such a result is too anomalous to be
considered satisfactory.</p>

<p>I again visited the Kinchinjhow glacier and hot springs; the
water had exactly the same temperature as in the previous month,
though the mean temperature of the air was 8&deg; or 9&deg; lower.
The minimum thermometer fell to 22&deg;, being 10&deg; lower than
it ever fell in September.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 181">[ 181 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">We descended to Yeumtong in a cold drizzle,
arriving by sunset; we remained through the following day, hoping
to explore the lower glacier on the opposite side of the valley:
which, however, the weather entirely prevented. I have before
mentioned (<a href="chap23.html#page 140">p. 140</a>) that in
descending in autumn from the drier and more sunny rearward Sikkim
valleys, the vegetation is found to be most backward in the lowest
and dampest regions. On this occasion, I found asters, grasses,
polygonums, and other plants that were withered, brown, and seeding
at Momay (14,000 to 15,000 feet), at Yeumtong (12,000 feet) green
and unripe; and 2000 feet lower still, at Lachoong, the contrast
was even more marked. Thus the short backward spring and summer of
the Arctic zone is overtaken by an early and forward seed-time and
winter: so far as regards the effects of mean temperature, the
warmer station is in autumn more backward than the colder. This is
everywhere obvious in the prevalent plants of each, and is
especially recognisable in the rhododendrons; as the following
table shows:&mdash;</p>

<font size="-1">16,000 to 17,000 feet, <i>R. nivale</i> flowers in
July;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fruits in September=2 months.<br>
13,000 to 14,000 feet, <i>R. anthopogon</i> flowers in June;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fruits in Oct.=4 months.<br>
11,000 to 12,000 feet, <i>R. campanulatum</i> flowers in May;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fruits in Nov.=8 months.<br>
8,000 to 9,000 feet, <i>R. argenteum</i> flowers in April;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fruits in Dec.=8 months.</font><br>
<br>
<br>
<p class="first">And so it is with many species of <i>
Composit&aelig;</i> and <i>Umbellifer&aelig;,</i> and indeed of all
natural orders, some of which I have on the same day gathered in
ripe fruit at 13,000 to 14,000 feet, and found still in flower at
9000 to 10,000 feet. The brighter skies and more powerful and
frequent solar radiation at the greater elevations, account for
this apparent inversion of the order of nature.*</p>

<p class="fnote">* The distribution of the seasons at different
elevations in the Himalaya gives rise to some anomalies that have
puzzled naturalists. From the middle of October to that of May,
vegetation is torpid above 14,000 feet, and indeed almost uniformly
covered with snow. From November till the middle of April,
vegetation is also torpid above 10,000 feet, except that a few
trees and bushes do not ripen all their seeds till December. The
three winter months (December, January, and February) are all but
dead above 6000 feet, the earliest appearance of spring at
Dorjiling (7000 feet) being at the sudden accession of heat in
March. From May till August the vegetation at each elevation is (in
ascending order) a month behind that below it; 4000 feet being
about equal to a month of summer weather in one sense. I mean by
this, that the genera and natural orders (and sometimes the
species) which flower at 8000 feet in May, are not so forward at
12,000 feet till June, nor at 16,000 feet till July. After August,
however, the reverse holds good; then the vegetation is as forward
at 16,000 feet as at 8000 feet. By the end of September most of the
natural orders and genera have ripened their fruit in the upper
zone, though they have flowered as late as July; whereas October is
the fruiting month at 12,000, and November below 10,000 feet. Dr.
Thomson does not consider that the more sunny climate of the
loftier elevations sufficiently accounts for this, and adds the
stimulus of cold, which must act by checking the vegetative organs
and hastening maturation.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 182">[ 182 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">I was disappointed at finding the rhododendron
seeds still immature at Yeumtong, for I was doubtful whether the
same kinds might be met with at the Chola pass, which I had yet to
visit; besides which, their tardy maturation threatened to delay me
for an indefinite period in the country. <i>Viburnum</i> and <i>
Lonicera,</i> however, were ripe and abundant; the fruits of both
are considered poisonous in Europe, but here the black berries of a
species of the former (called &ldquo;Nalum&rdquo;) are eatable and
agreeable; as are those of a <i>Gualtheria,</i> which are pale
blue, and called &ldquo;Kalumbo.&rdquo; Except these, and the
cherry mentioned above, there are no other autumnal fruits above
10,000 feet: brambles, strange as it may appear, do not ascend
beyond that elevation in the Sikkim Himalaya, though so abundant
below it, both in species and individuals, and though so typical of
northern Europe.</p>

<p>At Lachoong we found all the yaks that had been grazing till the
end of September at the higher elevations, and the Phipun presented
our men with one of a gigantic size, and proportionally old and
tough. The Lepchas</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 183">[ 183 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">barbarously slaughtered it with arrows, and
feasted on the flesh and entrails, singed and fried the skin, and
made soup of the bones, leaving nothing but the horns and hoofs.
Having a fine day, they prepared some as jerked meat, cutting it
into thin strips, which they dried on the rocks. This (called
&ldquo;Schat-chew,&rdquo; dried meat) is a very common and
favourite food in Tibet, I found it palatable; but on the other
hand, the dried saddles of mutton, of which they boast so much,
taste so strongly of tallow, that I found it impossible to swallow
a morsel of them.*</p>

<p>We staid two days at Lachoong, two of my lads being again laid
up with fever; one of them had been similarly attacked at the same
place nearly two months before: the other lad had been repeatedly
ill since June, and at all elevations. Both cases were returns of a
fever caught in the low unhealthy valleys some months previously,
and excited by exposure and hardship. The vegetation at Lachoong
was still beautiful, and the weather mild, though snow had
descended to 14,000 feet on Tunkra. <i>Composit&aelig;</i> were
abundantly in flower, apples</p>

<p class="fnote">* Raw dried split fish are abundantly cured
(without salt) in Tibet; they are caught in the Yaru and great
lakes of Ramchoo, Dobtah, and Yarbru, and are chiefly carp, and
allied fish, which attain a large size. It is one of the most
remarkable facts in the zoology of Asia, that no trout or salmon
inhabits any of the rivers that d&eacute;bouche into the Indian
Ocean (the so-called Himalayan trout is a species of carp). This
widely distributed natural order of fish (<i>Salmonid&aelig;</i>)
is however, found in the Oxus, and in all the rivers of central
Asia that flow north and west, and the <i>Salmo orientalis,</i>
M&rsquo;Clelland (&ldquo;Calcutta Journ. Nat. Hist.&rdquo; iii., p.
283), was caught by Mr. Griffith (Journals, p. 404) in the Bamean
river (north of the Hindo Koosh) which flows into the Oxus, and
whose waters are separated by one narrow mountain ridge from those
of the feeders of the Indus. The central Himalayan rivers often
rise in Tibet from lakes full of fish, but have none (at least
during the rains) in that rapid part of their course from 10,000 to
14,000 feet elevation: below that fish abound, but I believe
invariably of different species from those found at the sources of
the same rivers. The nature of the tropical ocean into which all
the Himalayan rivers d&eacute;bouche, is no doubt the proximate
cause of the absence of <i>Salmonid&aelig;.</i> Sir John Richardson
(Fishes of China Seas, etc., &ldquo;in Brit. Ass. Rep.
etc.&rdquo;), says that no species of the order has been found in
the Chinese or eastern Asiatic seas.</p>

<p>I here found that I had lost a thermometer for high
temperatures, owing to a hole in the bag in which Cheytoong carried
those of my instruments which were in constant use. It had been
last used at the hot springs of the Kinchinjhow glacier; and the
poor lad was so concerned at his mishap, that he came to me soon
afterwards, with his blanket on his back, and a few handfuls of
rice in a bag, to make his salaam before setting out to search for
it. There was not now a single inhabitant between Lachoong and that
dreary spot, and strongly against my wish he started, without a
companion. Three days afterwards he overtook us at Keadom, radiant
with joy at having found the instrument: he had gone up to the hot
springs, and vainly sought around them that evening; then rather
than lose the chance of a day-light search on his way back, he had
spent the cold October night in the hot water, without fire or
shelter, at 16,000 feet above the sea. Next morning his search was
again fruitless; and he was returning disconsolate, when he
descried the brass case glistening between two planks of the bridge
crossing the river at Momay, over which torrent the instrument was
suspended. The Lepchas have generally been considered timorous of
evil spirits, and especially averse to travelling at night, even in
company. However little this gallant lad may have been given to
superstition, he was nevertheless a Lepcha, born in a warm region,
and had never faced the cold till he became my servant; and it
required a stout heart and an honest one, to spend a night in so
awful a solitude as that which reigns around the foot of the
Kinchinjhow glacier.*</p>

<p class="fnote">* The fondness of natives for hot springs wherever
they occur is very natural and has been noticed by Humboldt,
&ldquo;Pers. Narr.&rdquo; iv. 195, who states that on Christianity
being introduced into Iceland, the natives refused to be baptised
in any but the water of the Geysers. I have mentioned at <a href=
"chap22.html#page 117">p. 117</a> the uses to which the Yeumtong
hot springs are put; and the custom of using artificial hot baths
is noticed at vol. i., <a href="chap13.html#page 305">page

<p>The villagers at Keadom, where we slept on the 26th, were busy
cutting the crops of millet, maize, and <i>Amaranthus.</i> A girl
who, on my way down the previous month, had observed my curiosity
about a singular variety of the maize, had preserved the heads on
their ripening, and now brought them to me. The peaches were all
gathered, and though only half ripe, were better than Dorjiling
produce. A magnificent tree of <i>Bucklandia,</i> one of the most
beautiful evergreens in Sikkim, grew near this village; it had a
trunk twenty-one feet seven inches in girth, at five feet from the
ground, and was unbranched for forty feet.* Ferns and the beautiful
air-plant <i>C&oelig;logyne Wallichii</i> grew on its branches,
with other orchids, while <i>Clematis</i> and <i>Stauntonia</i>
climbed the trunk. Such great names (Buckland, Staunton, and
Wallich) thus brought before the traveller&rsquo;s notice, never
failed to excite lively and pleasing emotions: it is the ignorant
and unfeeling alone who can ridicule the association of the names
of travellers and naturalists with those of animals and plants.</p>

<p>We arrived at Choongtam (for the fourth time) at noon, and took
up our quarters in a good house near the temple. The autumn and
winter flowering plants now prevailed here, such as <i>
Labiat&aelig;,</i> which are generally late at this</p>

<p class="fnote">* This superb tree is a great desideratum in our
gardens; I believe it would thrive in the warm west of England. Its
wood is brown, and not valuable as timber, but the thick, bright,
glossy, evergreen foliage is particularly handsome, and so is the
form of the crown. It is also interesting in a physiological point
of view, from the woody fibre being studded with those curious
microscopic discs so characteristic of pines, and which when
occurring on fossil wood are considered conclusive as to the
natural family to which such woods belong. Geologists should bear
in mind that not only does the whole natural order to which <i>
Bucklandia</i> belongs, possess this character, but also various
species of <i>Magnoliace&aelig;</i> found in India, Australia,
Borneo, and South America.</p>

<p class="first">elevation; and grasses, which, though rare in the
damp forest regions, are so common on these slopes that I here
gathered twenty-six kinds. I spent a day here in order to collect
seeds of the superb rhododendrons* which I had discovered in May,
growing on the hills behind. The ascent was now difficult, from the
length of the wiry grass, which rendered the slopes so slippery
that it was impossible to ascend without holding on by the
tussocks.</p>

<p>A ragged Tibetan mendicant (Phud) was amusing the people: he put
on a black mask with cowrie shells for eyes, and danced uncouth
figures with a kind of heel and toe shuffle, in excellent time, to
rude Tibetan songs of his own: for this he received ample alms,
which a little boy collected in a wallet. These vagrants live well
upon charity; they bless, curse, and transact little affairs of all
kinds up and down the valleys of Sikkim and Tibet; this one dealt
in red clay teapots, sheep and puppies.</p>

<p>We found Meepo at Choongtam: I had given him leave (when here
last) to go back to the Rajah, and to visit his wife; and he had
returned with instructions to conduct me to the Chola and Yakla
passes, in Eastern Sikkim. These passes, like that of Tunkra (<a
href="chap22.html#page 110">p. 110</a>), lead over the Chola range
to that part of Tibet which is interposed between Sikkim and
Bhotan. My road lay past the Rajah&rsquo;s residence, which we
considered very fortunate, as apparently affording Campbell an
opportunity of a conference with his highness, for which both he
and the Tchebu Lama were most anxious.</p>

<p>On the way down the Lachen-Lachoong, we found the valley still
flooded (as described at <a href="chap18.html#page 20">p. 20</a>
and <a href="chap23.html#page 146">p. 146</a>), and the alders
standing with their trunks twelve feet under water;</p>

<p class="fnote">* These Rhododendrons are now all flourishing at
Kew and elsewhere: they are <i>R. Dalhousi&aelig;, arboreum,
Maddeni, Edgeworthii, Aucklandii</i> and <i>virgatum.</i></p>

<p class="first">but the shingle dam was now dry and hard: it would
probably soften, and be carried away by the first rains of the
following year. I left here the temperate flora of northern Sikkim,
tropical forms commencing to appear: of these the nettle tribe were
most numerous in the woods. A large grape, with beautiful clusters
of round purple berries, was very fair eating; it is not the common
vine of Europe, which nevertheless is probably an Himalayan plant,
the <i>Vitis Indica.</i>*</p>

<p class="fnote">* The origin of the common grape being unknown, it
becomes a curious question to decide whether the Himalayan <i>Vitis
Indica</i> is the wild state of that plant: an hypothesis
strengthened by the fact of Bacchus, etc., having come from the
East.</p>

<p>At Chakoong the temperature of the river, which in May was
54&deg;, was now 51&middot;5&deg; at 3 p.m. We did not halt here,
but proceeded to Namgah, a very long and fatiguing march. Thence a
short march took us to Singtam, which we reached on the 30th of
October. The road by which I had come up was for half the distance
obliterated in most parts by landslips,* but they were hard and
dry, and the leeches were gone.</p>

<p>Bad weather, and Campbell&rsquo;s correspondence with the
Durbar, who prevented all communication with the Rajah, detained us
here two days, after which we crossed to the Teesta valley, and
continued along its east bank to Tucheam, 2000 feet above the
river. We obtained a magnificent view of the east face of
Kinchinjunga, its tops bearing respectively N. 62&deg; W., and N.
63&deg; W.: the south slope of the snowed portion in profile was
34&deg;, and of the north 40&deg;; but both appeared much steeper
to the eye, when unaided by an instrument.</p>

<p>The great shrubby nettle (<i>Urtica crenulata</i>) is common
here: this plant, called &ldquo;Mealum-ma,&rdquo; attains fifteen
feet in height; it has broad glossy leaves, and though apparently
without stings, is held in so great dread,&dagger; that</p>

<p class="fnote">* I took a number of dips and strikes of the
micaceous rocks: the strike of these was as often north-east as
north-west; it was ever varying, and the strata were so disturbed,
as materially to increase the number and vast dimensions of the
landslips.<br>
&dagger; The stinging hairs are microscopic, and confined to the
young shoots, leaf and flower-stalks. Leschenault de la Tour
describes being stung by this nettle on three fingers of his hand
only at the Calcutta Botanical Gardens, and the subsequent sneezing
and running at the nose, followed by tetanic symptoms and two
days&rsquo; suffering, nor did the effects disappear for nine days.
It is a remarkable fact that the plant stings violently only at
this season. I frequently gathered it with impunity on subsequent
occasions, and suspected some inaccuracy in my observations; but in
Silhet both Dr. Thomson and I experienced the same effects in
autumn. Endlicher (&ldquo;Lindley&rsquo;s Vegetable Kingdom&rdquo;)
attributes the causticity of nettle-juice to bicarbonate of
ammonia, which Dr. Thomson and I ascertained was certainly not
present in this species.</p>

<p class="first">I had difficulty in getting help to cut it down. I
gathered many specimens without allowing any part to touch my skin;
still the scentless effluvium was so powerful, that mucous matter
poured from my eyes and nose all the rest of the afternoon, in such
abundance, that I had to hold my head over a basin for an hour. The
sting is very virulent, producing inflammation; and to punish a
child with &ldquo;Mealum-ma&rdquo; is the severest Lepcha threat.
Violent fevers and death have been said to ensue from its sting;
but this I very much doubt.</p>
