<br>
<p class="first">On the 20th of September I ascended to the great
Donkia glaciers, east of Momay; the valley is much longer than that
leading to the Kinchinjhow glacier, and at 16,000 or 17,000 feet
elevation, containing four marshes or lakes, alternating with as
many transverse moraines that have dammed the river. These moraines
seem in some cases to have been deposited where rocks in the bed of
the valley obstructed the downward progress of the ancient glacier;
hence, when this latter finally retired, it rested at these
obstructions, and accumulated there great deposits, which do not
cross the valley, but project from each side obliquely into it. The
rocks <i>in situ</i> on the floor of the valley are all <i>
moutonn&eacute;ed</i> and polished on the top, sides, and face
looking up the valley, but are rugged on</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 137">[ 137 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">that looking down it: gigantic blocks are poised
on some. The lowest of the ancient moraines completely crosses the
river, which finds, its way between the boulders.</p>

<p>Under the red cliff of Forked Donkia the valley becomes very
broad, bare, and gravelly, with a confusion of moraines, and turns
more northwards. At the angle, the present terminal moraine rises
like a mountain (I assumed it to be about 800 feet high),* and
crosses the valley from N.N.E. to S.S.W. From the summit, which
rises above the level of the glacier, and from which I assume its
present retirement, a most striking scene opened. The ice filling
an immense basin, several miles broad and long, formed a low
dome,&dagger; with Forked Donkia on the west, and a serried range
of rusty-red scarped mountains, 20,000 feet high on the north and
east, separating large tributary glaciers. Other still loftier tops
of Donkia appeared behind these, upwards of 22,000 feet high, but I
could not recognise the true summit (23,176 feet). The surface was
very rugged, and so deeply honey-combed that the foot often sank
from six to eight inches in</p>

<p class="fnote">* This is the largest and longest terminal moraine
backed by an existing glacier that I examined with care: I doubt
its being so high as the moraine of the Allalein glacier below the
Mat-maark sea in the Sachs valley (Valais, Switzerland); but it is
impossible to compare such objects from memory: the Donkia one was
much the most uniform in height.<br>
&dagger; This convexity of the ice is particularly alluded to by
Forbes (&ldquo;Travels in the Alps,&rdquo; p.386), as the
&ldquo;renfl&eacute;ment&rdquo; of Rendu and &ldquo;surface
bombee&rdquo; of Agassiz, and is attributed to the effects of
hydrostatic pressure tending to press the lower layers of ice
upwards to the surface. My own impression at the time was, that the
convexity of the surface of the Donkia glacier was due to a
subjacent mountain spur running south from Donkia itself. I know,
however, far too little of the topography of this glacier to
advance such a conjecture with any confidence. In this case, as in
all similar ones, broad expanses being covered to an enormous depth
with ice, the surface of the latter must in some degree be modified
by the ridges and valleys it conceals. The typical &ldquo;surface
bombee,&rdquo; which is conspicuous in the Himalaya glaciers, I was
wont (in my ignorance of the mechanical laws of glaciers) to
attribute to the more rapid melting of the edges of the glacier by
the radiated heat of its lateral moraines and of the flanks of the
valley that it occupies.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 138">[ 138 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">crisp wet ice. I proceeded a mile on it, with much
more difficulty than on any Swiss glacier: this was owing to the
elevation, and the corrosion of the surface into pits and pools of
water; the crevasses being but few and distant. I saw no dirt-bands
on looking down upon it from a point I attained under the red cliff
of Forked Donkia, at an elevation of 18,307 feet by barometer, and
18,597 by boiling-point. The weather was very cold, the thermometer
fell from 41&deg; to 34&deg;, and it snowed heavily after 3
p.m.</p>

<p>The strike of all the rocks (gneiss with granite veins) seemed
to be north-east, and dip north-west 30&deg;. Such also were the
strike and dip on another spur from Donkia, north of this, which I
ascended to 19,000 feet, on the 26th of September: it abutted on
the scarped precipices, 3000 feet high, of that mountain. I had
been attracted to the spot by its bright orange-red colour, which I
found to be caused by peroxide of iron. The highly crystalline
nature of the rocks, at these great elevations, is due to the
action of veins of fine-grained granite, which sometimes alter the
gneiss to such an extent that it appears as if fused into a fine
granite, with distinct crystals of quartz and felspar; the most
quartzy layers are then roughly crystallized into prisms, or their
particles are aggregated into spheres composed of concentric layers
of radiating crystals, as is often seen in agates. The
rearrangement of the mineral constituents by heat goes on here just
as in trap, cavities filled with crystals being formed in rocks
exposed to great heat and pressure. Where mica abounds, it becomes
black and metallic; and the aluminous matter is crystallised in the
form of garnets.</p>

<p>At these great heights the weather was never fine for more than
an hour at a time, and a driving sleet followed by thick snow drove
me down on both these occasions.</p>

<p class="first">Another time I ascended a third spur from this
great mountain, and was overtaken by a heavy gale and thunderstorm,
the latter is a rare phenomenon: it blew down my tripod and
instruments which I had thought securely Propped with stones, and
the thermometers were broken, but fortunately not the barometer. On
picking up the latter, which lay with its top down the hill, a
large bubble of air appeared, which I passed up and down the tube,
and then allowed to escape; when I heard a rattling of broken glass
in the cistern. Having another barometer*</p>

<p class="fnote">* This barometer (one of Newman&rsquo;s portable
instruments) I have now at Kew: it was compared with the Royal
Society&rsquo;s standard before leaving England; and varied
according to comparisons made with the Calcutta standard
0&middot;.012 during its travels; on leaving Calcutta its error was
0; and on arriving in England, by the standard of the Royal
Society, +&middot;004. I have given in the Appendix some remarks on
the use of these barometers, which (though they have obvious
defects), are less liable to derangement, far more portable, and
stand much heavier shocks than those of any other construction with
which I am familiar.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 140">[ 140 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">at my tent, I hastened to ascertain by comparison
whether the instrument which had travelled with me from England,
and taken so many thousand observations, was seriously damaged: to
my delight an error of 0&middot;020 was all I could detect at Momay
and all other lower stations. On my return to Dorjiling in
December, I took it to pieces, and found the lower part of the bulb
of the attached thermometer broken off, and floating on the
mercury. Having quite expected this, I always checked the
observations of the attached thermometer by another, but&mdash;how,
it is not easy to say&mdash;the broken one invariably gave a
correct temperature.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 141">[ 141 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Kinchinjhow spurs are not accessible to so great an
elevation as those of Donkia, but they afford finer views over
Tibet, across the ridge connecting Kinchinjow with Donkia.</p>

<p>Broad summits here, as on the opposite side of the valley, are
quite bare of snow at 18,000 feet, though where they project as
sloping hog-backed spurs from the parent mountain, the snows of the
latter roll down on them and form glacial caps, the reverse of
glaciers in valleys, but which overflow, as it were, on all sides
of the slopes, and are ribboned* and crevassed.</p>

<p>On the 18th of September I ascended the range which divides the
Lachen from the Lachoong valley, to the Sebolah pass, a very sharp
ridge of gneiss, striking north-west and dipping north-east, which
runs south from Kinchinjhow to Chango-khang. A yak-track led across
the Kinchinjhow glacier, along the bank of the lake, and thence
westward up a very steep spur, on which was much glacial ice and
snow, but few plants above 16,000 feet. At nearly 17,000 feet I
passed two small lakes, on the banks of one of which I found bees,
a May-fly (<i>Ephemera</i>) and gnat; the two latter bred on stones
in the water, which (the day being fine) had a temperature of
53&deg;, while that of the large lake at the glacier, 1000 feet
lower, was only 39&deg;.</p>

<p>The view from the summit commands the whole castellated front of
Kinchinjhow, the sweep of the Donkia cliffs to the east,
Chango-khang&rsquo;s blunt cone of ribbed snow&dagger; over head,
while to the west, across the grassy Palung dunes rise Chomiomo,
the Thlonok mountains, and Kinchinjunga</p>

<p class="fnote">* The convexity of the curves, however, seems to
be upwards. Such reversed glaciers, ending abruptly on broad stony
shoulders quite free of snow, should on no account be taken as
indicating the lower limit of perpetual snow.<br>
&dagger; This ridging or furrowing of steep snow-beds is explained
at vol. i, <a href="chap10.html#page 237">p. 237</a></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 142">[ 142 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">in the distance.* The Palung plains, now yellow
with withered grass, were the most curious part of the view: hemmed
in by this range which rises 2000 feet above them, and by the
Lachen hills on the east, they appeared a dead level, from which
Kinchinjhow reared its head, like an island from the ocean.&dagger;
The black tents of the Tibetans were still there, but the flocks
were gone. The broad fosse-like valley of the Chachoo was at my
feet, with the river winding along its bottom, and its flanks
dotted with black juniper bushes.</p>

<p>The temperature at this elevation, between 1 and 3 p.m., varied
from 38&deg; to 59&deg;; the mean being 46&middot;5&deg;, with the
dew-point 34&middot;6&deg;. The height I made 17,585 feet by
barometer, and 17,517 by boiling-point. I tried the pulses of
eight, persons after two hours&rsquo; rest; they varied from 80 to
112, my own being 104. As usual at these heights, all the party
were suffering from giddiness and headaches.</p>

<p>Throughout September various parties passed my tent at Momay,
generally Lamas or traders: the former, wrapped in blankets,
wearing scarlet and gilt mitres, usually rode grunting yaks, which
were sometimes led by a slave-boy or a mahogany-faced nun, with a
broad yellow sheep-skin cap with flaps over her ears, short
petticoats, and striped boots. The domestic utensils, pots, pans,
and bamboos of butter,</p>

<p class="fnote">* The latter bore 241&deg; 30&prime;; it was
distant about thirty-four miles, and subtended an angle of 3&deg;
2&prime; 30&Prime;. The rocks on its north flanks were all black,
while those forming the upper 10,000 feet of the south face were
white: hence, the top is probably granite, overlaid by the gneiss
on the north.<br>
&dagger; It is impossible to contemplate the abrupt flanks of all
these lofty mountains, without contrasting them with the sloping
outlines that prevail in the southern parts of Sikkim. All such
precipices are, I have no doubt, the results of sea action; and all
posterior influence of sub-aerial action, aqueous or glacial, tends
to wear these precipices into slopes, to fill up valleys and to
level mountains. Of all such influences heavy rain-falls and a
luxuriant vegetation are probably the most active; and these
features are characteristic of the lower valleys of Sikkim, which
are consequently exposed to very different conditions of wear and
tear from those which prevail on these loftier rearward ranges.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 143">[ 143 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">tea-churn, bellows, stools, books, and sacred
implements, usually hung rattling on all sides of his holiness, and
a sumpter yak carried the tents and mats for sleeping. On several
occasions large parties of traders, with thirty or forty yaks*
laden with planks, passed, and occasionally a shepherd with Tibet
sheep, goats, and ponies. I questioned many of these travellers
about the courses of the Tibetan rivers; they all agreed&dagger; in
stating the Kambajong or Chomachoo liver, north of the Lachen, to
be the Arun of Nepal, and that it rose near the Ramchoo lake (of
Turner&rsquo;s route). The lake itself discharges either into the
Arun, or into the Painomchoo (flowing to the Yaru); but this point
I could never satisfactorily ascertain. The weather at Momay,
during September, was generally bad after 11 a.m.: little snow or
rain fell, but thin mists and drizzle prevailed; less than one inch
and a half of rain was collected, though upwards of eleven fell at
Calcutta, and rather more at Dorjiling. The mornings were sometimes
fine, cold, and sunny, with a north wind which had blown down the
valley all night, and till 9 a.m., when the south-east wind, with
fog, came on. Throughout the day a north current blew above the
southern; and when the mist was thin; the air sparkled with
spicul&aelig; of snow, caused by the cold dry upper current
condensing the vapours of the lower. This southern current passes
over the tops of the loftiest mountains, ascending to 24,000 feet,
and discharging frequent showers</p>

<p class="fnote">* About 600 loaded yaks are said to cross the
Donkia pass annually.<br>
&dagger; One lad only, declared that the Kambajong river flowed
north-west to Dobtah and Sarrh, and thence turned north to the
Yaru; but all Campbell&rsquo;s itineraries, as well as mine, make
the Dobtah lake drain into the Chomachoo, north of Wallanchoon;
which latter river the Nepalese also affirm flows into Nepal, as
the Arun. The Lachen and Lachoong Phipuns both insisted on this,
naming to me the principal towns on the way south-west from
Kambajong along the river to Tingri Maidan, <i>via</i> Tashirukpa
Chait, which is north of Wallanchoon pass.</p>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">in Tibet, as far north as Jigatzi, where, however,
violent dry easterly gales are the most prevalent.</p>

<p>The equinoctial gales set in on the 21st, with a falling
barometer, and sleet at night; on the 23rd and 24th it snowed
heavily, and being unable to light a fire at the entrance of my
tent, I spent two wretched days, taking observations; on the 25th
it cleared, and the snow soon melted. Frosty nights succeeded, but
the thermometer only fell to 31&deg; once during the month, and the
maximum once rose to 62&middot;5&deg;. The mean temperature from
the 9th to the 30th September was 41&middot;6&deg;,* which
coincided with that of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.; the mean maximum,
52&middot;2&deg;, minimum, 34&middot;7&deg;, and consequent range,
17&middot;5&deg;.&dagger; On seven nights the radiating thermometer
fell much below the temperature of the air, the mean being
10&middot;5&deg; and maximum 14&middot;2&deg;; and on seven
mornings the sun heated the black-bulb thermometer considerably, on
the mean to 62&middot;6&deg; above the air; maximum
75&middot;2&deg;, and minimum, 43&deg;. The greatest heat of the
day occurred at noon: the most rapid rise of temperature (5&deg;)
between 8 and 9 a.m., and the greatest fall (5&middot;5&deg;),
between 3 and 4 p.m. A sunk thermometer fell from 52&middot;5&deg;
to 51&middot;5&deg; between the 11th and 14th, when I was obliged
to remove the thermometer owing to the accident mentioned above.
The mercury in the barometer rose and fell contemporaneously with
that at Calcutta and Dorjiling, but the amount of tide was
considerably less, and, as is usual during the equinoctial month,
on some days it scarcely moved, whilst on others it rose and fell
rapidly. The tide amounted to 0&middot;062 of an inch.</p>

<p>On the 28th of the month the Singtam Soubah came up</p>

<p class="fnote">* The result of fifty-six comparative observations
between Calcutta and Momay, give 40&middot;6&deg; difference,
which, after corrections, allows 1&deg; Fahr. for every 438 feet of
ascent.<br>
&dagger; At Dorjiling the September range is only 9&middot;5&deg;;
and at Calcutta 10&deg;.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 145">[ 145 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">from Yeumtong, to request leave to depart for his
home, on account of his wife&rsquo;s illness; and to inform me that
Dr. Campbell had left Dorjiling, accompanied (in compliance with
the Rajah&rsquo;s orders) by the Tchebu Lama. I therefore left
Momay on the 30th, to meet him at Choongtam, arriving at Yeumtong
the same night, amid heavy rain and sleet.</p>

<p>Autumnal tints reigned at Yeumtong, and the flowers had
disappeared from its heath-like flat; a small eatable cherry with a
wrinkled stone was ripe, and acceptable in a country so destitute
of fruit.* Thence I descended to Lachoong, on the 1st of October,
again through heavy rain, the snow lying on the Tunkra mountain at
14,000 feet. The larch was shedding its leaves, which turn red
before they fall; but the annual vegetation was much behind that at
14,000 feet, and so many late flowerers, such as <i>
Umbellifer&aelig;</i> and <i>Composit&aelig;,</i> had come into
blossom, that the place still looked gay and green: the blue
climbing gentian (<i>Crawfurdia</i>) now adorned the bushes; this
plant would be a great acquisition in English gardens. A <i>
Polygonum</i> still in flower here, was in ripe fruit near Momay,
6000 feet higher up the valley.</p>

<p>On the following day I made a long and very fatiguing march to
Choongtam, but the coolies were not all able to accomplish it. The
backwardness of the flora in descending was even more conspicuous
than on the previous day: the jungles, at 7000 feet, being gay with
a handsome Cucurbitaceous plant. Crossing the Lachoong cane-bridge,
I paid the tribute of a sigh to the memory of my poor dog, and
reached my old camping-ground at Choongtam by</p>

<p class="fnote">* The absence of <i>Vaccinia</i> (whortleberries
and cranberries) and eatable <i>Rubi</i> (brambles) in the alpine
regions of the Himalaya is very remarkable, and they are not
replaced by any substitute. With regard to Vaccinium, this is the
more anomalous, as several species grow in the temperate regions of
Sikkim.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 146">[ 146 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">10 p.m., having been marching rapidly for twelve
hours. My bed and tent came up two hours later, and not before the
leeches and mosquitos had taxed me severely. On the 4th of October
I heard the nightingale for the first time this season.</p>

<p>Expecting Dr. Campbell on the following morning, I proceeded
down the river to meet him: the whole valley was buried under a
torrent or d&eacute;bacle of mud, shingle, and boulders, and for
half a mile the stream was dammed up into a deep lake. Amongst the
gneiss and granite boulders brought down by this d&eacute;bacle, I
collected some actinolites; but all minerals are extremely rare in
Sikkim and I never heard of a gem or crystal of any size or beauty,
or of an ore of any consequence, being found in this country.</p>

<p>I met my friend on the other side of the mud torrent, and I was
truly rejoiced to see him, though he was looking much the worse for
his trying journey through the hot valleys at this season; in fact,
I know no greater trial of the constitution than the exposure and
hard exercise that is necessary in traversing these valleys, below
5000 feet, in the rainy season: delay is dangerous, and the heat,
anxiety, and bodily suffering from fatigue, insects, and bruises,
banish sleep, and urge the restless traveller onward to higher and
more healthy regions. Dr. Campbell had, I found, in addition to the
ordinary dangers of such a journey, met with an accident which
might have proved serious; his pony having been dashed to pieces by
falling over a precipice, a fate he barely escaped himself, by
adroitly slipping from the saddle when he felt the animal&rsquo;s
foot giving way.</p>

<p>On our way back to Choongtam, he detailed to me the motives that
had led to his obtaining the authority of the Deputy-Governor of
Bengal (Lord Dalhousie being absent)</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 147">[ 147 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">for his visiting Sikkim. Foremost, was his earnest
desire to cultivate a better understanding with the Rajah and his
officers. He had always taken the Rajah&rsquo;s part, from a
conviction that he was not to blame for the misunderstandings which
the Sikkim officers pretended to exist between their country and
Dorjiling; he had, whilst urgently remonstrating with the Rajah,
insisted on forbearance on my part, and had long exercised it
himself. In detailing the treatment to which I was subjected, I had
not hesitated to express my opinion that the Rajah was more
compromised by it than his Dewan: Dr. Campbell, on the contrary,
knew that the Dewan was the head and front of the whole system of
annoyance. In one point of view it mattered little who was in the
right; but the transaction was a violation of good faith on the
part of the Sikkim government towards the British, for which the
Rajah, however helpless, was yet responsible. To act upon my
representations alone would have been unjust, and no course
remained but for Dr. Campbell to inquire personally into the
matter. The authority to do this gave him also the opportunity of
becoming acquainted with the country which we were bound to
protect, as well by our interest as by treaty, but from which we
were so jealously excluded, that should any contingency occur, we
were ignorant of what steps to take for defence, and, indeed, of
what we should have to defend.</p>

<p>On the 6th of October we left Choongtam for my second visit to
the Kongra Lama pass, hoping to get round by the Cholamoo lakes and
the Donkia pass. As the country beyond the frontier was
uninhabited, the Tchebu Lama saw no difficulty in this, provided
the Lachen Phipun and the Tibetans did not object. Our great
obstacle was the Singtam Soubah, who (by the Rajah&rsquo;s order)
accompanied</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 148">[ 148 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">us to clear the road, and give us every facility,
but who was very sulky, and undisguisedly rude to Campbell; he was
in fact extremely jealous of the Lama, who held higher authority
than he did, and who alone had the Rajah&rsquo;s confidence.</p>

<p>Our first day&rsquo;s march was of about ten miles to one of the
river-flats, which was covered with wild apple-trees, whose fruit,
when stewed with sugar, we found palatable. The Lachen river,
though still swollen, was comparatively clear; the rains usually
ceasing, or at least moderating, in October: its water was about
5&deg; colder than in the beginning of August.</p>

<p>During the second day&rsquo;s march we were stopped at the
Taktoong river by the want of a bridge, which the Singtam Soubah
refused to exert himself to have repaired; its waters were,
however, so fallen, that our now large party soon bridged it with
admirable skill. We encamped the second night on Chateng, and the
following day made a long march, crossing the Zemu, and ascending
half-way to Tallum Samdong. The alpine foliage was rapidly changing
colour; and that of the berberry turning scarlet, gave a warm glow
to the mountain above the forest. Lamteng village was deserted:
turnips were maturing near the houses, and buckwheat on the slope
behind; the latter is a winter-crop at lower elevations, and
harvested in April. At Zemu Samdong the willow-leaves were becoming
sear and yellow, and the rose-bushes bore enormous scarlet hips,
two inches long, and covered with bristles; they were sweet, and
rather good eating. Near Tungu (where we arrived on the 9th) the
great Sikkim currant was in fruit; its berries are much larger than
the English, and of the same beautiful red colour, but bitter and
very acid; they are, however, eaten by the Tibetans, who call them
&ldquo;Kewdemah.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Near the village I found Dr. Campbell remonstrating with the
Lachen Phipun on the delays and rude treatment I had received in
June and July: the man, of course, answered every question with
falsehoods, which is the custom of these people, and produced the
Rajah&rsquo;s orders for my being treated with every civility, as a
proof that he must have behaved as he ought! The Singtam Soubah, as
was natural, hung back, for it was owing to him alone that the
orders had been contravened, and the Phipun appealed to the
bystanders for the truth of this.</p>

<p>The Phipun (accompanied by his Larpun or subordinate officer)
had prepared for us a sumptuous refreshment of tea soup, which was
brewing by the road, and in which all animosities were soon washed
away. We took up our abode at Tungu in a wooden but under the great
rock, where we were detained for several days by bad weather. I was
assured that during all August and September the weather had been
uniformly gloomy, as at Momay, though little rain had fallen.</p>

<p>We had much difficulty in purchasing a sufficient number of
blankets* for our people, and in arranging for our journey, to
which the Lachen Phipun was favourable, promising us ponies for the
expedition. The vegetation around was wholly changed since my July
visit: the rhododendron scrub was verdigris-green from the young
leaves which burst in autumn, and expose at the end of each
branchlet a flower-bud covered with resinous scales, which are
thrown off in the following spring. The jungle was spotted yellow
with the withered birch, maple and mountain-ash, and scarlet with
berberry bushes; while above, the pastures were yellow-brown with
the dead grass, and streaked with snow.</p>

<p class="fnote">* These were made of goat&rsquo;s wool, teazed
into a satiny surface by little teazle-like brushes of bamboo.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 150">[ 150 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amongst other luxuries, we procured the flesh of yak calves,
which is excellent veal: we always returned the foot for the mother
to lick while being milked, without which she yields nothing. The
yak goes nine months with calf, and drops one every two years,
bearing altogetber ten or twelve: the common Sikkim cow of lower
elevations, at Dorjiling invariably goes from nine and a half to
ten months, and calves annually: ponies go eleven months, and foal
nearly every year. In Tibet the sheep are annually sheared; the
ewes drop their young in spring and autumn, but the lambs born at
the latter period often die of cold and starvation, and double
lambing is unknown; whereas, in the plains of Bengal (where,
however, sheep cannot be said to thrive without pulse fodder) twins
are constantly born. At Dorjiling the sheep drop a lamb once in the
season. The Tibetan mutton we generally found dry and stringy.</p>

<p>In these regions many of my goats and kids had died foaming at
the mouth and grinding their teeth; and I here discovered the cause
to arise from their eating the leaves of <i>Rhododendron
cinnabarinum</i>* (&ldquo;Kema Kechoong,&rdquo; Lepcha: Kema
signifying Rhododendron): this species alone is said to be
poisonous; and when used as fuel, it causes the face to swell and
the eyes to inflame; of which I observed several instances. As the
subject of fire-wood is of every-day interest to the traveller in
these regions, I may here mention that the rhododendron woods
afford poor fires; juniper burns the brightest, and with least
smoke. <i>Abies Webbiana,</i> though emitting much smoke, gives a
cheerful fire, far superior to larch,&dagger; spruce, or <i>Abies
Brunoniana.</i> At Dorjiling, oak is the common</p>

<p class="fnote">* The poisonous honey produced by other species is
alluded to at vol. i., <a href="chap9.html#page 201">p. 201.</a> An
<i>Andromeda</i> and a <i>Gualtheria,</i> I have been assured are
equally deleterious.<br>
&dagger; The larch of northern Asia (<i>Larix Europ&oelig;a</i>) is
said to produce a pungent smoke, which I never observed to be the
case with the Sikkim species.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 151">[ 151 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">fuel; alder is also good. Chestnut is invariably
used for blacksmith&rsquo;s charcoal. Magnolia has a disagreeable
odour, and laurel burns very badly.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of phosphorescence is most conspicuous on stacks
of fire-wood. At Dorjiling, during the damp, warm, summer months
(May to October), at elevations of 5000 to 8000 feet, it may be
witnessed every night by penetrating a few yards into the
forest&mdash;at least it was so in 1848 and 1849; and during my
stay there billets of decayed wood were repeatedly sent to me by
residents, with inquiries as to the cause of their luminosity. It
is no exaggeration to say that one does not need to move from the
fireside to see this phenomenon, for if there is a partially
decayed log amongst the fire-wood, it is almost sure to glow with a
pale phosphoric light. A stack of fire-wood, collected near my
host&rsquo;s (Mr. Hodgson) cottage, presented a beautiful spectacle
for two months (in July and August), and on passing it at night, I
had to quiet my pony, who was always alarmed by it. The phenomenon
invariably accompanies decay, and is common on oak, laurel
(<i>Tetranthera</i>), birch, and probably other timbers; it equally
appears on cut wood and on stumps, but is most frequent on branches
lying close to the ground in the wet forests. I have reason to
believe that it spreads with great rapidity from old surfaces to
freshly cut ones. That it is a vital phenomenon, and due to the
mycelium of a fungus, I do not in the least doubt, for I have
observed it occasionally circumscribed by those black lines which
are often seen to bound mycelia on dead wood, and to precede a more
rapid decay. I have often tried, but always in vain, to coax these
mycelia into developing some fungus, by placing them in damp rooms,
etc. When camping in the mountains, I frequently caused the natives
to bring</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 152">[ 152 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">phosphorescent wood into my tent, for the pleasure
of watching its soft undulating light, which appears to pale and
glow with every motion of the atmosphere; but except in this
difference of intensity, it presents no change in appearance night
after night. Alcohol, heat, and dryness soon dissipate it;
electricity I never tried. It has no odour, and my dog, who had a
fine sense of smell, paid no heed when it was laid under his
nose.*</p>

<p>The weather continuing bad, and snow falling, the country people
began to leave for their winter-quarters at Lamteng. In the
evenings we enjoyed the company of the Phipun and Tchebu Lama, who
relished a cup of sugarless tea more than any other refreshment we
could offer. From them we collected much Tibetan
information:&mdash;the former was an inveterate smoker, using a
pale, mild tobacco, mixed largely with leaves of the small wild
Tibetan Rhubarb, called &ldquo;Chula.&rdquo; Snuff is little used,
and is principally procured from the plains of India.</p>

<p>We visited Palung twice, chiefly in hopes that Dr. Campbell
might see the magnificent prospect of Kinchinjhow from its plains:
the first time we gained little beyond a ducking, but on the second
(October the 15th) the view was superb; and I likewise caught a
glimpse of Kinchinjunga from the neighbouring heights, bearing
south 60&deg; west and distant forty miles. I also measured
barometrically the elevation at the great chait on the plains, and
found it</p>

<p class="fnote">* As far as my observations go, this phenomenon of
light is confined to the lower orders of vegetable life, to the
fungi alone, and is not dependent on irritability. I have never
seen luminous flowers or roots, nor do I know of any authenticated
instance of such, which may not be explained by the presence of
mycelium or of animal life. In the animal kingdom, luminosity is
confined, I believe, to the Invertebrata, and is especially common
amongst the Radiata and Mollusca; it is also frequent in the
Entromostracous Crustacea, and in various genera of most orders of
insects. In all these, even in the Sertulari&aelig;, I have
invariably observed the light to be increased by irritation, in
which respect the luminosity of animal life differs from that of
vegetable.</p>

<p class="first">15,620 feet, and by carefully boiled thermometers,
15,283, on the 13th October, and 15,566 on the 15th: the difference
being due to the higher temperature on the latter day, and to a
rise of 0&middot;3&deg; on both boiling-point thermometers above
what the same instruments stood at on the 13th. The elevation of
Tungu from the October barometrical observations was only seven
feet higher than that given by those of July; the respective
heights being 12,766 feet in July, and 12,773 in October.* The mean
temperature had fallen from 50&deg; in July to 41&deg;, and that of
the sunk thermometer from 57&deg; to 51&middot;4&deg;. The mean
range in July was 23&middot;3&deg;, and in October
13&middot;8&deg;; the weather during the latter period being,
however, uniformly cold and misty, this was much below the mean
monthly range, which probably exceeds 30&deg;. Much more rain fell
in October at Tungu than at Dorjiling, which is the opposite to
what occurs during the rainy season.</p>

<p><i>October 15th.</i> Having sent the coolies forward, with
instructions to halt and camp on this side of the Kongra Lama pass,
we followed them, taking the route by Palung, and thence over the
hills to the Lachen, to the east of which we descended, and further
up its valley joined the advanced party in a rocky glen, called
Sitong, an advantageous camping ground, from being sheltered by
rocks which ward off the keen blasts: its elevation is 15,370 feet
above the sea, and the magnificent west cliff of Kinchinjhow towers
over it not a mile distant, bearing due east,</p>

<p class="fnote">* The elevation of Tungu by boiling-point was
12,650 feet by a set of July observations, 12,818 by a set taken on
the 11th of October, and 12,544 by a set on the 14th of October:
the discrepancies were partly due to the temperature corrections,
but mainly to the readings of the thermometers, which
were&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">and subtending an angle of 24&middot;3&deg;. The
afternoon was misty, but at 7 p.m. the south-east wind fell, and
was immediately succeeded by the biting north return current, which
dispelled the fog: hoar-frost sparkled on the ground, and the moon
shone full on the snowy head of Kinchinjhow, over which the
milky-way and the broad flashing orbs of the stars formed a
jewelled diadem. The night was very windy and cold, though the
thermometer fell no lower than 22&deg;, that placed in a polished
parabolic reflector to 20&deg;, and another laid on herbage to
17&middot;5&deg;.</p>

<p>On the 16th we were up early. I felt very anxious about the
prospect of our getting round by Donkia pass and Cholamoo, which
would enable me to complete the few remaining miles of my long
survey of the Teesta river, and which promised immense results in
the views I should obtain of the country, and of the geology and
botany of these lofty snowless regions. Campbell, though extremely
solicitous to obtain permission from the Tibetan guard, (who were
waiting for us on the frontier), was nevertheless bound by his own
official position to yield at once to their wishes, should they
refuse us a passage.</p>

<p>The sun rose on our camp at 7.30 a.m., when the north wind fell;
and within an hour afterwards the temperature had risen to 45&deg;.
Having had our sticks* warmed and handed to us, we started on
ponies, accompanied by the Lama only, to hold a parley with the
Tibetans; ordering the rest of the party to follow at their
leisure. We had not proceeded far when we were joined by two
Tibetan Sepoys, who, on our reaching the pass, bellowed</p>

<p class="fnote">* It was an invariable custom of our Lepcba and
Tibetan attendants, to warm the handles of our sticks in cold
weather, before starting on our daily marches. This is one of many
little instances I could adduce, of their thoughtfulness and
attention to the smallest comforts of the stranger and wanderer in
their lands.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 155">[ 155 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">lustily for their companions; when Campbell and
the Lama drew up at the chait of Kongra Lama, and announced his
wish to confer with their commandant.</p>

<p>My anxiety was now wound up to a pitch; I saw men with
matchlocks emerging from amongst the rocks under Chomiomo, and
despairing of permission being obtained, I goaded my pony with
heels and stick, and dashed on up the Lachen valley, resolved to
make the best of a splendid day, and not turn back till I had
followed the river to the Cholamoo lakes: The Sepoys followed me a
few paces, but running being difficult at 16,000 feet, they soon
gave up the chase.</p>

<p>A few miles ride in a north-east direction over an open,
undulating country, brought me to the Lachen, flowing westwards in
a broad, open, stony valley, bounded by Kinchinjhow on the south,
(its face being as precipitous as that on the opposite side), and
on the north by the Peukathlo, a low range of rocky, sloping
mountains, of which the summits were 18,000 to 19,000 feet above
the sea. Enormous erratic blocks of gneiss strewed the ground,
which was sandy or gravelly, and cut into terraces along the
shallow, winding river, the green and sparkling waters of which
rippled over pebbles, or expanded into lagoons. The already scanty
vegetation diminished rapidly: it consisted chiefly of scattered
bushes of a dwarf scrubby honeysuckle and tufts of nettle, both so
brittle as to be trodden into powder, and the short leafless twiggy
<i>Ephedra,</i> a few inches higher. The most alpine rhododendron
(<i>R. nivale</i>) spread its small rigid branches close to the
ground; the hemispherical <i>Arenaria,</i> another type of
sterility, rose here and there, and tufts of <i>Myosotis,
Artemisia, Astragali,</i> and <i>Adrosace,</i> formed flat cushions
level with the soil. Grass was very scarce, but a running wiry
sedge (<i>Carex Moorcroftii</i>)</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 156">[ 156 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">bound the sand, like the <i>Carex arenaria</i> of
our English coasts.</p>

<p>A more dismally barren country cannot well be conceived, nor one
more strongly contrasting with the pastures of Palung at an equal
elevation. The long lofty wall of Kinchinjhow and Donkia presents
an effectual barrier to the transmission of moisture to the head of
the Lachen valley, which therefore becomes a type of such
elevations in Tibet. As I proceeded, the ground became still more
sandy, chirping under the pony&rsquo;s feet; and where harder, it
was burrowed by innumerable marmots, foxes, and the
&ldquo;Goomchen,&rdquo; or tail-less rat (<i>Lagomys badius</i>),
sounding hollow to the tread, and at last becoming so dangerous
that I was obliged to dismount and walk.</p>

<p>The geological features changed as rapidly as those of the
climate and vegetation, for the strike of the rocks being
north-west, and the dip north-east, I was rising over the strata
that overlie the gneiss. The upper part of Kinchinjhow is composed
of bold ice-capped cliffs of gneiss; but the long spurs that
stretch northwards from it are of quartz, conglomerates, slates,
and earthy red clays, forming the rounded terraced hills I had seen
from Donkia pass. Between these spurs were narrow valleys, at whose
mouths stupendous blocks of gneiss rest on rocks of a much later
geological formation.</p>

<p>Opposite the most prominent of these spurs the river (16,800
feet above the sea) runs west, forming marshes, which were full of
<i>Zannichellia palustris</i> and <i>Ranunculus aquatilis,</i> both
English and Siberian plants: the waters contained many shells, of a
species of <i>Lymn&aelig;a</i>;* and the soil</p>

<p class="fnote">* This is the most alpine living shell in the
world; my specimens being from nearly 17,000 feet elevation; it is
the <i>Lymn&aelig;a Hookeri,</i> Reeve (&ldquo;Proceedings of the
Zoological Society,&rdquo; No. 204).</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 157">[ 157 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">near the edge, which was covered with tufts of
short grass, was whitened with effloresced carbonate of soda. Here
were some square stone enclosures two feet high, used as pens, and
for pitching tents in; within them I gathered some unripe
barley.</p>

<p>Beyond this I recognised a hill of which I had taken bearings
from Donkia pass, and a few miles further, on rounding a great spur
of Kinchinjunga, I arrived in sight of Cholamoo lakes, with the
Donkia mountain rearing its stupendous precipices of rock and ice
on the east. My pony was knocked up, and I felt very giddy from the
exertion and elevation; I had broken his bridle, and so led him on
by my plaid for the last few miles to the banks of the lake; and
there, with the pleasant sound of the waters rippling at my feet, I
yielded for a few moments to those emotions of gratified ambition
which, being unalloyed by selfish considerations for the future;
become springs of happiness during the remainder of one&rsquo;s
life.</p>

<p>The landscape about Cholamoo lakes was simple in its elements,
stern and solemn; and though my solitary situation rendered it
doubly impressive to me, I doubt whether the world contains any
scene with more sublime associations than this calm sheet of water,
17,000 feet above the sea, with the shadows of mountains 22,000 to
24,000 feet high, sleeping on its bosom.</p>

<p>There was much short grass about the lake, on which large
antelopes, &ldquo;Chiru&rdquo; (<i>Antilope Hodgsoni</i>),* and
deer, &ldquo;Goa&rdquo; (<i>Procapra picticaudata,</i> Hodgson),
were feeding. There were also many slate-coloured hales with white
rumps</p>

<p class="fnote">* I found the horns of this animal on the south
side of the Donkia pass, but I never saw a live one except in
Tibet. The <i>Procapra</i> is described by Mr. Hodgson,
&ldquo;Bengal As. Soc. Jour., 1846, p. 388,&rdquo; and is
introduced into the cut at <a href="#page 139">p. 139.</a></p>

tail-less rats. The abundance of animal life was wonderful,
compared with the want of it on the south side of Donkia pass, not
five miles distant in a straight line! it is partly due to the
profusion of carbonate of soda, of which all ruminants are fond,
and partly to the dryness of the climate, which is favourable to
all burrowing quadrupeds. A flock of common English teal were
swimming in the lake, the temperature of which was 55&deg;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had come about fifteen miles from the pass, and arrived at 1
p.m., remaining half an hour. I could not form an idea as to
whether Campbell had followed or not, and began to speculate on the
probability of passing the night in the open air, by the warm side
of my steed. Though the sun shone brightly, the wind was bitterly
cold, and I arrived at the stone dykes of Yeumtso at 3 p.m., quite
exhausted with fatigue and headache. I there found, to my great
relief, the Tchebu Lama and Lachen Phipun: they were in some alarm
at my absence, for they thought I was not aware of the extreme
severity of the temperature on the north side of the snows, or of
the risk of losing my way; they told me that after a long discourse
with the Dingpun (or commander) of the Tibetan Sepoys, the latter
had allowed all the party to pass; that the Sepoys had brought on
the coolies, who were close behind, but that they themselves had
seen nothing of Campbell; of whom the Lama then went in search.</p>

<p>The sun set behind Chomiomo at 5 p.m., and the wind at once
dropped, so local are these violent atmospheric currents, which are
caused by the heating of the upper extremities of these lofty
valleys, and consequent rarefaction of the air. Intense terrestrial
radiation immediately follows the withdrawal of the sun&rsquo;s
rays, and the temperature sinks rapidly.</p>

<p>Soon after sunset the Lama returned, bringing Campbell; who,
having mistaken some glacier-fed lakes at the back of Kinchinjhow
for those of Cholamoo, was looking for me. He too had speculated on
having to pass the night under a rock, with one plaid for himself
and servant; in which case I am sure they would both have been
frozen to death, having no pony to lie down beside. He told me that
after I had quitted Kongra Lama, leaving him with</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 160">[ 160 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the Tchebu Lama and Phipun, the Dingpun and twenty
men came up, and very civilly but formally forbade their crossing
the frontier; but that upon explaining his motives, and
representing that it would save him ten days&rsquo; journey, the
Dingpun had relented, and promised to conduct the whole party to
the Donkia pass.</p>

<p>We pitched our little tent in the corner of the cattle-pen, and
our coolies soon afterwards came up; mine were in capital health,
though suffering from headaches, but Campbell&rsquo;s were in a
distressing state of illness and fatigue, with swollen faces and
rapid pulses, and some were insensible from symptoms like pressure
on the brain;* these were chiefly Ghorkas (Nepalese). The Tibetan
Dingpun and his guard arrived last of all, he was a droll little
object, short, fat, deeply marked with small-pox, swarthy, and
greasy; he was robed in a green woollen mantle, and was perched on
the back of a yak, which also carried his bedding, and cooking
utensils, the latter rattling about its flanks, horns, neck, and
every point of support: two other yaks bore the tents of the party.
His followers were tall savage looking fellows, with broad swarthy
faces, and their hair in short pig-tails. They wore the
long-sleeved cloak, short trousers, and boots, all of thick
woollen, and felt caps on their heads. Each was armed with a long
matchlock slung over his back, with a moveable rest having two
prongs like a fork, and a hinge, so as to fold up along the barrel,
when the prongs project behind the shoulders like antelope horns,
giving the uncouth warrior a droll appearance.</p>

<p class="fnote">* I have never experienced bleeding at the nose,
ears, lips or eyelids, either in my person or that of my
companions, on these occasions; nor did I ever meet with a recent
traveller who has. Dr. Thomson has made the same remark, and when
in Switzerland together we were assured by Auguste Balmat,
Fran&ccedil;ois Coutet, and other experienced Mont Blanc guides,
that they never witnessed these symptoms nor the blackness of the
sky, so frequently insisted upon by alpine travellers.</p>

<p>The night was fine, but intensely cold, and the vault of heaven
was very dark, and blazing with stars; the sir was electrical, and
flash lightning illumined the sky; this was the reflection of a
storm that was not felt at Dorjiling, but which raged on the plains
of India, beyond the Terai, fully 120 miles, and perhaps 150, south
of our position. No thunder was heard. The thermometer fell to
5&deg;, and that in the reflector to 3.5&deg;; at sunrise it rose
to 10&deg;, and soon after 8 a.m. to 33&deg;; till this hour the
humidity was great, and a thin mist hung over the frozen surface of
the rocky ground; when this dispersed, the air became very dry, and
the black-bulb thermometer in the sun rose 60&deg; above the
temperature in the shade. The light of the sun, though sometimes
intercepted by vapours aloft, was very brilliant.*</p>

India (see &ldquo;Turner&rsquo;s Tibet,&rdquo; p. 212), repairs to
these enormous elevations to breed. The fact of birds
characteristic of the tropics dwelling for months in such climates
is a very instructive one, and should be borne in mind in our
speculations upon the climate supposed to be indicated by the
imbedded bones of birds.</p>

themselves for the last flight of the year, to the valleys of the
southern Himalaya, to the Teesta, and other rivers of the Terai and
plains of India.</p>

<p>The Dingpun paid his respects to us in the morning, wearing,
besides his green cloak, a white cap with a green glass button,
denoting his rank; he informed us that he had written to his
superior officer at Kambajong, explaining his motives for
conducting us across the frontier, and he drew from his breast a
long letter, written on <i>Daphne</i>* paper, whose ends were tied
with floss silk, with a large red seal; this he pompously
delivered, with whispered orders, to an attendant, and sent him
off. He admired our clothes extremely,&dagger; and then my
percussion gun, the first he had seen; but above all he admired rum
and water, which he drank with intense relish, leaving a mere sip
for his comrades at the bottom of his little wooden cup, which they
emptied, and afterwards licked clean, and replaced in his breast
for him. We made a large basin full of very weak grog for his
party, who were all friendly and polite; and having made us the
unexpected offer of allowing us to rest ourselves for the day at
Yeumtso, he left us, and practised his men at firing at a mark, but
they were very indifferent shots.</p>

<p>I ascended with Campbell to the lake he had visited</p>

<p class="fnote">* Most of the paper used in Tibet is, as I have
elsewhere noticed, made from the bark of various species of <i>
Daphne&aelig;,</i> and especially of <i>Edgeworthia Gardneri,</i>
and is imported from Nepal and Bhotan; but the Tibetans, as MM. Huc
and Gabet correctly state, manufacture a paper from the root of a
small shrub: this I have seen, and it is of a much thicker texture
and more durable than Daphne paper. Dr. Thomson informs me that a
species of <i>Astragalus</i> is used in western Tibet for this
purpose, the whole shrub, which is dwarf, being reduced to
pulp.<br>
&dagger; All Tibetans admire sad value English broad-cloth beyond
any of our products. Woollen articles are very familiar to them,
and warm clothing is one of the first requisites of life.</p>

<p class="first">on the previous day, about 600 or 800 feet above
Yeumtso, and 17,500 feet above the sea: it is a mile and a half
long, and occupies a large depression between two rounded spurs,
being fed by glaciers from Kinchinjhow. The rocks of these spurs
were all of red quartz and slates, cut into broad terraces, covered
with a thick glacial talus of gneiss and granite in angular
pebbles, and evidently spread over the surface when the glacier,
now occupying the upper end of the lake, extended over the
valley.</p>

<p>The ice on the cliffs and summit of Kinchinjhow was much greener
and clearer than that on the south face (opposite Palung); and rows
of immense icicles hung from the cliffs. A conferva grew in the
waters of the lake, and short, hard tufts of sedge on the banks,
but no other plants were to be seen. Brahminee geese, teal, and
widgeon, were swimming in the waters, and a beetle
(<i>Elaphrus</i>) was coursing over the wet banks; finches and
other small birds were numerous, eating the sedge-seeds, and
picking up the insects. No view was obtained to the north, owing to
the height of the mountains on the north flank of the Lachen.</p>

<p>At noon the temperature rose to 52&middot;5&deg;, and the
black-bulb to 104&middot;5&deg;; whilst the north-west dusty wind
was so dry, that the dew-point fell to 24&middot;2&deg;.</p>
