<br>
<p class="first">A very favourite and interesting excursion from
Dorjiling is to the cane bridge over the Great Rungeet river, 6000
feet below the station. To this an excellent road has been cut, by
which the whole descent of six miles, as the crow flies, is easily
performed on pony-back; the road distance being only eleven miles.
The scenery is, of course, of a totally different description from
that of Sinchul, or even of the foot of the hills, being that of a
deep mountain-valley. I several times made this trip; on the
excursion about to be described, and in which I was accompanied by
Mr. Barnes, I followed the Great Rungeet to the Teesta, into which
it flows.</p>

<p>In descending from Dorjiling, the zones of vegetation are well
marked between 6000 and 7000 feet by&mdash;1. The oak, chesnut, and
Magnolias, the main features from 7000 to 10,000 feet.&mdash;2.
Immediately below 6,500 feet, the tree-fern appears (<i>Alsophila
gigantea,</i> Wall.), a widely-distributed</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 143">[ 143 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">plant, common to the Himalaya, from Nepal eastward
to the Malayan peninsula, Java, and Ceylon.&mdash;3. Of palms, a
species of <i>Calamus,</i> and <i>Plectocomia,</i> the
&ldquo;Rhenoul&rdquo; of the Lepchas. The latter, though not a very
large plant, climbs lofty trees, and extends about 40 yards through
the forest; 6,500 feet is the upper limit of palms in the Sikkim
Himalaya, the Rhenoul alone attaining this elevation.*&mdash;4. The
fourth striking feature is a wild plantain, which ascends to nearly
the same elevation (&ldquo;Lukhlo,&rdquo; Lepcha). This is replaced
by another, and rather larger species, at lower elevations; both
ripen austere and small fruits, which are full of seeds, and quite
uneatable; that commonly grown in Sikkim is an introduced stock
(nor have the wild species ever been cultivated); it is very large,
but poor in flavour, and does not bear seeds. The zones of these
conspicuous plants are very clearly defined, and especially if the
traveller, standing on one of the innumerable spurs which project
from the Dorjiling ridge, cast his eyes up the gorges of green on
either hand.</p>

<p>At 1000 feet below Dorjiling a fine wooded spur projects, called
Leebong. This beautiful spot is fully ten degrees warmer than Mr.
Hodgson&rsquo;s house, and enjoys considerably more sunshine;
peaches and English fruit-trees flourish extremely well, but do not
ripen fruit. The tea-plant</p>

<p class="fnote">* Four other <i>Calami</i> range between 1000 and
6000 feet on the outer hills, some of them being found forty miles
distant from the plains of India. The other palms of Sikkim are,
&ldquo;Simong&rdquo; (<i>Caryota urens</i>); it is rare, and
ascends to nearly 5000 feet. <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i> (probably <i>P.
acaulis,</i> Buch.), a small, stemless species, which grows on the
driest soil in the deep valleys; it is the &ldquo;Schaap&rdquo; of
the Lepchas, who eat the young seeds, and use the feathery fronds
as screens in hunting. <i>Wallichia oblonjpgolia,</i> the
&ldquo;Ooh&rdquo; of the Lepchas, who make no use of it; Dr.
Campbell and myself, however, found that it is an admirable fodder
for horses, who prefer it to any other green food to be had in
these mountains. <i>Areca gracilis</i> and <i>Licuala peltata</i>
are the only other palms in Sikkim; but <i>Cycas pectinata,</i>
with the India-rubber fig, occurs in the deepest and hottest
valleys&mdash;the western limit of both these interesting plants.
Of <i>Pandanus</i> there is a graceful species at elevations of
1000 to 4000 feet (&ldquo;Borr,&rdquo; Lepcha).</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 144">[ 144 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">succeeds here admirably, and might be cultivated
to great profit, and be of advantage in furthering a trade with
Tibet. It has been tried on a large scale by Dr. Campbell at his
residence (alt. 7000 feet), but the frosts and snow of that height
injure it, as do the hailstorms in spring.</p>

<p>Below Leebong is the village of Ging, surrounded by steeps,
cultivated with maize, rice, and millet. It is rendered very
picturesque by a long row of tall poles, each bearing a narrow,
vertically elongated banner, covered with Boodhist inscriptions,
and surmounted by coronet-like ornaments, or spear-heads, rudely
cut out of wood, or formed of basket-work, and adorned with cotton
fringe. Ging is peopled by Bhotan emigrants, and when one dies, if
his relations can afford to pay for them, two additional poles and
flags are set up by the Lamas in honour of his memory, and that of
Sunga, the third member of the Boodhist Trinity.</p>

<p>Below this the <i>Gordonia</i> commences, with <i>Cedrela
toona,</i> and various tropical genera, such as abound near
Punkabaree. The heat and hardness of the rocks cause the streams to
dry up on these abrupt hills, especially on the eastern slope, and
the water is therefore conveyed along the sides of the path, in
conduits ingeniously made of bamboo, either split in half, or, what
is better, whole, except at the septum, which is removed through a
lateral hole. The oak and chesnut of this level (3000 feet), are
both different from those which grow above, as are the brambles.
The <i>Arums</i> are replaced by <i>Caladiums.</i> Tree-ferns cease
below 4000 feet, and the large bamboo abounds.</p>

<p>At about 2000 feet, and ten miles distant from Dorjiling, we
arrived at a low, long spur, dipping down to the bed of the
Rungeet, at its junction with the Rungmo. This is close to the
boundary of the British ground, and there is a</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 145">[ 145 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">guard-house, and a sepoy or two at it; here we
halted. It took the Lepchas about twenty minutes to construct a
table and two bedsteads within our tent; each was made of four
forked sticks, stuck in the ground, supporting as many side-pieces,
across which were laid flat split pieces of bamboo, bound tightly
together by strips of rattan palm-stem. The beds were afterwards
softened by many layers of bamboo-leaf, and if not very downy, they
were dry, and as firm as if put together with screws and joints.
This spur rises out of a deep valley, quite surrounded by lofty
mountains; it is narrow, and covered with red clay, which the
natives chew as a cure for go&icirc;tre. North, it looks down into
a gully, at the bottom of which the Rungeet&rsquo;s foamy stream
winds through a dense forest. In the opposite direction, the Rungmo
comes tearing down from the top of Sinchul, 7000 feet above; and
though its roar is heard, and its course is visible throughout its
length, the stream itself is nowhere seen, so deep does it cut its
channel. Except on this, and a few similarly hard rocky hills
around, the vegetation is a mass of wood and jungle. At this spot
it is rather scanty and dry, with abundance of the <i>Pinus
lonjpgolia</i> and Sal. The dwarf date-palm (<i>Ph&oelig;nix
acaulis</i>) also, was very abundant.</p>

<p>The descent to the river was exceedingly steep, the banks
presenting an impenetrable jungle. The pines on the arid crests of
the hills around formed a remarkable feature: they grow like the
Scotch fir, the tall, red trunks springing from the steep and dry
slopes. But little resin exudes from the stem, which, like that of
most pines, is singularly free from lichens and mosses; its wood is
excellent, and the charcoal of the burnt leaves is used as a
pigment. Being confined to dry soil, this pine is local in Sikkim,
and the elevation it attains here is not above 3000 feet. In
Bhotan,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 146">[ 146 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">where there is more dry country, its range is
about the same, and in the north-west Himalaya, from 2,500 to 7000
feet.</p>

<p>The Lepcha never inhabits one spot for more than three
successive years, after which an increased rent is demanded by the
Rajah. He therefore <i>squats</i> in any place which he can render
profitable for that period, and then moves to another. His first
operation, after selecting a site, is to burn the jungle; then he
clears away the trees, and cultivates between the stumps. At this
season, firing the jungle is a frequent practice, and the effect by
night is exceedingly fine; a forest, so dry and full of bamboo, and
extending over such steep hills, affording grand blazing
spectacles. Heavy clouds canopy the mountains above, and,
stretching across the valleys, shut out the firmament; the air is a
dead calm, as usual in these deep gorges, and the fires, invisible
by day, are seen raging all around, appearing to an inexperienced
eye in all but dangerous proximity. The voices of birds and insects
being hushed, nothing is audible but the harsh roar of the rivers,
and occasionally, rising far above it, that of the forest fires. At
night we were literally surrounded by them; some smouldering, like
the shale-heaps at a colliery, others fitfully bursting forth,
whilst others again stalked along with a steadily increasing and
enlarging flame, shooting out great tongues of fire, which spared
nothing as they advanced with irresistible might. Their triumph is
in reaching a great bamboo clump, when the noise of the flames
drowns that of the torrents, and as the great stem-joints, burst,
from the expansion of the confined air, the report is as that of a
salvo from a park of artillery. At Dorjiling the blaze is visible,
and the deadened reports of the bamboos bursting is heard
throughout the night; but in the valley, and within a mile of the
scene of destruction, the effect is the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 147">[ 147 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">most grand, being heightened by the glare
reflected from the masses of mist which hover above.</p>

<p>On the following morning we pursued a path to the bed of the
river; passing a rude Booddhist monument, a pile of slate-rocks,
with an attempt at the mystical hemisphere at top. A few flags or
banners, and slabs of slate, were inscribed with &ldquo;Om Mani
Padmi om.&rdquo; Placed on a jutting angle of the spur, backed with
the pine-clad hills, and flanked by a torrent on either hand, the
spot was wild and picturesque; and I could not but gaze with a
feeling of deep interest on these emblems of a religion which
perhaps numbers more votaries than any other on the face of the
globe. Booddhism in some form is the predominating creed, from
Siberia and Kamschatka to Ceylon, from the Caspian steppes to
Japan, throughout China, Burmah, Ava, and a part of the Malayan
Archipelago. Its associations enter into every book of travels over
these vast regions, with Booddha, Dhurma, Sunga, Jos, Fo, and
praying-wheels. The mind is arrested by the names, the imagination
captivated by the symbols; and though I could not worship in the
grove, it was impossible to deny to the inscribed stones such a
tribute as is commanded by the first glimpse of objects which have
long been familiar to our minds, but not previously offered to our
senses. My head Lepcha went further: to a due observance of
demon-worship he united a deep reverence for the Lamas, and he
venerated their symbols rather as theirs than as those of their
religion. He walked round the pile of stones three times from left
to right repeating his &ldquo;Om Mani,&rdquo; etc., then stood
before it with his head hung down and his long queue streaming
behind, and concluded by a votive offering of three pine-cones.
When done, he looked round at me, nodded, smirked, elevated the
angles of his little</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 148">[ 148 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">turned-up eyes, and seemed to think we were safe
from all perils in the valleys yet to be explored.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images/fig9.jpg" width="265" height="349" alt=
"Pines (Pinus lonjpgolia), Rungeet Valley"></center>

<p>In the gorge of the Rungeet the heat was intolerable, though the
thermometer did not rise above 95&deg;. The mountains leave but a
narrow gorge between them, here and there bordered by a belt of
strong soil, supporting a towering crop of long cane-like grasses
and tall trees. The troubled river, about eighty yards across,
rages along over a</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 149">[ 149 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">gravelly bed. Crossing the Rungmo, where it falls
into the Rungeet, we came upon a group of natives drinking
fermented Murwa liquor, under a rock; I had a good deal of
difficulty in getting my people past, and more in inducing one of
the topers to take the place of a Ghorka (Nepalese) of our party
who was ill with fever. Soon afterwards, at a most wild and
beautiful spot, I saw, for the first time, one of the most
characteristic of Himalayan objects of art, <i>a cane bridge.</i>
All the spurs, round the bases of which the river flowed, were
steep and rocky, their flanks clothed with the richest tropical
forest, their crests tipped with pines. On the river&rsquo;s edge,
the Banana, <i>Pandanus,</i> and <i>Bauhinia,</i> were frequent,
and Figs prevailed. One of the latter (of an exceedingly beautiful
species) projected over the stream, growing out of a mass of rock,
its roots interlaced and grasping at every available support, while
its branches, loaded with deep glossy foliage, hung over the
water.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images/fig10.jpg" width="367" height="141" alt=
"Construction of a cane suspension bridge"></center>

<p>This tree formed one pier for the canes; that on the opposite
bank, was constructed of strong piles, propped with large stones;
and between them swung the bridge,* about eighty yards long, ever
rocking over the torrent (forty feet below). The lightness and
extreme simplicity of its structure were very remarkable. Two
parallel canes, on the same horizontal plane, were stretched across
the stream; from them others hung in loops, and along</p>

<p class="fnote">* A sketch of one of these bridges will be found
in <a href="vol2/chap18/page 21">Vol. II.</a></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 150">[ 150 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the loops were laid one or two bamboo stems for
flooring; cross pieces below this flooring, hung from the two upper
canes, which they thus served to keep apart. The traveller grasps
one of the canes in either hand, and walks along the loose bamboos
laid on the swinging loops: the motion is great, and the rattling
of the loose dry bamboos is neither a musical sound, nor one
calculated to inspire confidence; the whole structure seeming as if
about to break down. With shoes it is not easy to walk; and even
with bare feet it is often difficult, there being frequently but
one bamboo, which, if the fastening is loose, tilts up, leaving the
pedestrian suspended over the torrent by the slender canes. When
properly and strongly made, with good fastenings, and a floor of
bamboos laid <i>transversely,</i> these bridges are easy to cross.
The canes are procured from a species of <i>Calamus</i>; they are
as thick as the finger, and twenty, or thirty yards long, knotted
together; and the other pieces are fastened to them by strips of
the same plant. A Lepcha, carrying one hundred and forty pounds on
his back, crosses without hesitation, slowly but steadily, and with
perfect confidence.</p>

<p>A deep broad pool below the bridge was made available for a
ferry: the boat was a triangular raft of bamboo stems, with a stage
on the top, and it was secured on the opposite side of the stream,
having a cane reaching across to that on which we were. A stout
Lepcha leapt into the boiling flood, and boldly swam across,
holding on by the cane, without which he would have been carried
away. He unfastened the raft, and we drew it over by the cane, and,
seated on the stage, up to our knees in water, we were pulled
across; the raft bobbing up and down over the rippling stream.</p>

<p>We were beyond British ground, on the opposite bank,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 151">[ 151 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">where any one guiding Europeans is threatened with
punishment: we had expected a guide to follow us, but his
non-appearance caused us to delay for some hours; four roads, or
rather forest paths, meeting here, all of which were difficult to
find. After a while, part of a marriage-procession came up, headed
by the bridegroom, a handsome young Lepcha, leading a cow for the
marriage feast; and after talking to him a little, he volunteered
to show us the path. On the flats by the stream grew the Sago palm
(<i>Cycas pectinata</i>), with a stem ten feet high, and a
beautiful crown of foliage; the contrast between this and the
Scotch-looking pine (both growing with oaks and palms) was curious.
Much of the forest had been burnt, and we traversed large blackened
patches, where the heat was intense, and increased by the burning
trunks of prostrate trees, which smoulder for months, and leave a
heap of white ashes. The larger timber being hollow in the centre,
a current of air is produced, which causes the interior to burn
rapidly, till the sides fall in, and all is consumed. I was often
startled, when walking in the forest, by the hot blast proceeding
from such, which I had approached without a suspicion of their
being other than cold dead trunks.</p>

<p>Leaving the forest, the path led along the river bank, and over
the great masses of rock which strewed its course. The beautiful
India-rubber fig was common, as was <i>Bassia butyracea,</i> the
&ldquo;Yel Pote&rdquo; of the Lepchas, from the seeds of which they
express a concrete oil, which is received and hardens in bamboo
vessels. On the forest-skirts, <i>Hoya,</i> parasitical <i>
Orchide&aelig;,</i> and Ferns, abounded; the Chaulmoogra, whose
fruit is used to intoxicate fish, was very common; as was an
immense mulberry tree, that yields a milky juice and produces a
long green sweet fruit. Large fish, chiefly</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 152">[ 152 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Cyprinoid, were abundant in the beautifully clear
water of the river. But by far the most striking feature consisted
in the amazing quantity of superb butterflies, large tropical
swallow-tails, black, with scarlet or yellow eyes on their wings.
They were seen everywhere, sailing majestically through the still
hot air, or fluttering from one scorching rock to another, and
especially loving to settle on the damp sand of the river-edge;
where they sat by thousands, with erect wings, balancing themselves
with a rocking motion, as their heavy sails inclined them to one
side or the other; resembling a crowded fleet of yachts on a calm
day. Such an entomological display cannot be surpassed. <i>
Cicindel&aelig;</i> were very numerous, and incredibly active, as
were <i>Grylli</i>; and the great <i>Cicade&aelig;</i> were
everywhere lighting on the ground, when they uttered a short sharp
creaking sound, and anon disappeared, as if by magic. Beautiful
whip-snakes were gleaming in the sun: they hold on by a few coils
of the tail round a twig, the greater part of their body stretched
out horizontally, occasionally retracting, and darting an unerring
aim at some insect. The narrowness of the gorge, and the excessive
steepness of the bounding hills, prevented any view, except of the
opposite mountain face, which was one dense forest, in which the
wild Banana was conspicuous.</p>

<p>Towards evening we arrived at another cane-bridge, still more
dilapidated than the former, but similar in structure. For a few
hundred yards before reaching it, we lost the path, and followed
the precipitous face of slate-rocks overhanging the stream, which
dashed with great violence below. Though we could not walk
comfortably, even with our shoes off, the Lepchas, bearing their
enormous loads, proceeded with perfect indifference.</p>

<p>Anxious to avoid sleeping at the bottom of the valley,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 153">[ 153 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">we crawled, very much fatigued, through burnt dry
forest, up a very sharp ridge, so narrow that the tent sat astride
on it, the ropes being fastened to the tops of small trees on
either slope. The ground swarmed with black ants, which got into
our tea, sugar, etc., while it was so covered with charcoal, that
we were soon begrimed. Our Lepchas preferred remaining on the
river-bank, whence they had to bring up water to us, in great
bamboo &ldquo;chungis,&rdquo; as they are called. The great dryness
of this face is owing to its southern exposure: the opposite
mountains, equally high and steep, being clothed in a rich green
forest.</p>

<p>At nine the next morning, the temperature was 78&deg;, but a
fine cool easterly wind blew. Descending to the bed of the river,
the temperature was 84&deg;. The difference in humidity of the two
stations (with about 300 feet difference in height) was more
remarkable; at the upper, the wet bulb thermometer was
67&middot;5&deg;, and consequently the saturation point,
0&middot;713; at the lower, the wet bulb was 68&deg;, and
saturation, 0&middot;599. The temperature of the river was, at all
hours of the preceding day, and this morning,
67&middot;5&deg;.*</p>

<p>Our course down the river was by so rugged a path, that, giddy
and footsore with leaping from rock to rock, we at last attempted
the jungle, but it proved utterly impervious. On turning a bend of
the stream, the mountains of Bhotan suddenly presented themselves,
with the Teesta flowing at their base; and we emerged at the angle
formed by the junction of the Rungeet, which we</p>

<p class="fnote">* At this hour, the probable temperature at
Dorjiling (6000 feet above this) would be 56&deg;, with a
temperature of wet bulb 55&deg;, and the atmosphere loaded with
vapour. At Calcutta, again, the temperature was at the observatory
98.&middot;3&deg;, wet bulb, 81.8&deg;, and
saturation=0&middot;737. The dryness of the air, in the
damper-looking and luxuriant river-bed, was owing to the heated
rocks of its channel; while the humidity of the atmosphere over the
drier-looking hill where we encamped, was due to the moisture of
the wind then blowing.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 154">[ 154 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">had followed from the west, of the Teesta, coming
from the north, and of their united streams flowing south.</p>

<p>We were not long before enjoying the water, when I was surprised
to find that of the Teesta singularly cold; its temperature being
7&deg; below that of the Rungeet.* At the salient angle (a rocky
peninsula) of their junction, we could almost place one foot in the
cold stream and the other in the warmer. There is a no less marked
difference in the colour of the two rivers; the Teesta being
sea-green and muddy, the Great Rungeet dark green and very clear;
and the waters, like those of the Arve and Rhone at Geneva,
preserve their colours for some hundred yards; the line separating
the two being most distinctly drawn. The Teesta, or main stream, is
much the broadest (about 80 or 100 yards wide at this season), the
most rapid and deep. The rocks which skirt its bank were covered
with a silt or mud deposit, which I nowhere observed along the
Great Rungeet, and which, as well as its colour and coldness, was
owing to the vast number of then melting glaciers drained by this
river. The Rungeet, on the other hand, though it rises amongst the
glaciers of Kinchinjunga and its sister peaks, is chiefly supplied
by the rainfall of the outer ranges of Sinchul and Singalelah, and
hence its waters are clear, except during the height of the
rains.</p>

<p>From this place we returned to Dorjiling, arriving on the
afternoon of the following day.</p>

<p>The most interesting trip to be made from Dorjiling, is that to
the summit of Tonglo, a mountain on the Singalelah</p>

<p class="fnote">* This is, no doubt, due partly to the Teesta
flowing south, and thus having less of the sun, and partly to its
draining snowy mountains throughout a much longer portion of its
course. The temperature of the one was 67&middot;5&deg;, and that
of the other 60&middot;5&deg;.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 155">[ 155 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">range, 10,079 feet high, due west of the station,
and twelve miles in a straight line, but fully thirty by the
path.*</p>

<p>Leaving the station by a native path, the latter plunges at once
into a forest, and descends very rapidly, occasionally emerging on
cleared spurs, where are fine crops of various millets, with much
maize and rice. Of the latter grain as many as eight or ten
varieties are cultivated, but seldom irrigated, which, owing to the
dampness of the climate, is not necessary: the produce is often
eighty-fold, but the grain is large, coarse, reddish, and rather
gelatinous when boiled. After burning the timber, the top soil is
very fertile for several seasons, abounding in humus, below which
is a stratum of stiff clay, often of great thickness, produced by
the disintegration of the rocks;&dagger; the clay makes excellent
bricks, and often contains nearly 30 per cent. of alumina.</p>

<p>At about 4000 feet the great bamboo (&ldquo;Pao&rdquo; Lepcha)
abounds; it flowers every year, which is not the case with all
others of this genus, most of which flower profusely over large
tracts of country, once in a great many years, and then die away;
their place being supplied by seedlings, which grow with immense
rapidity. This well-known fact is not due, as some suppose, to the
life of the species being of such a duration, but to favourable
circumstances in the season. The Pao attains a height of 40 to 60
feet, and the culms average in thickness the human thigh; it is
used for large water-vessels, and its leaves form admirable thatch,
in universal use for European houses at Dorjiling. Besides this,
the Lepchas are acquainted with nearly a dozen kinds of bamboo;
these occur at various elevations below 12,000</p>

<p class="fnote">* A full account of the botanical features noticed
on this excursion (which I made in May, 1848, with Mr. Barnes) has
appeared in the &ldquo;London Journal of Botany,&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Horticultural Society&rsquo;s Journal,&rdquo; and I shall,
therefore, recapitulate its leading incidents only.<br>

<p class="first">feet, forming, even in the pine-woods, and above
their zone, in the skirts of the <i>Rhododendron</i> scrub, a small
and sometimes almost impervious jungle. In an economical point of
view they maybe classed as those which split readily, and those
which do not. The young shoots of several are eaten, and the seeds
of one are made into a fermented drink, and into bread in times of
scarcity; but it would take many pages to describe the numerous
purposes to which the various species are put.</p>

<p>Gordonia is their most common tree (<i>G.
Wallichii</i>), much prized for ploughshares and other purposes
requiring a hard wood: it is the &ldquo;Sing-brang-kun &rdquo; of
the Lepchas, and ascends to 4000 feet. Oaks at this elevation occur
as solitary trees, of species different from those of Dorjiling.
There are three or four with a cup-shaped involucre, and three with
spinous involucres enclosing an eatable sweet nut; these generally
grow on a dry clayey soil.</p>

<p>Some low steep spurs were well cultivated, though the angle of
the field was upwards of 25&deg;; the crops, chiefly maize, were
just sprouting. This plant is occasionally hermaphrodite in Sikkim,
the flowers forming a large drooping panicle and ripening small
grains; it is, however, a rare occurrence, and the specimens are
highly valued by the people.</p>

<p>The general prevalence of figs,* and their allies, the
nettles,&dagger; is a remarkable feature in the botany of the
Sikkim Himalaya, up to nearly 10,000 feet. Of the former there were
here five species, some bearing eatable and very palatable fruit of
enormous size, others with the fruit small and borne on prostrate,
leafless branches, which spring from the root and creep along the
ground.</p>

<p>A troublesome, dipterous insect (the &ldquo;Peepsa,&rdquo; a
species of <i>Siamulium</i>) swarms on the banks of the streams; it
is very small and black, floating like a speck before the eye; its
bite leaves a spot of extravasated blood under the cuticle, very
irritating if not opened.</p>

<p>Crossing the Little Rungeet river, we camped on the base of
Tonglo. The night was calm and clear, with faint</p>

<p class="fnote">* One species of this very tropical genus ascends
almost to 9000 feet on the outer ranges of Sikkim.<br>
&dagger; Of two of these cloth is made, and of a third, cordage.
The tops of two are eaten, as are several species of <i>
Procris.</i> The &ldquo;Poa&rdquo; belongs to this order, yielding
that kind of grass cloth fibre, now abundantly imported into
England from the Malay Islands, and used extensively for
shirting.</p>

<p class="first">cirrus, but no dew. A thermometer sunk two feet in
rich vegetable mould stood at 78&deg; two hours after it was
lowered, and the same on the following morning. This probably
indicates the mean temperature of the month at that spot, where,
however, the dark colour of the exposed loose soil must raise the
temperature considerably.</p>

<p><i>May 20th.</i>&mdash;The temperature at sunrise was 67&deg;;
the morning bright, and clear over head, but the mountains looked
threatening. Dorjiling, perched on a ridge 5000 feet above us, had
a singular appearance. We ascended the Simonbong spur of Tonglo, so
called from a small village and Lama temple of that name on its
summit; where we arrived at noon, and passing some chaits* gained
the Lama&rsquo;s residence.</p>

<p>Two species of bamboo, the &ldquo;Payong&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Praong&rdquo; of the Lepchas, here replace the Pao of the
lower regions. The former was flowering abundantly, the whole of
the culms (which were 20 feet high) being a diffuse panicle of
inflorescence. The &ldquo;Praong&rdquo; bears a round head of
flowers at the ends of the leafy branches. Wild strawberry, violet,
geranium, etc., announced our approach to the temperate zone.
Around the temple were potato crops and peach-trees, rice, millet,
yam, brinjal (egg-apple), fennel, hemp (for smoking its narcotic
leaves), and cummin, etc. The potato thrives extremely well as a
summer crop, at 7000 feet, in Sikkim, though I think the root (from
the Dorjiling stock) cultivated as a winter crop in the plains, is
superior both in size and flavour. Peaches never ripen in this part
of Sikkim, apparently from the want of sun; the tree</p>

<p class="fnote">* The chait of Sikkim, borrowed from Tibet, is a
square pedestal, surmounted with a hemisphere, the convex end
downwards, and on it is placed a cone, with a crescent on the top.
These are erected as tombs to Lamas, and as monuments to
illustrious persons, and are venerated accordingly, the people
always passing them from left to right, often repeating the
invocation, &ldquo;Ora Mani Padmi om.&rdquo;</p>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">grows well at from 3000 to 7000 feet elevation,
and flowers abundantly; the fruit making the nearest approach to
maturity (according to the elevation) from July to October. At
Dorjiling it follows the English seasons, flowering in March and
fruiting in September, when the scarce reddened and still hard
fruit falls from the tree. In the plains of India, both this and
the plum ripen in May, but the fruits are very acid.</p>

<p>It is curious that throughout this temperate region, there is
hardly an eatable fruit except the native walnut, and some
brambles, of which the &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; and &ldquo;ground
raspberry&rdquo; are the best, some insipid figs, and a very
austere crab-apple. The European apple will scarcely ripen,* and
the pear not at all. Currants and gooseberries show no disposition
to thrive, and strawberries are the only fruits that ripen at all,
which they do in the greatest abundance. Vines, figs, pomegranates,
plums, apricots, etc., will not succeed even as trees. European
vegetables again grow, and thrive remarkably well throughout the
summer of Dorjiling, and the produce is very fair, sweet and good,
but inferior in flavour to the English.</p>

<p>Of tropical fruits cultivated below 4000 feet, oranges and
indifferent bananas alone are frequent, with lemons of various
kinds. The season for these is, however, very short; though that of
the plantain might with care be prolonged; oranges abound in
winter, and are excellent, but neither so large nor free of white
pulp as those of the Khasia hills, the West Indies, or the west
coast of Africa. Mangos are brought from the plains, for though
wild in Sikkim, the cultivated kinds do not thrive; I have</p>

<p class="fnote">* This fruit, and several others, ripen at
Katmandoo, in Nepal (alt. 4000 feet), which place enjoys more
sunshine than Sikkim. I have, however, received very differedt
accounts of the produce, which, on the whole, appears to be
inferior.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 160">[ 160 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">seen the pine-apple plant, but I never met with
good fruit on it.</p>

<p>A singular and almost total absence of the light, and of the
direct rays of the sun in the ripening season, is the cause of this
dearth of fruit. Both the farmer and orchard gardener in England
know full well the value of a bright sky as well as of a warm
autumnal atmosphere. Without this corn does not ripen, and
fruit-trees are blighted. The winter of the plains of India being
more analogous in its distribution of moisture and heat to a
European summer, such fruits as the peach, vine, and even plum,
fig, strawberry, etc., may be brought to bear well in March, April,
and May, if they are only carefully tended through the previous hot
and damp season, which is, in respect to the functions of flowering
and fruiting, their winter.</p>

<p>Hence it appears that, though some English fruits will turn the
winter solstice of Bengal (November to May) into summer, and then
flower and fruit, neither these nor others will thrive in the
summer of 7000 feet on the Sikkim Himalaya, (though its temperature
so nearly approaches that of England,) on account of its rain and
fogs. Further, they are often exposed to a winter&rsquo;s cold
equal to the average of that of London, the snow lying for a week
on the ground, and the thermometer descending to 25&deg;. It is
true that in no case is the extreme of cold so great here as in
England, but it is sufficient to check vegetation, and to prevent
fruit-trees from flowering till they are fruiting in the plains.
There is in this respect a great difference between the climate of
the central and eastern and western Himalaya, at equal elevations.
In the western (Kumaon, etc.) the winters are colder than in
Sikkim&mdash;the summers warmer and less humid. The rainy season is
shorter, and</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 161">[ 161 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the sun shines so much more frequently between the
heavy showers, that the apple and other fruits are brought to a
much better state. It is true that the rain-gauge may show as great
a fall there, but this is no measure of the humidity of the
atmosphere, and still less so of the amount of the sun&rsquo;s
direct light and heat intercepted by aqueous vapour, for it takes
no account of the quantity of moisture suspended in the air, nor of
the depositions from fogs, which are far more fatal to the
perfecting of fruits than the heaviest brief showers. The Indian
climate, which is marked by one season of excessive humidity and
the other of excessive drought, can never be favourable to the
production either of good European or tropical fruits. Hence there
is not one of the latter peculiar to the country, and perhaps but
one which arrives at full perfection; namely, the mango. Tile
plantains, oranges, and pine-apples are less abundant, of inferior
kinds, and remain a shorter season in perfection than they do in
South America, the West Indies, or Western Africa.</p>
