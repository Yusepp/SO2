<p class="first">
On the 3rd of March I bade farewell to Mr. Williams and his kind
party, and rode over a plain to the village of Markunda, at the
foot of the Ghat. There the country becomes very rocky and wooded,
and a stream is crossed, which runs over a flat bed of limestone,
cracked into the appearance of a tesselated pavement. For many
miles there is no pass over the Kymore range, except this,
significantly called &ldquo;Ek-powa-Ghat&rdquo; (one-foot Ghat). It
is evidently a <i>fault,</i> or shifting of the rocks, producing so
broken a cliff as to admit of a path winding over the shattered
crags. On either side, the precipices are extremely steep, of
horizontally stratified rocks, continued in an unbroken line, and
the views across the plain and Soane valley, over which the sun was
now setting, were superb. At the summit we entered on a dead flat
plain or table-land, with no hills, except along the brim of the
broad valley we had left, where are some curious broad
pyramids,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 60">[ 60 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">formed of slabs of sandstone arranged in steps. By
dark we reached the village of Roump (alt. 1,090 feet), beyond the
top of the pass.</p>

<p>On the next day I proceeded on a small, fast, and wofully
high-trotting elephant, to Shahgunj, where I enjoyed Mr.
Felle&rsquo;s hospitality for a few days. The country here, though
elevated, is, from the nature of the soil and formation, much more
fertile than what I had left. Water is abundant, both in tanks and
wells, and rice-fields, broad and productive, cover the ground;
while groves of tamarinds and mangos, now loaded with blossoms,
occur at every village.</p>

<p>It is very singular that the elevation of this table-land (1,100
feet at Shahgunj) should coincide with that of the granite range of
Upper Bengal, where crossed by the grand trunk road, though they
have no feature but the presence of alluvium in common. Scarce a
hillock varies the surface here, and the agricultural produce of
the two is widely different. Here the flat ledges of sandstone
retain the moisture, and give rise to none of those impetuous
torrents which sweep it off the inclined beds of gneiss, or
splintered quartz. Nor is there here any of the effloresced salts
so forbidding to vegetation where they occur. Wherever the alluvium
is deep on these hills, neither <i>Catechu, Olibanum, Butea,
Terminalia, Diospyros,</i> dwarf-palm, or any of those plants are
to be met with, which abound wherever the rock is superficial, and
irrespectively of its mineral characters.</p>

<p>The gum-arabic <i>Acacia</i> is abundant here, though not seen
below, and very rare to the eastward of this meridian, for I saw
but little of it in Behar. It is a plant partial to a dry climate,
and rather prefers a good soil. In its distribution it in some
degree follows the range of the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 61">[ 61 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">camel, which is its constant companion over
thousands of leagues. In the valley of the Ganges I was told that
neither the animal nor plant flourish east of the Soane, where I
experienced a marked change in the humidity of the atmosphere on my
passage down the Ganges. It was a circumstance I was interested in,
having first met with the camel at Teneriffe and the Cape Verd
Islands, the westernmost limit of its distribution; imported
thither, however, as it now is into Australia, where, though there
is no <i>Acacia Arabica,</i> four hundred other species of the
genus are known.</p>

<p>The mango, which is certainly <i>the</i> fruit of India, (as the
pine-apple is of the Eastern Islands, and the orange of the West,)
was now blossoming, and a superb sight. The young leaves are
purplish-green, and form a curious contrast to the deep lurid hue
of the older foliage; especially when the tree is (which often
occurs) dimidiate, one half the green, and the other the red shades
of colours; when in full blossom, all forms a mass of yellow,
diffusing a fragrance rather too strong and peculiar to be
pleasant.</p>

<p>We passed a village where a large fair was being held, and
singularly familiar its arrangements were to my early associations.
The women and children are the prime customers; for the latter
whirl-you-go-rounds, toys, and sweetmeats were destined; to tempt
the former, little booths of gay ornaments, patches for the
forehead, ear-rings of quaint shapes, bugles and beads. Here as at
home, I remarked that the vendors of these superfluities occupy the
approaches to this Vanity-Fair. As, throughout the East, the trades
are congregated into particular quarters of the cities, so here the
itinerants grouped themselves into little bazaars for each class of
commodity. Whilst I was</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 62">[ 62 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">engaged in purchasing a few articles of native
workmanship, my elephant made an attack on a sweetmeat stall,
demolishing a magnificent erection of barley-sugar, before his
proceedings could be put a stop to.</p>

<p>Mr. Felle&rsquo;s bungalow (whose garden smiled with roses in
this wilderness) was surrounded by a moat (fed by a spring), which
was full of aquatic plants, <i>Nymph&aelig;a, Damasonium, Villarsia
cristata, Aponogeton,</i> three species of <i>Potamogeton,</i> two
of <i>Naias, Chara</i> and <i>Zannichellia</i> (the two latter
indifferently, and often together, used in the refinement of
sugar). In a large tank hard by, wholly fed by rain water, I
observed only the <i>Villarsia Indica,</i> no <i>Aponogeton,
Nymph&aelig;a,</i> or <i>Dammonium,</i> nor did these occur in any
of the other tanks I examined, which were otherwise well peopled
with plants. This may not be owing to the quality of the water so
much as to its varying quantity in the tank.</p>

<p>All around here, as at Roump, is a dead flat, except towards the
crest of the ghats which overhang the valley of the Soane, and
there the sandstone rock rises by steps into low hills. During a
ride to a natural tank amongst these rocky elevations, I passed
from the alluvium to the sandstone, and at once met with all the
prevailing plants of the granite, gneiss, limestone and hornstone
rocks previously examined, and which I have enumerated too often to
require recapitulation; a convincing proof that the mechanical
properties and not the chemical constitution of the rocks regulate
the distribution of these plants.</p>

<p>Rujubbund (the pleasant spot), is a small tarn, or more properly
the expanded bed of a stream, art having aided nature in its
formation: it is edged by rocks and cliffs fringed with the usual
trees of the neighbourhood; it is a wild and pretty spot, not
unlike some</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 63">[ 63 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">birch-bordered pool in the mountains of Wales or
Scotland, sequestered and picturesque. It was dark before I got
back, with heavy clouds and vivid lightning approaching from the
south-west. The day had been very hot (3 p.m., 90&deg;), and the
evening the same; but the barometer did not foretell the coming
tempest, which broke with fury at 7 p.m., blowing open the doors,
and accompanied with vivid lightning and heavy thunder, close by
and all round, though no rain fell.</p>

<p>In the clear dry mornings of these regions, a curious optical
phenomena may be observed, of a <i>sunrise</i> in the <i>west,</i>
and <i>sunset</i> in the <i>east.</i> In either case, bright and
well-defined beams rise to the zenith, often crossing to the
opposite horizon. It is a beautiful feature in the firmament, and
equally visible whether the horizon be cloudy or clear, the white
beams being projected indifferently against a dark vapour or the
blue serene. The zodiacal light shines from an hour or two after
sunset till midnight, with singular brightness, almost equalling
the milky way.</p>

<p><i>March 7.</i>&mdash;Left Shahgunj for Mirzapore, following the
road to Goorawal, over a dead alluvial flat without a feature to
remark. Turning north from that village, the country undulates,
exposing the rocky nucleus, and presenting the usual concomitant
vegetation. Occasionally park-like views occurred, which, where
diversified by the rocky valleys, resemble much the noble scenery
of the Forest of Dean on the borders of Wales; the <i>Mahowa</i>
especially representing the oak, with its spreading and often
gnarled branches. Many of the exposed slabs of sandstone are
beautifully waved on the surface with the <i>ripple-mark</i>
impression.</p>

<p>Amowee, where I arrived at 9 p.m., is on an open grassy flat,
about fifteen miles from the Ganges, which is</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 64">[ 64 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">seen from the neighbourhood, flowing among trees,
with the white houses, domes, and temples of Mirzapore scattered
around, and high above which the dust-clouds were coursing along
the horizon.</p>

<p>Mr. Money, the magistrate of Mirzapore, kindly sent a mounted
messenger to meet me here, who had vast trouble in getting bearers
for my palkee. In it I proceeded the next day to Mirzapore,
descending a steep ghat of the Bind hills by an excellent road, to
the level plains of the Ganges. Unlike the Dunwah pass, this is
wholly barren. At the foot the sun was intensely hot, the roads
alternately rocky and dusty, the villages thronged with a widely
different looking race from those of the hills, and the whole air
of the outskirts, on a sultry afternoon, far from agreeable.</p>

<p>Mirzapore is a straggling town, said to contain 100,000
inhabitants. It flanks the river, and is built on an undulating
alluvial bank, full of kunker, elevated 360 feet above the sea, and
from 50 to 80 above the present level of the river. The vicinity of
the Ganges and its green bank, and the numbers of fine trees
around, render it a pleasing, though not a fine town. It presents
the usual Asiatic contrast of squalor and gaudiness; consisting of
large squares and broad streets, interspersed with acres of low
huts and groves of trees. It is celebrated for its manufactory of
carpets, which are admirable in appearance, and, save in
durability, equal to the English. Indigo seed from Bundelkund is
also a most extensive article of commerce, the best coming from the
Doab. For cotton, lac, sugar, and saltpetre, it is one of the
greatest marts in India. The articles of native manufacture are
brass washing and cooking utensils, and stone deities worked out of
the sandstone.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 65">[ 65 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is little native vegetation, the country
being covered with cultivation and extensive groves of mango, and
occasionally of guava. English vegetables are abundant and
excellent, and the strawberries, which ripen in March, rival the
European fruit in size, but hardly in flavour.</p>

<p>During the few days spent at Mirzapore with my kind friend, Mr.
C. Hamilton, I was surprised to find the temperature of the day
cooler by nearly 4&deg; than that of the hills above, or of the
upper part of the Soane valley; while on the other hand the nights
were decidedly warmer. The dewpoint again was even lower in
proportion, (7&middot;5&deg;) and the climate consequently drier.
The atmosphere was extremely dry and electrical, the hair
constantly crackling when combed. Further west, where the climate
becomes still drier, the electricity of the air is even greater.
Mr. Griffith mentions in his journal that in filling barometer
tubes in Affghanistan, he constantly experienced a shock.</p>

<p>Here I had the pleasure of meeting Lieutenant Ward, one of the
suppressors of Thuggee (<i>Thuggee,</i> in Hindostan, signifies a
deceiver; fraud, not open force, being employed). This gentleman
kindly showed me the approvers or king&rsquo;s evidence of his
establishment, belonging to those three classes of human scourges,
the Thug, Dakoit, and Poisoner. Of these the first was the Thug, a
mild-looking man, who had been born and bred to the profession: he
had committed many murders, saw no harm in them, and felt neither
shame nor remorse. His organs of observation and destructiveness
were large, and the cerebellum small. He explained to me how the
gang waylay the unwary traveller, enter into conversation with him,
and have him suddenly seized, when the superior throws his own
linen girdle round the victim&rsquo;s neck and strangles him,
pressing the knuckles against the spine.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 66">[ 66 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Taking off his own, he passed it round my arm, and
showed me the turn as coolly as a sailor once taught me the <i>
hangman&rsquo;s knot.</i> The Thug is of any caste, and from any
part of India. The profession have particular stations, which they
generally select for murder, throwing the body of their victim into
a well.</p>

<p>The Dakoit (<i>dakhee,</i> a robber) belongs to a class who rob
in gangs, but never commit murder&mdash;arson and housebreaking
also forming part of their profession. These are all high-class
Rajpoots, originally from Guzerat; who, on being conquered, vowed
vengeance on mankind. They speak both Hindostanee and the otherwise
extinct Guzerat language; this is guttural in the extreme, and very
singular in sound. They are a very remarkable people, found
throughout India, and called by various names; their women dress
peculiarly, and are utterly devoid of modesty. The man I examined
was a short, square, but far from powerful Nepalese, with high
arched eyebrows, and no organs of observation. These people are
great cowards.</p>

<p>The Poisoners all belong to one caste, of Pasie, or dealers in
toddy: they go singly or in gangs, haunting the travellers&rsquo;
resting-places, where they drop half a rupee weight of pounded or
whole <i>Datura</i> seeds into his food, producing a
twenty-hours&rsquo; intoxication, during which he is robbed, and
left to recover or sink under the stupifying effects of the
narcotic. He told me that the <i>Datura</i> seed is gathered
without ceremony, and at any time, place, or age of the plant. He
was a dirty, ill-conditioned looking fellow, with no bumps behind
his ears, or prominence of eyebrow region, but a remarkable
cerebellum.</p>

<p>Though now all but extinct (except in Cuttack), through ten or
fifteen years of unceasing vigilance on the part of</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 67">[ 67 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Government, and incredible activity and acuteness
in the officers employed, the Thugs were formerly a wonderfully
numerous body, who abstained from their vocation solely in the
immediate neighbourhood of their own villages; which, however, were
not exempt from the visits of other Thugs; so that, as Major
Sleeman says,&mdash;&ldquo;The annually returning tide of murder
swept unsparingly over the whole face of India, from the Sutlej to
the sea-coast, and from the Himalaya to Cape Comorin. One narrow
district alone was free, the Concan, beyond the ghats, whither they
never penetrated.&rdquo; In Bengal, river Thugs replace the
travelling practitioner. Candeish and Rohilkund alone harboured no
Thugs as residents, but they were nevertheless haunted by the
gangs.</p>

<p>Their origin is uncertain, but supposed to be very ancient, soon
after the Mahommedan conquest. They now claim a divine original,
and are supposed to have supernatural powers, and to be the
emissaries of the divinity, like the wolf, the tiger, and the bear.
It is only lately that they have swarmed so
prodigiously,&mdash;seven original gangs having migrated from Delhi
to the Gangetic provinces about 200 years ago, and from these all
the rest have sprung. Many belong to the most amiable, intelligent,
and respectable classes of the lower and even middle ranks: they
love their profession, regard murder as sport, and are never
haunted with dreams, or troubled with pangs of conscience during
hours of solitude, or in the last moments of life. The victim is an
acceptable sacrifice to the goddess Davee, who by some classes is
supposed to eat the lifeless body, and thus save her votaries the
necessity of concealing it.</p>

<p>They are extremely superstitious, always consulting omens, such
as the direction in which a hare or jackall</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 68">[ 68 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">crosses the road; and even far more trivial
circumstances will determine the fate of a dozen of people, and
perhaps of an immense treasure. All worship the pickaxe, which is
symbolical of their profession, and an oath sworn on it binds
closer than on the Koran. The consecration of this weapon is a most
elaborate ceremony, and takes place only under certain trees. They
rise through various grades: the lowest are scouts; the second,
sextons; the third are holders of the victims&rsquo; hands; the
highest, stranglers.</p>

<p>Though all agree in never practising cruelty, or robbing
previous to murder,&mdash;never allowing any but infants to escape
(and these are trained to Thuggee), and never leaving a trace of
such goods as may be identified,&mdash;there are several variations
in their mode of conducting operations; some tribes spare certain
castes, others none: murder of woman is against all rules; but the
practice crept into certain gangs, and this it is which led to
their discountenance by the goddess Davee, and the consequent
downfall of the system. Davee, they say, allowed the British to
punish them, because a certain gang had murdered the mothers to
obtain their daughters to be sold to prostitution.</p>

<p>Major Sleeman has constructed a map demonstrating the number of
&ldquo;Bails,&rdquo; or regular stations for committing murder, in
the kingdom of Oude alone, which is 170 miles long by 100 broad,
and in which are 274, which are regarded by the Thug with as much
satisfaction and interest as a game preserve is in England: nor are
these &ldquo;bails&rdquo; less numerous in other parts of India. Of
twenty assassins who were examined, one frankly confessed to having
been engaged in 931 murders, and the least guilty of the number to
24. Sometimes 150 persons collected into one gang, and their
profits have often been immense,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 69">[ 69 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the murder of six persons on one occasion yielding
82,000 rupees; upwards of 8000 pounds.</p>

<p>Of the various facilities for keeping up the system, the most
prominent are, the practice amongst the natives of travelling
before dawn, of travellers mixing freely together, and taking their
meals by the way-side instead of in villages; in the very Bails, in
fact, to which they are inveigled by the Thug in the shape of a
fellow-traveller; money remittances are also usually made by
disguised travellers, whose treasure is exposed at the
custom-houses, and, worst of all, the bankers will never own to the
losses they sustain, which, as a visitation of God, would, if
avenged, lead, they think, to future, and perhaps heavier
punishment. Had the Thugs destroyed Englishmen, they would quickly
have been put down; but the system being invariably practised on a
class of people acknowledging the finger of the Deity in its
execution, its glaring enormities were long in rousing the
attention of the Indian Government.</p>

<p>A few examples of the activity exercised by the suppressors may
be interesting. They act wholly through the information given by
approvers, who are simply king&rsquo;s evidences. Of 600 Thugs
engaged in the murder of 64 people, and the plunder of nearly
20,000 pounds, all except seventy were captured in ten years,
though separated into six gangs, and their operations continued
from 1,826 to 1830: the last party was taken in 1836. And again,
between the years 1826 and 1835, 1,562 Thugs were seized, of whom
382 were hanged, and 909 transported; so that now it is but seldom
these wretches are ever heard of.</p>

<p>To show the extent of their operations I shall quote an anecdote
from Sleeman&rsquo;s Reports (to which I am indebted for most of
the above information). He states that he was</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 70">[ 70 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">for three years in charge of a district on the
Nerbudda, and considered himself acquainted with every circumstance
that occurred in the neighbourhood; yet, during that time, 100
people were murdered and buried within less than a quarter of a
mile of his own residence!</p>

<p>Two hundred and fifty boats full of river Thugs, in crews of
fifteen, infested the Ganges between Benares and Calcutta, during
five months of every year, under pretence of conveying pilgrims.
Travellers along the banks were tracked, and offered a passage,
which if refused in the first boat was probably accepted in some
other. At a given signal the crews rushed in, doubled up the
decoyed victim, broke his back, and threw him into the river, where
floating corpses are too numerous to elicit even an
exclamation.</p>

<p>At Mirzapore I engaged a boat to carry me down the river to
Bhagulpore, whence I was to proceed to the Sikkim-Himalaya. The
sketch at <a href="images/fig6.jpg">p.88</a> will give some idea of
this vessel, which, though slow and very shabby, had the advantage
of being cooler and more commodious than the handsomer craft. Its
appearance was not unlike that of a floating haystack, or thatched
cottage: its length was forty feet, and breadth fifteen, and it
drew a foot and a half of water: the deck, on which a kind of
house, neatly framed of matting, was erected, was but a little
above the water&rsquo;s edge. My portion of this floating residence
was lined with a kind of reed-work formed of long culms of <i>
Saccharum.</i> The crew and captain consisted of six naked Hindoos,
one of whom steered by the huge rudder, sitting on a bamboo-stage
astern; the others pulled four oars in the very bows opposite my
door, or tracked the boat along the riverbank.</p>

<p>In my room (for cabin I cannot call it) stood my palkee,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 71">[ 71 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">fitted as a bed, with mosquito curtains; a chair
and table. On one side were placed all my papers and plants, under
arrangement to go home; on the other, my provisions, rice, sugar,
curry-powder, a preserved ham, and cheese, etc. Around hung
telescope, botanical box, dark lantern, barometer, and thermometer,
etc., etc. Our position was often <i>ashore,</i> and, Hindoo-like,
on the lee-shore, going bump, bump, bump, so that I could hardly
write. I considered myself fortunate in having to take this slow
conveyance down, it enabling me to write and arrange all day
long.</p>

<p>I left on the 15th of March, and in the afternoon of the same
day passed Chunar.* This is a tabular mass of sandstone, projecting
into the river, and the eastern termination of the Kymore range.
There is not a rock between this and the Himalaya, and barely a
stone all the way down the Ganges, till the granite and gneiss
rocks of the Behar range are again met with. The current of the
Ganges is here very strong, and its breadth much lessened: the
river runs between high banks of alluvium, containing much kunker.
At Benares it expands into a broad stream, with a current which
during the rains is said to flow eight miles an hour, when the
waters rise 43 feet. The fall hence is 300 feet to its junction
with the Hooghly, viz., one foot to every mile. My observations
made that from Mirzapore to Benares considerably greater.</p>

<p>Benares is the Athens of India. The variety of buildings along
the bank is incredible. There are temples of every shape in all
stages of completion and dilapidation, and at all angles of
inclination; for the banks give way so much that many of these
edifices are fearfully out of the perpendicular.</p>

<p class="fnote">* The first station at which Henry Martyn laboured
in India.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 72">[ 72 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The famed mosque, built by Aurungzebe on the site
of a Hindoo temple, is remarkable for its two octagonal minarets,
232 feet above the Ganges. The view from it over the town,
especially of the European Resident&rsquo;s quarter, is fine; but
the building itself is deficient in beauty or ornament: it commands
the muddy river with its thousands of boats, its waters peopled
with swimmers and bathers, who spring in from the many temples,
water-terraces, and ghats on the city side: opposite is a great
sandy plain. The town below looks a mass of poor, square,
flat-roofed houses, of which 12,000 are brick, and 16,000 mud and
thatch, through the crowd of which, and of small temples, the eye
wanders in vain for some attractive feature or evidence of the
wealth, the devotion, the science, or the grandeur of a city
celebrated throughout the East for all these attributes. Green
parrots and pigeons people the air.</p>

<p>The general appearance of an oriental town is always more or
less ruinous; and here the eye is fatigued with bricks and
crumbling edifices, and the ear with prayer-bells. The bright
meadows and green trees which adorn the European Resident&rsquo;s
dwelling, some four miles back from the river, alone relieve the
monotony of the scene. The streets are so narrow that it is
difficult to ride a horse through them; and the houses are often
six stories high, with galleries crossing above from house to
house. These tall, gaunt edifices sometimes give place to clumps of
cottages, and a mass of dusty ruins, the unsavoury retreats of
vermin and filth, where the <i>Calotropis arborea</i> generally
spreads its white branches and glaucous leaves&mdash;a dusty plant.
Here, too, enormous spiders&rsquo; webs hang from the crumbling
walls, choked also with dust, and resembling curtains of coarse
muslin, being often some yards across,</p>

weaver&rsquo;s woofs. Paintings, remarkable only for their hideous
proportions and want of perspective, are daubed in vermilion,
ochre, and indigo. The elephant, camel, and porpoise of the Ganges,
dog, shepherd, peacock, and horse, are especially frequent, and so
is a running pattern of a hand spread open, with a blood-red spot
on the palm. A still less elegant but frequent object is the fuel,
which is composed of the manure collected on the roads of the city,
moulded into flat cakes, and stuck by the women on the walls to
dry, retaining the sign-manual of the artist in the impressed form
of her outspread hand. The cognizance of the Rajah, two fish
chained together, appears over the gates of public buildings.</p>

<p>The hundreds of temples and shrines throughout the city are its
most remarkable feature: sacred bulls, and lingams of all sizes,
strewed with flowers and grains of rice meet the eye at every turn;
and the city&rsquo;s boast is the possession of one million idols,
which, of one kind and another, I can well believe. The great
Hindoo festival of the <i>Holi</i> was now celebrating, and the
city more than ordinarily crowded; throwing red powder (lac and
flour), with rose-water, is the great diversion at a festival more
childish by far than a carnival.</p>

<p>Through the kindness of Mr. Reade (the Commissioner), I obtained
admission to the Bishishar-Kumardil, the &ldquo;holiest of
holies.&rdquo; It was a small, low, stone building, daubed with red
inside, and swarming with stone images of Brahminee bulls, and
various disgusting emblems. A fat old Brahmin, naked to the waist,
took me in, but allowed no followers; and what with my ignorance of
his phraseology, the clang of bells and din of voices, I gained but
little information. Some fine bells from Nepal were</p>

adorned with a chaplet of magnolia flowers, and with my hands full
of <i>Calotropis</i> and <i>Nyctanthes</i> blossoms. It was a
horrid place for noise, smell, and sights. Thence I went to a holy
well, rendered sacred because Siva, when stepping from the Himalaya
to Ceylon, accidentally let a medicine chest fall into it. The
natives frequent it with little basins or baskets of rice, sugar,
etc., dropping in a little of each while they mutter prayers.</p>

the great stone instruments are rapidly crumbling away. The
building is square, with a central court and flat roof, round which
the astrolabes, etc. are arranged. A half naked Astronomer-Royal,
with a large sore on his stomach, took me round&mdash;he was a
pitiful object, and told me he was very hungry. The observatory is
nominally supported by the Rajah of Jeypore, who doles out a too
scanty pittance to his scientific corps.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mr. Reade drove me to the Sar-nath, a singular
Boodhist temple, a cylindrical mass of brickwork, faced with stone,
the scrolls on which were very beautiful, and as sharp as if
freshly cut: it is surmounted by a tall dome, and is altogether
about seventy or a hundred feet high. Of the Boodh figures only one
remains, the others having been used by a recent magistrate of
Benares in repairing a bridge over the Goomtee! From this place the
Boodhist monuments, Hindoo temple, Mussulman mosque, and English
church, were all embraced in one <i>coup d&rsquo;&oelig;il.</i> On
our return, we drove past many enormous mounds of earth and
brick-work, the vestiges of Old Benares, but whether once continued
to the present city or not is unknown. Remains are abundant,
eighteen feet below the site of the present city.</p>

<p>Benares is the Mecca of the Hindoos, and the number of pilgrims
who visit it is incalculable. Casi (its ancient name, signifying
splendid), is alleged to be no part of this world, which rests on
eternity, whereas Benares is perched on a prong of Siva&rsquo;s
trident, and is hence beyond the reach of earthquakes.* Originally
built of gold, the</p>

transmutation into stone, and latterly into mud and thatch: whoever
enters it, and especially visits its principal idol (Siva
fossilised) is secure of heaven.</p>

<p>On the 18th I left Benares for Ghazepore, a pretty town situated
on the north bank of the river, celebrated for its manufacture of
rose-water, the tomb of Lord Cornwallis, and a site of the
Company&rsquo;s stud. The Rose gardens surround the town: they are
fields, with low bushes of the plant grown in rows, red with
blossoms in the morning, all of which are, however, plucked long
before midday. The petals are put into clay stills, with twice
their weight of water, and the produce exposed to the fresh air,
for a night, in open vessels. The unskimmed water affords the best,
and it is often twice and even oftener distilled; but the fluid
deteriorates by too much distillation. The Attar is skimmed from
the exposed pans, and sells at 10 pounds the rupee weight, to make
which 20,000 flowers are required. It is frequently adulterated
with sandal-wood oil.</p>

<p>Lord Cornwallis&rsquo; mausoleum is a handsome building,
modelled by Flaxman after the Sybil&rsquo;s Temple. The allegorical
designs of Hindoos and sorrowing soldiers with reversed arms, which
decorate two sides of the enclosed tomb, though perhaps as good as
can be, are under any treatment unclassical and uncouth. The simple
laurel and oak-leaf chaplets on the alternating faces are far more
suitable and suggestive. <i>March 21.</i>&mdash;I left Ghazepore
and dropped down the Ganges; the general features of which are soon
described. A strong current four or five miles broad, of muddy
water, flows between a precipitous bank of alluvium or sand on one
side, and a flat shelving one of sand or more rarely mud, on the
other. Sand-banks are frequent in the river,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 79">[ 79 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">especially where the great affluents debouche; and
there generally are formed vast expanses of sand, small
&ldquo;Saharas,&rdquo; studded with stalking pillars of sand,
raised seventy or eighty feet high by gusts of wind, erect,
stately, grave-looking columns, all shaft, with neither basement
nor capital, the genii of the &ldquo;Arabian Nights.&rdquo; The
river is always dotted with boats of all shapes, mine being perhaps
of the most common description; the great square, Yankee-like
steamers, towing their accommodation-boats (as the
passengers&rsquo; floating hotels are called), are the rarest.
Trees are few on the banks, except near villages, and there is
hardly a palm to be seen above Patna. Towns are unfrequent, such as
there are being mere collections of huts, with the ghat and boats
at the bottom of the bank; and at a respectful distance from the
bazaar, stand the neat bungalows of the European residents, with
their smiling gardens, hedgings and fencings, and loitering
servants at the door. A rotting charpoy (or bedstead) on the banks
is a common sight, the &ldquo;<i>sola reliquia</i>&rdquo; of some
poor Hindoo, who departs this life by the side of the stream, to
which his body is afterwards committed.</p>

<p>Shoals of small goggled-eyed fish are seen, that spring clear
out of the water; and are preyed upon by terns and other birds; a
few insects skim the surface; turtle and porpoises tumble along,
all forming a very busy contrast to the lazy alligator, sunning his
green and scaly back near the shore, with his ichthyosaurian snout
raised high above the water. Birds are numerous, especially early
and late in the day. Along the silent shore the hungry Pariah dog
may be seen tearing his meal from some stranded corpse, whilst the
adjutant-bird, with his head sunk on his body and one leg tucked
up, patiently awaits his turn. At night the beautiful Brahminee
geese alight, one by one, and</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 80">[ 80 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">seek total solitude; ever since having disturbed a
god in his slumbers, these birds are fated to pass the night in
single blessedness. The gulls and terns, again, roost in flocks, as
do the wild geese and pelicans,&mdash;the latter, however, not till
after making a hearty and very noisy supper. These birds congregate
by the sides of pools, and beat the water with violence, so as to
scare the fish, which thus become an easy prey; a fact which was, I
believe, first indicated by Pallas, during his residence on the
banks of the Caspian Sea. Shells are scarce, and consist of a few
small bivalves; their comparative absence is probably due to the
paucity of limestone in the mountains whence the many feeders flow.
The sand is pure white and small-grained, with fragments of
hornblende and mica, the latter varying in abundance as a feeder is
near or far away. Pink sand* of garnets is very common, and
deposited in layers interstratified with the white quartz sand.
Worm-marks, ripple-marks, and the footsteps of alligators, birds
and beasts, abound in the wet sand. The vegetation of the banks
consists of annuals which find no permanent resting-place. Along
the sandy shores the ever-present plants are mostly English, as
Dock, a <i>Nasturtium, Ranunculus sceleratus, Fumitory, Juncus
bufonius,</i>, Common Vervain, <i>Gnaphalium luteo-album,</i> and
very frequently <i>Veronica Anagallise.</i> On the alluvium grow
the same, mixed with Tamarisk, <i>Acacia Arabica,</i> and a few
other bushes.</p>

<p>Withered grass abounds; and wheat, dhal (<i>Cajanus</i>) and
gram (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>), <i>Carthamus,</i> vetches, and rice
are the staple products of the country. Bushes are few, except the
universally prevalent Adhatoda and <i>Calotropis.</i></p>

<p class="fnote">* I have seen the same garnet sand covering the
bottom of the Himalayan torrents, where it is the produce of
disintegrated gneiss, and whence it is transported to the
Ganges.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 81">[ 81 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Trees, also, are rare, and of stunted growth;
Figs, the <i>Artocarpus</i> and some <i>Leguminosa</i> prevail
most. I saw but two kinds of palm, the fan-palm, and <i>
Ph&oelig;nix</i>: the latter is characteristic of the driest
locality. Then, for the animal creation, men, women, and children
abound, both on the banks, and plying up and down the Ganges. The
humped cow (of which the ox is used for draught) is common. Camels
I occasionally observed, and more rarely the elephant; poneys,
goats, and dogs muster strong. Porpoises and alligators infest the
river, even above Benares. Flies and mosquitos are terrible pests;
and so are the odious flying-bugs,* which insinuate themselves
between one&rsquo;s skin and clothes, diffusing a dreadful odour,
which is increased by any attempt to touch or remove them. In the
evening it was impossible to keep insects out of the boat, or to
hinder their putting the lights out; and of these the most
intolerable was the abovementioned flying-bug. Saucy crickets, too,
swarm, and spring up at one&rsquo;s face, whilst mosquitos maintain
a constant guerilla warfare, trying to the patience no less than to
the nerves. Thick webs of the gossamer spider float across the
river during the heat of the day, as coarse as fine thread, and
being inhaled keep tickling the nose and lips.</p>

<p>On the 18th, the morning commenced with a dust-storm, the
horizon was about 20 yards off, and ashy white with clouds of sand;
the trees were scarcely visible, and everything in my boat was
covered with a fine coat of impalpable powder, collected from the
boundless alluvial plains through which the Ganges flows. Trees
were scarcely discernible, and so dry was the wind that drops of
water vanished like magic. Neither ferns, mosses, nor lichens grow
along the banks of the Ganges, they cannot survive the</p>

months&rsquo; floods at midsummer, when the country is for miles
under water.</p>

<p><i>March 23.</i>&mdash;Passed the mouth of the Soane, a vast
expanse of sand dotted with droves of camels; and soon after, the
wide-spread spits of sand along the north bank announced the mouth
of the Gogra, one of the vastest of the many Himalayan affluents of
the Ganges.</p>

<p>On the 25th of March I reached Dinapore, a large military
station, sufficiently insalubrious, particularly for European
troops, the barracks being so misplaced that the inmates are
suffocated: the buildings run east and west instead of north and
south, and therefore lose all the breeze in the hottest weather.
From this place I sent the boat down to Patna, and proceeded
thither by land to the house of Dr. Irvine, an old acquaintance and
botanist, from whom I received a most kind welcome. On the road,
Bengal forms of vegetation, to which I had been for three months a
stranger, reappeared; likewise groves of fan and toddy palms, which
are both very rare higher up the river; clumps of large bamboo,
orange, <i>Acacia Sissoo, Melia, Guatteria lonjpgolia, Spondias
manjpgera, Odina, Euphorbia pentagona, neriifolia</i> and <i>
trigona,</i> were common road-side plants. In the gardens, Papaw,
<i>Croton, Jatropha, Buddleia, Cookia,</i> Loquat, Litchi, Longan,
all kinds of the orange tribe, and the cocoa-nut, some from their
presence, and many from their profusion, indicated a decided change
of climate, a receding from the desert north-west of India, and its
dry winds, and an approach to the damper regions of the
many-mouthed Ganges.</p>

<p>My main object at Patna being to see the opium Godowns (stores),
I waited on Dr. Corbett, the Assistant-Agent, who kindly explained
everything to me, and to whose obliging attentions I am much
indebted.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 83">[ 83 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The E.I. Company grant licences for the
cultivation of the poppy, and contract for all the produce at
certain rates, varying with the quality. No opium can be grown
without this licence, and an advance equal to about two-thirds of
the value of the produce is made to the grower. This produce is
made over to district collectors, who approximately fix the worth
of the contents of each jar, and forward it to Patna, where rewards
are given for the best samples, and the worst are condemned without
payment; but all is turned to some account in the reduction of the
drug to a state fit for market.</p>

<p>The poppy flowers in the end of January and beginning of
February, and the capsules are sliced in February and March with a
little instrument like a saw, made of three iron plates with jagged
edges, tied together. The cultivation is very carefully conducted,
nor are there any very apparent means of improving this branch of
commerce and revenue. During the N.W., or dry winds, the best opium
is procured, the worst during the moist, or E. and N.E., when the
drug imbibes moisture, and a watery bad solution of opium collects
in cavities of its substance, and is called Passewa, according to
the absence of which the opium is generally prized.</p>

<p>At the end of March the opium jars arrive at the stores by water
and by land, and continue accumulating for some weeks. Every jar is
labelled and stowed in a proper place, separately tested with
extreme accuracy, and valued. When the whole quantity has been
received, the contents of all the jars are thrown into great vats,
occupying a very large building, whence the mass is distributed, to
be made up into balls for the markets. This operation is carried on
in a long paved room, where every man is ticketed, and many
overseers are stationed to see that the work is properly</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 84">[ 84 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">conducted. Each workman sits on a stool, with a
double stage and a tray before him. On the top stage is a tin
basin, containing opium sufficient for three balls; in the lower
another basin, holding water: in the tray stands a brass
hemispherical cup, in which the ball is worked. To the man&rsquo;s
right hand is another tray, with two compartments, one containing
thin pancakes of poppy petals pressed together, the other a cupful
of sticky opium-water, made from refuse opium. The man takes the
brass cup, and places a pancake at the bottom, smears it with
opium-water, and with many plies of the pancakes makes a coat for
the opium. Of this he takes about one-third of the mass before him,
puts it inside the petals, and agglutinates many other coats over
it: the balls are then again weighed, and reduced or increased to a
certain weight if necessary. At the day&rsquo;s end, each man takes
his work to a rack with numbered compartments, and deposits it in
that which answers to his own number, thence the balls (each being
put in a clay cup) are carried to an enormous drying-room, where
they are exposed in tiers, and constantly examined and turned, to
prevent their being attacked by weevils, which are very prevalent
during moist winds, little boys creeping along the racks all day
long for this purpose. When dry, the balls are packed in two layers
of six each in chests, with the stalks, dried leaves, and capsules
of the plant, and sent down to Calcutta. A little opium is prepared
of very fine quality for the Government Hospitals, and some for
general sale in India; but the proportion is trifling, and such is
made up into square cakes. A good workman will prepare from thirty
to fifty balls a day, the total produce being 10,000 to 12,000 a
day; during one working season 1,353,000 balls are manufactured for
the Chinese market alone.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 85">[ 85 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The poppy-petal <i>pancakes,</i> each about a foot
radius, are made in the fields by women, by the simple operation of
pressing the fresh petals together. They are brought in large
baskets, and purchased at the commencement of the season. The
liquor with which the pancakes are agglutinated together by the
ball-maker, and worked into the ball, is merely inspissated
opium-water, the opium for which is derived from the condemned
opium, (Passewa,) the washing of the utensils, and of the workmen,
every one of whom is nightly laved before he leaves the
establishment, and the water is inspissated. Thus not a particle of
opium is lost. To encourage the farmers, the refuse stalks, leaves,
and heads are bought up, to pack the balls with; but this is far
from an economical plan, for it is difficult to keep the refuse
from damp and insects.</p>

<p>A powerful smell of opium pervaded these vast buildings, which
Dr. Corbett* assured me did not affect himself or the assistants.
The men work ten hours a day, becoming sleepy in the afternoon; but
this is only natural in the hot season: they are rather liable to
eruptive diseases, possibly engendered by the nature of their
occupation.</p>

<p>Even the best East Indian opium is inferior to the Turkish, and
owing to peculiarities of climate, will probably always be so. It
never yields more than five per cent. of morphia, whence its
inferiority, but is as good in other respects, and even richer in
narcotine.</p>

<p>The care and attention devoted to every department of
collecting, testing, manipulating, and packing, is quite
extraordinary; and the result has been an impulse to the trade,
beyond what was anticipated. The natives have</p>

<p class="fnote">* I am greatly indebted to Mr. Oldfield, the Opium
Agent, and to Dr. Corbett, for a complete set of specimens,

<p class="first">been quick at apprehending and supplying the wants
of the market, and now there are more demands for licences to grow
opium than can be granted. All the opium eaten in India is given
out with a permit to licensed dealers, and the drug is so
adulterated before it reaches the retailers in the bazaars, that it
does not contain one-thirtieth part of the intoxicating power that
it did when pure.</p>

<p>Patna is the stronghold of Mahommedanism, and from its central
position, its command of the Ganges, and its proximity to Nepal
(which latter has been aptly compared to a drawn dagger, pointed at
the heart of India), it is an important place. For this reason
there are always a European and several Native Regiments stationed
there. In the neighbourbood there is little to be seen, and the
highly cultivated flat country is unfavourable to native
vegetation.</p>

<p>The <i>mudar</i> plant (<i>Calotropis</i>) was abundant here,
but I found that its properties and nomenclature were far from
settled points. On the banks of the Ganges, the larger,
white-flowered, sub-arboreous species prevailed; in the interior,
and along my whole previous route, the smaller purple-flowered kind
only was seen. Mr. Davis, of Rotas, was in the habit of using the
medicine copiously, and vouched for the cure of eighty cases,
chiefly of leprosy, by the <i>white mudar,</i> gathered on the
Ganges, whilst the purple of Rotas and the neighbourhood was quite
inert: Dr. Irvine, again, used the purple only, and found the white
inert. The European and native doctors, who knew the two plants,
all gave the preference to the <i>white</i>; except Dr. Irvine,
whose experience over various parts of India is entitled to great
weight.</p>

<p><i>March 29.</i>&mdash;Dropped down the river, experiencing a
succession of east and north-east winds during the whole</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 87">[ 87 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">remainder of the voyage. These winds are very
prevalent throughout the month of March, and they rendered the
passage in my sluggish boat sufficiently tedious. In other respects
I had but little bad weather to complain of: only one shower of
rain occurred, and but few storms of thunder and lightning. The
stream is very strong, and its action on the sand-banks
conspicuous. All night I used to hear the falling cliffs
precipitated with a dull heavy splash into the water,&mdash;a
pretty spectacle in the day-time, when the whirling current is seen
to carry a cloud of white dust, like smoke, along its course.</p>

<p>The Curruckpore hills, the northern boundary of the gneiss and
granite range of Paras-nath, are seen first in the distance, and
then throwing out low loosely timbered spurs towards the river; but
no rock or hill comes close to the banks till near Monghyr, where
two islets of rock rise out of the bed of the river. They are of
stratified quartz, dipping, at a high angle, to the south-east;
and, as far as I could observe, quite barren, each crowned with a
little temple. The swarm of boats from below Patna to this place
was quite incredible.</p>

<p><i>April 1.</i>&mdash;Arrived at Monghyr, by far the prettiest
town I had seen on the river, backed by a long range of wooded
hills,&mdash;detached outliers of which rise in the very town. The
banks are steep, and they appear more so owing to the
fortifications, which are extensive. A number of large, white,
two-storied houses, some very imposing, and perched on rounded or
conical hills, give a European aspect to the place.</p>

<p>Monghyr is celebrated for its iron manufactures, especially of
muskets, in which respect it is the Birmingham of Bengal. Generally
speaking, these weapons are poor, though stamped with the first
English names. A native workman will, however, if time and

inhabitants are reported to be sad drunkards, and the abundance of
toddy-palms was quite remarkable. The latter, (here the <i>
Ph&oelig;nix sylvestris,</i>) I never saw wild, but it is
considered to be so in N.W. India; it is still a doubtful point
whether it is the same as the African species. In the morning of
the following day I went to the hot springs of Seeta-koond (wells
of Seeta), a few miles south of the town.</p>

<p class="first">bases. The river has its course through the
alluvium, like the Soane. The depth of the former is in many places
upwards of 100 feet, and the kunker pebbles it contains are often
disposed in parallel undulating bands. It nowhere contains sand
pebbles or fossils; concretions of lime (kunker) alone interrupting
its uniform consistence. It attains its greatest thickness in the
valleys of the Ganges and the Soane, gradually sloping up to the
Himalaya and Curruckpore hills on either flank. It is, however,
well developed on the Kymore and Paras-nath hills, 1,200 to 1 500
feet above the Ganges valley, and I have no doubt was deposited in
very deep water, when the relative positions of these mountains to
the Ganges and Soane valleys were the same that they are now. Like
every other part of the surface of India, it has suffered much from
denudation, especially on the above-named mountains, and around
their bases, where various rocks protrude through it. Along the
Ganges again, its surface is an unbroken level between Chunar and
the rocks of Monghyr. The origin of its component mineral matter
must be sought in the denudation of the Himalayas within a very
recent geological period. The contrast between the fertility of the
alluvium and the sterility of the protruded quartzy rocks is very
striking, cultivation running up to these fields of stones, and
suddenly stopping.</p>

<p>Unlike the Soorujkoond hot-springs, those of Seetakoond rise in
a plain, and were once covered by a handsome temple. All the water
is collected in a tank, some yards square, with steps leading down
to it. The water, which is clear and tasteless (temp. 104&deg;), is
so pure as to be exported copiously, and the Monghyr manufactory of
soda-water presents the anomaly of owing its purity to
Seeta&rsquo;s ablutions.</p>

<p class="first">On my passage down the river I passed the
picturesque rocks of Sultangunj; they are similar to those of
Monghyr, but very much larger and loftier. One, a round-headed
mass, stands on the bank, capped with a triple-domed Mahommedan
tomb, palms, and figs. The other, which is far more striking, rises
isolated in the bed of the river, and is crowned with a Hindoo
temple, its pyramidal cone surmounted with a curious pile of
weathercocks, and two little banners. The current of the Ganges is
here very strong, and runs in deep black eddies between the
rocks.</p>

<p>Though now perhaps eighty or a hundred yards from the shore, the
islet must have been recently a peninsula, for it retains a portion
of the once connecting bank of alluvium, in the form of a short
flat-topped cliff, about thirty feet above the water. Some curious
looking sculptures on the rocks are said to represent Naragur (or
Vishnu), Suree and Sirooj; but to me they were quite
unintelligible. The temple is dedicated to Naragur, and inhabited
by Fakirs; it is the most holy on the Ganges.</p>

<p><i>April 5.</i>&mdash;I arrived at Bhagulpore, and took up my
quarters with my friend Dr. Grant, till he should arrange my dawk
for Sikkim.</p>

<p>The town has been supposed to be the much-sought Palibothra, and
a dirty stream hard by (the Chundum), the Eranoboas; but Mr.
Ravenshaw has now brought all existing proofs to bear on Patna and
the Soane. It is, like most hilly places in India, S. of the
Himalaya, the seat of much Jain worship; and the temples on Mount
Manden,* a few miles off, are said to have been 540 in number. At
the assumed summer-palaces of the kings of Palibothra the ground is
covered with agates, brought from the</p>

<p class="fnote">* For the following information about Bhagulpore
and its neighbourhood, I am indebted chiefly to Col.
Francklin&rsquo;s essay in the Asiatic Researches; and the late
Major Napleton and Mr. Pontet.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 91">[ 91 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">neighbouring hills, which were, in a rough state,
let into the walls of the buildings. These agates perfectly
resemble the Soane pebbles, and they assist in the identification
of these flanking hills with those of the latter river.</p>

<p>Again, near the hills, the features of interest are very
numerous. The neighbouring mountains of Curruckpore, which are a
portion of the Rajmahal and Paras-nath range, are peopled by tribes
representing the earliest races of India, prior to the invasion of
young Rama, prince of Oude, who, according to the legend, spread
Brahminism with his conquests, and won the hand of King
Jannuk&rsquo;s daughter, Seeta, by bending her father&rsquo;s bow.
These people are called Coles, a middle-sized, strong, very dark,
and black-haired race, with thick lips: they have no vocation but
collecting iron from the soil, which occurs abundantly in nodules.
They eat flesh, whether that of animals killed by themselves, or of
those which have died a natural death, and mix with Hindoos, but
not with Mussulmen. There are other tribes, vestiges of the
Tamulian race, differing somewhat in their rites from these, and
approaching, in their habits, more to Hindoos; but all are timorous
and retiring.</p>

<p>The hill-rangers, or Bhagulpore-rangers, are all natives of the
Rajmahal hills, and form a local corps maintained by the Company
for the protection of the district. For many years these people
were engaged in predatory excursions, which, owing to the nature of
the country, were checked with great difficulty. The plan was
therefore conceived, by an active magistrate in the district, of
embodying a portion into a military force, for the protection of
the country from invasions of their own tribes; and this scheme has
answered perfectly.</p>

<p>To me the most interesting object in Bhagulpore was the
Horticultural Gardens, whose origin and flourishing</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 92">[ 92 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">condition are due to the activity and enterprise
of the late Major Napleton, commander of the hill-rangers. The site
is good, consisting of fifteen acres, that were, four years ago, an
indigo field, but form now a smiling garden. About fifty men are
employed; and the number of seeds and vegetables annually
distributed is very great. Of trees the most conspicuous are the
tamarind, <i>Tecoma jasminoides, Erythrina, Adansonia, Bombax,</i>
teak, banyan, peepul, <i>Sissoo, Casuarina, Terminalia, Melia,
Bauhinia.</i> Of introduced species English and Chinese flat
peaches (pruned to the centre to let the sun in), Mangos of various
sorts, <i>Eugenia Jambos,</i> various Anonas, Litchi, Loquat and
Longan, oranges, <i>Sapodilla</i>; apple, pear, both succeeding
tolerably; various Cabool and Persian varieties of fruit-trees;
figs, grapes, guava, apricots, and jujube. The grapes looked
extremely well, but they require great skill and care in the
management. They form a long covered walk, with a row of plantains
on the W. side, to diminish the effects of the hot winds, but even
with this screen, the fruit on that side are inferior to that on
the opposite trellis. Easterly winds, again, being moist, blight
these and other plants, by favouring the abundant increase of
insects, and causing the leaves to curl and fall off; and against
this evil there is no remedy. With a clear sky the mischief is not
great; under a cloudy one the prevalence of such winds is fatal to
the crop. The white ant sometimes attacks the stems, and is best
checked by washing the roots with limewater, yellow arsenic, or
tobacco-water. Numerous Cerealia, and the varieties of cotton,
sugar-cane, etc. all thrive extremely well; so do many of our
English vegetables. Cabbages, peas, and beans are much injured by
the caterpillars of a <i>Pontia,</i> like our English
&ldquo;White;&rdquo; raspberries, currants, and gooseberries will
not grow at all.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 93">[ 93 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The seeds were all deposited in bottles, and hung
round the walls of a large airy apartment; and for cleanliness and
excellence of kind they would bear comparison with the best
seedsman&rsquo;s collection in London. Of English garden
vegetables, and varieties of the Indian Cerealia, and leguminous
plants, Indian corn, millets, rice, etc., the collections for
distribution were extensive.</p>

<p>The manufacture of economic products is not neglected. Excellent
coffee is grown; and arrow-root, equal to the best West Indian, is
prepared, at 18<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per bottle of twenty-four
ounces, about a fourth of the price of that article in
Calcutta.</p>

<p>In most respects the establishment is a model of what such
institutions ought to be in India; not only of real practical
value, in affording a good and cheap supply of the best culinary
and other vegetables that the climate can produce, but as showing
to what departments efforts are best directed. Such gardens diffuse
a taste for the most healthy employments, and offer an elegant
resource for the many unoccupied hours which the Englishman in
India finds upon his hands. They are also schools of gardening; and
a simple inspection of what has been done at Bhagulpore is a
valuable lesson to any person about to establish a private garden
of his own.</p>

<p>I often heard complaints made of the seeds distributed from
these gardens not vegetating freely in other parts of India, and it
is not to be expected that they should retain their vitality
unimpaired through an Indian rainy season; but on the other hand I
almost invariably found that the planting and tending had been left
to the uncontrolled management of native gardeners, who with a
certain amount of skill in handicraft are, from habits and
prejudices, singularly unfit for the superintendence of a
garden.</p>
