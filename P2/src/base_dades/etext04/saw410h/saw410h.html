<p>TOM'S mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He
was a forsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when
they found out what they had driven him to, perhaps they would be
sorry; he had tried to do right and get along, but they would not
let him; since nothing would do them but to be rid of him, let it
be so; and let them blame HIM for the consequences&mdash;why
shouldn't they? What right had the friendless to complain? Yes,
they had forced him to it at last: he would lead a life of crime.
There was no choice.</p>

<p>By this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for
school to "take up" tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now,
to think he should never, never hear that old familiar sound any
more&mdash;it was very hard, but it was forced on him; since he
was driven out into the cold world, he must submit&mdash;but he
forgave them. Then the sobs came thick and fast.</p>

<p>Just at this point he met his soul's sworn comrade, Joe
Harper&mdash;hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal
purpose in his heart. Plainly here were "two souls with but a
single thought." Tom, wiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to
blubber out something about a resolution to escape from hard
usage and lack of sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the
great world never to return; and ended by hoping that Joe would
not forget him.</p>

<p>But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just
been going to make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that
purpose. His mother had whipped him for drinking some cream which
he had never tasted and knew nothing about; it was plain that she
was tired of him and wished him to go; if she felt that way,
there was nothing for him to do but succumb; he hoped she would
be happy, and never regret having driven her poor boy out into
the unfeeling world to suffer and die.</p>

<p>As the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new
compact to stand by each other and be brothers and never separate
till death relieved them of their troubles. Then they began to
lay their plans. Joe was for being a hermit, and living on crusts
in a remote cave, and dying, some time, of cold and want and
grief; but after listening to Tom, he conceded that there were
some conspicuous advantages about a life of crime, and so he
consented to be a pirate.</p>

<p>Three miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the
Mississippi River was a trifle over a mile wide, there was a
long, narrow, wooded island, with a shallow bar at the head of
it, and this offered well as a rendezvous. It was not
inhabited; it lay far over toward the further shore, abreast a
dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson's Island was
chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a
matter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up
Huckleberry Finn, and he joined them promptly, for all careers
were one to him; he was indifferent. They presently separated to
meet at a lonely spot on the river-bank two miles above the
village at the favorite hour&mdash;which was midnight. There was
a small log raft there which they meant to capture. Each would
bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal in
the most dark and mysterious way&mdash;as became outlaws. And
before the afternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the
sweet glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would
"hear something." All who got this vague hint were cautioned to
"be mum and wait."</p>

<p>About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few
trifles, and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff
overlooking the meeting-place. It was starlight, and very still.
The mighty river lay like an ocean at rest. Tom listened a
moment, but no sound disturbed the quiet. Then he gave a low,
distinct whistle. It was answered from under the bluff. Tom
whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the same way.
Then a guarded voice said:</p>

<p>"Who goes there?"</p>

<p>"Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your
names."</p>

<p>"Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the
Seas." Tom had furnished these titles, from his favorite
literature.</p>

<p>"'Tis well. Give the countersign."</p>

<p>Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word
simultaneously to the brooding night:</p>

<p>"BLOOD!"</p>

<p>Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down
after it, tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the
effort. There was an easy, comfortable path along the shore
under the bluff, but it lacked the advantages of difficulty and
danger so valued by a pirate.</p>

<p>The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had
about worn himself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed
had stolen a skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco,
and had also brought a few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none
of the pirates smoked or "chewed" but himself. The Black Avenger
of the Spanish Main said it would never do to start without some
fire. That was a wise thought; matches were hardly known there in
that day. They saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred
yards above, and they went stealthily thither and helped
themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing adventure of it,
saying, "Hist!" every now and then, and suddenly halting with
finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts; and
giving orders in dismal whispers that if "the foe" stirred, to
"let him have it to the hilt," because "dead men tell no tales."
They knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the
village laying in stores or having a spree, but still that was no
excuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.</p>

<p>They shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after
oar and Joe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed,
and with folded arms, and gave his orders in a low, stern
whisper:</p>

<p>"Luff, and bring her to the wind!"</p>

<p>"Aye-aye, sir!"</p>

<p>"Steady, steady-y-y-y!"</p>

<p>"Steady it is, sir!"</p>

<p>"Let her go off a point!"</p>

<p>"Point it is, sir!"</p>

<p>As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward
mid-stream it was no doubt understood that these orders were
given only for "style," and were not intended to mean anything in
particular.</p>

<p>"What sail's she carrying?"</p>

<p>"Courses, tops'ls, and flying-jib, sir."</p>

<p>"Send the r'yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of
ye&mdash; foretopmaststuns'l! Lively, now!"</p>

<p>"Aye-aye, sir!"</p>

<p>"Shake out that maintogalans'l! Sheets and braces! NOW my
hearties!"</p>

<p>"Aye-aye, sir!"</p>

<p>"Hellum-a-lee&mdash;hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she
comes! Port, port! NOW, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!"</p>

<p>"Steady it is, sir!"</p>

<p>The raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed
her head right, and then lay on their oars. The river was not
high, so there was not more than a two or three mile current.
Hardly a word was said during the next three-quarters of an hour.
Now the raft was passing before the distant town. Two or three
glimmering lights showed where it lay, peacefully sleeping,
beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water, unconscious of
the tremendous event that was happening. The Black Avenger stood
still with folded arms, "looking his last" upon the scene of his
former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing "she" could see
him now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with
dauntless heart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips.
It was but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson's
Island beyond eye-shot of the village, and so he "looked his
last" with a broken and satisfied heart. The other pirates were
looking their last, too; and they all looked so long that they
came near letting the current drift them out of the range of the
island. But they discovered the danger in time, and made shift to
avert it. About two o'clock in the morning the raft grounded on
the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island, and they
waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part of
the little raft's belongings consisted of an old sail, and this
they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their
provisions; but they themselves would sleep in the open air in
good weather, as became outlaws.</p>

<p>They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or
thirty steps within the sombre depths of the forest, and then
cooked some bacon in the frying-pan for supper, and used up half
of the corn "pone" stock they had brought. It seemed glorious
sport to be feasting in that wild, free way in the virgin forest
of an unexplored and uninhabited island, far from the haunts of
men, and they said they never would return to civilization. The
climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy glare upon
the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the
varnished foliage and festooning vines.</p>

<p>When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last
allowance of corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves
out on the grass, filled with contentment. They could have found
a cooler place, but they would not deny themselves such a
romantic feature as the roasting campfire.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>"AIN'T it gay?" said Joe.</p>

<p>"It's NUTS!" said Tom. "What would the boys say if they could
see us?"</p>

<p>"Say? Well, they'd just die to be here&mdash;hey, Hucky!"</p>

<p>"I reckon so," said Huckleberry; "anyways, I'm suited. I don't
want nothing better'n this. I don't ever get enough to eat,
gen'ally&mdash;and here they can't come and pick at a feller and
bullyrag him so."</p>

<p>"It's just the life for me," said Tom. "You don't have to get
up, mornings, and you don't have to go to school, and wash, and
all that blame foolishness. You see a pirate don't have to do
ANYTHING, Joe, when he's ashore, but a hermit HE has to be
praying considerable, and then he don't have any fun, anyway, all
by himself that way."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, that's so," said Joe, "but I hadn't thought much
about it, you know. I'd a good deal rather be a pirate, now that
I've tried it."</p>

<p>"You see," said Tom, "people don't go much on hermits,
nowadays, like they used to in old times, but a pirate's always
respected. And a hermit's got to sleep on the hardest place he
can find, and put sackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out
in the rain, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?"
inquired Huck.</p>

<p>"I dono. But they've GOT to do it. Hermits always do. You'd
have to do that if you was a hermit."</p>

<p>"Dern'd if I would," said Huck.</p>

<p>"Well, what would you do?"</p>

<p>"I dono. But I wouldn't do that."</p>

<p>"Why, Huck, you'd HAVE to. How'd you get around it?"</p>

<p>"Why, I just wouldn't stand it. I'd run away."</p>

<p>"Run away! Well, you WOULD be a nice old slouch of a hermit.
You'd be a disgrace."</p>

<p>The Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had
finished gouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it,
loaded it with tobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and
blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke&mdash;he was in the full bloom
of luxurious contentment. The other pirates envied him this
majestic vice, and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly.
Presently Huck said:</p>

<p>"What does pirates have to do?"</p>

<p>Tom said:</p>

<p>"Oh, they have just a bully time&mdash;take ships and burn
them, and get the money and bury it in awful places in their
island where there's ghosts and things to watch it, and kill
everybody in the ships&mdash;make 'em walk a plank."</p>

<p>"And they carry the women to the island," said Joe; "they
don't kill the women."</p>

<p>"No," assented Tom, "they don't kill the women&mdash;they're
too noble. And the women's always beautiful, too.</p>

<p>"And don't they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and
silver and di'monds," said Joe, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Who?" said Huck.</p>

<p>"Why, the pirates."</p>

<p>Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.</p>

<p>"I reckon I ain't dressed fitten for a pirate," said he, with
a regretful pathos in his voice; "but I ain't got none but
these."</p>

<p>But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast
enough, after they should have begun their adventures. They made
him understand that his poor rags would do to begin with, though
it was customary for wealthy pirates to start with a proper
wardrobe.</p>

<p>Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal
upon the eyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the
fingers of the Red-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the
conscience-free and the weary. The Terror of the Seas and the
Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had more difficulty in getting
to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly, and lying down, since
there was nobody there with authority to make them kneel and
recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at all,
but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest
they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from
heaven. Then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent
verge of sleep&mdash;but an intruder came, now, that would not
"down." It was conscience. They began to feel a vague fear that
they had been doing wrong to run away; and next they thought of
the stolen meat, and then the real torture came. They tried to
argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined
sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not to
be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in
the end, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that
taking sweetmeats was only "hooking," while taking bacon and hams
and such valuables was plain simple stealing&mdash;and there was
a command against that in the Bible. So they inwardly resolved
that so long as they remained in the business, their piracies
should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing. Then
conscience granted a truce, and these curiously inconsistent
pirates fell peacefully to sleep.</p>

<p>WHEN Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He
sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he
comprehended. It was the cool gray dawn, and there was a
delicious sense of repose and peace in the deep pervading calm
and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not a sound
obtruded upon great Nature's meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood
upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the
fire, and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air.
Joe and Huck still slept.</p>

<p>Now, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered;
presently the hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the
cool dim gray of the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds
multiplied and life manifested itself. The marvel of Nature
shaking off sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing
boy. A little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf, lifting
two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and
"sniffing around," then proceeding again&mdash;for he was
measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own
accord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and
falling, by turns, as the creature still came toward him or
seemed inclined to go elsewhere; and when at last it considered a
painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came
decisively down upon Tom's leg and began a journey over him, his
whole heart was glad&mdash;for that meant that he was going to
have a new suit of clothes&mdash;without the shadow of a doubt a
gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared, from
nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one
struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as
itself in its arms, and lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A
brown spotted lady-bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade,
and Tom bent down close to it and said, "Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly
away home, your house is on fire, your children's alone," and she
took wing and went off to see about it&mdash; which did not
surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was
credulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its
simplicity more than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving
sturdily at its ball, and Tom touched the creature, to see it
shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead. The birds
were fairly rioting by this time. A catbird, the Northern mocker,
lit in a tree over Tom's head, and trilled out her imitations of
her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then a shrill jay swept
down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig almost within
the boy's reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the
strangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big
fellow of the "fox" kind came skurrying along, sitting up at
intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things
had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew
whether to be afraid or not. All Nature was wide awake and
stirring, now; long lances of sunlight pierced down through the
dense foliage far and near, and a few butterflies came fluttering
upon the scene.</p>

<p>Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away
with a shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing
after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of
the white sandbar. They felt no longing for the little village
sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water. A
vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off
their raft, but this only gratified them, since its going was
something like burning the bridge between them and
civilization.</p>

<br><br><br><br> 

<p>They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted,
and ravenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again.
Huck found a spring of clear cold water close by, and the boys
made cups of broad oak or hickory leaves, and felt that water,
sweetened with such a wildwood charm as that, would be a good
enough substitute for coffee. While Joe was slicing bacon for
breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a minute; they
stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in their
lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time
to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome
bass, a couple of sun-perch and a small catfish&mdash;provisions
enough for quite a family. They fried the fish with the bacon,
and were astonished; for no fish had ever seemed so delicious
before. They did not know that the quicker a fresh-water fish is
on the fire after he is caught the better he is; and they
reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping, open-air
exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make,
too.</p>

<p>They lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had
a smoke, and then went off through the woods on an exploring
expedition. They tramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through
tangled underbrush, among solemn monarchs of the forest, hung
from their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of
grape-vines. Now and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with
grass and jeweled with flowers.</p>

<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>They found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing
to be astonished at. They discovered that the island was about
three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore
it lay closest to was only separated from it by a narrow channel
hardly two hundred yards wide. They took a swim about every
hour, so it was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they
got back to camp. They were too hungry to stop to fish, but they
fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw themselves down
in the shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag, and then
died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods, and
the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the
boys. They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept
upon them. This took dim shape, presently&mdash;it was budding
homesickness. Even Finn the Red-Handed was dreaming of his
doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they were all ashamed of their
weakness, and none was brave enough to speak his thought.</p>

<p>For some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a
peculiar sound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the
ticking of a clock which he takes no distinct note of. But now
this mysterious sound became more pronounced, and forced a
recognition. The boys started, glanced at each other, and then
each assumed a listening attitude. There was a long silence,
profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came floating
down out of the distance.</p>

<p>"What is it!" exclaimed Joe, under his breath.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Tom in a whisper.</p>

<p>"'Tain't thunder," said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, "becuz
thunder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hark!" said Tom. "Listen&mdash;don't talk."</p>

<p>They waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same
muffled boom troubled the solemn hush.</p>

<p>"Let's go and see."</p>

<p>They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the
town. They parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the
water. The little steam ferry-boat was about a mile below the
village, drifting with the current. Her broad deck seemed crowded
with people. There were a great many skiffs rowing about or
floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat,
but the boys could not determine what the men in them were doing.
Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboat's
side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same dull
throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.</p>

<br><br><br><br> 

<p>"I know now!" exclaimed Tom; "somebody's drownded!"</p>

<p>"That's it!" said Huck; "they done that last summer, when Bill
Turner got drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that
makes him come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread
and put quicksilver in 'em and set 'em afloat, and wherever
there's anybody that's drownded, they'll float right there and
stop."</p>

<p>"Yes, I've heard about that," said Joe. "I wonder what makes
the bread do that."</p>

<p>"Oh, it ain't the bread, so much," said Tom; "I reckon it's
mostly what they SAY over it before they start it out."</p>

<p>"But they don't say anything over it," said Huck. "I've seen
'em and they don't."</p>

<p>"Well, that's funny," said Tom. "But maybe they say it to
themselves. Of COURSE they do. Anybody might know that."</p>

<p>The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said,
because an ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an
incantation, could not be expected to act very intelligently when
set upon an errand of such gravity.</p>

<p>"By jings, I wish I was over there, now," said Joe.</p>

<p>"I do too" said Huck "I'd give heaps to know who it is."</p>

<p>The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing
thought flashed through Tom's mind, and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Boys, I know who's drownded&mdash;it's us!"</p>

<p>They felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous
triumph; they were missed; they were mourned; hearts were
breaking on their account; tears were being shed; accusing
memories of unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising up,
and unavailing regrets and remorse were being indulged; and best
of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town, and the
envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was
concerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate,
after all.</p>

<p>As twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed
business and the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to
camp. They were jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and
the illustrious trouble they were making. They caught fish,
cooked supper and ate it, and then fell to guessing at what the
village was thinking and saying about them; and the pictures they
drew of the public distress on their account were gratifying to
look upon&mdash;from their point of view. But when the shadows of
night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat
gazing into the fire, with their minds evidently wandering
elsewhere. The excitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could
not keep back thoughts of certain persons at home who were not
enjoying this fine frolic as much as they were. Misgivings came;
they grew troubled and unhappy; a sigh or two escaped, unawares.
By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a roundabout "feeler" as to
how the others might look upon a return to civilization&mdash;not
right now, but&mdash;</p>

<p>Tom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as
yet, joined in with Tom, and the waverer quickly "explained," and
was glad to get out of the scrape with as little taint of
chicken-hearted home-sickness clinging to his garments as he
could. Mutiny was effectually laid to rest for the moment.</p>

<br><br><br><br> 


<p>As the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to
snore. Joe followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for
some time, watching the two intently. At last he got up
cautiously, on his knees, and went searching among the grass and
the flickering reflections flung by the campfire. He picked up
and inspected several large semi-cylinders of the thin white
bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed to suit
him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something upon
each of these with his "red keel"; one he rolled up and put in
his jacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe's hat and removed
it to a little distance from the owner. And he also put into the
hat certain schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable
value&mdash;among them a lump of chalk, an India-rubber ball,
three fishhooks, and one of that kind of marbles known as a "sure
'nough crystal." Then he tiptoed his way cautiously among the
trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and straightway
broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.</p>

<p>A FEW minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar,
wading toward the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his
middle he was halfway over; the current would permit no more
wading, now, so he struck out confidently to swim the remaining
hundred yards. He swam quartering upstream, but still was swept
downward rather faster than he had expected. However, he reached
the shore finally, and drifted along till he found a low place
and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket pocket, found
his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods,
following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten
o'clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and
saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high
bank. Everything was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept
down the bank, watching with all his eyes, slipped into the
water, swam three or four strokes and climbed into the skiff that
did "yawl" duty at the boat's stern. He laid himself down under
the thwarts and waited, panting.</p>

<p>Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order
to "cast off." A minute or two later the skiff's head was
standing high up, against the boat's swell, and the voyage was
begun. Tom felt happy in his success, for he knew it was the
boat's last trip for the night. At the end of a long twelve or
fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and Tom slipped overboard and
swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards downstream, out of
danger of possible stragglers.</p>

<p>He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself
at his aunt's back fence. He climbed over, approached the "ell,"
and looked in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning
there. There sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper's mother,
grouped together, talking. They were by the bed, and the bed was
between them and the door. Tom went to the door and began to
softly lift the latch; then he pressed gently and the door
yielded a crack; he continued pushing cautiously, and quaking
every time it creaked, till he judged he might squeeze through on
his knees; so he put his head through and began, warily.</p>

<p>"What makes the candle blow so?" said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried
up. "Why, that door's open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No
end of strange things now. Go 'long and shut it, Sid."</p>

<p>Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and
"breathed" himself for a time, and then crept to where he could
almost touch his aunt's foot.</p>

<p>"But as I was saying," said Aunt Polly, "he warn't BAD, so to
say&mdash; only mischEEvous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum,
you know. He warn't any more responsible than a colt. HE never
meant any harm, and he was the best-hearted boy that ever
was"&mdash;and she began to cry.</p>

<p>"It was just so with my Joe&mdash;always full of his
devilment, and up to every kind of mischief, but he was just as
unselfish and kind as he could be&mdash;and laws bless me, to
think I went and whipped him for taking that cream, never once
recollecting that I throwed it out myself because it was sour,
and I never to see him again in this world, never, never, never,
poor abused boy!" And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would
break.</p>

<p>"I hope Tom's better off where he is," said Sid, "but if he'd
been better in some ways&mdash;"</p>

<p>"SID!" Tom felt the glare of the old lady's eye, though he
could not see it. "Not a word against my Tom, now that he's gone!
God'll take care of HIM&mdash;never you trouble YOURself, sir!
Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don't know how to give him up! I don't know
how to give him up! He was such a comfort to me, although he
tormented my old heart out of me, 'most."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="15-130"></a>

<br><br><br><br> 

<p>"The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away&mdash;Blessed be
the name of the Lord! But it's so hard&mdash;Oh, it's so hard!
Only last Saturday my Joe busted a firecracker right under my
nose and I knocked him sprawling. Little did I know then, how
soon&mdash;Oh, if it was to do over again I'd hug him and bless
him for it."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know
just exactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my
Tom took and filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think
the cretur would tear the house down. And God forgive me, I
cracked Tom's head with my thimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But
he's out of all his troubles now. And the last words I ever heard
him say was to reproach&mdash;"</p>

<p>But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke
entirely down. Tom was snuffling, now, himself&mdash;and more in
pity of himself than anybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and
putting in a kindly word for him from time to time. He began to
have a nobler opinion of himself than ever before. Still, he was
sufficiently touched by his aunt's grief to long to rush out from
under the bed and overwhelm her with joy&mdash;and the theatrical
gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his nature, too,
but he resisted and lay still.</p>

<p>He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it
was conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while
taking a swim; then the small raft had been missed; next, certain
boys said the missing lads had promised that the village should
"hear something" soon; the wise-heads had "put this and that
together" and decided that the lads had gone off on that raft and
would turn up at the next town below, presently; but toward noon
the raft had been found, lodged against the Missouri shore some
five or six miles below the village&mdash;and then hope perished;
they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home by
nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the
bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning
must have occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good
swimmers, would otherwise have escaped to shore. This was
Wednesday night. If the bodies continued missing until Sunday,
all hope would be given over, and the funerals would be preached
on that morning. Tom shuddered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. Then
with a mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves
into each other's arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then
parted. Aunt Polly was tender far beyond her wont, in her
goodnight to Sid and Mary. Sid snuffled a bit and Mary went off
crying with all her heart.</p>

<p>Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so
appealingly, and with such measureless love in her words and her
old trembling voice, that he was weltering in tears again, long
before she was through.</p>

<p>He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept
making broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing
unrestfully, and turning over. But at last she was still, only
moaning a little in her sleep. Now the boy stole out, rose
gradually by the bedside, shaded the candle-light with his hand,
and stood regarding her. His heart was full of pity for her. He
took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the candle. But
something occurred to him, and he lingered considering. His face
lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark
hastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded
lips, and straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door
behind him.</p>

<p>He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at
large there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she
was tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always
turned in and slept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at
the stern, slipped into it, and was soon rowing cautiously
upstream. When he had pulled a mile above the village, he
started quartering across and bent himself stoutly to his work.
He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for this was a
familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture the skiff,
arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore
legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would
be made for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped
ashore and entered the woods.</p>

<p>He sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile
to keep awake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The
night was far spent. It was broad daylight before he found
himself fairly abreast the island bar. He rested again until the
sun was well up and gilding the great river with its splendor,
and then he plunged into the stream. A little later he paused,
dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and heard Joe say:</p>

<p>"No, Tom's true-blue, Huck, and he'll come back. He won't
desert. He knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom's
too proud for that sort of thing. He's up to something or other.
Now I wonder what?"</p>

<p>"Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain't they?"</p>

<p>Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if
he ain't back here to breakfast."</p>

<p>"Which he is!" exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect,
stepping grandly into camp.</p>

<p>A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided,
and as the boys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned)
his adventures. They were a vain and boastful company of heroes
when the tale was done. Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook
to sleep till noon, and the other pirates got ready to fish and
explore.</p>

<p>AFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs
on the bar. They went about poking sticks into the sand, and when
they found a soft place they went down on their knees and dug
with their hands. Sometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs
out of one hole. They were perfectly round white things a trifle
smaller than an English walnut. They had a famous fried-egg feast
that night, and another on Friday morning.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="16-135"></a>

<br><br><br><br> 

<p>After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the
bar, and chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as
they went, until they were naked, and then continued the frolic
far away up the shoal water of the bar, against the stiff
current, which latter tripped their legs from under them from
time to time and greatly increased the fun. And now and then they
stooped in a group and splashed water in each other's faces with
their palms, gradually approaching each other, with averted
faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and
struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they
all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up
blowing, sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and
the same time.</p>

<p>When they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl
on the dry, hot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with
it, and by and by break for the water again and go through the
original performance once more. Finally it occurred to them that
their naked skin represented flesh-colored "tights" very fairly;
so they drew a ring in the sand and had a circus&mdash;with three
clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest post to his
neighbor.</p>

<p>Next they got their marbles and played "knucks" and "ringtaw"
and "keeps" till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had
another swim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in
kicking off his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake
rattles off his ankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp
so long without the protection of this mysterious charm. He did
not venture again until he had found it, and by that time the
other boys were tired and ready to rest. They gradually wandered
apart, dropped into the "dumps," and fell to gazing longingly
across the wide river to where the village lay drowsing in the
sun. Tom found himself writing "BECKY" in the sand with his big
toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his
weakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help
it. He erased it once more and then took himself out of
temptation by driving the other boys together and joining
them.</p>

<p>But Joe's spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He
was so homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The
tears lay very near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom
was downhearted, but tried hard not to show it. He had a secret
which he was not ready to tell, yet, but if this mutinous
depression was not broken up soon, he would have to bring it out.
He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:</p>

<p>"I bet there's been pirates on this island before, boys. We'll
explore it again. They've hid treasures here somewhere. How'd you
feel to light on a rotten chest full of gold and
silver&mdash;hey?"</p>

<p>But it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no
reply. Tom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed,
too. It was discouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a
stick and looking very gloomy. Finally he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, boys, let's give it up. I want to go home. It's so
lonesome."</p>

<p>"Oh no, Joe, you'll feel better by and by," said Tom. "Just
think of the fishing that's here."</p>

<p>"I don't care for fishing. I want to go home."</p>

<p>"But, Joe, there ain't such another swimming-place
anywhere."</p>

<p>"Swimming's no good. I don't seem to care for it, somehow,
when there ain't anybody to say I sha'n't go in. I mean to go
home."</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Yes, I DO want to see my mother&mdash;and you would, too, if
you had one. I ain't any more baby than you are." And Joe
snuffled a little.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won't we,
Huck? Poor thing&mdash;does it want to see its mother? And so it
shall. You like it here, don't you, Huck? We'll stay, won't
we?"</p>

<p>Huck said, "Y-e-s"&mdash;without any heart in it.</p>

<p>"I'll never speak to you again as long as I live," said Joe,
rising. "There now!" And he moved moodily away and began to dress
himself.</p>

<p>"Who cares!" said Tom. "Nobody wants you to. Go 'long home and
get laughed at. Oh, you're a nice pirate. Huck and me ain't
crybabies. We'll stay, won't we, Huck? Let him go if he wants
to. I reckon we can get along without him, per'aps."</p>

<p>But Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe
go sullenly on with his dressing. And then it was discomforting
to see Huck eying Joe's preparations so wistfully, and keeping
up such an ominous silence. Presently, without a parting word,
Joe began to wade off toward the Illinois shore. Tom's heart
began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck could not bear the look,
and dropped his eyes. Then he said:</p>

<p>"I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway,
and now it'll be worse. Let's us go, too, Tom."</p>

<p>"I won't! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay."</p>

<p>"Tom, I better go."</p>

<p>"Well, go 'long&mdash;who's hendering you."</p>

<p>Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:</p>

<p>"Tom, I wisht you'd come, too. Now you think it over. We'll
wait for you when we get to shore."</p>

<p>"Well, you'll wait a blame long time, that's all."</p>

<p>Huck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after
him, with a strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride
and go along too. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still
waded slowly on. It suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become
very lonely and still. He made one final struggle with his pride,
and then darted after his comrades, yelling:</p>

<p>"Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!"</p>

<p>They presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where
they were, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened
moodily till at last they saw the "point" he was driving at, and
then they set up a warwhoop of applause and said it was
"splendid!" and said if he had told them at first, they wouldn't
have started away. He made a plausible excuse; but his real
reason had been the fear that not even the secret would keep them
with him any very great length of time, and so he had meant to
hold it in reserve as a last seduction.</p>

<p>The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a
will, chattering all the time about Tom's stupendous plan and
admiring the genius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner,
Tom said he wanted to learn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea
and said he would like to try, too. So Huck made pipes and filled
them. These novices had never smoked anything before but cigars
made of grapevine, and they "bit" the tongue, and were not
considered manly anyway.</p>

<p>Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to
puff, charily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an
unpleasant taste, and they gagged a little, but Tom said:</p>

<p>"Why, it's just as easy! If I'd a knowed this was all, I'd a
learnt long ago."</p>

<p>"So would I," said Joe. "It's just nothing."</p>

<p>"Why, many a time I've looked at people smoking, and thought
well I wish I could do that; but I never thought I could," said
Tom.</p>

<p>"That's just the way with me, hain't it, Huck? You've heard me
talk just that way&mdash;haven't you, Huck? I'll leave it to Huck
if I haven't."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;heaps of times," said Huck.</p>

<p>"Well, I have too," said Tom; "oh, hundreds of times. Once
down by the slaughter-house. Don't you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner
was there, and Johnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it.
Don't you remember, Huck, 'bout me saying that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so," said Huck. "That was the day after I lost a
white alley. No, 'twas the day before."</p>

<p>"There&mdash;I told you so," said Tom. "Huck recollects
it."</p>

<p>"I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day," said Joe. "I don't
feel sick."</p>

<p>"Neither do I," said Tom. "I could smoke it all day. But I bet
you Jeff Thatcher couldn't."</p>

<p>"Jeff Thatcher! Why, he'd keel over just with two draws. Just
let him try it once. HE'D see!"</p>

<p>"I bet he would. And Johnny Miller&mdash;I wish could see
Johnny Miller tackle it once."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't I!" said Joe. "Why, I bet you Johnny Miller
couldn't any more do this than nothing. Just one little snifter
would fetch HIM."</p>

<p>"'Deed it would, Joe. Say&mdash;I wish the boys could see us
now."</p>

<p>"So do I."</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;boys, don't say anything about it, and some time
when they're around, I'll come up to you and say, 'Joe, got a
pipe? I want a smoke.' And you'll say, kind of careless like, as
if it warn't anything, you'll say, 'Yes, I got my OLD pipe, and
another one, but my tobacker ain't very good.' And I'll say, 'Oh,
that's all right, if it's STRONG enough.' And then you'll out
with the pipes, and we'll light up just as ca'm, and then just
see 'em look!"</p>

<p>"By jings, that'll be gay, Tom! I wish it was NOW!"</p>

<p>"So do I! And when we tell 'em we learned when we was off
pirating, won't they wish they'd been along?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I reckon not! I'll just BET they will!"</p>

<p>So the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle,
and grow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration
marvellously increased. Every pore inside the boys' cheeks became
a spouting fountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars
under their tongues fast enough to prevent an inundation; little
overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they
could do, and sudden retchings followed every time. Both boys
were looking very pale and miserable, now. Joe's pipe dropped
from his nerveless fingers. Tom's followed. Both fountains were
going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main. Joe
said feebly:</p>

<p>"I've lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it."</p>

<p>Tom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:</p>

<p>"I'll help you. You go over that way and I'll hunt around by
the spring. No, you needn't come, Huck&mdash;we can find it."</p>

<br><br><br><br> 

<p>So Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it
lonesome, and went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in
the woods, both very pale, both fast asleep. But something
informed him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of
it.</p>

<p>They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a
humble look, and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and
was going to prepare theirs, they said no, they were not feeling
very well&mdash;something they ate at dinner had disagreed with
them.</p>

<p>About midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a
brooding oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something.
The boys huddled themselves together and sought the friendly
companionship of the fire, though the dull dead heat of the
breathless atmosphere was stifling. They sat still, intent and
waiting. The solemn hush continued. Beyond the light of the fire
everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness.
Presently there came a quivering glow that vaguely revealed the
foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by another came, a
little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came sighing
through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting
breath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the
Spirit of the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird
flash turned night into day and showed every little grassblade,
separate and distinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed
three white, startled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went
rolling and tumbling down the heavens and lost itself in sullen
rumblings in the distance. A sweep of chilly air passed by,
rustling all the leaves and snowing the flaky ashes broadcast
about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the forest and an
instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops right
over the boys' heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick
gloom that followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon
the leaves.</p>

<p>"Quick! boys, go for the tent!" exclaimed Tom.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="16-141"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="16-141.jpg (111K)" src="16-141.jpg" height="953" width="366">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>They sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the
dark, no two plunging in the same direction. A furious blast
roared through the trees, making everything sing as it went. One
blinding flash after another came, and peal on peal of deafening
thunder. And now a drenching rain poured down and the rising
hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground. The boys cried out
to each other, but the roaring wind and the booming
thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one
they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold,
scared, and streaming with water; but to have company in misery
seemed something to be grateful for. They could not talk, the old
sail flapped so furiously, even if the other noises would have
allowed them. The tempest rose higher and higher, and presently
the sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on
the blast. The boys seized each others' hands and fled, with many
tumblings and bruises, to the shelter of a great oak that stood
upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its highest. Under the
ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies,
everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless
distinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with
foam, the driving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the
high bluffs on the other side, glimpsed through the drifting
cloudrack and the slanting veil of rain. Every little while some
giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the
younger growth; and the unflagging thunderpeals came now in
ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp, and unspeakably
appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort that
seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it
to the treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it,
all at one and the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless
young heads to be out in.</p>

<p>But at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with
weaker and weaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed
her sway. The boys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they
found there was still something to be thankful for, because the
great sycamore, the shelter of their beds, was a ruin, now,
blasted by the lightnings, and they were not under it when the
catastrophe happened.</p>

<p>Everything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for
they were but heedless lads, like their generation, and had made
no provision against rain. Here was matter for dismay, for they
were soaked through and chilled. They were eloquent in their
distress; but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten
so far up under the great log it had been built against (where it
curved upward and separated itself from the ground), that a
handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they patiently
wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides
of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they
piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and
were gladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had
a feast, and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and
glorified their midnight adventure until morning, for there was
not a dry spot to sleep on, anywhere around.</p>

<p>As the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came
over them, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to
sleep. They got scorched out by and by, and drearily set about
getting breakfast. After the meal they felt rusty, and
stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once more. Tom saw the
signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as he could.
But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or
anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a
ray of cheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new
device. This was to knock off being pirates, for a while, and be
Indians for a change. They were attracted by this idea; so it was
not long before they were stripped, and striped from head to heel
with black mud, like so many zebras&mdash;all of them chiefs, of
course&mdash;and then they went tearing through the woods to
attack an English settlement.</p>

<p>By and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted
upon each other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed
and scalped each other by thousands. It was a gory day.
Consequently it was an extremely satisfactory one.</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>They assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy;
but now a difficulty arose&mdash;hostile Indians could not break
the bread of hospitality together without first making peace,
and this was a simple impossibility without smoking a pipe of
peace. There was no other process that ever they had heard of.
Two of the savages almost wished they had remained pirates.
However, there was no other way; so with such show of
cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and
took their whiff as it passed, in due form.</p>

<p>And behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for
they had gained something; they found that they could now smoke a
little without having to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did
not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable. They were not
likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort. No,
they practised cautiously, after supper, with right fair success,
and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were prouder and
happier in their new acquirement than they would have been in the
scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We will leave them to
smoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for
them at present.</p>

<p>BUT there was no hilarity in the little town that same
tranquil Saturday afternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly's
family, were being put into mourning, with great grief and many
tears. An unusual quiet possessed the village, although it was
ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience. The villagers
conducted their concerns with an absent air, and talked little;
but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to
the children. They had no heart in their sports, and gradually
gave them up.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the
deserted schoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she
found nothing there to comfort her. She soliloquized:</p>

<p>"Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven't
got anything now to remember him by." And she choked back a
little sob.</p>

<p>Presently she stopped, and said to herself:</p>

<p>"It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn't
say that &mdash;I wouldn't say it for the whole world. But he's
gone now; I'll never, never, never see him any more."</p>

<p>This thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears
rolling down her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and
girls&mdash;playmates of Tom's and Joe's&mdash;came by, and stood
looking over the paling fence and talking in reverent tones of
how Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw him, and how Joe
said this and that small trifle (pregnant with awful prophecy, as
they could easily see now!)&mdash;and each speaker pointed out
the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and then
added something like "and I was a-standing just so&mdash;just as
I am now, and as if you was him&mdash;I was as close as
that&mdash;and he smiled, just this way&mdash;and then something
seemed to go all over me, like&mdash; awful, you know&mdash;and I
never thought what it meant, of course, but I can see now!"</p>

<p>Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in
life, and many claimed that dismal distinction, and offered
evidences, more or less tampered with by the witness; and when it
was ultimately decided who DID see the departed last, and
exchanged the last words with them, the lucky parties took upon
themselves a sort of sacred importance, and were gaped at and
envied by all the rest. One poor chap, who had no other grandeur
to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the
remembrance:</p>

<p>"Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once."</p>

<p>But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could
say that, and so that cheapened the distinction too much. The
group loitered away, still recalling memories of the lost
heroes, in awed voices.</p>

<p>When the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning,
the bell began to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It
was a very still Sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in
keeping with the musing hush that lay upon nature. The villagers
began to gather, loitering a moment in the vestibule to converse
in whispers about the sad event. But there was no whispering in
the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses as the women
gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. None could
remember when the little church had been so full before. There
was finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt
Polly entered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper
family, all in deep black, and the whole congregation, the old
minister as well, rose reverently and stood until the mourners
were seated in the front pew. There was another communing
silence, broken at intervals by muffled sobs, and then the
minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving hymn was
sung, and the text followed: "I am the Resurrection and the
Life."</p>

<p>As the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of
the graces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost
lads that every soul there, thinking he recognized these
pictures, felt a pang in remembering that he had persistently
blinded himself to them always before, and had as persistently
seen only faults and flaws in the poor boys. The minister related
many a touching incident in the lives of the departed, too, which
illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the people could
easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes were, and
remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had
seemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The
congregation became more and more moved, as the pathetic tale
went on, till at last the whole company broke down and joined the
weeping mourners in a chorus of anguished sobs, the preacher
himself giving way to his feelings, and crying in the pulpit.</p>

<p>There was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a
moment later the church door creaked; the minister raised his
streaming eyes above his handkerchief, and stood transfixed!
First one and then another pair of eyes followed the minister's,
and then almost with one impulse the congregation rose and stared
while the three dead boys came marching up the aisle, Tom in the
lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags, sneaking
sheepishly in the rear! They had been hid in the unused gallery
listening to their own funeral sermon!</p>

<p>Aunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their
restored ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out
thanksgivings, while poor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable,
not knowing exactly what to do or where to hide from so many
unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and started to slink away, but Tom
seized him and said:</p>

<p>"Aunt Polly, it ain't fair. Somebody's got to be glad to see
Huck."</p>

<p>"And so they shall. I'm glad to see him, poor motherless
thing!" And the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him
were the one thing capable of making him more uncomfortable than
he was before.</p>

<p>Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: "Praise
God from whom all blessings flow&mdash;SING!&mdash;and put your
hearts in it!"</p>

<br><br><br><br> 

<p>And they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst,
and while it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked
around upon the envying juveniles about him and confessed in his
heart that this was the proudest moment of his life.</p>

<p>As the "sold" congregation trooped out they said they would
almost be willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred
sung like that once more.</p>

<p>Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day&mdash;according to Aunt
Polly's varying moods&mdash;than he had earned before in a year;
and he hardly knew which expressed the most gratefulness to God
and affection for himself.</p>

of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
