<p>THE sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the
peaceful village like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly
had family worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground
up of solid courses of Scriptural quotations, welded together
with a thin mortar of originality; and from the summit of this
she delivered a grim chapter of the Mosaic Law, as from
Sinai.</p>

<p>Then Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to
"get his verses." Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom
bent all his energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he
chose part of the Sermon on the Mount, because he could find no
verses that were shorter. At the end of half an hour Tom had a
vague general idea of his lesson, but no more, for his mind was
traversing the whole field of human thought, and his hands were
busy with distracting recreations. Mary took his book to hear
him recite, and he tried to find his way through the fog:</p>

<p>"Blessed are the&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Poor"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;poor; blessed are the
poor&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In spirit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for
they&mdash;they&mdash;"</p>

<p>"THEIRS&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For THEIRS. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for
they&mdash;they&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For they&mdash;a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"S, H, A&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For they S, H&mdash;Oh, I don't know what it is!"</p>

<p>"SHALL!"</p>

<p>"Oh, SHALL! for they shall&mdash;for they
shall&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;shall mourn&mdash;
a&mdash;a&mdash;blessed are they that shall&mdash;they
that&mdash;a&mdash;they that shall mourn, for they
shall&mdash;a&mdash;shall WHAT? Why don't you tell me,
Mary?&mdash;what do you want to be so mean for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I'm not teasing you. I
wouldn't do that. You must go and learn it again. Don't you be
discouraged, Tom, you'll manage it&mdash;and if you do, I'll give
you something ever so nice. There, now, that's a good boy."</p>

<p>"All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is."</p>

<p>"Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it's nice, it is
nice."</p>

<p>"You bet you that's so, Mary. All right, I'll tackle it
again."</p>

<p>And he did "tackle it again"&mdash;and under the double
pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such
spirit that he accomplished a shining success. Mary gave him a
brand-new "Barlow" knife worth twelve and a half cents; and the
convulsion of delight that swept his system shook him to his
foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything, but it was a
"sure-enough" Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur in
that&mdash;though where the Western boys ever got the idea that
such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an
imposing mystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom
contrived to scarify the cupboard with it, and was arranging to
begin on the bureau, when he was called off to dress for
Sunday-school.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="04-044"></a>
<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he
went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there;
then he dipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up
his sleeves; poured out the water on the ground, gently, and then
entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the
towel behind the door. But Mary removed the towel and said:</p>

<p>"Now ain't you ashamed, Tom. You mustn't be so bad. Water
won't hurt you."</p>

<p>Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and
this time he stood over it a little while, gathering resolution;
took in a big breath and began. When he entered the kitchen
presently, with both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his
hands, an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from
his face. But when he emerged from the towel, he was not yet
satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped short at his chin
and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line there was a
dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front
and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she
was done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction
of color, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its
short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect.
[He privately smoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty,
and plastered his hair close down to his head; for he held curls
to be effeminate, and his own filled his life with bitterness.]
Then Mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only
on Sundays during two years&mdash;they were simply called his
"other clothes"&mdash;and so by that we know the size of his
wardrobe. The girl "put him to rights" after he had dressed
himself; she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned
his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders, brushed him off
and crowned him with his speckled straw hat. He now looked
exceedingly improved and uncomfortable. He was fully as
uncomfortable as he looked; for there was a restraint about whole
clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He hoped that Mary would
forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she coated them
thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought them out.
He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do
everything he didn't want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:</p>

<p>"Please, Tom&mdash;that's a good boy."</p>

<p>So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and
the three children set out for Sunday-school&mdash;a place that
Tom hated with his whole heart; but Sid and Mary were fond of
it.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="04-045"></a>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then
church service. Two of the children always remained for the
sermon voluntarily, and the other always remained too&mdash;for
stronger reasons. The church's high-backed, uncushioned pews
would seat about three hundred persons; the edifice was but a
small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board tree-box on top of
it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step and
accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:</p>

<p>"Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What'll you take for her?"</p>

<p>"What'll you give?"</p>

<p>"Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook."</p>

<p>"Less see 'em."</p>

<p>Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property
changed hands. Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three
red tickets, and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue
ones. He waylaid other boys as they came, and went on buying
tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer. He
entered the church, now, with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and
girls, proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first
boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave, elderly man,
interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy's
hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy
turned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to
hear him say "Ouch!" and got a new reprimand from his teacher.
Tom's whole class were of a pattern&mdash;restless, noisy, and
troublesome. When they came to recite their lessons, not one of
them knew his verses perfectly, but had to be prompted all along.
However, they worried through, and each got his reward&mdash;in
small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture on it; each
blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten blue
tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten
red tickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the
superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents
in those easy times) to the pupil. How many of my readers would
have the industry and application to memorize two thousand
verses, even for a Dore Bible? And yet Mary had acquired two
Bibles in this way&mdash;it was the patient work of two
years&mdash;and a boy of German parentage had won four or five.
He once recited three thousand verses without stopping; but the
strain upon his mental faculties was too great, and he was little
better than an idiot from that day forth&mdash;a grievous
misfortune for the school, for on great occasions, before
company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it) had always made
this boy come out and "spread himself." Only the older pupils
managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work
long enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these
prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful
pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot
every scholar's heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often
lasted a couple of weeks. It is possible that Tom's mental
stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes, but
unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for
the glory and the eclat that came with it.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the
pulpit, with a closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger
inserted between its leaves, and commanded attention. When a
Sunday-school superintendent makes his customary little speech,
a hymn-book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable
sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the
platform and sings a solo at a concert&mdash; though why, is a
mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music is ever
referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim
creature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy
hair; he wore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost
reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast
the corners of his mouth &mdash;a fence that compelled a straight
lookout ahead, and a turning of the whole body when a side view
was required; his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which
was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had fringed ends;
his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion of the day,
like sleigh-runners&mdash;an effect patiently and laboriously
produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed
against a wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest
of mien, and very sincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred
things and places in such reverence, and so separated them from
worldly matters, that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school
voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent
on week-days. He began after this fashion:</p>

<p>"Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and
pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or
two. There&mdash; that is it. That is the way good little boys
and girls should do. I see one little girl who is looking out of
the window&mdash;I am afraid she thinks I am out there
somewhere&mdash;perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to
the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how
good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces
assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be
good." And so forth and so on. It is not necessary to set down
the rest of the oration. It was of a pattern which does not vary,
and so it is familiar to us all.</p>

<p>The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of
fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and
by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide,
washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks
like Sid and Mary. But now every sound ceased suddenly, with the
subsidence of Mr. Walters' voice, and the conclusion of the
speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.</p>

<p>A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event
which was more or less rare&mdash;the entrance of visitors:
lawyer Thatcher, accompanied by a very feeble and aged man; a
fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair; and a
dignified lady who was doubtless the latter's wife. The lady was
leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of chafings and
repinings; conscience-smitten, too&mdash;he could not meet Amy
Lawrence's eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he
saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a
moment. The next moment he was "showing off" with all his
might&mdash; cuffing boys, pulling hair, making faces&mdash;in a
word, using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and
win her applause. His exaltation had but one alloy&mdash;the
memory of his humiliation in this angel's garden&mdash;and that
record in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness
that were sweeping over it now.</p>

<p>The visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon
as Mr. Walters' speech was finished, he introduced them to the
school. The middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious
personage&mdash;no less a one than the county
judge&mdash;altogether the most august creation these children
had ever looked upon&mdash;and they wondered what kind of
material he was made of&mdash;and they half wanted to hear him
roar, and were half afraid he might, too. He was from
Constantinople, twelve miles away&mdash; so he had travelled, and
seen the world&mdash;these very eyes had looked upon the county
court-house&mdash;which was said to have a tin roof. The awe
which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive
silence and the ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge
Thatcher, brother of their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately
went forward, to be familiar with the great man and be envied by
the school. It would have been music to his soul to hear the
whisperings:</p>

<p>"Look at him, Jim! He's a going up there. Say&mdash;look! he's
a going to shake hands with him&mdash;he IS shaking hands with
him! By jings, don't you wish you was Jeff?"</p>

<p>Mr. Walters fell to "showing off," with all sorts of official
bustlings and activities, giving orders, delivering judgments,
discharging directions here, there, everywhere that he could find
a target. The librarian "showed off"&mdash;running hither and
thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the
splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in. The young
lady teachers "showed off"&mdash;bending sweetly over pupils that
were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers at bad
little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen
teachers "showed off" with small scoldings and other little
displays of authority and fine attention to discipline&mdash;and
most of the teachers, of both sexes, found business up at the
library, by the pulpit; and it was business that frequently had
to be done over again two or three times (with much seeming
vexation). The little girls "showed off" in various ways, and the
little boys "showed off" with such diligence that the air was
thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it
all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon
all the house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own
grandeur&mdash;for he was "showing off," too.</p>

<p>There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters' ecstasy
complete, and that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and
exhibit a prodigy. Several pupils had a few yellow tickets, but
none had enough&mdash;he had been around among the star pupils
inquiring. He would have given worlds, now, to have that German
lad back again with a sound mind.</p>

<p>And now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came
forward with nine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue
ones, and demanded a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear
sky. Walters was not expecting an application from this source
for the next ten years. But there was no getting around
it&mdash;here were the certified checks, and they were good for
their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge
and the other elect, and the great news was announced from
headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade,
and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up
to the judicial one's altitude, and the school had two marvels to
gaze upon in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with
envy&mdash;but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those
who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to
this hated splendor by trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he
had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges. These despised
themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a guileful snake
in the grass.</p>

<p>The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the
superintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it
lacked somewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow's instinct
taught him that there was a mystery here that could not well bear
the light, perhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had
warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his
premises&mdash;a dozen would strain his capacity, without a
doubt.</p>

<p>Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see
it in her face&mdash;but he wouldn't look. She wondered; then she
was just a grain troubled; next a dim suspicion came and
went&mdash;came again; she watched; a furtive glance told her
worlds&mdash;and then her heart broke, and she was jealous, and
angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most of
all (she thought).</p>

<p>Tom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his
breath would hardly come, his heart quaked&mdash;partly because
of the awful greatness of the man, but mainly because he was her
parent. He would have liked to fall down and worship him, if it
were in the dark. The Judge put his hand on Tom's head and called
him a fine little man, and asked him what his name was. The boy
stammered, gasped, and got it out:</p>

<p>"Tom."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not Tom&mdash;it is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thomas."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That's
very well. But you've another one I daresay, and you'll tell it
to me, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas," said Walters,
"and say sir. You mustn't forget your manners."</p>

<p>"Thomas Sawyer&mdash;sir."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="04-051"></a>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>"That's it! That's a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little
fellow. Two thousand verses is a great many&mdash;very, very
great many. And you never can be sorry for the trouble you took
to learn them; for knowledge is worth more than anything there
is in the world; it's what makes great men and good men; you'll
be a great man and a good man yourself, some day, Thomas, and
then you'll look back and say, It's all owing to the precious
Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood&mdash;it's all owing to my
dear teachers that taught me to learn&mdash;it's all owing to the
good superintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and
gave me a beautiful Bible&mdash;a splendid elegant Bible&mdash;to
keep and have it all for my own, always&mdash;it's all owing to
right bringing up! That is what you will say, Thomas&mdash;and
you wouldn't take any money for those two thousand
verses&mdash;no indeed you wouldn't. And now you wouldn't mind
telling me and this lady some of the things you've
learned&mdash;no, I know you wouldn't&mdash;for we are proud of
little boys that learn. Now, no doubt you know the names of all
the twelve disciples. Won't you tell us the names of the first
two that were appointed?"</p>

<p>Tom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He
blushed, now, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters' heart sank within
him. He said to himself, it is not possible that the boy can
answer the simplest question&mdash;why DID the Judge ask him? Yet
he felt obliged to speak up and say:</p>

<p>"Answer the gentleman, Thomas&mdash;don't be afraid."</p>

<p>Tom still hung fire.</p>

<p>"Now I know you'll tell me," said the lady. "The names of the
first two disciples were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"DAVID AND GOLIAH!"</p>

<p>Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the
scene.</p>

<p>ABOUT half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began
to ring, and presently the people began to gather for the
morning sermon. The Sunday-school children distributed themselves
about the house and occupied pews with their parents, so as to
be under supervision. Aunt Polly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary
sat with her&mdash;Tom being placed next the aisle, in order that
he might be as far away from the open window and the seductive
outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up the aisles:
the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days; the
mayor and his wife&mdash;for they had a mayor there, among other
unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass,
fair, smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and
well-to-do, her hill mansion the only palace in the town, and the
most hospitable and much the most lavish in the matter of
festivities that St. Petersburg could boast; the bent and
venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the new notable
from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by a
troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then
all the young clerks in town in a body&mdash;for they had stood
in the vestibule sucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of
oiled and simpering admirers, till the last girl had run their
gantlet; and last of all came the Model Boy, Willie Mufferson,
taking as heedful care of his mother as if she were cut glass. He
always brought his mother to church, and was the pride of all the
matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so good. And besides, he
had been "thrown up to them" so much. His white handkerchief was
hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on
Sundays&mdash;accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he
looked upon boys who had as snobs.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>The congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang
once more, to warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn
hush fell upon the church which was only broken by the tittering
and whispering of the choir in the gallery. The choir always
tittered and whispered all through service. There was once a
church choir that was not ill-bred, but I have forgotten where
it was, now. It was a great many years ago, and I can scarcely
remember anything about it, but I think it was in some foreign
country.</p>

<p>The minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a
relish, in a peculiar style which was much admired in that part
of the country. His voice began on a medium key and climbed
steadily up till it reached a certain point, where it bore with
strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged down as if
from a spring-board:</p>

<br><br>
<a name="05-055"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="05-055.jpg (94K)" src="05-055.jpg" height="558" width="794">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Shall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow'ry BEDS of
ease,</p>

<p>Whilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro' BLOOD-y
seas?</p>

<p>He was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church "sociables"
he was always called upon to read poetry; and when he was
through, the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall
helplessly in their laps, and "wall" their eyes, and shake their
heads, as much as to say, "Words cannot express it; it is too
beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal earth."</p>

<p>After the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned
himself into a bulletin-board, and read off "notices" of meetings
and societies and things till it seemed that the list would
stretch out to the crack of doom&mdash;a queer custom which is
still kept up in America, even in cities, away here in this age
of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is to justify a
traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.</p>

<p>And now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was,
and went into details: it pleaded for the church, and the little
children of the church; for the other churches of the village;
for the village itself; for the county; for the State; for the
State officers; for the United States; for the churches of the
United States; for Congress; for the President; for the officers
of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed by stormy seas; for
the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of European
monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light
and the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to
hear withal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and
closed with a supplication that the words he was about to speak
might find grace and favor, and be as seed sown in fertile
ground, yielding in time a grateful harvest of good. Amen.</p>

<p>There was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation
sat down. The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy
the prayer, he only endured it&mdash;if he even did that much.
He was restive all through it; he kept tally of the details of
the prayer, unconsciously&mdash;for he was not listening, but he
knew the ground of old, and the clergyman's regular route over
it&mdash;and when a little trifle of new matter was
interlarded, his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it;
he considered additions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of
the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him
and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together,
embracing its head with its arms, and polishing it so vigorously
that it seemed to almost part company with the body, and the
slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping its wings
with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had
been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as
if it knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely
as Tom's hands itched to grab for it they did not dare&mdash;he
believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a
thing while the prayer was going on. But with the closing
sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward; and the
instant the "Amen" was out the fly was a prisoner of war. His
aunt detected the act and made him let it go.</p>

<p>The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously
through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by
began to nod&mdash; and yet it was an argument that dealt in
limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect
down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving. Tom
counted the pages of the sermon; after church he always knew how
many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything else about
the discourse. However, this time he was really interested for a
little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the
assembling together of the world's hosts at the millennium when
the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little
child should lead them. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of
the great spectacle were lost upon the boy; he only thought of
the conspicuousness of the principal character before the
on-looking nations; his face lit with the thought, and he said to
himself that he wished he could be that child, if it was a tame
lion.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was
resumed. Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got
it out. It was a large black beetle with formidable jaws&mdash;a
"pinchbug," he called it. It was in a percussion-cap box. The
first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger. A
natural fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into the
aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went into the
boy's mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,
unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was
safe out of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon
found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a
vagrant poodle dog came idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the
summer softness and the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for
change. He spied the beetle; the drooping tail lifted and wagged.
He surveyed the prize; walked around it; smelt at it from a safe
distance; walked around it again; grew bolder, and took a closer
smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it, just
missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the
diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his
paws, and continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then
indifferent and absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by
little his chin descended and touched the enemy, who seized it.
There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the poodle's head, and the
beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on its back once
more. The neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy,
several faces went behind fans and hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was
entirely happy. The dog looked foolish, and probably felt so; but
there was resentment in his heart, too, and a craving for
revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it
again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with
his fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer
snatches at it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears
flapped again. But he grew tired once more, after a while; tried
to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief; followed an ant
around, with his nose close to the floor, and quickly wearied of
that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat down on
it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went
sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he
crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew down the other
aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the home-
stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he
was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the
speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its
course, and sprang into its master's lap; he flung it out of the
window, and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died
in the distance.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating
with suppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead
standstill. The discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame
and halting, all possibility of impressiveness being at an end;
for even the gravest sentiments were constantly being received
with a smothered burst of unholy mirth, under cover of some
remote pew-back, as if the poor parson had said a rarely
facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole
congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction
pronounced.</p>

<p>Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that
there was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a
bit of variety in it. He had but one marring thought; he was
willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug, but he did
not think it was upright in him to carry it off.</p>

<p>MONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning
always found him so&mdash;because it began another week's slow
suffering in school. He generally began that day with wishing he
had had no intervening holiday, it made the going into captivity
and fetters again so much more odious.</p>

<p>Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished
he was sick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a
vague possibility. He canvassed his system. No ailment was
found, and he investigated again. This time he thought he could
detect colicky symptoms, and he began to encourage them with
considerable hope. But they soon grew feeble, and presently died
wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly he discovered
something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This was
lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a "starter," as he
called it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court
with that argument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would
hurt. So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the
present, and seek further. Nothing offered for some little time,
and then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain
thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks and
threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly drew his
sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection. But
now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed
well worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with
considerable spirit.</p>

<p>But Sid slept on unconscious.</p>

<p>Tom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in
the toe.</p>

<p>No result from Sid.</p>

<p>Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a
rest and then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of
admirable groans.</p>

<p>Sid snored on.</p>

<p>Tom was aggravated. He said, "Sid, Sid!" and shook him. This
course worked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned,
stretched, then brought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and
began to stare at Tom. Tom went on groaning. Sid said:</p>

<p>"Tom! Say, Tom!" [No response.] "Here, Tom! TOM! What is the
matter, Tom?" And he shook him and looked in his face
anxiously.</p>

<p>Tom moaned out:</p>

<p>"Oh, don't, Sid. Don't joggle me."</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter, Tom? I must call auntie."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;never mind. It'll be over by and by, maybe. Don't
call anybody."</p>

<p>"But I must! DON'T groan so, Tom, it's awful. How long you
been this way?"</p>

<p>"Hours. Ouch! Oh, don't stir so, Sid, you'll kill me."</p>

<p>"Tom, why didn't you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, DON'T! It makes
my flesh crawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you've
ever done to me. When I'm gone&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, you ain't dying, are you? Don't, Tom&mdash;oh,
don't. Maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell 'em so, Sid. And Sid,
you give my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl
that's come to town, and tell her&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering
in reality, now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and
so his groans had gathered quite a genuine tone.</p>

<p>Sid flew downstairs and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom's dying!"</p>

<p>"Dying!"</p>

<p>"Yes'm. Don't wait&mdash;come quick!"</p>

<p>"Rubbage! I don't believe it!"</p>

<p>But she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her
heels. And her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When
she reached the bedside she gasped out:</p>

<p>"You, Tom! Tom, what's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, auntie, I'm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you&mdash;what is the matter with you,
child?"</p>

<p>"Oh, auntie, my sore toe's mortified!"</p>

<p>The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then
cried a little, then did both together. This restored her and she
said:</p>

<p>"Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that
nonsense and climb out of this."</p>

<p>The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy
felt a little foolish, and he said:</p>

<p>"Aunt Polly, it SEEMED mortified, and it hurt so I never
minded my tooth at all."</p>

<p>"Your tooth, indeed! What's the matter with your tooth?"</p>

<p>"One of them's loose, and it aches perfectly awful."</p>

<p>"There, there, now, don't begin that groaning again. Open your
mouth. Well&mdash;your tooth IS loose, but you're not going to
die about that. Mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire
out of the kitchen."</p>

<p>Tom said:</p>

<p>"Oh, please, auntie, don't pull it out. It don't hurt any
more. I wish I may never stir if it does. Please don't, auntie. I
don't want to stay home from school."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="06-063"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="06-063.jpg (54K)" src="06-063.jpg" height="516" width="367">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>"Oh, you don't, don't you? So all this row was because you
thought you'd get to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom,
Tom, I love you so, and you seem to try every way you can to
break my old heart with your outrageousness." By this time the
dental instruments were ready. The old lady made one end of the
silk thread fast to Tom's tooth with a loop and tied the other to
the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and suddenly
thrust it almost into the boy's face. The tooth hung dangling by
the bedpost, now.</p>

<p>But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to
school after breakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met
because the gap in his upper row of teeth enabled him to
expectorate in a new and admirable way. He gathered quite a
following of lads interested in the exhibition; and one that had
cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and homage up
to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,
and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a
disdain which he did not feel that it wasn't anything to spit
like Tom Sawyer; but another boy said, "Sour grapes!" and he
wandered away a dismantled hero.</p>

<p>Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village,
Huckleberry Finn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was
cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town,
because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad&mdash;and
because all their children admired him so, and delighted in his
forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like him. Tom was
like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied
Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict
orders not to play with him. So he played with him every time he
got a chance. Huckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off
clothes of full-grown men, and they were in perennial bloom and
fluttering with rags. His hat was a vast ruin with a wide
crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat, when he wore one, hung
nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the
back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of the
trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs
dragged in the dirt when not rolled up.</p>

<br><br>

<img alt="06-064.jpg (42K)" src="06-064.jpg" height="488" width="341">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on
doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did
not have to go to school or to church, or call any being master
or obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when and where
he chose, and stay as long as it suited him; nobody forbade him
to fight; he could sit up as late as he pleased; he was always
the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to
resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put on
clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything
that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every
harassed, hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>Tom hailed the romantic outcast:</p>

<p>"Hello, Huckleberry!"</p>

<p>"Hello yourself, and see how you like it."</p>

<p>"What's that you got?"</p>

<p>"Dead cat."</p>

<p>"Lemme see him, Huck. My, he's pretty stiff. Where'd you get
him ?"</p>

<p>"Bought him off'n a boy."</p>

<p>"What did you give?"</p>

<p>"I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the
slaughter-house."</p>

<p>"Where'd you get the blue ticket?"</p>

<p>"Bought it off'n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a
hoop-stick."</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;what is dead cats good for, Huck?"</p>

<p>"Good for? Cure warts with."</p>

<p>"No! Is that so? I know something that's better."</p>

<p>"I bet you don't. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Why, spunk-water."</p>

<p>"Spunk-water! I wouldn't give a dern for spunk-water."</p>

<p>"You wouldn't, wouldn't you? D'you ever try it?"</p>

<p>"No, I hain't. But Bob Tanner did."</p>

<p>"Who told you so!"</p>

<p>"Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and
Johnny told Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a
nigger, and the nigger told me. There now!"</p>

<p>"Well, what of it? They'll all lie. Leastways all but the
nigger. I don't know HIM. But I never see a nigger that WOULDN'T
lie. Shucks! Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck."</p>

<p>"Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the
rain-water was."</p>

<p>"In the daytime?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"With his face to the stump?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Least I reckon so."</p>

<p>"Did he say anything?"</p>

<p>"I don't reckon he did. I don't know."</p>

<p>"Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a
blame fool way as that! Why, that ain't a-going to do any good.
You got to go all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where
you know there's a spunk- water stump, and just as it's midnight
you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say:</p>

<p>'Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts, Spunk-water,
spunk-water, swaller these warts,'</p>

<p>and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut,
and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking
to anybody. Because if you speak the charm's busted."</p>

<p>"Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain't the way Bob
Tanner done."</p>

<p>"No, sir, you can bet he didn't, becuz he's the wartiest boy
in this town; and he wouldn't have a wart on him if he'd knowed
how to work spunk-water. I've took off thousands of warts off of
my hands that way, Huck. I play with frogs so much that I've
always got considerable many warts. Sometimes I take 'em off
with a bean."</p>

<p>"Yes, bean's good. I've done that."</p>

<p>"Have you? What's your way?"</p>

<p>"You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get
some blood, and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean
and take and dig a hole and bury it 'bout midnight at the
crossroads in the dark of the moon, and then you burn up the rest
of the bean. You see that piece that's got the blood on it will
keep drawing and drawing, trying to fetch the other piece to it,
and so that helps the blood to draw the wart, and pretty soon off
she comes."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it, Huck&mdash;that's it; though when you're
burying it if you say 'Down bean; off wart; come no more to
bother me!' it's better. That's the way Joe Harper does, and he's
been nearly to Coonville and most everywheres. But say&mdash;how
do you cure 'em with dead cats?"</p>

<p>"Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard 'long
about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried; and
when it's midnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but
you can't see 'em, you can only hear something like the wind, or
maybe hear 'em talk; and when they're taking that feller away,
you heave your cat after 'em and say, 'Devil follow corpse, cat
follow devil, warts follow cat, I'm done with ye!' That'll fetch
ANY wart."</p>

<p>"Sounds right. D'you ever try it, Huck?"</p>

<p>"No, but old Mother Hopkins told me."</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon it's so, then. Becuz they say she's a
witch."</p>

<p>"Say! Why, Tom, I KNOW she is. She witched pap. Pap says so
his own self. He come along one day, and he see she was
a-witching him, so he took up a rock, and if she hadn't dodged,
he'd a got her. Well, that very night he rolled off'n a shed
wher' he was a layin drunk, and broke his arm."</p>

<p>"Why, that's awful. How did he know she was a-witching
him?"</p>

<p>"Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at
you right stiddy, they're a-witching you. Specially if they
mumble. Becuz when they mumble they're saying the Lord's Prayer
backards."</p>

<p>"Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?"</p>

<p>"To-night. I reckon they'll come after old Hoss Williams
to-night."</p>

<p>"But they buried him Saturday. Didn't they get him Saturday
night?"</p>

<p>"Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till
midnight?&mdash;and THEN it's Sunday. Devils don't slosh around
much of a Sunday, I don't reckon."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that. That's so. Lemme go with you?"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;if you ain't afeard."</p>

<p>"Afeard! 'Tain't likely. Will you meow?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time,
you kep' me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks
at me and says 'Dern that cat!' and so I hove a brick through his
window&mdash;but don't you tell."</p>

<p>"I won't. I couldn't meow that night, becuz auntie was
watching me, but I'll meow this time. Say&mdash;what's that?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but a tick."</p>

<p>"Where'd you get him?"</p>

<p>"Out in the woods."</p>

<p>"What'll you take for him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't want to sell him."</p>

<p>"All right. It's a mighty small tick, anyway."</p>

<p>"Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don't belong to them.
I'm satisfied with it. It's a good enough tick for me."</p>

<p>"Sho, there's ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of 'em
if I wanted to."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't you? Becuz you know mighty well you can't.
This is a pretty early tick, I reckon. It's the first one I've
seen this year."</p>

<p>"Say, Huck&mdash;I'll give you my tooth for him."</p>

<p>"Less see it."</p>

<p>Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it.
Huckleberry viewed it wistfully. The temptation was very strong.
At last he said:</p>

<p>"Is it genuwyne?"</p>

<p>Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.</p>

<p>"Well, all right," said Huckleberry, "it's a trade."</p>

<p>Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had
lately been the pinchbug's prison, and the boys separated, each
feeling wealthier than before.</p>

<p>When Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he
strode in briskly, with the manner of one who had come with all
honest speed. He hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his
seat with business-like alacrity. The master, throned on high
in his great splint-bottom arm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the
drowsy hum of study. The interruption roused him.</p>

<p>"Thomas Sawyer!"</p>

<p>Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant
trouble.</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>"Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as
usual?"</p>

<p>Tom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long
tails of yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by
the electric sympathy of love; and by that form was THE ONLY
VACANT PLACE on the girls' side of the school-house. He instantly
said:</p>

<p>"I STOPPED TO TALK WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINN!"</p>

<p>The master's pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The
buzz of study ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy
had lost his mind. The master said:</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you did what?"</p>

<p>"Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn."</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the words.</p>

<p>"Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have
ever listened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence.
Take off your jacket."</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>The master's arm performed until it was tired and the stock of
switches notably diminished. Then the order followed:</p>

<p>"Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a
warning to you."</p>

<p>The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the
boy, but in reality that result was caused rather more by his
worshipful awe of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that
lay in his high good fortune. He sat down upon the end of the
pine bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss
of her head. Nudges and winks and whispers traversed the room,
but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the long, low desk before
him, and seemed to study his book.</p>

<p>By and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed
school murmur rose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy
began to steal furtive glances at the girl. She observed it,
"made a mouth" at him and gave him the back of her head for the
space of a minute. When she cautiously faced around again, a
peach lay before her. She thrust it away. Tom gently put it back.
She thrust it away again, but with less animosity. Tom patiently
returned it to its place. Then she let it remain. Tom scrawled on
his slate, "Please take it&mdash;I got more." The girl glanced at
the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw something
on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time the
girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began
to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked
on, apparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of
non-committal attempt to see, but the boy did not betray that he
was aware of it. At last she gave in and hesitatingly
whispered:</p>

<p>"Let me see it."</p>

<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two
gable ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the
chimney. Then the girl's interest began to fasten itself upon the
work and she forgot everything else. When it was finished, she
gazed a moment, then whispered:</p>

<p>"It's nice&mdash;make a man."</p>

<p>The artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a
derrick. He could have stepped over the house; but the girl was
not hypercritical; she was satisfied with the monster, and
whispered:</p>

<p>"It's a beautiful man&mdash;now make me coming along."</p>

<p>Tom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it
and armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl
said:</p>

<p>"It's ever so nice&mdash;I wish I could draw."</p>

<p>"It's easy," whispered Tom, "I'll learn you."</p>

<p>"Oh, will you? When?"</p>

<p>"At noon. Do you go home to dinner?"</p>

<p>"I'll stay if you will."</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;that's a whack. What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Becky Thatcher. What's yours? Oh, I know. It's Thomas
Sawyer."</p>

<p>"That's the name they lick me by. I'm Tom when I'm good. You
call me Tom, will you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the
words from the girl. But she was not backward this time. She
begged to see. Tom said:</p>

<p>"Oh, it ain't anything."</p>

<p>"Yes it is."</p>

<p>"No it ain't. You don't want to see."</p>

<p>"Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me."</p>

<p>"You'll tell."</p>

<p>"No I won't&mdash;deed and deed and double deed won't."</p>

<p>"You won't tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you
live?"</p>

<p>"No, I won't ever tell ANYbody. Now let me."</p>

<p>"Oh, YOU don't want to see!"</p>

<p>"Now that you treat me so, I WILL see." And she put her small
hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to
resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these
words were revealed: "I LOVE YOU."</p>

<p>"Oh, you bad thing!" And she hit his hand a smart rap, but
reddened and looked pleased, nevertheless.</p>

<p>Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip
closing on his ear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that vise he
was borne across the house and deposited in his own seat, under
a peppering fire of giggles from the whole school. Then the
master stood over him during a few awful moments, and finally
moved away to his throne without saying a word. But although
Tom's ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.</p>

<p>As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study,
but the turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his
place in the reading class and made a botch of it; then in the
geography class and turned lakes into mountains, mountains into
rivers, and rivers into continents, till chaos was come again;
then in the spelling class, and got "turned down," by a
succession of mere baby words, till he brought up at the foot and
yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with ostentation
for months.</p>

<p>THE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more
his ideas wandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave
it up. It seemed to him that the noon recess would never come.
The air was utterly dead. There was not a breath stirring. It was
the sleepiest of sleepy days. The drowsing murmur of the five and
twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is
in the murmur of bees. Away off in the flaming sunshine, Cardiff
Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of
heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds floated on
lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible but
some cows, and they were asleep. Tom's heart ached to be free, or
else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.
His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow
of gratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then
furtively the percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick
and put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowed
with a gratitude that amounted to prayer, too, at this moment,
but it was premature: for when he started thankfully to travel
off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new
direction.</p>

<p>Tom's bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had
been, and now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this
entertainment in an instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper.
The two boys were sworn friends all the week, and embattled
enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a pin out of his lapel and began
to assist in exercising the prisoner. The sport grew in interest
momently. Soon Tom said that they were interfering with each
other, and neither getting the fullest benefit of the tick. So he
put Joe's slate on the desk and drew a line down the middle of it
from top to bottom.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "as long as he is on your side you can stir
him up and I'll let him alone; but if you let him get away and
get on my side, you're to leave him alone as long as I can keep
him from crossing over."</p>

<p>"All right, go ahead; start him up."</p>

<p>The tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator.
Joe harassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back
again. This change of base occurred often. While one boy was
worrying the tick with absorbing interest, the other would look
on with interest as strong, the two heads bowed together over the
slate, and the two souls dead to all things else. At last luck
seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The tick tried this, that,
and the other course, and got as excited and as anxious as the
boys themselves, but time and again just as he would have victory
in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom's fingers would be
twitching to begin, Joe's pin would deftly head him off, and keep
possession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation
was too strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin.
Joe was angry in a moment. Said he:</p>

<p>"Tom, you let him alone."</p>

<p>"I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe."</p>

<p>"No, sir, it ain't fair; you just let him alone."</p>

<p>"Blame it, I ain't going to stir him much."</p>

<p>"Let him alone, I tell you."</p>

<p>"I won't!"</p>

<p>"You shall&mdash;he's on my side of the line."</p>

<p>"Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?"</p>

<p>"I don't care whose tick he is&mdash;he's on my side of the
line, and you sha'n't touch him."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll just bet I will, though. He's my tick and I'll do
what I blame please with him, or die!"</p>

<p>A tremendous whack came down on Tom's shoulders, and its
duplicate on Joe's; and for the space of two minutes the dust
continued to fly from the two jackets and the whole school to
enjoy it. The boys had been too absorbed to notice the hush that
had stolen upon the school awhile before when the master came
tiptoeing down the room and stood over them. He had contemplated
a good part of the performance before he contributed his bit of
variety to it.</p>

<p>When school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and
whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>"Put on your bonnet and let on you're going home; and when you
get to the corner, give the rest of 'em the slip, and turn down
through the lane and come back. I'll go the other way and come it
over 'em the same way."</p>

<p>So the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other
with another. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the
lane, and when they reached the school they had it all to
themselves. Then they sat together, with a slate before them, and
Tom gave Becky the pencil and held her hand in his, guiding it,
and so created another surprising house. When the interest in art
began to wane, the two fell to talking. Tom was swimming in
bliss. He said:</p>

<p>"Do you love rats?"</p>

<p>"No! I hate them!"</p>

<p>"Well, I do, too&mdash;LIVE ones. But I mean dead ones, to
swing round your head with a string."</p>

<p>"No, I don't care for rats much, anyway. What I like is
chewing-gum."</p>

<p>"Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now."</p>

<p>"Do you? I've got some. I'll let you chew it awhile, but you
must give it back to me."</p>

<p>That was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled
their legs against the bench in excess of contentment.</p>

<p>"Was you ever at a circus?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"Yes, and my pa's going to take me again some time, if I'm
good."</p>

<p>"I been to the circus three or four times&mdash;lots of times.
Church ain't shucks to a circus. There's things going on at a
circus all the time. I'm going to be a clown in a circus when I
grow up."</p>

<p>"Oh, are you! That will be nice. They're so lovely, all
spotted up."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so. And they get slathers of money&mdash;most a
dollar a day, Ben Rogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever
engaged?"</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Why, engaged to be married."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Would you like to?"</p>

<p>"I reckon so. I don't know. What is it like?"</p>

<p>"Like? Why it ain't like anything. You only just tell a boy
you won't ever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you
kiss and that's all. Anybody can do it."</p>

<p>"Kiss? What do you kiss for?"</p>

<p>"Why, that, you know, is to&mdash;well, they always do
that."</p>

<p>"Everybody?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, everybody that's in love with each other. Do you
remember what I wrote on the slate?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"I sha'n't tell you."</p>

<p>"Shall I tell YOU?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;yes&mdash;but some other time."</p>

<p>"No, now."</p>

<p>"No, not now&mdash;to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, NOW. Please, Becky&mdash;I'll whisper it, I'll
whisper it ever so easy."</p>

<p>Becky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his
arm about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with
his mouth close to her ear. And then he added:</p>

<p>"Now you whisper it to me&mdash;just the same."</p>

<p>She resisted, for a while, and then said:</p>

<p>"You turn your face away so you can't see, and then I will.
But you mustn't ever tell anybody&mdash;WILL you, Tom? Now you
won't, WILL you?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, indeed I won't. Now, Becky."</p>

<p>He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her
breath stirred his curls and whispered,
"I&mdash;love&mdash;you!"</p>

<p>Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and
benches, with Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last,
with her little white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about
her neck and pleaded:</p>

<p>"Now, Becky, it's all done&mdash;all over but the kiss. Don't
you be afraid of that&mdash;it ain't anything at all. Please,
Becky." And he tugged at her apron and the hands.</p>

<p>By and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all
glowing with the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the
red lips and said:</p>

<p>"Now it's all done, Becky. And always after this, you know,
you ain't ever to love anybody but me, and you ain't ever to
marry anybody but me, ever never and forever. Will you?"</p>

<p>"No, I'll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I'll never
marry anybody but you&mdash;and you ain't to ever marry anybody
but me, either."</p>

<p>"Certainly. Of course. That's PART of it. And always coming to
school or when we're going home, you're to walk with me, when
there ain't anybody looking&mdash;and you choose me and I choose
you at parties, because that's the way you do when you're
engaged."</p>

<p>"It's so nice. I never heard of it before."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence&mdash;"</p>

<p>The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped,
confused.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom! Then I ain't the first you've ever been engaged
to!"</p>

<p>The child began to cry. Tom said:</p>

<p>"Oh, don't cry, Becky, I don't care for her any more."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do, Tom&mdash;you know you do."</p>

<p>Tom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him
away and turned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom
tried again, with soothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed
again. Then his pride was up, and he strode away and went
outside. He stood about, restless and uneasy, for a while,
glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping she would repent
and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began to feel
badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle
with him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it
and entered. She was still standing back there in the corner,
sobbing, with her face to the wall. Tom's heart smote him. He
went to her and stood a moment, not knowing exactly how to
proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:</p>

<p>"Becky, I&mdash;I don't care for anybody but you."</p>

<p>No reply&mdash;but sobs.</p>

<p>"Becky"&mdash;pleadingly. "Becky, won't you say
something?"</p>

<p>More sobs.</p>

<p>Tom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of
an andiron, and passed it around her so that she could see it,
and said:</p>

<p>"Please, Becky, won't you take it?"</p>

<p>She struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house
and over the hills and far away, to return to school no more that
day. Presently Becky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he
was not in sight; she flew around to the play-yard; he was not
there. Then she called:</p>

<p>"Tom! Come back, Tom!"</p>

<p>She listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no
companions but silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry
again and upbraid herself; and by this time the scholars began to
gather again, and she had to hide her griefs and still her broken
heart and take up the cross of a long, dreary, aching afternoon,
with none among the strangers about her to exchange sorrows
with.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

will be made and fund raising will begin in the additional states.
Please feel free to ask to check the status of your state.

In answer to various questions we have received on this:

We are constantly working on finishing the paperwork to legally
request donations in all 50 states.  If your state is not listed and
you would like to know if we have added it since the list you have,
just ask.

While we cannot solicit donations from people in states where we are
not yet registered, we know of no prohibition against accepting
donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

International donations are accepted, but we don't know ANYTHING about
how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Donations by check or money order may be sent to:

Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

**The Legal Small Print**


(Three Pages)

***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN EBOOKS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
and its trustees and agents, and any volunteers associated
with the production and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm

     periodic) tax return.  Please contact us beforehand to
