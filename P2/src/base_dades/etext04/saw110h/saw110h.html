<center><h2>PREFACE</h2></center>
<br>
<p>Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred;
one or two were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who
were schoolmates of mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom
Sawyer also, but not from an individual&mdash;he is a combination
of the characteristics of three boys whom I knew, and therefore
belongs to the composite order of architecture.</p>

<p>The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among
children and slaves in the West at the period of this
story&mdash;that is to say, thirty or forty years ago.</p>

<p>Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of
boys and girls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on
that account, for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly
remind adults of what they once were themselves, and of how they
felt and thought and talked, and what queer enterprises they
sometimes engaged in.</p>

<p>"TOM!"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"TOM!"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"What's gone with that boy,  I wonder? You TOM!"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them
about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them.
She seldom or never looked THROUGH them for so small a thing as a
boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were
built for "style," not service&mdash;she could have seen through
a pair of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a
moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for
the furniture to hear:</p>

<p>"Well, I lay if I get hold of you I'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>She did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and
punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath
to punctuate the punches with. She resurrected nothing but the
cat.</p>

<p>"I never did see the beat of that boy!"</p>

<p>She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among
the tomato vines and "jimpson" weeds that constituted the garden.
No Tom. So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for
distance and shouted:</p>

<p>"Y-o-u-u TOM!"</p>

<p>There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in
time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and
arrest his flight.</p>

<p>"There! I might 'a' thought of that closet. What you been
doing in there?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What IS
that truck?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, aunt."</p>

<p>"Well, I know. It's jam&mdash;that's what it is. Forty times
I've said if you didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you. Hand me
that switch."</p>

<p>The switch hovered in the air&mdash;the peril was
desperate&mdash;</p>

<p>"My! Look behind you, aunt!"</p>

<p>The old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of
danger. The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high
board-fence, and disappeared over it.</p>

<p>His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a
gentle laugh.</p>

<p>"Hang the boy, can't I never learn anything? Ain't he played
me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by
this time? But old fools is the biggest fools there is. Can't
learn an old dog new tricks, as the saying is. But my goodness,
he never plays them alike, two days, and how is a body to know
what's coming? He 'pears to know just how long he can torment me
before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put
me off for a minute or make me laugh, it's all down again and I
can't hit him a lick. I ain't doing my duty by that boy, and
that's the Lord's truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile
the child, as the Good Book says. I'm a laying up sin and
suffering for us both, I know. He's full of the Old Scratch, but
laws-a-me! he's my own dead sister's boy, poor thing, and I ain't
got the heart to lash him, somehow. Every time I let him off,
my conscience does hurt me so, and every time I hit him my old
heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is born of woman is of
few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says, and I reckon
it's so. He'll play hookey this evening, * and [* Southwestern
for "afternoon"] I'll just be obleeged to make him work,
tomorrow, to punish him. It's mighty hard to make him work
Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work
more than he hates anything else, and I've GOT to do some of my
duty by him, or I'll be the ruination of the child."</p>

<p>Tom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back
home barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw
next-day's wood and split the kindlings before supper&mdash;at
least he was there in time to tell his adventures to Jim while
Jim did three-fourths of the work. Tom's younger brother (or
rather half-brother) Sid was already through with his part of the
work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, and had no
adventurous, trouble-some ways.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>While Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as
opportunity offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were
full of guile, and very deep&mdash;for she wanted to trap him
into damaging revealments. Like many other simple-hearted souls,
it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent
for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate
her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning. Said
she:</p>

<p>"Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"Powerful warm, warn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>"Didn't you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?"</p>

<p>A bit of a scare shot through Tom&mdash;a touch of
uncomfortable suspicion. He searched Aunt Polly's face, but it
told him nothing. So he said:</p>

<p>"No'm&mdash;well, not very much."</p>

<p>The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt, and
said:</p>

<p>"But you ain't too warm now, though." And it flattered her to
reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without
anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind. But in
spite of her, Tom knew where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled
what might be the next move:</p>

<p>"Some of us pumped on our heads&mdash;mine's damp yet.
See?"</p>

<p>Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of
circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new
inspiration:</p>

<p>"Tom, you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed
it, to pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!"</p>

<p>The trouble vanished out of Tom's face. He opened his jacket.
His shirt collar was securely sewed.</p>

<p>"Bother! Well, go 'long with you. I'd made sure you'd played
hookey and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon
you're a kind of a singed cat, as the saying is&mdash;better'n
you look. THIS time."</p>

<p>She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad
that Tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.</p>

<p>But Sidney said:</p>

<p>"Well, now, if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white
thread, but it's black."</p>

<p>"Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!"</p>

<p>But Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door
he said:</p>

<p>"Siddy, I'll lick you for that."</p>

<p>In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were
thrust into the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about
them&mdash;one needle carried white thread and the other black.
He said:</p>

<p>"She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid. Confound it!
sometimes she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with
black. I wish to gee-miny she'd stick to one or t'other&mdash;I
can't keep the run of 'em. But I bet you I'll lam Sid for that.
I'll learn him!"</p>

<p>He was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy
very well though&mdash;and loathed him.</p>

<p>Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his
troubles. Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and
bitter to him than a man's are to a man, but because a new and
powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind
for the time&mdash;just as men's misfortunes are forgotten in the
excitement of new enterprises. This new interest was a valued
novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from a negro,
and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed. It consisted in
a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by
touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals
in the midst of the music&mdash;the reader probably remembers how
to do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon
gave him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his
mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt
much as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new
planet&mdash;no doubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure
is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the
astronomer.</p>

<p>The summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently
Tom checked his whistle. A stranger was before him&mdash;a boy a
shade larger than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex
was an im-pressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of
St. Petersburg. This boy was well dressed, too&mdash;well dressed
on a week-day. This was simply as- tounding. His cap was a dainty
thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and
natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes on&mdash;and it
was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of ribbon.
He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom's vitals. The
more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up
his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own
outfit seemed to him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved,
the other moved&mdash;but only sidewise, in a circle; they kept
face to face and eye to eye all the time. Finally Tom said:</p>

<p>"I can lick you!"</p>

<p>"I'd like to see you try it."</p>

<p>"Well, I can do it."</p>

<p>"No you can't, either."</p>

<p>"Yes I can."</p>

<p>"No you can't."</p>

<p>"I can."</p>

<p>"You can't."</p>

<p>"Can!"</p>

<p>"Can't!"</p>

<p>An uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:</p>

<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"'Tisn't any of your business, maybe."</p>

<p>"Well I 'low I'll MAKE it my business."</p>

<p>"Well why don't you?"</p>

<p>"If you say much, I will."</p>

<p>"Much&mdash;much&mdash;MUCH. There now."</p>

<p>"Oh, you think you're mighty smart, DON'T you? I could lick
you with one hand tied behind me, if I wanted to."</p>

<p>"Well why don't you DO it? You SAY you can do it."</p>

<p>"Well I WILL, if you fool with me."</p>

<p>"Oh yes&mdash;I've seen whole families in the same fix."</p>

<p>"Smarty! You think you're SOME, now, DON'T you? Oh, what a
hat!"</p>

<p>"You can lump that hat if you don't like it. I dare you to
knock it off &mdash;and anybody that'll take a dare will suck
eggs."</p>

<p>"You're a liar!"</p>

<p>"You're another."</p>

<p>"You're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up."</p>

<p>"Aw&mdash;take a walk!"</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and
bounce a rock off'n your head."</p>

<p>"Oh, of COURSE you will."</p>

<p>"Well I WILL."</p>

<p>"Well why don't you DO it then? What do you keep SAYING you
will for? Why don't you DO it? It's because you're afraid."</p>

<p>"I AIN'T afraid."</p>

<p>"You are."</p>

<p>"I ain't."</p>

<p>"You are."</p>

<p>Another pause, and more eying and sidling around each other.
Presently they were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:</p>

<p>"Get away from here!"</p>

<p>"Go away yourself!"</p>

<p>"I won't."</p>

<p>"I won't either."</p>

<p>So they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace,
and both shoving with might and main, and glowering at each other
with hate. But neither could get an advantage. After struggling
till both were hot and flushed, each relaxed his strain with
watchful caution, and Tom said:</p>

<p>"You're a coward and a pup. I'll tell my big brother on you,
and he can thrash you with his little finger, and I'll make him
do it, too."</p>

<p>"What do I care for your big brother? I've got a brother
that's bigger than he is&mdash;and what's more, he can throw him
over that fence, too." [Both brothers were imaginary.]</p>

<p>"That's a lie."</p>

<p>"YOUR saying so don't make it so."</p>

<p>Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:</p>

<p>"I dare you to step over that, and I'll lick you till you
can't stand up. Anybody that'll take a dare will steal
sheep."</p>

<p>The new boy stepped over promptly, and said:</p>

<p>"Now you said you'd do it, now let's see you do it."</p>

<p>"Don't you crowd me now; you better look out."</p>

<p>"Well, you SAID you'd do it&mdash;why don't you do it?"</p>

<p>"By jingo! for two cents I WILL do it."</p>

<p>The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held
them out with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an
instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped
together like cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and
tore at each other's hair and clothes, punched and scratched each
other's nose, and covered themselves with dust and glory.
Presently the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle
Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with
his fists. "Holler 'nuff!" said he.</p>

<p>The boy only struggled to free himself. He was
crying&mdash;mainly from rage.</p>

<p>"Holler 'nuff!"&mdash;and the pounding went on.</p>

<p>At last the stranger got out a smothered "'Nuff!" and Tom let
him up and said:</p>

<p>"Now that'll learn you. Better look out who you're fooling
with next time."</p>

<p>The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes,
sobbing, snuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his
head and threatening what he would do to Tom the "next time he
caught him out." To which Tom responded with jeers, and started
off in high feather, and as soon as his back was turned the new
boy snatched up a stone, threw it and hit him between the
shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope. Tom
chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he lived. He
then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the enemy
to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through
the window and declined. At last the enemy's mother appeared, and
called Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So
he went away; but he said he "'lowed" to "lay" for that boy.</p>

<p>He got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed
cautiously in at the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the
person of his aunt; and when she saw the state his clothes were
in her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity at
hard labor became adamantine in its firmness.</p>

<p>SATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright
and fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every
heart; and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips.
There was cheer in every face and a spring in every step. The
locust-trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms
filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it,
was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem
a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.</p>

<p>Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a
long-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left
him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty
yards of board fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow,
and existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and
passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it
again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the
far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a
tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at the gate with a
tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from the town
pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but now
it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at
the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always
there waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings,
quarrelling, fighting, skylarking. And he remembered that
although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim
never got back with a bucket of water under an hour&mdash;and
even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:</p>

<p>"Say, Jim, I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some."</p>

<p>Jim shook his head and said:</p>

<p>"Can't, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an' git
dis water an' not stop foolin' roun' wid anybody. She say she
spec' Mars Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash, an' so she tole me go
'long an' 'tend to my own business&mdash;she 'lowed SHE'D 'tend
to de whitewashin'."</p>

<p>"Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That's the way she
always talks. Gimme the bucket&mdash;I won't be gone only a a
minute. SHE won't ever know."</p>

<p>"Oh, I dasn't, Mars Tom. Ole missis she'd take an' tar de head
off'n me. 'Deed she would."</p>

<p>"SHE! She never licks anybody&mdash;whacks 'em over the head
with her thimble&mdash;and who cares for that, I'd like to know.
She talks awful, but talk don't hurt&mdash;anyways it don't if
she don't cry. Jim, I'll give you a marvel. I'll give you a white
alley!"</p>

<p>Jim began to waver.</p>

<p>"White alley, Jim! And it's a bully taw."</p>

<p>"My! Dat's a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I's
powerful 'fraid ole missis&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And besides, if you will I'll show you my sore toe."</p>

<p>Jim was only human&mdash;this attraction was too much for him.
He put down his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe
with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound. In
another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a
tingling rear, Tom was whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly
was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and
triumph in her eye.</p>

<p>But Tom's energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he
had planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the
free boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious
expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of him for having
to work&mdash;the very thought of it burnt him like fire. He got
out his worldly wealth and examined it&mdash;bits of toys,
marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange of WORK, maybe, but
not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom.
So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and gave up
the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless
moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great,
magnificent inspiration.</p>

<p>He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers
hove in sight presently&mdash;the very boy, of all boys, whose
ridicule he had been dreading. Ben's gait was the
hop-skip-and-jump&mdash;proof enough that his heart was light and
his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and giving a
long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned
ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a
steamboat. As he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle
of the street, leaned far over to starboard and rounded to
ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance&mdash;for he
was personating the Big Missouri, and considered himself to be
drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and
engine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on
his own hurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:</p>

<p>"Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!" The headway ran almost out,
and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!" His arms straightened and
stiffened down his sides.</p>

<p>"Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow!
ch-chow-wow! Chow!" His right hand, mean-time, describing stately
circles&mdash;for it was representing a forty-foot wheel.</p>

<p>"Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling!
Chow-ch-chow-chow!" The left hand began to describe circles.</p>

<p>"Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come
ahead on the stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over
slow! Ting-a-ling- ling! Chow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line!
LIVELY now! Come&mdash;out with your spring-line&mdash;what're
you about there! Take a turn round that stump with the bight of
it! Stand by that stage, now&mdash;let her go! Done with the
engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH'T! S'H'T! SH'T!" (trying the
gauge-cocks).</p>

<p>Tom went on whitewashing&mdash;paid no attention to the
steamboat. Ben stared a moment and then said: "Hi-YI! YOU'RE up a
stump, ain't you!"</p>

<p>No answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an
artist, then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed
the result, as before. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom's
mouth watered for the apple, but he stuck to his work. Ben
said:</p>

<p>"Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?"</p>

<p>Tom wheeled suddenly and said:</p>

<p>"Why, it's you, Ben! I warn't noticing."</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;I'm going in a-swimming, I am. Don't you wish you
could? But of course you'd druther WORK&mdash;wouldn't you?
Course you would!"</p>

<p>Tom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:</p>

<p>"What do you call work?"</p>

<p>"Why, ain't THAT work?"</p>

<br><br>
<a name="02-030"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="02-030.jpg (170K)" src="02-030.jpg" height="1024" width="787">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>


<p>Tom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:</p>

<p>"Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain't. All I know, is, it
suits Tom Sawyer."</p>

<p>"Oh come, now, you don't mean to let on that you LIKE it?"</p>

<p>The brush continued to move.</p>

<p>"Like it? Well, I don't see why I oughtn't to like it. Does a
boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?"</p>

<p>That put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his
apple. Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth&mdash;stepped
back to note the effect&mdash;added a touch here and
there&mdash;criticised the effect again&mdash; Ben watching every
move and getting more and more interested, more and more
absorbed. Presently he said:</p>

<p>"Say, Tom, let ME whitewash a little."</p>

<p>Tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his
mind:</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;I reckon it wouldn't hardly do, Ben. You
see, Aunt Polly's awful particular about this fence&mdash;right
here on the street, you know &mdash;but if it was the back fence
I wouldn't mind and SHE wouldn't. Yes, she's awful particular
about this fence; it's got to be done very careful; I reckon
there ain't one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can
do it the way it's got to be done."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;is that so? Oh come, now&mdash;lemme just try. Only
just a little&mdash; I'd let YOU, if you was me, Tom."</p>

<p>"Ben, I'd like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly&mdash;well,
Jim wanted to do it, but she wouldn't let him; Sid wanted to do
it, and she wouldn't let Sid. Now don't you see how I'm fixed? If
you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try.
Say&mdash;I'll give you the core of my apple."</p>

<p>"Well, here&mdash;No, Ben, now don't. I'm afeard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll give you ALL of it!"</p>

<p>Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but
alacrity in his heart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri
worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel
in the shade close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple, and
planned the slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of
material; boys happened along every little while; they came to
jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was fagged out,
Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite, in
good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in for
a dead rat and a string to swing it with&mdash;and so on, and so
on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came,
from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was
literally rolling in wealth. He had besides the things before
mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a jews-harp, a piece of blue
bottle-glass to look through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn't
unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper of a
decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six fire-crackers,
a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a dog-collar&mdash;
but no dog&mdash;the handle of a knife, four pieces
of orange-peel, and a dilapidated old window sash.</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>He had had a nice, good, idle time all the while&mdash;plenty
of company&mdash; and the fence had three coats of whitewash on
it! If he hadn't run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted
every boy in the village.</p>

<p>Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after
all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without
knowing it&mdash; namely, that in order to make a man or a boy
covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult
to attain. If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the
writer of this book, he would now have comprehended that Work
consists of whatever a body is OBLIGED to do, and that Play
consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And this would
help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or
performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or
climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy
gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches
twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because
the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were
offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and
then they would resign.</p>

<p>The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had
taken place in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward
headquarters to report.</p>

<p>TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an
open window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,
breakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy
summer air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the
drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was
nodding over her knitting&mdash;for she had no company but the
cat, and it was asleep in her lap. Her spectacles were propped up
on her gray head for safety. She had thought that of course Tom
had deserted long ago, and she wondered at seeing him place
himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He said: "Mayn't
I go and play now, aunt?"</p>

<p>"What, a'ready? How much have you done?"</p>

<p>"It's all done, aunt."</p>

<p>"Tom, don't lie to me&mdash;I can't bear it."</p>

<p>"I ain't, aunt; it IS all done."</p>

<p>Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out
to see for herself; and she would have been content to find
twenty per cent. of Tom's statement true. When she found the
entire fence white-washed, and not only whitewashed but
elaborately coated and recoated, and even a streak added to the
ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She said:</p>

<p>"Well, I never! There's no getting round it, you can work when
you're a mind to, Tom." And then she diluted the compliment by
adding, "But it's powerful seldom you're a mind to, I'm bound to
say. Well, go 'long and play; but mind you get back some time in
a week, or I'll tan you."</p>

<p>She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that
she took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and
delivered it to him, along with an improving lecture upon the
added value and flavor a treat took to itself when it came
without sin through virtuous effort. And while she closed with a
happy Scriptural flourish, he "hooked" a doughnut.</p>

<p>Then he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside
stairway that led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods
were handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling. They
raged around Sid like a hail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could
collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue, six or
seven clods had taken personal effect, and Tom was over the fence
and gone. There was a gate, but as a general thing he was too
crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at peace, now
that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his black
thread and getting him into trouble.</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>
<p>Tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that
led by the back of his aunt's cow-stable. He presently got safely
beyond the reach of capture and punishment, and hastened toward
the public square of the village, where two "military" companies
of boys had met for conflict, according to previous appointment.
Tom was General of one of these armies, Joe Harper (a bosom
friend) General of the other. These two great commanders did not
condescend to fight in person&mdash;that being better suited to
the still smaller fry&mdash;but sat together on an eminence and
conducted the field operations by orders delivered through
aides-de-camp. Tom's army won a great victory, after a long and
hard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners
exchanged, the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and
the day for the necessary battle appointed; after which the
armies fell into line and marched away, and Tom turned homeward
alone.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he
saw a new girl in the garden&mdash;a lovely little blue-eyed
creature with yellow hair plaited into two long-tails, white
summer frock and embroidered pan-talettes. The fresh-crowned hero
fell without firing a shot. A certain Amy Lawrence vanished out
of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind. He had
thought he loved her to distraction; he had regarded his passion
as adoration; and behold it was only a poor little evanescent
partiality. He had been months winning her; she had confessed
hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest boy
in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of
time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose
visit is done.</p>

<p>He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw
that she had discovered him; then he pretended he did not know
she was present, and began to "show off" in all sorts of absurd
boyish ways, in order to win her admiration. He kept up this
grotesque foolishness for some time; but by-and-by, while he was
in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances, he glanced
aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the
house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it, grieving, and
hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a moment on
the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great sigh
as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up, right
away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she
disappeared.</p>
<br><br>
<a name="03-036"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="03-036.jpg (43K)" src="03-036.jpg" height="485" width="325">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>
<p>The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the
flower, and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look
down street as if he had discovered something of interest going
on in that direction. Presently he picked up a straw and began
trying to balance it on his nose, with his head tilted far back;
and as he moved from side to side, in his efforts, he edged
nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his bare foot rested
upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped away with
the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a
minute&mdash;only while he could button the flower inside his
jacket, next his heart&mdash;or next his stomach, possibly, for
he was not much posted in anatomy, and not hypercritical,
anyway.</p>

<p>He returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall,
"showing off," as before; but the girl never exhibited herself
again, though Tom comforted himself a little with the hope that
she had been near some window, meantime, and been aware of his
attentions. Finally he strode home reluctantly, with his poor
head full of visions.</p>

<p>All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt
wondered "what had got into the child." He took a good scolding
about clodding Sid, and did not seem to mind it in the least. He
tried to steal sugar under his aunt's very nose, and got his
knuckles rapped for it. He said:</p>

<p>"Aunt, you don't whack Sid when he takes it."</p>

<p>"Well, Sid don't torment a body the way you do. You'd be
always into that sugar if I warn't watching you."</p>

<p>Presently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his
immunity, reached for the sugar-bowl&mdash;a sort of glorying
over Tom which was wellnigh unbearable. But Sid's fingers
slipped and the bowl dropped and broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In
such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent.
He said to himself that he would not speak a word, even when his
aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she asked who
did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be
nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model "catch it."
He was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold
himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck
discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles. He said
to himself, "Now it's coming!" And the next instant he was
sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted to strike
again when Tom cried out:</p>

<p>"Hold on, now, what 'er you belting ME for?&mdash;Sid broke
it!"</p>

<p>Aunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity.
But when she got her tongue again, she only said:</p>

<p>"Umf! Well, you didn't get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been
into some other audacious mischief when I wasn't around, like
enough."</p>

<br><br>
<a name="03-038"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="03-038.jpg (60K)" src="03-038.jpg" height="419" width="413">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>Then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say
something kind and loving; but she judged that this would be
construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong, and
discipline forbade that. So she kept silence, and went about her
affairs with a troubled heart. Tom sulked in a corner and exalted
his woes. He knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to
him, and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it. He
would hang out no signals, he would take notice of none. He knew
that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then, through a
film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured
himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him
beseeching one little forgiving word, but he would turn his face
to the wall, and die with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she
feel then? And he pictured himself brought home from the river,
dead, with his curls all wet, and his sore heart at rest. How she
would throw herself upon him, and how her tears would fall like
rain, and her lips pray God to give her back her boy and she
would never, never abuse him any more! But he would lie there
cold and white and make no sign&mdash;a poor little sufferer,
whose griefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with
the pathos of these dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he
was so like to choke; and his eyes swam in a blur of water, which
overflowed when he winked, and ran down and trickled from the end
of his nose. And such a luxury to him was this petting of his
sorrows, that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or
any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too sacred for such
contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced in, all
alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit
of one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and
darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at
the other.</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<p>He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought
desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft
in the river invited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge
and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the
while, that he could only be drowned, all at once and
unconsciously, without undergoing the uncomfortable routine
devised by nature. Then he thought of his flower. He got it out,
rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal
felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would
she cry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his
neck and comfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the
hollow world? This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable
suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and
set it up in new and varied lights, till he wore it threadbare.
At last he rose up sighing and departed in the darkness.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="03-039b"></a>
<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>About half-past nine or ten o'clock he came along the deserted
street to where the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no
sound fell upon his listening ear; a candle was casting a dull
glow upon the curtain of a second-story window. Was the sacred
presence there? He climbed the fence, threaded his stealthy way
through the plants, till he stood under that window; he looked up
at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him down on the ground
under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his hands
clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower. And
thus he would die&mdash;out in the cold world, with no shelter
over his homeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps
from his brow, no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the
great agony came. And thus SHE would see him when she looked out
upon the glad morning, and oh! would she drop one little tear
upon his poor, lifeless form, would she heave one little sigh to
see a bright young life so rudely blighted, so untimely cut
down?</p>

<p>The window went up, a maid-servant's discordant voice profaned
the holy calm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr's
remains!</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>

<p>The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There
was a whiz as of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of
a curse, a sound as of shivering glass followed, and a small,
vague form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom.</p>

<p>Not long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying
his drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up;
but if he had any dim idea of making any "references to
allusions," he thought better of it and held his peace, for there
was danger in Tom's eye.</p>

<p>Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid
made mental note of the omission.</p>

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

donations from donors in these states who approach us with an offer to
donate.

how to make them tax-deductible, or even if they CAN be made
deductible, and don't have the staff to handle it even if there are
ways.

Why is this "Small Print!" statement here? You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this eBook, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault. So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you. It also tells you how
you may distribute copies of this eBook if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS EBOOK
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
eBook, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement. If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this eBook by

you got it from. If you received this eBook on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] Michael Hart and the Foundation (and any other party you may
receive this eBook from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook) disclaims
all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this eBook within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from. If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy. If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS EBOOK IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS". NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE EBOOK OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold Michael Hart, the Foundation,
