<br>
<p class="first">On the following morning, after receiving the
usual presents from the Lamas of Dholing, and from a large posse of
women belonging to the village of Barphiung, close by, we ascended
the Raklang pass, which crosses the range dividing the waters of
the Teesta from those of the Great Rungeet. The Kajee still kept
beside me, and proved a lively companion: seeing me continually
plucking and noting plants, he gave me much local information about
them. He told me the uses made of the fibres of the various
nettles; some being twisted for bowstrings, others as a thread for
sewing and weaving; while many are eaten raw and in soups,
especially the numerous little succulent species. The great
yellow-flowered <i>Begonia</i> was abundant, and he cut its juicy
stalks to make sauce (as we do apple-sauce) for some pork which he
expected to get at Bhomsong; the taste</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 293">[ 293 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">is acid and very pleasant. The large succulent
fern, called <i>Botrychium,</i>* grew here plentifully; it is
boiled and eaten, both here and in New Zealand. Ferns are more
commonly used for food than is supposed. In Calcutta the Hindoos
boil young tops of a <i>Polypodium</i> with their shrimp curries;
and both in Sikkim and Nepal the watery tubers of an <i>
Aspidium</i> are abundantly eaten. So also the pulp of one
tree-fern affords food, but only in times of scarcity, as does that
of another species in New Zealand (<i>Cyathea medullaris</i>): the
pith of all is composed of a coarse sago, that is to say, of
cellular tissue with starch granules.</p>

<p>A thick forest of Dorjiling vegetation covers the summit, which
is only 6,800 feet above the sea: it is a saddle, connecting the
lofty mountain of Mainom (alt. 11,000 feet) to the north, with
Tendong (alt. 8,663 feet) to the south. Both these mountains are on
a range which is continuous with Kinchinjunga, projecting from it
down into the very heart of Sikkim. A considerable stand was made
here by the Lepchas during the Nepal war in 1787; they defended the
pass with their arrows for some hours, and then retired towards the
Teesta, making a second stand lower down, at a place pointed out to
me, where rocks on either side gave them the same advantages. The
Nepalese, however, advanced to the Teesta, and then retired with
little loss.</p>

<p>Unfortunately a thick mist and heavy rain cut off all view of
the Teesta valley, and the mountains of Chola to the eastward;
which I much regretted.</p>

<p>Descending by a very steep, slippery path, we came to a</p>

<p class="fnote">* <i>Botrychium Virginicum,</i> Linn. This fern is
eaten abundantly by the New Zealanders: its distribution is most
remarkable, being found very rarely indeed in Europe, and in Norway
only. It abounds in many parts of the Southern United States, the
Andes of Mexico, etc., in the Himalaya mountains, Australia, and
New Zealand.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 294">[ 294 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">fine mass of slaty gneiss, thirty feet long and
thirteen feet high; not <i>in situ,</i> but lying on the mountain
side: on its sloping face was carved in enormous characters,
&ldquo;Om Mani Padmi om&rdquo;; of which letters the top-strokes
afford an uncertain footing to the enthusiast who is willing to
purchase a good metempsychosis by walking along the slope, with his
heels or toes in their cavities. A small inscription in one corner
is said to imply that this was the work of a pious monk of Raklang;
and the stone is called &ldquo;Do-mani,&rdquo; literally,
&ldquo;stone of prayer.&rdquo;</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images/fig30.jpg" width="304" height="246" alt=
"Do-mani stone"></center>

<p>The rocks and peaks of Mainom are said to overhang the descent
here with grandeur; but the continued rain hid everything but a
curious shivered peak, apparently of chlorite schist, which was
close by, and reflected a green colour it is of course reported to
be of turquoise, and inaccessible.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 295">[ 295 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Descending, the rocks became more micaceous, with
broad seams of pipe-clay, originating in decomposed beds of
felspathic gneiss: the natives used this to whitewash and mortar
their temples.</p>

<p>I passed the monastery of Neongong, the monks of which were
building a new temple; and came to bring me a large present. Below
it is a pretty little lake, about 100 yards across, fringed with
brushwood. We camped at the village of Nampok, 4,370 feet above the
sea; all thoroughly sodden with rain.</p>

<p>During the night much snow had fallen at and above 9000 feet,
but the weather cleared on the following morning, and disclosed the
top of Mainom, rising close above my camp, in a series of rugged
shivered peaks, crested with pines, which looked like statues of
snow: to all other quarters this mountain presents a very gently
sloping outline. Up the Teesta valley there was a pretty peep of
snowy mountains, bearing north 35&deg; east, of no great
height.</p>

<p>I was met by a messenger from Dr. Campbell who told me he was
waiting breakfast; so I left my party, and, accompanied by the
Kajee and Meepo, hurried down to the valley of the Rungoon (which
flows east to the Teesta), through a fine forest of tropical trees;
passing the villages of Broom* and Lingo, to the spur of that name;
where I was met by a servant of the Sikkim Dewan&rsquo;s, with a
pony for my use. I stared at the animal, and felt inclined to ask
what he had to do here, where it was difficult enough</p>

<p class="fnote">* On the top of the ridge above Broom, a tall
stone is erected by the side of the path, covered with private
marks, indicating the height of various individuals who are
accustomed to measure themselves thus; there was but one mark above
5 feet 7 inches, and that was 6 inches higher. It turned out to be
Campbell&rsquo;s, who had passed a few days before, and was thus
proved to top the natives of Sikkim by a long way.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 296">[ 296 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">to walk up and down slippery slopes, amongst
boulders of rock, heavy forest, and foaming torrents; but I was
little aware of what these beasts could accomplish. The Tartar
saddle was imported from Tibet, and certainly a curiosity;
once&mdash;but a long time ago&mdash;it must have been very
handsome; it was high-peaked, covered with shagreen and silvered
ornaments, wretchedly girthed, and with great stirrups attached to
short leathers. The bridle and head-gear were much too complicated
for description; there were good leather, raw hide, hair-rope, and
scarlet worsted all brought into use; the bit was the ordinary
Asiatic one, jointed, and with two rings. I mounted on one side,
and at once rolled over, saddle and all, to the other; the pony
standing quite still. I preferred walking; but Dr. Campbell had
begged of me to use the pony, as the Dewan had procured and sent it
at great trouble: I, however, had it led till I was close to
Bhomsong, when I was hoisted into the saddle and balanced on it,
with my toes in the stirrups and my knees up to my breast; twice,
on the steep descent to the river, my saddle and I were thrown on
the pony&rsquo;s neck; in these awkward emergencies I was assisted
by a man on each side, who supported my weight on my elbows: they
seemed well accustomed to easing mounted ponies down hill without
giving the rider the trouble of dismounting. Thus I entered Dr.
Campbell&rsquo;s camp at Bhomsong, to the pride and delight of my
attendants; and received a hearty welcome from my old friend, who
covered me with congratulations on the successful issue of a
journey which, at this season, and under such difficulties and
discouragements, he had hardly thought feasible.</p>

<p>Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s tent was pitched in an orange-grove,
occupying a flat on the west bank of the Teesta, close to a small
enclosure of pine-apples, with a pomegranate tree in</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 297">[ 297 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the middle. The valley is very narrow, and the
vegetation wholly tropical, consisting of two species of oak,
several palms, rattan-cane (screw-pine), <i>Pandanus,</i> tall
grasses, and all the natives of dense hot jungles. The river is a
grand feature, broad, rocky, deep, swift, and broken by enormous
boulders of rock; its waters were of a pale opal green, probably
from the materials of the soft micaceous rocks through which it
flows.</p>

<p>A cane bridge crosses it,* but had been cut away (in feigned
distrust of us), and the long canes were streaming from their
attachments on either shore down the stream, and a triangular raft
of bamboo was plying instead, drawn to and fro by means of a strong
cane.</p>

<p>Soon after arriving I received a present from the Rajah,
consisting of a brick of Tibet tea, eighty pounds of rancid yak
butter, in large squares, done up in yak-hair cloth, three loads of
rice, and one of Murwa for beer; rolls of bread,&dagger; fowls,
eggs, dried plums, apricots, jujubes, currants, and Sultana
raisins, the latter fruits purchased at Lhassa, but imported
thither from western Tibet; also some trays of coarse milk-white
crystallised salt, as dug in Tibet.</p>

<p>In the evening we were visited by the Dewan, the head and front
of all our Sikkim difficulties, whose influence was paramount with
the Rajah, owing to the age and infirmities of the latter, and his
devotion to religion, which absorbed all his time and thoughts. The
Dewan was a good-looking Tibetan, very robust, fair, muscular and
well fleshed; he had a very broad Tartar face, quite free of hair;
a small and beautifully formed mouth and chin, very broad
cheekbones,</p>

<p class="fnote">* Whence the name of Bhomsong Samdong, the latter
word meaning bridge.<br>
&dagger; These rolls, or rather, sticks of bread, are made in
Tibet, of fine wheaten flour, and keep for a long time: they are
sweet and good, but very dirtily prepared.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 298">[ 298 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and a low, contracted forehead: his manners were
courteous and polite, but evidently affected, in assumption of
better breeding than he could in reality lay claim to. The Rajah
himself was a Tibetan of just respectable extraction, a native of
the Sokpo province, north of Lhassa: his Dewan was related to one
of his wives, and I believe a Lhassan by birth as well as
extraction, having probably also Kashmir blood in him.* Though
minister, he was neither financier nor politician, but a mere
plunderer of Sikkim, introducing his relations, and those whom he
calls so, into the best estates in the country, and trading in
great and small wares, from a Tibet pony to a tobacco pipe,
wholesale and retail. Neither he nor the Rajah are considered
worthy of notice by the best Tibet families or priests, or by the
Chinese commissioners settled in Lhassa and Jigatzi. The latter
regard Sikkim as virtually English, and are contented with knowing
that its ruler has no army, and with believing that its protectors,
the English, could not march an army across the Himalaya if they
would.</p>

<p>The Dewan, trading in wares which we could supply better and
cheaper, naturally regarded us with repugnance, and did everything
in his power to thwart Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s attempts to open a
friendly communication between the Sikkim and English governments.
The Rajah owed everything to us, and was, I believe, really
grateful; but he was a mere cipher in the hands of his minister.
The priests again, while rejoicing in our proximity, were
apathetic, and dreaded the more active Dewan; and the people had
long given evidence of their confidence in the English. Under these
circumstances it was in the hope of gaining the Rajah&rsquo;s own
ear, and representing to him the advantages</p>

<p class="fnote">* The Tibetans court promiscuous intercourse
between their families and the Kashmir merchants who traverse their
country.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 299">[ 299 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">of promoting an intercourse with us, and the
danger of continuing to violate the terms of our treaty, that Dr.
Campbell had been authorised by government to seek an interview
with His Highness. At present our relations were singularly
infelicitous. There was no agent on the Sikkim Rajah&rsquo;s part
to conduct business at Dorjiling, and the Dewan insisted on sending
a creature of his own, who had before been dismissed for insolence.
Malefactors who escaped into Sikkim were protected, and our police
interrupted in the discharge of their duties; slavery was
practised; and government communications were detained for weeks
and months under false pretences.</p>

<p>In his interviews with us the Dewan appeared to advantage: he
was fond of horses and shooting, and prided himself on his
hospitality. We gained much information from many conversations
with him, during which politics were never touched upon. Our
queries naturally referred to Tibet and its geography, especially
its great feature the Yarou Tsampoo river; this he assured us was
the Burrampooter of Assam, and that no one doubted it in that
country. Lhassa he described as a city in the bottom of a
flat-floored valley, surrounded by lofty snowy mountains: neither
grapes, tea, silk, or cotton are produced near it, but in the
Tartchi province of Tibet, one month&rsquo;s journey east of
Lhassa, rice, and a coarse kind of tea are both grown. Two
months&rsquo; journey north-east of Lhassa is Siling, the
well-known great commercial entrep&ocirc;t* in west China; and
there coarse silk is produced. All Tibet he described as
mountainous, and an inconceivably poor country: there are no
plains, save flats in the bottoms of the valleys, and the paths
lead over lofty mountains. Sometimes, when the inhabitants are
obliged from famine to change their habitations in winter, the
old</p>

<p class="fnote">* The entrep&ocirc;t is now removed to
Tang-Keou-Eul.&mdash;See Huc and Gabet.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 300">[ 300 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and feeble are frozen to death, standing and
resting their chins on their staves; remaining as pillars of ice,
to fall only when the thaw of the ensuing spring commences.</p>

<p>We remained several days at Bhomsong, awaiting an interview with
the Rajah, whose movements the Dewan kept shrouded in mystery. On
Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s arrival at this river a week before, he found
messengers waiting to inform him that the Rajah would meet him
here; this being half way between Dorjiling and Tumloong.
Thenceforward every subterfuge was resorted to by the Dewan to
frustrate the meeting; and even after the arrival of the Rajah on
the east bank, the Dewan communicated with Dr. Campbell by shooting
across the river arrows to which were attached letters, containing
every possible argument to induce him to return to Dorjiling; such
as that the Rajah was sick at Tumloong, that he was gone to Tibet,
that he had a religious fast and rites to perform, etc. etc.</p>

<p>One day we walked up the Teesta to the Rumphiup river, a torrent
from Mainom mountain to the west; the path led amongst thick jungle
of <i>Wallichia</i> palm, prickly rattan canes, and the <i>
Pandanus,</i> or screw-pine, called &ldquo;Borr,&rdquo; which has a
straight, often forked, palm-like trunk, and an immense crown of
grassy saw-edged leaves four feet long: it bears clusters of
uneatable fruit as large as a man&rsquo;s fist, and their
similarity to the pine-apple has suggested the name of
&ldquo;Borr&rdquo; for the latter fruit also, which has for many
years been cultivated in Sikkim, and yields indifferent produce.
Beautiful pink balsams covered the ground, but at this season few
other showy plants were in flower: the rocks were chlorite, very
soft and silvery, and so curiously crumpled and contorted as to
appear as though formed of scaled of mica crushed together,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 301">[ 301 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and confusedly arranged in layers: the strike was
north-west, and dip north-east from 60&deg; to 70&deg;.</p>

<p>Messengers from the Dewan overtook us at the river to announce
that the Rajah was prepared and waiting to give us a reception; so
we returned, and I borrowed a coat from Dr. Campbell instead of my
tattered shooting-jacket; and we crossed the river on the
bamboo-raft. As it is the custom on these occasions to exchange
presents, I was officially supplied with some red cloth and beads:
these, as well as Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s present, should only have
been delivered during or after the audience; but our wily friend
the Dewan here played us a very shabby trick; for he managed that
our presents should be stealthily brought in before our appearance,
thus giving to the by-standers the impression of our being
tributaries to his Highness!</p>

<p>The audience chamber was a mere roofed shed of neat bamboo
wattle, about twenty feet long: two Bhoteeas in scarlet jackets,
and with bows in their hands, stood on each side of the door, and
our own chairs were carried before us for our accommodation. Within
was a square wicker throne, six feet high, covered with purple
silk, brocaded with dragons in white and gold, and overhung by a
canopy of tattered blue silk, with which material part of the walls
also was covered. An oblong box (containing papers) with gilded
dragons on it, was placed on the stage or throne, and behind it was
perched cross-legged, an odd, black, insignificant looking old man,
with twinkling upturned eyes: he was swathed in yellow silk, and
wore on his head a pink silk hat with a flat broad crown, from all
sides of which hung floss silk. This was the Rajah, a genuine
Tibetan, about seventy years old. On some steps close by, and
ranged down the apartment, were his relations, all in brocaded silk
robes reaching from the throat to the ground,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 302">[ 302 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and girded about the waist; and wearing caps
similar to that of the Rajah. Kajees, counsellors, and shaven
mitred Lamas were there, to the number of twenty, all planted with
their backs to the wall, mute and motionless as statues. A few
spectators were huddled together at the lower end of the room, and
a monk waved about an incense pot containing burning juniper and
other odoriferous plants. Altogether the scene was solemn and
impressive: as Campbell well expressed it, the genius of Lamaism
reigned supreme.</p>

<p>We saluted, but received no complimentary return; our chairs
were then placed, and we seated ourselves, when the Dewan came in,
clad in a superb purple silk robe, worked with circular gold
figures, and formally presented us. The Dewan then stood; and as
the Rajah did not understand Hindoostanee, our conversation was
carried on through the medium of a little bare-headed rosy-cheeked
Lama, named &ldquo;Tchebu,&rdquo; clad in a scarlet gown, who acted
as interpreter. The conversation was short and constrained: Tchebu
was known as a devoted servant of the Rajah and of the heir
apparent; and in common with all the Lamas he hates the Dewan, and
desires a friendly intercourse between Sikkim and Dorjiling. He is,
further, the only servant of the Rajah capable of conversing both
in Hindoo and Tibetan, and the uneasy distrustful look of the
Dewan, who understands the latter language only, was very evident.
He was as anxious to hurry over the interview, as Dr. Campbell and
Tchebu were to protract it; it was clear, therefore, that nothing
satisfactory could be done under such auspices.</p>

<p>As a signal for departure white silk scarfs were thrown over our
shoulders, according to the established custom in Tibet, Sikkim,
and Bhotan; and presents were made to us of China silks, bricks of
tea, woollen cloths,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 303">[ 303 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">yaks, ponies, and salt, with worked silk purses
and fans for Mrs. Campbell; after which we left. The whole scene
was novel and very curious. We had had no previous idea of the
extreme poverty of the Rajah, of his utter ignorance of the usages
of Oriental life, and of his not having anyone near to instruct
him. The neglect of our salutation, and the conversion of our
presents into tribute, did not arise from any ill-will: it was
owing to the craft of the Dewan in taking advantage of the
Rajah&rsquo;s ignorance of his own position and of good manners.
Miserably poor, without any retinue, taking no interest in what
passes in his own kingdom, subsisting on the plainest and coarsest
food, passing his time in effectually abstracting his mind from the
consideration of earthly things, and wrapt in contemplation, the
Sikkim Rajah has arrived at great sanctity, and is all but prepared
for that absorption into the essence of Boodh, which is the end and
aim of all good Boodhists. The mute conduct of his Court, who
looked like attendants at an inquisition, and the profound
veneration expressed in every word and gesture of those who did
move and speak, recalled a Pekin reception. His attendants treated
him as a being of a very different nature from themselves; and well
might they do so, since they believe that he will never die, but
retire from the world only to re-appear under some equally sainted
form.</p>

<p>Though productive of no immediate good, our interview had a very
favourable effect on the Lamas and people, who had long wished it;
and the congratulations we received thereon during the remainder of
our stay in Sikkim were many and sincere. The Lamas we found
universally in high spirits; they having just effected the marriage
of the heir apparent, himself a Lama, said to possess much ability
and prudence, and hence being very obnoxious to the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 304">[ 304 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Dewan, who vehemently opposed the marriage. As,
however, the minister had established his influence over the
youngest, and estranged the Rajah from his eldest son, and was
moreover in a fair way for ruling Sikkim himself, the Church rose
in a body, procured a dispensation from Lhassa for the marriage of
a priest, and thus hoped to undermine the influence of the violent
and greedy stranger.</p>

<p>In the evening, we paid a farewell visit to the Dewan, whom we
found in a bamboo wicker-work hut, neatly hung with bows, arrows,
and round Lepcha shields of cane, each with a scarlet tuft of
yak-hair in the middle; there were also muskets, Tibetan arms, and
much horse gear; and at one end was a little altar, with cups,
bells, pastiles, and images. He was robed in a fawn-coloured silk
gown, lined with the softest of wool, that taken from unborn lambs:
like most Tibetans, he extracts all his beard with tweezers; an
operation he civilly recommended to me, accompanying the advice
with the present of a neat pair of steel forceps. He aspires to be
considered a man of taste, and plays the Tibetan guitar, on which
he performed some airs for our amusement: the instrument is
round-bodied and long-armed, with six strings placed in pairs, and
probably comes from Kashmir: the Tibetan airs were simple and quite
pretty, with the time well marked.</p>

<p>During our stay at Bhomsong, the weather was cool, considering
the low elevation (1,500 feet), and very steady; the mean
temperature was 52&middot;25&deg;, the maximum 71&middot;25&deg;,
the minimum 42&middot;75&deg;. The sun set behind the lofty
mountains at 3 p.m., and in the morning a thick, wet, white,
dripping fog settled in the bottom of the valley, and extended to
800 or 1000 feet above the river-bed; this was probably caused by
the descent of cold currents into the humid gorge: it was
dissipated soon after sunrise, but formed</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 305">[ 305 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">again at sunset for a few minutes, giving place to
clear starlight nights.</p>

<p>A thermometer sunk two feet seven inches, stood at 64&deg;. The
temperature of the water was pretty constant at 51&deg;: from here
to the plains of India the river has a nearly uniform fall of 1000
feet in sixty-nine miles, or sixteen feet to a mile: were its
course straight for the same distance, the fall would be 1000 feet
in forty miles, or twenty-five feet to a mile.</p>

<p>Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s object being accomplished, he was anxious
to make the best use of the few days that remained before his
return to Dorjiling, and we therefore arranged to ascend Mainom,
and visit the principal convents in Sikkim together, after which he
was to return south, whilst I should proceed north to explore the
south flank of Kinchinjunga. For the first day our route was that
by which I had arrived. We left on Christmas-day, accompanied by
two of the Rajah&rsquo;s, or rather Dewan&rsquo;s officers, of the
ranks of Dingpun and Soupun, answering to those of captain and
lieutenant; the titles were, however, nominal, the Rajah having no
soldiers, and these men being profoundly ignorant of the mysteries
of war or drill. They were splendid specimens of Sikkim Bhoteeas
(i.e. Tibetans, born in Sikkim, sometimes called Arrhats), tall,
powerful, and well built, but insolent and bullying: the Dingpun
wore the Lepcha knife, ornamented with turquoises, together with
Chinese chopsticks. Near Bhomsong, Campbell pointed out a hot bath
to me, which he had seen employed: it consisted of a hollowed
prostrate tree trunk, the water in which was heated by throwing in
hot stones with bamboo tongs. The temperature is thus raised to
114&deg;, to which the patient submits at repeated intervals for
several days, never leaving till wholly exhausted.</p>

<p class="first">These baths are called &ldquo;Sa-choo,&rdquo;
literally &ldquo;hot-water,&rdquo; in Tibetan.</p>

<p>We stopped to measure some splendid trees in the valley, and
found the trunk of one to be forty-five feet round the buttresses,
and thirty feet above them, a large size for the Himalaya: they
were a species of <i>Terminalia (Pentaptera),</i> and called by the
Lepchas &ldquo;Sillok-Kun,&rdquo; &ldquo;Kun&rdquo; meaning
tree.</p>

<p>We slept at Nampok, and the following morning commenced the
ascent. On the way we passed the temple and lake of Neongong; the
latter is about 400 yards round, and has no outlet. It contained
two English plants, the common duckweed (<i>Lemna minor</i>), and
<i>Potamogeton natans</i>: some coots were swimming in it, and
having flushed a woodcock, I sent for my gun, but the Lamas
implored us not to shoot, it being contrary to their creed to take
life wantonly.</p>

<p>We left a great part of our baggage at Neongong, as we intended
to return there; and took up with us bedding, food, etc., for two
days. A path hence up the mountain is frequented once a year by the
Lamas, who make a pilgrimage to the top for worship. The ascent was
very gradual for 4000 feet. We met with snow at the level of
Dorjiling (7000 feet), indicating a colder climate than at that
station, where none had fallen; the vegetation was, however,
similar, but not so rich, and at 8000 feet trees common also to the
top of Sinchul appeared, with <i>R. Hodgsoni,</i> and the beautiful
little winter-flowering primrose, <i>P. petiolaris,</i> whose
stemless flowers spread like broad purple stars on the deep green
foliage. Above, the path runs along the ridge of the precipices
facing the south-east, and here we caught a glimpse of the great
valley of the Ryott, beyond the Teesta, with Tumloong, the
Rajah&rsquo;s residence,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 307">[ 307 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">on its north flank, and the superb snowy peak of
Chola at its head.</p>

<p>One of our coolies, loaded with crockery and various
indispensables, had here a severe fall, and was much bruised; he
however recovered himself, but not our goods.</p>

<p>The rocks were all of chlorite slate, which is not usual at this
elevation; the strike was north-west, and dip north-east. At 9000
feet various shrubby rhododendrons prevailed, with mountain-ash,
birch, and dwarf-bamboo; also <i>R. Falconeri,</i> which grew from
forty to fifty feet high. The snow was deep and troublesome, so we
encamped at 9,800 feet, or 800 feet below the top, in a wood of <i>
Pyrus, Magnolia, Rhododendron,</i> and bamboo. As the ground was
deeply covered with snow, we laid our beds on a thick layer of
rhododendron twigs, bamboo, and masses of a pendent moss.</p>

<p>We passed a very cold night, chiefly owing to damp, the
temperature falling to 24&deg;. On the following morning we
scrambled through the snow, reaching the summit after an
hour&rsquo;s very laborious ascent, and took up our quarters in a
large wooden barn-like temple (<i>goompa</i>), built on a stone
platform. The summit was very broad, but the depth of the snow
prevented our exploring much, and the silver firs (<i>Abies
Webbiana</i>) were so tall, that no view could be obtained, except
from the temple. The great peak of Kinchinjunga is in part hidden
by those of Pundim and Nursing, but the panorama of snowy mountains
is very grand indeed. The effect is quite deceptive; the mountains
assuming the appearance of a continued chain, the distant snowy
peaks being seemingly at little further distance than the nearer
ones. The whole range (about twenty-two miles nearer than at
Dorjiling) appeared to rise uniformly and steeply out of black
pine</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 308">[ 308 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">forests, which were succeeded by the russet-brown
of the rhododendron shrubs, and that again by tremendous precipices
and gulleys, into which descended mighty glaciers and perpetual
snows. This excessive steepness is however only apparent, being due
to foreshortening.</p>

<p>The upper 10,000 feet of Kinchin, and the tops of Pundim, Kubra,
and Junnoo, are evidently of granite, and are rounded in outline:
the lower peaks again, as those of Nursing, etc., present rugged
pinnacles of black and red stratified rocks, in many cases resting
on white granite, to which they present a remarkable contrast. The
general appearance was as if Kinchin and the whole mass of
mountains clustered around it, had been up-heaved by white granite,
which still forms the loftiest summits, and has raised the black
stratified rocks in some places to 20,000 feet in numerous peaks
and ridges. One range presented on every summit a cap of black
stratified rocks of uniform inclination and dip, striking
north-west, with precipitous faces to the south-west: this was
clear to the naked eye, and more evident with the telescope, the
range in question being only fifteen miles distant, running between
Pundim and Nursing. The fact of the granite forming the greatest
elevation must not be hastily attributed to that igneous rock
having burst through the stratified, and been protruded beyond the
latter: it is much more probable that the upheaval of the granite
took place at a vast depth, and beneath an enormous pressure of
stratified rocks and perhaps of the ocean; since which period the
elevation of the whole mountain chain, and the denudation of the
stratified rocks, has been slowly proceeding.</p>

<p>To what extent denudation has thus lowered the peaks we dare
scarcely form a conjecture; but considering the number and variety
of the beds which in some places</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 309">[ 309 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">overlie the gneiss and granite, we may reasonably
conclude that many thousand feet have been removed.</p>

<p>It is further assumable that the stratified rocks originally
took the forms of great domes, or arches. The prevailing north-west
strike throughout the Himalaya vaguely indicates a general primary
arrangement of the curves into waves, whose crests run north-west
and south-cast; an arrangement which no minor or posterior forces
have wholly disturbed, though they have produced endless
dislocations, and especially a want of uniformity in the amount and
direction of the dip. Whether the loftiest waves were the result of
one great convulsion, or of a long-continued succession of small
ones, the effect would be the same, namely, that the strata over
those points at which the granite penetrated the highest, would be
the most dislocated, and the most exposed to wear during
denudation.</p>

<p>We enjoyed the view of this superb scenery till noon, when the
clouds which had obscured Dorjiling since morning were borne
towards us by the southerly wind, rapidly closing in the landscape
on all sides. At sunset they again broke, retreating from the
northward, and rising from Sinchul and Dorjiling last of all,
whilst a line of vapour, thrown by perspective into one narrow
band, seemed to belt the Singalelah range with a white girdle,
darkened to black where it crossed the snowy mountains; and it was
difficult to believe that this belt did not really hang upon the
ranges from twenty to thirty miles off, against which it was
projected; or that its true position was comparatively close to the
mountain on which we were standing, and was due to condensation
around its cool, broad, flat summit.</p>

<p>As usual from such elevations, sunset produced many beautiful
effects. The zenith was a deep blue, darkening</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 310">[ 310 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">opposite the setting sun, and paling over it into
a peach colour, and that again near the horizon passing into a
glowing orange-red, crossed by coppery streaks of cirrhus. Broad
beams of pale light shot from the sun to the meridian, crossing the
moon and the planet Venus. Far south, through gaps in the
mountains, the position of the plains of India, 10,000 feet below
us, was indicated by a deep leaden haze, fading upwards in
gradually paler bands (of which I counted fifteen) to the clear
yellow of the sunset sky. As darkness came on, the mists collected
around the top of Mainom, accumulating on the windward side, and
thrown off in ragged masses from the opposite.</p>

<p>The second night we passed here was fine, and not very cold (the
mean temperature being 27&deg; and we kept ourselves quite warm by
pine-wood fires. On the following morning the sun tinged the sky of
a lurid yellow-red: to the south-west, over the plains, the belts
of leaden vapour were fewer (twelve being distinguishable) and much
lower than on the previous evening, appearing as if depressed on
the visible horizon. Heavy masses of clouds nestled into all the
valleys, and filled up the larger ones, the mountain tops rising
above them like islands.</p>

<p>The height of our position I calculated to be 10,613 feet.
Colonel Waugh had determined that of the summit by trigonometry to
be 10,702 feet, which probably includes the trees which cover it,
or some rocky peaks on the broad and comparatively level
surface.</p>

<p>The mean temperature of the twenty-four hours was
32&middot;7&deg; (max. 41&middot;5&deg;/min. 27&middot;2&deg;),
mean dew-point 29&middot;7, and saturation 0&middot;82. The mercury
suddenly fell below the freezing point at sunset; and from early
morning the radiation was so powerful, that a thermometer exposed
on snow sank to 21&middot;2&deg;, and stood at 25&middot;5&deg;, at
10 a.m. The black bulb</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 311">[ 311 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">thermometer rose to 132&deg;, at 9 a.m. on the
27th, or 94&middot;2&deg; above the temperature of the air in the
shade. I did not then observe that of radiation from snow; but if,
as we may assume, it was not less than on the following morning
(21&middot;2&deg;), we shall have a difference of 148&middot;6&deg;
Fahr., in contiguous spots; the one exposed to the full effects of
the sun, the other to that of radiation through a rarefied medium
to a cloudless sky. On the 28th the black bulb thermometer, freely
suspended over the snow and exposed to the sun, rose to 108&deg;,
or 78&deg; above that of the air in the shade (32&deg;); the
radiating surface of the same snow in the shade being
21&middot;2&deg;, or 86&middot;8&deg; colder.</p>

<p>Having taken a complete set of angles and panoramic sketches
from the top of Mainom, with seventeen hourly observations, and
collected much information from our guides, we returned on the 28th
to our tents pitched by the temples at Neongong; descending 7000
feet, a very severe shake along Lepcha paths. In the evening the
Lamas visited us, with presents of rice, fowls, eggs, etc., and
begged subscriptions for their temple which was then building,
reminding Dr. Campbell that he and the Governor-General had an
ample share of their prayers, and benefited in proportion. As for
me, they said, I was bound to give alms, as I surely needed praying
for, seeing how I exposed myself; besides my having been the first
Englishman who had visited the snows of Kinchinjunga, the holiest
spot in Sikkim.</p>

<p>On the following morning we visited the unfinished temple. The
outer walls were of slabs of stone neatly chiselled, but badly
mortared with felspathic clay and pounded slate, instead of lime;
the partition walls were of clay, shaped in moulds of wood;
parallel planks, four feet asunder, being placed in the intended
position of the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 312">[ 312 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">walls, and left open above, the composition was
placed in these boxes, a little at a time, and rammed down by the
feet of many men, who walked round and round the narrow enclosure,
singing, and also using rammers of heavy wood. The outer work was
of good hard timber, of Magnolia (&ldquo;Pendre-kun&rdquo; of the
Lepchas) land oak (&ldquo;Sokka&rdquo;). The common
&ldquo;Ban,&rdquo; or Lepcha knife, supplied the place of axe, saw,
adze, and plane; and the graving work was executed with small
tools, chiefly on Toon (<i>Cedrela</i>), a very soft wood (the
&ldquo;Simal-kun&rdquo; of the Lepchas).</p>

<p>This being a festival day, when the natives were bringing
offerings to the altar, we also visited the old temple, a small
wooden building. Besides more substantial offerings, there were
little cones of rice with a round wafer of butter at the top,
ranged on the altar in order.* Six Lamas were at prayer, psalms,
and contemplation, sitting cross-legged on two small benches that
ran down the building: one was reading, with his hand and
fore-finger elevated, whilst the others listened; anon they all
sang hymns, repeated sacred or silly precepts to the bystanders, or
joined in a chorus with boys, who struck brass cymbals, and blew
straight copper trumpets six feet long, and conch-shells mounted
with broad silver wings, elegantly carved with dragons. There were
besides manis, or praying-cylinders, drums, gongs, books, and
trumpets made of human thigh-bones, plain or mounted in silver.</p>

<p class="fnote">* The worshippers, on entering, walk straight up
to the altar, and before, or after, having deposited their gifts,
they lift both hands to the forehead, fall on their knees, and
touch the ground three times with both head and hands, raising the
body a little between each prostration. They then advance to the
head Lama, kotow similarly to him, and he blesses them, laying both
hands on their heads and repeating a short formula. Sometimes the
dorje is used in blessing, as the cross is in Europe, and when a
mass of people request a benediction, the Lama pronounces it from
the door of the temple with outstretched arms, the people all being
prostrate, with their foreheads touching the ground.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 313">[ 313 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout Sikkim, we were roused each morning at daybreak by
this wild music, the convents being so numerous that we were always
within hearing of it. To me it was always deeply impressive,
sounding so foreign, and awakening me so effectually to the
strangeness of the wild land in which I was wandering, and of the
many new and striking objects it contained. After sleep, too,
during which the mind has either been at rest, or carried away to
more familiar subjects, the feelings of loneliness and sometimes
even of despondency, conjured up, by this solemn music, were often
almost oppressive.</p>

<p>Ascending from Neongong, we reached that pass from the Teesta to
the Great Rungeet, which I had crossed on the 22nd; and this time
we had a splendid view, down both the valleys, of the rivers, and
the many spars from the ridge communicating between Tendong and
Mainom, with many scattered villages and patches of cultivation.
Near the top I found a plant of &ldquo;Praong,&rdquo; (a small
bamboo), in full seed; this sends up many flowering branches from
the root, and but few leaf-bearing ones; and after maturing its
seed, and giving off suckers from the root, the parent plant dies.
The fruit is a dark, long grain, like rice; it is boiled and made
into cakes, or into beer, like Murwa.</p>

<p>Looking west from the summit, no fewer than ten monastic
establishments with their temples, villages and cultivation, were
at once visible, in the valley of the Great Rungeet, and in those
of its tributaries; namely, Changachelling, Raklang, Dholi, Molli,
Catsuperri, Dhoobdi, Sunnook, Powhungri, Pemiongchi and Tassiding,
all of considerable size, and more or less remarkable in their
sites, being perched on spurs or peaks at elevations varying from
3000 to 7000 feet, and commanding splendid prospects.</p>

<p>We encamped at Lingcham, where I had halted on</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 314">[ 314 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the 21st, and the weather being fine, I took
bearings of all the convents and mountains around. There is much
cultivation here, and many comparatively rich villages, all
occupying flat-shouldered spurs from Mainom. The houses are large,
and the yards are full of animals familiar to the eye but not to
the ear. The cows of Sikkim, though generally resembling the
English in stature, form, and colour, have humps, and grunt rather
than low; and the cocks wake the morning with a prolonged howling
screech, instead of the shrill crow of chanticleer.</p>

<p>Hence we descended north-west to the Great Rungeet, opposite
Tassiding; which is one of the oldest monastic establishments in
Sikkim, and one we were very anxious to visit. The descent lay
through a forest of tropical trees, where small palms, vines,
peppers, <i>Pandanus,</i> wild plantain, and <i>Pothos,</i> were
interlaced in an impenetrable jungle, and air-plants clothed the
trees.</p>
