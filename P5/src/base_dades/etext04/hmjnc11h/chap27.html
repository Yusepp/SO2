<br>
<p class="first">I was chiefly occupied during January and February
of 1850, in arranging and transmitting my collections to Calcutta,
and completing my manuscripts, maps, and surveys. My friend Dr.
Thomson having joined me here, for the purpose of our spending a
year in travelling and botanising together, it became necessary to
decide on the best field for our pursuits. Bhotan offered the most
novelty, but it was inaccessible to Europeans; and we therefore
turned our thoughts to Nepal, and failing that, to the Khasia
mountains.</p>

<p>The better to expedite our arrangements, I made a trip to
Calcutta in March, where I expected to meet both Lord Dalhousie, on
his return from the Straits of Malacca, and Jung Bahadoor (the
Nepalese minister), who was then <i>en route</i> as envoy to
England. I staid at Government House,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 243">[ 243 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">where every assistance was afforded me towards
obtaining the Nepal Rajah&rsquo;s permission to proceed through the
Himalaya from Dorjiling to Katmandu. Jung Bahadoor received me with
much courtesy, and expressed his great desire to serve me; but
begged me to wait until his return from England, as he could not be
answerable for my personal safety when travelling during his
absence; and he referred to the permission he had formerly given me
(and such was never before accorded to any European) in earnest of
his disposition, which was unaltered. We therefore determined upon
spending the season of 1850 in the Khasia mountains in eastern
Bengal, at the head of the great delta of the Ganges and
Burrampooter.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 244">[ 244 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I devoted a few days to the Calcutta Botanic Gardens, where I
found my kind friend Dr. Falconer established, and very busy. The
destruction of most of the palms, and of all the noble tropical
features of the gardens, during Dr. Griffith&rsquo;s incumbency,
had necessitated the replanting of the greater part of the grounds,
the obliteration of old walks, and the construction of new: it was
also necessary to fill up tanks whose waters, by injudicious
cuttings, were destroying some of the most valuable parts of the
land, to drain many acres, and to raise embankments to prevent the
encroachments of the Hoogly: the latter being a work attended with
great expense, now cripples the resources of the garden library,
and other valuable adjuncts; for the trees which were planted for
the purpose having been felled and sold, it became necessary to buy
timber at an exorbitant price.</p>

<p>The avenue of Cycas trees (<i>Cycas circinalis</i>), once the
admiration of all visitors, and which for beauty and singularity
was unmatched in any tropical garden, had been swept away by the
same unsparing hand which had destroyed the teak, mahogany, clove,
nutmeg, and cinnamon groves. In 1847, when I first visited the
establishment, nothing was to be seen of its former beauty and
grandeur, but a few noble trees or graceful palms rearing their
heads over a low ragged jungle, or spreading their broad leaves or
naked limbs over the forlorn hope of a botanical garden, that
consisted of open clay beds, disposed in concentric circles, and
baking into brick under the fervid heat of a Bengal sun.</p>

<p>The rapidity of growth is so great in this climate, that within
eight months from the commencement of the improvements, a great
change had already taken place. The grounds bore a park-like
appearance; broad shady</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 245">[ 245 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">walks had replaced the narrow winding paths that
ran in distorted lines over the ground, and a large Palmetum, or
collection of tall and graceful palms of various kinds, occupied
several acres at one side of the garden; whilst a still larger
portion of ground was being appropriated to a picturesque
assemblage of certain closely allied families of plants, whose
association promised to form a novel and attractive object of study
to the botanist, painter, and landscape gardener. This, which the
learned Director called in scientific language a
Thamno-Endogenarium, consists of groups of all kinds of bamboos,
tufted growing palms, rattan canes (<i>Calami</i>), <i>
Drac&aelig;n&aelig;,</i> plantains, screw-pines, (<i>Pandani</i>),
and such genera of tropical monocotyledonous plants. All are
evergreens of most vivid hue, some of which, having slender
trailing stems, form magnificent masses; others twine round one
another, and present impenetrable hillocks of green foliage; whilst
still others shoot out broad long wavy leaves from tufted roots;
and a fourth class is supported by aerial roots, diverging on all
sides and from all heights on the stems, every branch of which is
crowned with an enormous plume of grass-like leaves.*</p>

<p>The great <i>Amherstia</i> tree had been nearly killed by
injudicious treatment, and the baking of the soil above its roots.
This defect was remedied by sinking bamboo pipes four feet and a
half in the earth, and watering through them&mdash;a plan first
recommended by Major M`Farlane of Tavoy. Some fine <i>
Orchide&aelig;</i> were in flower in the, gardens, but few of them
fruit;</p>

<p class="fnote">* Since I left India, these improvements have been
still further carried out, and now (in the spring of 1853) I read
of five splendid <i>Victoria</i> plants flowering at once, with <i>
Euryale ferox,</i> white, blue, and red water-lilies, and white,
yellow and scarlet lotus, rendering the tanks gorgeous, sunk as
their waters are in frames of green grass, ornamented with clumps
of <i>Nipa fruticans</i> and <i>Ph&oelig;nix paludosa.</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 246">[ 246 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and those <i>Dendrobiums</i> which bear axillary
viviparous buds never do. Some of the orchids appear to be spread
by birds amongst the trees; but the different species of <i>
Vanda</i> are increasing so fast, that there seems no doubt that
this tribe of air-plants grows freely from seed in a wild state,
though we generally fail to rear them in England.</p>

<p>The great Banyan tree (<i>Ficus Indica</i>) is still the pride
and ornament of the garden. Dr. Falconer has ascertained
satisfactorily that it is only seventy-five years old: annual
rings, size, etc., afford no evidence in such a case, but people
were alive a few years ago who remembered well its site being
occupied in 1782 by a Kujoor (Date-palm), out of whose crown the
Banyan sprouted, and beneath which a Fakir sat. It is a remarkable
fact that the banyan hardly ever vegetates on the ground; but its
figs are eaten by birds, and the seeds deposited in the crowns of
palms, where they grow, sending down roots that embrace and
eventually kill the palm, which decays away. This tree is now
eighty feet high, and throws an area 300 feet* in diameter into a
dark, cool shade. The gigantic limbs spread out about ten feet
above the ground, and from neglect during Dr. Wallich&rsquo;s
absence, there were on Dr. Falconer&rsquo;s arrival no more than
eighty-nine descending roots or props; there are now several
hundreds, and the growth of this grand mass of vegetation is
proportionably stimulated and increased. The props are induced to
sprout by wet clay and moss tied to the branches, beneath which</p>

<p class="fnote">* Had this tree been growing in 1849 over the
great palm-stove at Kew, only thirty feet of each end of that vast
structure would have been uncovered: its increase was proceeding so
rapidly, that by this time it could probably cover the whole.
Larger banyans are common in Bengal; but few are so symmetrical in
shape and height. As the tree gets old, it breaks up into separate
masses, the original trunk decaying, and the props becoming
separate trunks of the different portions.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 247">[ 247 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">a little pot of water is hung, and after they have
made some progress, they are inclosed in bamboo tubes, and so
coaxed down to the ground. They are mere slender whip-cords before
reaching the earth, where they root, remaining very lax for several
months; but gradually, as they grow and swell to the size of
cables, they tighten, and eventually become very tense. This is a
curious phenomenon, and so rapid, that it appears to be due to the
rooting part mechanically dragging down the aerial. The branch
meanwhile continues to grow outwards, and being supplied by its new
support, thickens beyond it, whence the props always slant outwards
from the ground towards the circumference of the tree.</p>

<p><i>Cycas</i> trees abound in the gardens, and, though generally
having only one, or rarely two crowns, they have sometimes sixteen,
and their stems are everywhere covered with leafy buds, which are
developed on any check being given to the growth of the plant, as
by the operation of transplantation, which will cause as many as
300 buds to appear in the course of a few years, on a trunk eight
feet high.</p>

<p>During my stay at the gardens, Dr. Falconer received a box of
living plants packed in moss, and transported in a frozen state by
one of the ice ships from North America:* they left in November,
and arriving in March, I was present at the opening of the boxes,
and saw 391 plants (the whole contents) taken out in the most
perfect state. They were chiefly fruit-trees, apples, pears,
peaches, currants, and gooseberries, with beautiful plants of the
Venus&rsquo; fly-trap (<i>Dion&aelig;a muscipula</i>). More perfect
success never attended an experiment: the plants were in
vigorous</p>

<p class="fnote">* The ice from these ships is sold in the Calcutta
market for a penny a pound, to great profit; it has already proved
an invaluable remedy in cases of inflammation and fever, and has
diminished mortality to a very appreciable extent.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 248">[ 248 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">bud, and the day after being released from their
icy bonds, the leaves sprouted and unfolded, and they were packed
in Ward&rsquo;s cases for immediate transport to the Himalaya
mountains.</p>

<p>My visit to Calcutta enabled me to compare my instruments with
the standards at the Observatory, in which I was assisted by my
friend, Capt. Thuillier, to whose kind offices on this and many
other occasions I am greatly indebted.</p>

<p>I returned to Dorjiling on the 17th of April, and Dr. Thomson
and I commenced our arrangements for proceeding to the Khasia
mountains. We started on the 1st of May, and I bade adieu to
Dorjiling with no light heart; for I was leaving the kindest and
most disinterested friends I had ever made in a foreign land, and a
country whose mountains, forests, productions, and people had all
become endeared to me by many ties and associations. The prospects
of Dorjiling itself are neither doubtful nor insignificant. Whether
or not Sikkim will fall again under the protection of Britain, the
station must prosper, and that very speedily. I had seen both its
native population and its European houses doubled in two years; its
salubrious climate, its scenery, and accessibility, ensure it so
rapid a further increase that it will become the most populous
hill-station in India. Strong prejudices against a damp climate,
and the complaints of loungers and idlers who only seek pleasure,
together with a groundless fear of the natives, have hitherto
retarded its progress; but its natural advantages will outweigh
these and all other obstacles.</p>

<p>I am aware that my opinion of the ultimate success of Dorjiling
is not shared by the general public of India, and must be pardoned
for considering their views in this</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 249">[ 249 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">matter short-sighted. With regard to the
disagreeables of its climate, I can sufficiently appreciate them,
and shall be considered by the residents to have over-estimated the
amount and constancy of mist, rain, and humidity, from the two
seasons I spent there being exceptional in these respects. Whilst
on the one hand I am willing to admit the probability of this,* I
may be allowed on the other to say that I have never visited any
spot under the sun, where I was not told that the season was
exceptional, and generally for the worse; added to which there is
no better and equally salubrious climate east of Nepal, accessible
from Calcutta.</p>

<p>All climates are comparative, and fixed residents naturally
praise their own. I have visited many latitudes, and can truly say
that I have found no two climates resembling each other, and that
all alike are complained of. That of Dorjiling is above the average
in point of comfort, and for perfect salubrity rivals any; while in
variety, interest, and grandeur, the scenery is unequalled.</p>

<p>From Sikkim to the Khasia mountains our course was by boat down
the Mahanuddy to the upper Gangetic delta, whose many branches we
followed eastwards to the Megna; whence we ascended the Soormah to
the Silhet district. We arrived at Kishengunj, on the Mahanuddy, on
the 3rd of May, and were delayed two days for our boat, which
should have been waiting here to take us to Berhampore on the
Ganges: we were, however, hospitably received by Mr. Perry&rsquo;s
family.</p>

<p>The approach of the rains was indicated by violent easterly
storms of thunder, lightning, and rain; the thermometer ranging
from 70&deg; to 85&deg;. The country around Kishengunj</p>

<p class="fnote">* I am informed that hardly a shower of rain has
fallen this season, between November 1852, and April 1853; and a
very little snow in February only.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 250">[ 250 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">is flat and very barren; it is composed of a deep
sandy soil, covered with a short turf, now swarming with
cockchafers. Water is found ten or twelve feet below the surface,
and may be supplied by underground streams from the Himalaya,
distant forty-five miles. The river, which at this season is low,
may be navigated up to Titalya during the rains; its bed averages
60 yards in width, and is extremely tortuous; the current is
slight, and, though shallow, the water is opaque. We slowly
descended to Maldah, where we arrived on the 11th: the temperature
both of the water and of the air increased rapidly to upwards of
90&deg;; the former was always a few degrees cooler than the air by
day, and warmer by night. The atmosphere became drier as we receded
from the mountains.</p>

<p>The boatmen always brought up by the shore at night; and our
progress was so slow, that we could keep up with the boat when
walking along the bank. So long as the soil and river-bed continued
sandy, few bushes or herbs were to be found, and it was difficult
to collect a hundred kinds of plants in a day: gradually, however,
clumps of trees appeared, with jujube bushes, <i>Trophis,
Acacia,</i> and <i>Buddleia,</i> a few fan-palms, bamboos, and
Jack-trees. A shell (<i>Anodon</i>) was the only one seen in the
river, which harboured few water-plants or birds, and neither
alligators nor porpoises ascend so high.</p>

<p>On the 7th of May, about eighty miles in a straight line from
the foot of the Himalaya, we found the stratified sandy banks,
which had gradually risen to a height of thirteen feet, replaced by
the hard alluvial clay of the Gangetic valley, which underlies the
sand: the stream contracted, and the features of its banks were
materially improved by a jungle of tamarisk, wormwood
(<i>Artemisia</i>), and white rose-bushes (<i>Rosa
involucrata</i>), whilst mango trees became common,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 251">[ 251 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">with tamarinds, banyan, and figs. Date and <i>
Caryota</i> palms, and rattan canes, grew in the woods, and
parasitic Orchids on the trees, which were covered with a climbing
fern (<i>Acrosticum scandens</i>), so that we easily doubled our
flora of the river banks before arriving at Maldah.</p>

<p>This once populous town is, like Berhampore, now quite decayed,
since the decline of its silk and indigo trades: the staple
product, called &ldquo;Maldy,&rdquo; a mixture of silk and cotton,
very durable, and which washes well, now forms its only trade, and
is exported through Sikkim to the north-west provinces and Tibet.
It is still famous for the size and excellence of its mangos, which
ripen late in May; but this year the crop had been destroyed by the
damp heats of spring, the usual north-west dry winds not having
prevailed.</p>

<p>The ruins of the once famous city of Gour, a few miles distant,
are now covered with jungle, and the buildings are fast
disappearing, owing to the bricks being carried away to be used
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Below Maldah the river gets broader, and willow becomes common.
We found specimens of a <i>Planorbis</i> in the mud of the stream,
and saw apparently a boring shell in the alluvium, but could not
land to examine it. Chalky masses of alligators&rsquo; droppings,
like coprolites, are very common, buried in the banks, which become
twenty feet high at the junction with the Ganges, where we arrived
on the 14th. The waters of this great river were nearly two degrees
cooler than those of the Mahanuddy.</p>

<p>Rampore-Bauleah is a large station on the north bank of the
Ganges, whose stream is at this season fully a mile wide, with a
very slow current; its banks are thirty feet above the water. We
were most kindly received by Mr. Bell, the collector of the
district, to whom we were</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 252">[ 252 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">greatly indebted for furthering us on our voyage:
boats being very difficult to procure, we were, however, detained
here from the 16th to the 19th. I was fortunate in being able to
compare my barometers with a first-rate standard instrument, and in
finding no appreciable alteration since leaving Calcutta in the
previous April. The elevation of the station is 130 feet above the
sea, that of Kishengunj I made 131; so that the Gangetic valley is
nearly a dead level for fully a hundred miles north, beyond which
it rises; Titalya, 150 miles to the north, being 360 feet, and
Siligoree, at the margin of the Terai, rather higher. The river
again falls more considerably than the land; the Mahanuddy, at
Kishengunj, being about twenty feet below the level of the plains,
or 110 above the sea; whereas the Ganges, at Rampore, is probably
not more than eighty feet, even when the water is highest.</p>

<p>The climate of Rampore is marked by greater extremes than that
of Calcutta: during our stay the temperature rose above 106&deg;,
and fell to 78&deg; at night: the mean was 2&middot;5&deg; higher
than at Calcutta, which is 126 miles further south. Being at the
head of the Gangetic delta, which points from the Sunderbunds
obliquely to the north-west, it is much damper than any locality
further west, as is evidenced by two kinds of <i>Calamus</i> palm
abounding, which do not ascend the Ganges beyond Monghyr. Advancing
eastwards, the dry north-west wind of the Gangetic valley, which
blows here in occasional gusts, is hardly felt; and easterly winds,
rising after the sun (or, in other words, following the heating of
the open dry country), blow down the great valley of the
Burrampooter, or south-easterly ones come up from the Bay of
Bengal. The western head of the Gangetic delta is thus placed in
what are called &ldquo;the variables&rdquo; in naval phraseology;
but only so far as its</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 253">[ 253 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">superficial winds are concerned, for its great
atmospheric current always blows from the Bay of Bengal, and flows
over all northern India, to the lofty regions of Central Asia.</p>

<p>At Rampore I found the temperature of the ground, at three feet
depth, varied from 87&middot;8&deg; to 89&middot;8&deg;, being
considerably lower than that of the air (94&middot;2&deg;), whilst
that of a fine ripening shaddock, into which I plunged a
thermometer bulb, varied little from 81&deg;, whether the sun shone
on it or not. From this place we made very slow progress
south-eastwards, with a gentle current, but against constant
easterly winds, and often violent gales and thunder-storms, which
obliged us to bring up under shelter of banks and islands of sand.
Sometimes we sailed along the broad river, whose opposite shores
were rarely both visible at once, and at others tracked the boat
through narrow creeks that unite the many Himalayan streams, and
form a network soon after leaving their mountain valleys.</p>

<p>A few miles beyond Pubna we passed from a narrow canal at once
into the main stream of the Burrampooter at Jaffergunj: our maps
had led us to expect that it flowed fully seventy miles to the
eastward in this latitude; and we were surprised to hear that
within the last twenty years the main body of that river had
shifted its course thus far to the westward. This alteration was
not effected by the gradual working westwards of the main stream,
but by the old eastern channel so rapidly silting up as to be now
unnavigable; while the Jummul, which receives the Teesta, and which
is laterally connected by branches with the Burrampooter, became
consequently wider and deeper, and eventually the principal
stream.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more dreary and uninteresting than the scenery of
this part of the delta. The water is clay-coloured and turbid,
always cooler than the air, which</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 254">[ 254 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">again was 4&deg; or 5&deg; below that of Calcutta,
with a damper atmosphere. The banks are of stratified sand and mud,
hardly raised above the mean level of the country, and consequently
unlike those bordering most annually flooded rivers; for here the
material is so unstable, that the current yearly changes its
course. A wiry grass sometimes feebly binds the loose soil, on
which there are neither houses nor cultivation.</p>

<p>Ascending the Jummul (now the main channel of the Burrampooter)
for a few miles, we turned off into a narrower channel, sixty miles
long, which passes by Dacca, where we arrived on the 28th, and
where we were again detained for boats, the demand for which is
rapidly increasing with the extended cultivation of the Sunderbunds
and Delta. We stayed with Mr. Atherton, and botanised in the
neighbourhood of the town, which was once very extensive, and is
still large, though not flourishing. The population is mostly
Mahometan; the site, though beautiful and varied, is unhealthy for
Europeans. Ruins of great Moorish brick buildings still remain, and
a Greek style of ornamenting the houses prevails to a remarkable
degree.</p>

<p>The manufacture of rings for the arms and ancles, from
conch-shells imported from the Malayan Archipelago, is still almost
confined to Dacca: the shells are sawn across for this purpose by
semicircular saws, the hands and toes being both actively employed
in the operation. The introduction of circular saws has been
attempted by some European gentlemen, but steadily resisted by the
natives, despite their obvious advantages. The Dacca muslin
manufacture, which once employed thousands of hands, is quite at an
end, so that it was with great difficulty that the specimens of
these fabrics sent to the Great Exhibition</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 255">[ 255 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">of 1851, were procured. The kind of cotton (which
is very short in the staple) employed, is now hardly grown, and
scarcely a loom exists which is fit for the finest fabrics. The
jewellers still excel in gold and silver filagree.</p>

<p>Pine-apples, plantains, mangos, and oranges, abound in the Dacca
market, betokening a better climate for tropical fruits than that
of Western Bengal; and we also saw the fruit of <i>Euryale
ferox,</i>* which is round, soft, pulpy, and the size of a small
orange; it contains from eight to fifteen round black seeds as
large as peas, which are full of flour, and are eaten roasted in
India and China, in which latter country the plant is said to have
been in cultivation for upwards of 3000 years.</p>

<p>The native vegetation is very similar to that of the Hoogly,
except that the white rose is frequent here. The fact of a plant of
this genus being as common on the plains of Bengal as a dog-rose is
in England, and associated with cocoa-nuts, palms, mangos,
plantains, and banyans, has never yet attracted the attention of
botanists, though the species was described by Roxburgh. As a
geographical fact it is of great importance, for the rose is
usually considered a northern genus, and no kind but this inhabits
a damp hot tropical climate. Even in mountainous countries situated
near the equator, as in the Himalaya and Andes, wild roses are very
rare, and only found at great elevations, whilst they are unknown
in the southern hemisphere. It is curious that this rose, which is
also a native of Birma and the Indian Peninsula, does not in this
latitude grow</p>

<p class="fnote">* An Indian water-lily with a small red flower,
covered everywhere with prickles, and so closely allied to <i>
Victoria regia</i> as to be scarcely generically distinguishable
from it. It grows in the eastern Sunderbunds, and also in Kashmir.
The discoverer of Victoria called the latter &ldquo;<i>Euryale
Amazonica.</i>&rdquo; These interestiug plants are growing side by
side in the new Victoria house at Kew. The Chinese species has been
erroneously considered different from the Indian one.</p>

<p class="first">west of the meridian of 87&deg;; it is confined to
the upper Gangetic delta, and inhabits a climate in which it would
least of all be looked for.</p>

<p>I made the elevation of Dacca by barometer only seventy-two feet
above the sea; and the banks of the Dallisary being high, the level
of its waters at this season is scarcely above that of the Bay of
Bengal. The mean temperature of the air was 86&middot;75&deg;
during our stay, or half a degree lower than Calcutta at the same
period.</p>

<p>We pursued our voyage on the 30th of May, to the old bed of the
Burrampooter, an immense shallow sheet of water, of which the
eastern bank is for eighty miles occupied by the delta of the
Soormah. This river rises on the Munnipore frontier, and flows
through Cachar, Silhet, and the Jheels of east Bengal, receiving
the waters of the Cachar, Jyntea, Khasia, and Garrow mountains
(which bound the Assam valley to the south), and of the Tipperah
hills, which stretch parallel to them, and divide the Soormah
valley from the Bay of Bengal. The immense area thus drained by the
Soormah is hardly raised above the level of the sea, and covers
about 10,000 square miles. The anastomosing rivers that traverse
it, flow very gently, and do not materially alter their course;
hence their banks gradually rise above the mean level of the
surrounding country, and on them the small villages are built,
surrounded by extensive rice-fields that need no artificial
irrigation. At this season the general surface of the Jheels is
marshy; but during the rains, which are excessive on the
neighbouring mountains, they resemble an inland sea, the water
rising gradually to within a few inches of the floor of the huts;
as, however, it subsides as slowly in autumn, it commits no
devastation. The communication is at all seasons by</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 257">[ 257 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">boats, in the management of which the natives
(chiefly Mahometans) are expert.</p>

<p>The want of trees and shrubs is the most remarkable feature of
the Jheels; in which respect they differ from the Sunderbunds,
though the other physical features of each are similar, the level
being exactly the same: for this difference there is no apparent
cause, beyond the influence of the tide and sea atmosphere. Long
grasses of tropical genera (<i>Saccharum, Donax, Andropogon,</i>
and <i>Rottb&oelig;llia</i>) ten feet high, form the bulk of the
vegetation, with occasional low bushes along the firmer banks of
the natural canals that everywhere intersect the country; amongst
these the rattan cane (<i>Calamus</i>), rose, a laurel, <i>
Stravadium,</i> and fig, are the most common; while beautiful
convolvuli throw their flowering shoots across the water.</p>

<p>The soil, which is sandy along the Burrampooter, is more muddy
and clayey in the centre of the Jheels, with immense spongy
accumulations of vegetable matter in the marshes, through which we
poked the boat-staves without finding bottom: they were for the
most part formed of decomposed grass roots, with occasionally
leaves, but no quantity of moss or woody plants. Along the courses
of the greater streams drift timber and various organic fragments
are no doubt imbedded, but as there is no current over the greater
part of the flooded surface, there can be little or no
accumulation, except perhaps of old canoes, or of such vegetables
as grow on the spot. The waters are dark-coloured, but clear and
lucid, even at their height.</p>

<p>We proceeded up the Burrampooter, crossing it obliquely; its
banks were on the average five miles apart, and formed of sand,
without clay, and very little silt or mud: the water was clear and
brown, like that of the Jheels, and very different from that of the
Jummul. We</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 258">[ 258 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">thence turned eastwards into the delta of the
Soormah, which we traversed in a north-easterly direction to the
stream itself. We often passed through very narrow channels, where
the grasses towered over the boats: the boatmen steered in and out
of them as they pleased, and we were utterly at a loss to know how
they guided themselves, as they had neither compass nor map, and
there were few villages or landmarks; and on climbing the mast we
saw multitudes of other masts and sails peeing over the grassy
marshes, doing just the same as we did. All that go up have the
south-west wind in their favour, and this helps them to their
course, but beyond this they have no other guide but that instinct
which habit begets. Often we had to retreat from channels that
promised to prove short cuts, but which turned out to be blind
alleys. Sometimes we sailed up broader streams of chesnut-brown
water, accompanied by fleets of boats repairing to the populous
districts at the foot of the Khasia, for rice, timber, lime, coal,
bamboos, and long reeds for thatching, all of which employ an
inland navy throughout the year in their transport to Calcutta.</p>

<p>Leeches and mosquitos were very troublesome, the latter
appearing in clouds at night; during the day they were rarer, but
the species was the same. A large cray-fish was common, but there
were few birds and no animals to be seen.</p>

<p>Fifty-four barometric observations, taken at the level of the
water on the voyage between Dacca and the Soormah, and compared
with Calcutta, showed a gradual rise of the mercury in proceeding
eastwards; for though the pressure at Calcutta was &middot;055 of
an inch higher than at Dacca, it was &middot;034 lower than on the
Soormah: the mean difference between all these observations and
the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 259">[ 259 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">contemporaneous ones at Calcutta was +&middot;003
in favour of Calcutta, and the temperature half a degree lower; the
dew-point and humidity were nearly the same at both places. This
being the driest season of the year, it is very probable that the
mean level of the water at this part of the delta is not higher
than that of the Bay of Bengal; but as we advanced northwards
towards the Khasia, and entered the Soormah itself, the atmospheric
pressure increased further, thus appearing to give the bed of that
stream a depression of thirty-five feet below the Bay of Bengal,
into which it flows! This was no doubt the result of unequal
atmospheric pressure at the two localities, caused by the
disturbance of the column of atmosphere by the Khasia mountains;
for in December of the same year, thirty-eight observations on the
surface of the Soormah made its bed forty-six feet <i>above</i> the
Bay of Bengal, whilst, from twenty-three observations on the Megna,
the pressure only differed +0&middot;020 of an inch from that of
the barometer at Calcutta, which is eighteen feet above the
sea-level.</p>

<p>These barometric levellings, though far from satisfactory as
compared with trigonometric, are extremely interesting in the
absence of the latter. In a scientific point of view nothing has
been done towards determining the levels of the land and waters of
the great Gangetic delta, since Rennell&rsquo;s time, yet no
geodetical operation promises more valuable results in geography
and physical geology than running three lines of level across its
area; from Chittagong to Calcutta, from Silhet to Rampore, and from
Calcutta to Silhet. The foot of the Sikkim Himalaya has, I believe,
been connected with Calcutta by the great trigonometrical survey,
but I am given to understand that the results are not
published.</p>

<p>My own barometric levellings would make the bed of the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 260">[ 260 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Mahanuddy and Ganges at the western extremity of
the delta, considerably higher than I should have expected,
considering how gentle the current is, and that the season was that
of low water. If my observations are correct, they probably
indicate a diminished pressure, which is not easily accounted for,
the lower portion of the atmospheric column at Rampore being
considerably drier and therefore heavier than at Calcutta. At the
eastern extremity again, towards Silhet, the atmosphere is much
damper than at Calcutta, and the barometer should therefore have
stood lower, indicating a higher level of the waters than is the
case.</p>

<p>To the geologist the Jheels and Sunderbunds are a most
instructive region, as whatever may be the mean elevation of their
waters, a permanent depression of ten to fifteen feet would
submerge an immense tract, which the Ganges, Burrampooter, and
Soormah would soon cover with beds of silt and sand. There would be
extremely few shells in the beds thus formed, the southern and
northern divisions of which would present two very different floras
and faunas, and would in all probability be referred by future
geologists to widely different epochs. To the north, beds of peat
would be formed by grasses, and in other parts, temperate and
tropical forms of plants and animals would be preserved in such
equally balanced proportions as to confound the
pal&aelig;ontologist; with the bones of the long-snouted alligator,
Gangetic porpoise, Indian cow, buffalo, rhinoceros, elephant,
tiger, deer, boar; and a host of other animals, he would meet with
acorns of several species of oak, pine-cones and magnolia fruits,
rose seeds, and <i>Cycas</i> nuts, with palm nuts, screw-pines, and
other tropical productions. On the other hand, the Sunderbunds
portion, though containing also the bones of the tiger, deer,
and</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 261">[ 261 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">buffalo, would have none of the Indian cow,
rhinoceros, or elephant; there would be different species of
porpoise, alligator, and deer, and none of the above mentioned
plants (<i>Cycas,</i> oak, pine, magnolia and rose), which would be
replaced by numerous others, all distinct from those of the Jheels,
and many of them indicative of the influence of salt water, whose
proximity (from the rarity of sea-shells) might not otherwise be
suspected.</p>

<p>On the 1st of June we entered the Soormah, a full and muddy
stream flowing west, a quarter of a mile broad, with banks of mud
and clay twelve or fifteen feet high, separating it from marshes,
and covered with betel-nut and cocoa-nut palms, figs, and banyans.
Many small</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 262">[ 262 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">villages were scattered along the banks, each with
a swarm of boats, and rude kilns for burning the lime brought from
the Khasia mountains, which is done with grass and bushes. We
ascended to Chattuc, against a gentle current, arriving on the
9th.</p>

<p>From this place the Khasia mountains are seen as a long
table-topped range running east and west, about 4000 to 5000 feet
high, with steep faces towards the Jheels, out of which they appear
to rise abruptly. Though twelve miles distant, large waterfalls are
very clearly seen precipitating themselves over the cliffs into a
bright green mass of foliage, that seems to creep half way up their
flanks. The nearly horizontal arrangement of the strata is as
conspicuous here, as in the sandstone of the Kymore hills in the
Soane valley, which these mountains a good deal resemble; but they
are much higher, and the climate is widely different. Large valleys
enter the hills, and are divided by hog-backed spurs, and it is far
within these valleys that the waterfalls and precipices occur; but
the nearer and further cliffs being thrown by perspective into one
range, they seem to rise out of the Jheels so abruptly as to remind
one of some precipitous island in the ocean.</p>

<p>Chattuc is mainly indebted for its existence to the late Mr.
Inglis, who resided there for upwards of sixty years, and opened a
most important trade between the Khasia and Calcutta in oranges,
potatos, coal, lime, and timber. We were kindly received by his
son, whose bungalow occupies a knoll, of which there are several,
which attracted our attention as being the only elevations fifty
feet high which we had ascended since leaving the foot of the
Sikkim Himalaya. They rise as islets (commonly called Teela, Beng.)
out of the Jheels, within twelve to</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 263">[ 263 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">twenty miles of the Khasia; they are chiefly
formed of stratified gravel and sand, and are always occupied by
villages and large trees. They seldom exceed sixty feet in height,
and increase in number and size as the hills are approached; they
are probably the remains of a deposit that was once spread
uniformly along the foot of the mountains, and they in all respects
resemble those I have described as rising abruptly from the plains
near Titalya (see vol. i. <a href="chap17.html#page 382">p.
382</a>).</p>

<p>The climate of Chattuc is excessively damp and hot throughout
the year, but though sunk amid interminable swamps, the place is
perfectly healthy! Such indeed is the character of the climate
throughout the Jheels, where fevers and agues are rare; and though
no situations can appear more malarious to the common observer than
Silhet and Cachar, they are in fact eminently salubrious. These
facts admit of no explanation in the present state of our knowledge
of endemic diseases. Much may be attributed to the great amount and
purity of the water, the equability of the climate, the absence of
forests and of sudden changes from wet to dry; but such facts
afford no satisfactory explanation. The water, as I have above
said, is of a rich chesnut-brown in the narrow creeks of the
Jheels, and is golden yellow by transmitted light, owing no doubt,
as in bog water and that of dunghills, to a vegetable extractive
and probably the presence of carburetted hydrogen. Humboldt
mentions this dark-coloured water as prevailing in some of the
swamps of the Cassiquares, at the junction of the Orinoco and
Amazon, and gives much curious information on its accompanying
features of animal and vegetable life.</p>

<p>The rains generally commence in May: they were unusually late
this year, though the almost daily gales and</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 264">[ 264 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">thunder-storms we experienced, foretold their
speedy arrival. From May till October they are unremitting, and the
country is under water, the Soormah rising about fifty feet.
North-easterly winds prevail, but they are a local current
reflected from the Khasia, against which the southerly perennial
trade-wind impinges. Westerly winds are very rare, but the dry
north-west blasts of India have been known to traverse the delta
and reach this meridian, in one or two short hot dry puffs during
March and April. Hoarfrost is unknown.*</p>

<p>China roses and tropical plants (<i>Bignoni&aelig;,
Asclepiade&aelig;,</i> and <i>Convolvuli</i>) rendered Mr.
Inglis&rsquo; bungalow gay, but little else will grow in the
gardens. Pine-apples are the best fruit, and oranges from the foot
of the Khasia: plantains ripen imperfectly, and the mango is always
acid, attacked by grubs, and having a flavour of turpentine. The
violent hailstorms of the vernal equinox cut both spring and cold
season flowers and vegetables, and the rains destroy all summer
products. The soil is a wet clay, in which some European vegetables
thrive well if planted in October or November. We were shown
marrowfat peas that had been grown for thirty years without
degenerating in size, but their flavour was poor.</p>

<p>Small long canoes, paddled rapidly by two men, were procured
here, whereby to ascend the narrow rivers that lead up to the foot
of the mountains: they each carry one passenger, who lies along the
bottom, protected by a bamboo platted arched roof. We started at
night, and early the next morning arrived at Pundua,&dagger; where
there is a</p>

<p class="fnote">* It however forms further south, at the very
mouth of the Megna, and is the effect of intense radiation when the

&dagger; Pundua, though an insignificant village, surrounded by
swamps, has enjoyed an undue share of popularity as a botanical
region. Before the geographical features of the country north of
Silhet were known, the plants brought from those hills by native
collectors were sent to the Calcutta garden (and thence to Europe)
as from Pundua. Hence Silhet mountains and Pundua mountains, both
very erroneous terms, are constantly met with in botanical works,
and generally refer to plants growing in the Khasia mountains.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 265">[ 265 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">dilapidated bungalow: the inhabitants are employed
in the debarkation of lime, coal, and potatos. Large fleets of
boats crowded the narrow creeks, some of the vessels being of
several tons burden.</p>

<p>Elephants were kindly sent here for us by Mr. H. Inglis, to take
us to the foot of the mountains, about three miles distant, and
relays of mules and ponies to ascend to Churra, where we were
received with the greatest hospitality by that gentleman, who
entertained us till the end of June, and procured us servants and
collectors. To his kind offices we were also indebted throughout
our travels in the Khasia, for much information, and for facilities
and necessaries of all kinds: things in which the traveller is more
dependent on his fellow countrymen in India, than in any other part
of the world.</p>

<p>We spent two days at Pundua, waiting for our great boats (which
drew several feet of water), and collecting in the vicinity. The
old bungalow, without windows and with the roof falling in, was a
most miserable shelter; and whichever way we turned from the door,
a river or a swamp lay before us. Birds, mosquitos, leeches, and
large wasps swarmed, also rats and sandflies. A more pestilential
hole cannot be conceived; and yet people traverse this district,
and sleep here at all seasons of the year with impunity. We did so
ourselves in the month of June, when the Sikkim and all other
Terais are deadly: we returned in September, traversing the Jheels
and nullahs at the very foot of the hills during a short break of
fine weather in the middle of the rains; and we again</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 266">[ 266 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">slept here in November,* always exposed in the
heat of the day to wet and fatigue, and never having even a <i>
soup&ccedil;on</i> of fever, ague, or rheumatism. This immunity
does not, however, extend to the very foot of the hills, as it is
considered imprudent to sleep at this season in the bungalow of
Terrya, only three miles off.</p>

<p>The elevation of Pundua bungalow is about forty feet above the
sea, and that of the waters surrounding it, from ten to thirty,
according to the season. In June the mean of the barometer readings
at the bungalow was absolutely identical with that of the Calcutta
barometer, In September it was 0&middot;016 inch lower, and in
November 0&middot;066 lower. The mean annual temperature throughout
the Jheels is less than 2&deg; below that of Calcutta.</p>

<p>Terrya bungalow lies at the very foot of the first rise of the
mountains; on the way we crossed many small streams upon the
elephants, and one large one by canoes: the water in all was
cool&dagger; and sparkling, running rapidly over boulders and
pebbles. Their banks of sandy clay were beautifully fringed with a
willow-like laurel, <i>Ehretia</i> bushes, bamboos, palms, <i>
Bauhinia, Bombax,</i> and <i>Erythrina,</i> over which <i>
Calamus</i> palm (rattan) and various flowering plants climbed. The
rock at Terrya is a nummulitic limestone, worn into extensive
caverns. This formation is said to extend along the southern flank
of the Khasia, Garrow, and Jyntea mountains, and to be associated
with sandstone and coal: it is extensively quarried in many places,
several</p>

<p class="fnote">* At the north foot of the Khasia, in the heavily
timbered dry Terai stretching for sixty miles to the Burrampooter,
it is almost inevitable death for a European to sleep, any time
between the end of April and of November. Many have crossed that
tract, but not one without taking fever: Mr. H. Inglis was the only
survivor of a party of five, and he was ill from the effects for
upwards of two years, after having been brought to death&rsquo;s
door by the first attack, which came on within three weeks of his
arrival at Churra, and by several relapses.<br>

November 75&middot;7&deg;.</p>

<p class="first">thousand tons being annually shipped for Calcutta
and Dacca. It is succeeded by a horizontally stratified sandstone,
which is continued up to 4000 feet, where it is overlain by
coal-beds and then by limestone again.</p>

<p>The sub-tropical scenery of the lower and outer Sikkim Himalaya,
though on a much more gigantic scale, is not comparable in beauty
and luxuriance with the really tropical vegetation induced by the
hot, damp, and insular climate of these perennially humid
mountains. At the Himalaya forests of gigantic trees, many of them
deciduous, appear from a distance as masses of dark gray foliage,
clothing mountains 10,000 feet high: here the individual trees are
smaller, more varied in kind, of a brilliant green, and contrast
with gray limestone and red sandstone rocks and silvery cataracts.
Palms are more numerous here;* the cultivated <i>Areca</i>
(betel-nut) especially, raising its graceful stem and feathery
crown, &ldquo;like an arrow shot down from heaven,&rdquo; in
luxuriance and beauty above the verdant slopes. This difference is
at once expressed to the Indian botanist by defining the Khasia
flora as of Malayan character; by which is meant the prevalence of
brilliant glossy-leaved evergreen tribes of trees (as <i>
Euphorbiace&aelig;</i> and <i>Urtice&aelig;</i>), especially figs,
which abound in the hot gulleys, where the property of their roots,
which inosculate and form natural grafts, is taken advantage of in
bridging streams, and in constructing what are called living
bridges, of the most picturesque forms. <i>Combretace&aelig;,</i>
oaks, oranges, <i>Garcinia</i> (gamboge), <i>Diospyros,</i> figs,
Jacks, plantains, and <i>Pandanus,</i> are more frequent here,
together with pinnated leaved <i>Leguminos&aelig;,
Meliace&aelig;,</i> vines and peppers, and above all</p>

<p class="fnote">* There are upwards of twenty kinds of Palm in
this district, including <i>Cham&aelig;rops,</i> three species of
<i>Areca,</i> two of <i>Wallichia, Arenga, Caryota,</i> three of
<i>Ph&oelig;nix, Plectocomia, Licuala,</i> and many species of <i>
Calamus.</i> Besides these there are several kinds of <i>
Pandanus,</i> and the <i>Cycas pectinata.</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">palms, both climbing ones with pinnated shining
leaves (as <i>Calamus</i> and <i>Plectocomia</i>), and erect ones
with similar leaves (as cultivated cocoa-nut, <i>Areca</i> and <i>
Arenga</i>), and the broader-leaved wild betel-nut, and beautiful
<i>Caryota</i> or wine-palm, whose immense decompound leaves are
twelve feet long. Laurels and wild nutmegs, with <i>Henslowia,
Itea,</i> etc., were frequent in the forest, with the usual
prevalence of parasites, mistleto, epiphytical <i>Orchide&aelig;,
&AElig;shynanthus,</i> ferns, mosses, and <i>Lycopodia</i>; and on
the ground were <i>Rubiace&aelig;, Scitamine&aelig;,</i> ferns, <i>
Acanthace&aelig;,</i> beautiful balsams, and herbaceous and shrubby
nettles. Bamboos* of many kinds are very abundant, and these hills
further differ remarkably from those of Sikkim in the great number
of species of grasses.</p>

<p>The ascent was at first gradual, along the sides of a sandstone
spur. At 2000 feet the slope suddenly became steep and rocky, at
3000 feet tree vegetation disappeared, and we opened a magnificent
prospect of the upper scarped flank of the valley of Moosmai, which
we were ascending, with four or five beautiful cascades rolling
over the table top of the hills, broken into silvery foam as they
leapt from ledge to ledge of the horizontally stratified precipice,
and throwing a veil of silver gauze over the gulf of emerald green
vegetation, 2000 feet below. The views of the many</p>

<p class="fnote">* The natives enumerate about fourteen different
kinds of bamboo, of which we found five in flower, belonging to
three very distinct genera. Uspar, Uspet, Uspit, Usken, Uskong,
Uktang, Usto, Silee, Namlang, Tirra, and Battooba are some of the
names of Bamboos vouched for by Mr. Inglis as correctly spelt. Of
other Khasia names of plants, Wild Plantains are called Kairem, and
the cultivated Kakesh; the latter are considered so nourishing that
they are given to newborn infants. Senteo is a flower in Khas, So a
fruit, Ading a tree, and Te a leaf. <i>Pandanus</i> is Kashelan.
<i>Plectocomia,</i> Usmole. <i>Licuala,</i> Kuslow. <i>Caryota,</i>
Kalai-katang. <i>Wallichia,</i> Kalai-nili. <i>Areca,</i> Waisola.
Various <i>Calami</i> are Rhimet, Uriphin, Ureek hilla, Tindrio,
etc. This list will serve as a specimen; I might increase it
materially, but as I have elsewhere observed, the value attached to
the supposed definite application of native names to natural
objects is greatly over-rated, and too much reliance on them has
introduced a prodigious amount of confusion into scientific works
and philological inquiries.</p>
