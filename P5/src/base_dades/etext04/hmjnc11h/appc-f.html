ON THE SOILS OF SIKKIM.</b></center>

<p class="app">There is little variety in the soil throughout
Sikkim, and, as far as vegetation is concerned, it may be divided
into vegetable mould and stiff clay&mdash;each, as they usually
occur, remarkably characteristic in composition of such soils.
Bog-earth is very rare, nor did I find peat at any elevation.</p>

<p class="app">The clay is uniformly of great tenacity, and is, I
believe, wholly due to the effect of the atmosphere on crumbling
gneiss and other rocks. It makes excellent bricks, is tenacious,
seldom friable, and sometimes accumulated in beds fourteen feet
thick, although more generally only about two feet. In certain
localities, beds or narrow seams of pure felspathic clay and layers
of vegetable matter occur in it, probably wholly due to local
causes. An analysis of that near Dorjiling gives about 30 per cent.
of alumina, the rest being silica, and a fraction of oxide of iron.
Lime is wholly unknown as a constituent of the soil, and only
occasionally seen as a stalactitic deposit from a few springs.</p>

<p class="app">A layer of vegetable earth almost invariably covers
the clay to the depth of from three to twelve or fourteen inches.
It is a very rich black mould, held in its position on the slopes
of the hills by the dense vegetation, and accumulated on the banks
of small streams to a depth at times of three and four feet. The
following is an analysis of an average specimen of the surface-soil
of Dorjiling, made for me by my friend C. J. Muller, Esq., of that
place:&mdash;<br>

<p class="app">The soil from which this example was taken was
twelve inches deep; it abounded to the eye in vegetable matter, and
was siliceous to the touch. There were no traces of phosphates or
of animal matter, and doubtful traces of lime and potash. The
subsoil of clay gave only 5&middot;7 per cent. of water, and
5&middot;55 of organic matter. The above analysis was conducted
during the rainy month of September, and the sample is an average
one of the surface-soil at 6000 to 10,000 feet. There is, I think,
little difference anywhere in the soils at this elevation, except
where the rock is remarkably micaceous, or where veins of
felspathic granite, by their decomposition, give rise to small beds
of kaolin.<br>

<p class="app">The following appearances are as noted in my
journal at the time. They so entirely resembled auroral beams, that
I had no hesitation in pronouncing them at the time to be such.
This opinion has, however, been dissented from by some
meteorologists, who consider that certain facts connected with the
geographical distribution of auroras (if I may use the term), are
opposed to it. I am well aware of the force of these arguments,
which I shall not attempt to controvert; but for the information of
those who may be interested in the matter, I may remark, that I am
very familiar with</p>

<p class="app1">the Aurora borealis in the northern temperate zone,
and during the Antarctic expedition was in the habit of recording
in the log-book the appearance presented by the Aurora australis.
The late Mr. Williams, Mr. Haddon, and Mr. Theobald, who were also
witnesses of the appearances on this occasion, considered it a
brilliant display of the aurora.</p>

clear; moon three-quarters full, and bright.</p>

<p class="app">Observed about thirty lancet beams rising in the
north-west from a low luminous arch, whose extremes bore W. 20&deg;
S., and N. 50&deg; E.; altitude of upper limb of arch 20&deg;, of
the lower 8&deg;. The beams crossed the zenith, and converged
towards S. 15&deg; E. The extremity of the largest was forked, and
extended to 25&deg; above the horizon in the S.E. by S. quarter.
The extremity of the centre one bore S. 50&deg; E., and was 45&deg;
above the horizon. The western beams approached nearest the
southern horizon. All the beams moved and flashed slowly,
occasionally splitting and forking, fading and brightening; they
were brightly defined, though the milky way and zodiacal light
could not be discerned, and the stars and planets, though clearly
discernible, were very pale.</p>

<p class="app">At 10 p.m., the luminous appearance was more
diffused; upper limb of the arch less defined; no beams crossed the
zenith; but occasionally beams appeared there and faded away.</p>

<p class="app">Between 10 and 11, the beams continued to move and
replace one another, as usual in auroras, but disappeared from the
south-east quarter, and became broader in the northern hemisphere;
the longest beams were near the north and north-east horizon.</p>

<p class="app">At half-past 10, a dark belt, 4&deg; broad, appeared
in the luminous arch, bearing from N. 55&deg; W. to N. 10&deg; W.;
its upper limb was 10&deg; above the horizon: it then gradually
dilated, and thus appeared to break up the arch. This appeared to
be the commencement of the dispersion of the phenomenon.</p>

<p class="app">At 10.50 p.m. the dark band had increased so much in
breadth that the arch was broken up in the north-west, and no beams
appeared there. Eighteen linear beams rose from the eastern part of
the arch, and bore from north to N. 20&deg; E.</p>

<br>
 PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF THE SIKKIM HIMALAYA, EAST NEPAL,<br>
AND ADJACENT PROVINCES OF TIBET.</b><br>
</center>

<p class="app">Sikkim is included in a section of the Himalaya,
about sixty miles broad from east to west, where it is bounded
respectively by the mountain states of Bhotan and Nepal. Its
southern limits are easily defined, for the mountains rise abruptly
from the plains of Bengal, as spurs of 6000 to 10,000 feet high,
densely clothed with forest to their summits. The northern and
north-eastern frontier of Sikkim is beyond the region of much rain,
and is not a natural, but a political line, drawn between that
country and Tibet. Sikkim lies nearly due north of Calcutta, and
only four hundred miles from the Bay of Bengal; its latitude being
26&deg; 40&prime; to 28&deg; N., and longitude 88&deg; to 89&deg;
E.</p>

<p class="app">The main features of Sikkim are Kinchinjunga, the
loftiest hitherto measured mountain, which lies to its north-west,
and rises 28,178 feet above the level of the sea; and the Teesta
river, which flows throughout the length of the country, and has a
course of upwards of ninety miles in a straight line. Almost all
the sources of the Teesta are included in Sikkim; and except some
comparatively insignificant streams draining the outermost ranges,
there are no rivers in this country but itself and its feeders,
which occupy the largest of the Himalayan valleys between the
Tambur in East Nepal, and the Machoo in Western Bhotan.</p>

<p class="app">An immense spur, sixty miles long, stretches south
from Kinchin to the plains of India; it is called Singalelah, and
separates Sikkim from East Nepal; the waters from its west flank
flow into the Tambur, and those from the east into the Great
Rungeet, a feeder</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 387">[ 387 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">of the Teesta. Between these two latter rivers is a
second spur from Kinchinjunga, terminating in Tendong.</p>

<p class="app">The eastern boundary of Sikkim, separating it from
Bhotan, is formed for the greater part by the Chola range, which
stretches south from the immense mountain of Donkia, 23,176 feet
high, situated fifty miles E.N.E. of Kinchinjunga: where the
frontier approaches the plains of India, the boundary line follows
the course of the Teesta, and of the Rinkpo, one of its feeders,
flowing from the Chola range. This range is much more lofty than
that of Singalelah, and the drainage from its eastern flank is into
the Machoo river, the upper part of whose course is in Tibet, and
the lower in Bhotan.</p>

<p class="app">The Donkia mountain, though 4000 feet lower than
Kinchin, is the culminant point of a much more extensive and
elevated mountain mass. It throws off an immense spur from its
north-west face, which runs west, and then south-west, to Kinchin,
forming the watershed of all the remote sources of the Teesta. This
spur has a mean elevation of 18,000 to 19,000 feet, and several of
its peaks (of which Chomiomo is one) rise much higher. The northern
boundary of Sikkim is not drawn along this, but runs due west from
Donkia, following a shorter, but stupendous spur, called
Kinchinjhow; whence it crosses the Teesta to Chomiomo, and is
continued onwards to Kinchinjunga.</p>

<p class="app">Though the great spur connecting Donkia with Kinchin
is in Tibet, and bounds the waters that flow directly south into
the Teesta, it is far from the true Himalayan axis, for the rivers
that rise on its northern slope do not run into the valley of the
Tsampu, or Tibetan Burrampooter, but into the Arun of Nepal, which
rises to the north of Donkia, and flows south-west for many miles
in Tibet, before entering Nepal and flowing south to the
Ganges.</p>

<p class="app">Sikkim, thus circumscribed, consists of a mass of
mountainous spurs, forest-clad up to 12,000 feet; there are no flat
valleys or plains in the whole country, no lakes or precipices of
any consequence below that elevation, and few or no bare slopes,
though the latter are uniformly steep. The aspect of Sikkim can
only be understood by a reference to its climate and vegetation,
and I shall therefore take these together, and endeavour, by
connecting these phenomena,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 388">[ 388 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">to give an intelligible view of the main features
of the whole country.*</p>

<p class="app">The greater part of the country between Sikkim and
the sea is a dead level, occupied by the delta of the Ganges and
Burrampooter, above which the slope is so gradual to the base of
the mountains, that the surface of the plain from which the
Himalayas immediately rise is only 300 feet above the sea. The most
obvious effect of this position is, that the prevailing southerly
wind reaches the first range of hills, loaded with vapour. The same
current, when deflected easterly to Bhotan, or westerly to Nepal
and the north-west Himalaya, is intercepted and drained of much
moisture, by the Khasia and Garrow mountains (south of Assam and
the Burrampooter) in the former case, and the Rajmahal hills (south
of the Ganges) in the latter. Sikkim is hence the dampest region of
the whole Himalaya.</p>

<p class="app">Viewed from a distance on the plains of India,
Sikkim presents the appearance&mdash;common to all mountainous
countries&mdash;of consecutive parallel ridges, running east and
west: these are all wooded, and backed by a beautiful range of
snowy peaks, with occasional breaks in the foremost ranges, through
which the rivers debouch. Any view of the Himalaya, especially at a
sufficient distance for the remote snowy peaks to be seen
overtopping the outer ridges, is, however, rare, from the constant
deposition of vapours over the forest-clad ranges during the
greater part of the year, and the haziness of the dry atmosphere of
the plains in the winter months. At the end of the rains, when the
south-east monsoon has ceased to blow with constancy, views are
obtained, sometimes from a distance of nearly two hundred miles.
From the plains, the highest peaks subtend so small an angle, that
they appear like white specks very low on the horizon, tipping the
black lower and outer wooded ranges, which always rise out of a
belt of haze, and from the density, probably, of the lower strata
of atmosphere, are never seen to rest on the visible horizon. The
remarkable lowness on the horizon of the whole stupendous mass is
always a disappointing feature to the new comer, who expects to see
dazzling peaks towering in the air. Approaching nearer, the snowy
mountains</p>

<p class="fnote">* This I did with reference especially to the
cultivation of Rhododendrons, in a paper which the Horticultural
Society of London did me the honour of printing. Quarterly Journ.
of Hort. Soc., vol. vii., p. 82.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 389">[ 389 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">sink behind the wooded ones, long before the latter
have assumed gigantic proportions; and when they do so, they appear
a sombre, lurid grey-green mass of vegetation, with no brightness
or variation of colour. There is no break in this forest caused by
rock, precipices, or cultivation; some spurs project nearer, and
some valleys appear to retire further into the heart of the
foremost great chain that shuts out all the country beyond.</p>

<p class="app">From Dorjiling the appearance of parallel ridges is
found to be deceptive, and due to the inosculating spurs of long
tortuous ranges that ran north and south throughout the whole
length of Sikkim, dividing deep wooded valleys, which form the beds
of large rivers. The snowy peaks here look like a long east and
west range of mountains, at an average distance of thirty or forty
miles. Advancing into the country, this appearance proves equally
deceptive, and the snowy range is resolved into isolated peaks,
situated on the meridional ridges; their snow-clad spurs,
projecting east and west, cross one another, and being uniformly
white, appear to connect the peaks into one grand unbroken range.
The rivers, instead of having their origin in the snowy mountains,
rise far beyond them; many of their sources are upwards of one
hundred miles in a straight line from the plains, in a very curious
country, loftier by far in mean elevation than the meridional
ridges which run south from it, yet comparatively bare of snow.
This rearward part of the mountain region is Tibet, where all the
Sikkim, Nepal, and Bhotan rivers rise as small streams, increasing
in size as they receive the drainage from the snowed parts of the
ridges that bound them in their courses. Their banks, between 8000
and 14,000 feet, are generally clothed with rhododendrons,
sometimes to the almost total exclusion of other woody vegetation,
especially near the snowy mountains&mdash;a cool temperature and
great humidity being the most favourable conditions for the
luxuriant growth of this genus.</p>

<p class="app">The source of this humidity is the southerly or sea
wind which blows steadily from May till October in Sikkim, and
prevails throughout the rest of the year, if not as the monsoon
properly so called, as a current from the moist atmosphere above
the Gangetic delta. This rushes north to the rarefied regions of
Sikkim, up the great valleys, and does not appear materially
disturbed by the north-</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 390">[ 390 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">west wind, which blows during the afternoons of the
winter months over the plains, and along the flanks of the outer
range, and is a dry surface current, due to the diurnal heating of
the soil. When it is considered that this wind, after passing lofty
mountains on the outer range, has to traverse eighty or one hundred
miles of alps before it has watered all the forest region, it will
be evident that its moisture must be expended before it reaches
Tibet.</p>

<p class="app">Let the figures in the accompanying woodcut, the one
on the true scale, the other with the heights exaggerated,
represent two of these long meridional ridges, from the watershed
to the plains of India, following in this instance the course of
the Teesta river, from its source at 19,000 feet to where it
debouches from the Himalaya at 300. The lower rugged outline
represents one meridional ridge, with all its most prominent peaks
(whether exactly or not on the line of section); the upper
represents the parallel ridge of Singalelah (D.E.P.), of greater
mean elevation, further west, introduced to show the maximum
elevation of the Sikkim mountains, Kinchinjunga (28,178 feet),
being represented on it. A deep valley is interposed between these
two ridges, with a feeder of the Teesta in it (the Great Rungeet),
which runs south from Kinchin, and turning west enters the Teesta
at R. The position of the bed of the Teesta river is indicated by a
dotted line from its source at T to the plains at S; of Dorjiling,
on the north flank of the outer range, by <i>d</i>; of the first
point where perpetual snow is met with, by P; and of the first
indications of a Tibetan climate, by C.</p>

<p class="app">A warm current of Air, loaded with vapour, will
deposit the bulk of its moisture on the ridge of Sinchul, which
rises above Dorjiling (<i>d</i>), and is 8,500 feet high. Passing
on, little will be precipitated on <i>e</i> whose elevation is the
same as that of Sinchul; but much at <i>f</i> (11,000 feet), where
the current, being further cooled, has less capacity for holding
vapour, and is further exhausted. When it ascends to P (15,000
feet) it is sufficiently cooled to deposit snow in the winter and
spring months, more of which falling than can be melted during the
summer, it becomes perennial. At the top of ginchin very little
falls, and it is doubtful if the southerly current ever reaches
that prodigiously elevated isolated summit. The amount of surface
above 20,000 feet is, however, too limited and</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 392">[ 392 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">broken into isolated peaks to drain the already
nearly, exhausted current, whose condensed vapours roll along in
fog beyond the parallel of Kinchin, are dissipated during the day
over the arid mountains of Tibet, and deposited at night on the
cooled surface of the earth.</p>

<p class="app">Other phenomena of no less importance than the
distribution of vapour, and more or less depending on it, are the
duration and amount of solar and terrestrial radiation. Towards D
the sun is rarely seen during the rainy season, as well from the
constant presence of nimbi aloft, as from fog on the surface of the
ground. An absence of both light and heat is the result south of
the parallel of Kinchin; and at C low fogs prevail at the same
season, but do not intercept either the same amount of light or
heat; whilst at T there is much sunshine and bright light. During
the night, again, there is no terrestrial radiation between S and
P; the rain either continues to pour&mdash;in some months with
increased violence&mdash;or the saturated atmosphere is condensed
into a thick white mist, which hangs over the redundant vegetation.
A bright starlight night is almost unknown in the summer months at
6000 to 10,000 feet, but is frequent in December and January, and
at intervals between October and May, when, however, vegetation is
little affected by the cold of nocturnal radiation. In the regions
north of Kinchin, starlight nights are more frequent, and the cold
produced by radiation, at 14,000 feet, is often severe towards the
end of the rains in September. Still the amount of clear weather
during the night is small; the fog clears off for an hour or two at
sunset as the wind falls, but the returning cold north current
again chills the air soon afterwards, and rolling masses of vapour
are hence flying overhead, or sweeping the surface of the earth,
throughout the summer nights. In the Tibetan regions, on the other
hand, bright nights and even sharp frosts prevail throughout the
warmest months.</p>

<p class="app">Referring again to the cut, it must be borne in mind
that neither of the two meridional ridges runs in a straight line,
but that they wind or zigzag as all mountain ranges do; that spurs
from each ridge are given off from either flank alternately, and
that the origin of a spur on one side answers to the source of a
river (<i>i.e.,</i> the head of a valley) on the other. These
rivers are feeders of the main</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 393">[ 393 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">stream, the Teesta, and run at more or less of an
angle to the latter. The spurs from the east flank of one ridge
cross, at their ends, those from the west flank of another; and
thus transverse valleys are formed, presenting many modifications
of climate with regard to exposure, temperature, and humidity.</p>

<p class="app">The roads from the plains of India to the watershed
in Tibet always cross these lateral spurs. The main ridge is too
winding and rugged, and too lofty for habitation throughout the
greater part of its length, while the river-channel is always very
winding, unhealthy for the greater part of the year below 4000
feet, and often narrow, gorge-like, and rocky. The villages are
always placed above the unhealthy regions, on the lateral spurs,
which the traveller repeatedly crosses throughout every day&rsquo;s
march; for these spurs give off lesser ones, and these again others
of a third degree, whence the country is cut up into as many spurs,
ridges, and ranges, as there are rills, streams, and rivers amongst
the mountains.</p>

<p class="app">Though the direction of the main atmospheric current
is to the north, it is in reality seldom felt to be so, except the
observer be on the very exposed mountain tops, or watch the motions
of the upper strata of atmosphere. Lower currents of air rush up
both the main and lateral valleys, throughout the day; and from the
sinuosities in the beds of the rivers, and the generally transverse
directions of their feeders, the current often becomes an east or
west one. In the branch valleys draining to the north the wind
still ascends; it is, in short, an ascending warm, moist current,
whatever course be pursued by the valleys it follows.</p>

<p class="app">The sides of each valley are hence equally supplied
with moisture, though local circumstances render the soil on one or
the other flank more or less humid and favourable to a luxuriant
vegetation: such differences are a drier soil on the north side,
with a too free exposure to the sun at low elevations, where its
rays, however transient, rapidly dry the ground, and where the
rains, though very heavy, are of shorter duration, and where, owing
to the capacity of the heated air for retaining moisture, day fogs
are comparatively rare. In the northern parts of Sikkim, again,
some of the lateral valleys are so placed that the moist wind
strikes the side facing the south, and keeps it very humid, whilst
the returning cold current from the neighbouring</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 394">[ 394 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">Tibetan mountains impinges against the side facing
the north, which is hence more bare of vegetation. An infinite
number of local peculiarities will suggest themselves to any one
conversant with physical geography, as causing unequal local
distribution of light, heat, and moisture in the different valleys
of so irregular a country; namely, the amount of slope, and its
power of retaining moisture and soil; the composition and hardness
of the rocks; their dip and strike; the protection of some valleys
by lofty snowed ridges; and the free southern exposures of others
at great elevations.</p>

<p class="app">The position and elevation of the perpetual snow*
vary with those of the individual ranges, and their exposure to the
south wind. The expression that the perpetual snow lies lower and
deeper on the southern slopes of the Himalayan mountains than on
the northern,</p>

<p class="fnote">* It appears to me, as I have asserted in the
pages of my Journal, that the limit of perpetual snow is laid down
too low in all mountain regions, and that accumulations in hollows,
and the descent of glacial ice, mask the phenomenon more
effectually than is generally allowed. In this work I define the
limit, as is customary, in general terms only, as being that where
the accumulations are very great, and whence they are continuous
upwards, on gentle slopes. All perpetual snow, however, becomes
ice, and, as such, obeys the laws of glacial motion, moving as a
viscous fluid; whence it follows that the lower edge of a snow-bed
placed on a slope is, in one sense, the termination of a glacier,
and indicates a position below that where all the snow that falls
melts. I am well aware that it is impossible to define the limit
required with any approach to accuracy. Steep and broken surfaces,
with favourable exposures to the sun or moist winds, are bare much
above places where snow lies throughout the year; but the
occurrence of a gentle slope, free of snow, and covered with
plants, cannot but indicate a point below that of perpetual snow.
Such is the case with the &ldquo;Jardin&rdquo; on the Mer de Glace,
whose elevation is 9,500 feet, whereas that of perpetual snow is
considered by Professor J. Forbes, our best authority, to be 8,500
feet. Though limited in area, girdled by glaciers, presenting a
very gentle slope to the east, and screened by surrounding
mountains from a considerable proportion of the sun&rsquo;s rays,
the Jardin is clear, for fully three months of the year, of all but
sporadic falls of snow, that never lie long; and so are similar
spots placed higher on the neighbouring slopes; which facts are
quite at variance with the supposition that the perpetual snow-line
is below that point in the Mont Blanc Alps. On the Monte Rosa Alps,
again, Dr. Thomson and I gathered plants in flower, above 12,000
feet on the steep face of the Weiss-thor Pass, and at 10,938 feet
on the top of St. Theodule; but in the former case the rocks are
too steep for any snow to lie, they are exposed to the south-east,
and overhang a gorge 8000 feet deep, up which no doubt warm
currents ascend; while at St. Theodule the plants were growing on a
slope which, though gentle, is black and stony, and exposed to warm
ascending currents, as on the Weiss-thor; and I do not consider
either of these as evidences of the limit of perpetual snow being
higher than their position.</p>

<p class="app1">conveys a false impression. It is better to say
that the snow lies deeper and lower on the southern faces of the
individual mountains and spurs that form the snowy Himalaya. The
axis itself of the chain is generally far north of the position of
the spurs that catch all the snow, and has comparatively very
little snow on it, most of what there is lying upon north
exposures.</p>

<p class="app">A reference to the woodcut will show that the same
circumstances which affect the distribution of moisture and
vegetation, determine the position, amount, and duration of the
snow. The principal fall will occur, as before shown, where the
meridional range first attains a sufficiently great elevation, and
the air becomes consequently cooled below 32&deg;; this is at a
little above 14,000 feet, sporadic falls occurring even in summer
at that elevation: these, however, melt immediately, and the
copious winter falls also are dissipated before June. As the depth
of rain-fall diminishes in advancing north to the higher parts of
the meridional ranges, so does that of the snow-fall. The
permanence of the snow, again, depends on&mdash;1. The depth of the
accumulation; 2. The mean temperature of the spot; 3. The melting
power of the sun&rsquo;s rays; 4. The prevalence and strength of
evaporating winds. Now at 14,000 feet, though the accumulation is
immense, the amount melted by the sun&rsquo;s rays is trifling, and
there are no evaporating winds; but the mean temperature is so
high, and the corroding powers of the rain (which falls abundantly
throughout summer) and of the warm and humid ascending currents are
so great, that the snow is not perennial. At 15,500 feet, again, it
becomes perennial, and its permanence at this low elevation (at P)
is much favoured by the accumulation and detention of fogs over the
rank vegetation which prevails from S nearly to P; and by the lofty
mountains beyond it, which shield it from the returning dry
currents from the north. In proceeding north all the circumstances
that tend to the dispersion of the snow increase, whilst the fall
diminishes. At P the deposition is enormous and the snow-line
low&mdash;16,000 feet; whilst at T little falls, and the limit of
perpetual snow is 19,000 and 20,000 feet. Hence the anomaly, that
the snow-line ascends in advancing north to the coldest Himalayan
regions. The position of the greatest peaks and of the greatest
mass of perpetual snow being generally assumed as indicating a
ridge and watershed, travellers, arguing from</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 396">[ 396 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">single mountains alone, on the meridional ridges,
have at one time supported and at another denied the assertion,
that the snow lies longer and deeper on the north than on the south
slope of the Himalayan ridge.</p>

<p class="app">The great accumulation of snow at 15,000 feet, in
the parallel of P, exercises a decided influence on the vegetation.
The alpine rhododendrons hardly reach 14,000 feet in the broad
valleys and round-headed spurs of the mountains of the Tunkra and
Chola passes; whilst the same species ascend to 16,000, and one to
17,000 feet, at T. Beyond the latter point, again, the great
aridity of the climate prevents their growth, and in Tibet there
are generally none even as low as 12,000 and 14,000 feet. Glaciers,
again, descend to 15,000 feet in the tortuous gorges which
immediately debouch from the snows of Kinchinjunga, but no plants
grow on the d&eacute;bris they carry down, nor is there any sward
of grass or herbage at their base, the atmosphere immediately
around being chilled by enormous accumulations of snow, and the
summer sun rarely warming the soil. At T, again, the glaciers do
not descend below 16,000 feet, but a greensward of vegetation
creeps up to their bases, dwarf rhododendrons cover the moraines,
and herbs grow on the patches of earth carried down by the latter,
which are thawed by the more frequent sunshine, and by the
radiation of heat from the unsnowed flanks of the valleys down
which these ice-streams pour.</p>

<p class="app">Looking eastward or westward on the map of India, we
perceive that the phenomenon of perpetual snow is regulated by the
same laws. From the longitude of Upper Assam in 95&deg; E to that
of Kashmir in 75&deg; E, the lowest limit of perpetual snow is
15,500 to 16,000 feet, and a shrubby vegetation affects the most
humid localities near it, at 12,000 to 14,000 feet. Receding from
the plains of India and penetrating the mountains, the climate
becomes drier, the snowline rises, and vegetation diminishes,
whether the elevation of the land increases or decreases; plants
reaching 17,000 and 18,000 feet, and the snow-line, 20,000 feet. To
mention extreme cases; the snow-level of Sikkim in 27&deg; 30
minutes is at 16,000 feet, whereas in latitude 35&deg; 30 minutes
Dr. Thomson found the snow line 20,000 feet on the mountains near
the Karakoram Pass, and vegetation up to 18,500 feet&mdash;features
I found to be common also to Sikkim in latitude 28&deg;.</p>

<p class="app">The Himalaya, north of Nepal, and thence eastward to
the bend of the Yaru-Tsampu (or Tibetan Burrampooter) has for its
geographical limits the plains of India to the south, and the bed
of the Yaru to the north. All between these limits is a mountain
mass, to which Tibet (though so often erroneously called a plain)*
forms no exception. The waters from the north side of this chain
flow into the Tsampu, and those from the south side into the
Burrampooter of Assam, and the Ganges. The line, however tortuous,
dividing the heads of these waters, is the watershed, and the only
guide we have to the axis of the Himalaya. This has never been
crossed by Europeans, except by Captain Turner&rsquo;s embassy in
1798, and Captain Bogle&rsquo;s in 1779, both of which reached the
Yaru river. In the account published by Captain Turner, the summit
of the watershed is not rigorously defined, and the boundary, of
Tibet and Bhotan is sometimes erroneously taken for it; the
boundary being at that point a southern spur of Chumulari.&dagger;
Eastwards from the sources of the Tsampu, the watershed of the
Himalaya seems to follow a very winding course, and to be
everywhere to the north of the snowy peaks seen from the plains of
India. It is by a line through these snowy peaks that the axis of
the Himalaya is represented in all our maps; because they <i>
seem</i> from the plains to be situated on an east and west ridge,
instead of being placed on subsidiary meridional ridges, as
explained above. It is also across or along the subsidiary ridges
that the boundary line between the Tibetan provinces and those of
Nepal, Sikkim, and Bhotan, is usually drawn; because the enormous
accumulations of snow form a more</p>

<p class="fnote">* The only true account of the general features of
eastern Tibet is to be found in MM. Huc and Gabet&rsquo;s travels.
Their description agrees with Dr. Thomson&rsquo;s account of
western Tibet, and with my experience of the parts to the north of
Sikkim, and the information I everywhere obtained. The so-called
<i>plains</i> are the flat floors of the valleys, and the terraces
on the margins of the rivers, which all flow between stupendous
mountains. The term &ldquo;maidan,&rdquo; so often applied to Tibet
by the natives, implies, not a plain like that of India, but simply
an open, dry, treeless country, in contrast to the densely wooded
wet regions of the snowy Himalaya, south of Tibet.<br>
&dagger; Between Donkia and Chumulari lies a portion of Tibet
(including the upper part of the course of the Machoo river)
bounded on the east by Bhotan, and on the west by Sikkim (see
chapter xxii). Turner, when crossing the Simonang Pass, descended
westwards into the valley of the Machoo, and was still on the
Indian watershed.</p>

<p class="app1">efficient natural barrier than the greater height
of the less snowed central part of the chain beyond them.</p>

<p class="app">Though, however, our maps draw the axis through the
snowy peaks, they also make the rivers to rise beyond the latter,
on the northern slopes as it were, and to flow southwards through
gaps in the axis. Such a feature is only reconcilable with the
hypothesis of the chain being double, as the Cordillera of Peru and
Chili is said to be, geographically, and which in a geological
sense it no doubt is: but to the Cordillera the Himalaya offers no
parallel. The results of Dr. Thomson&rsquo;s study of the
north-west Himalaya and Tibet, and my own of the north-east extreme
of Sikkim and Tibet, first gave me an insight into the true
structure of this chain. Donkia mountain is the culminant point of
an immensely elevated mass of mountains, of greater mean height
than a similarly extensive area around Kinchin junga. It comprises
Chumulari, and many other mountains much above 20,000 feet, though
none equalling Kinchinjunga, Junnoo, and Kubra. The great lakes of
Ramchoo and Cholamoo are placed on it; and the rivers rising on it
flow in various directions; the Painomchoo north-west into the
Yaru; the Arun west to Nepal; the Teesta south-west through Sikkim;
the Machoo south, and the Pachoo south-east, through Bhotan. All
these rivers have their sources far beyond the great snowed
mountains, the Arun most conspicuously of all, flowing completely
at the back or north of Kinchinjunga. Those that flow southwards,
break through no chain, nor do they meet any contraction as they
pass the snowy parts of the mountains which bound the valleys in
which they flow, but are bound by uniform ranges of lofty
mountains, which become more snowy as they approach the plains of
India. These valleys, however, gradually contract as they descend,
being less open in Sikkim and Nepal than in Tibet, though there
bounded by rugged mountains, which from being so bare of snow and
of vegetation, do not give the same impression of height as the
isolated sharper peaks which rise out of a dense forest, and on
which the snow limit is 4000 or 5000 feet lower.</p>

<p class="app">The fact of the bottom of the river valleys being
flatter towards the watershed, is connected with that of their fall
being less rapid at that part of their course; this is the
consequence of the great extent in</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 399">[ 399 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">breadth of the most elevated portion of the chain.
If we select the Teesta as an example, and measure its fall at
three points of its course, we shall find the results very
different. From its principal source at Lake Cholamoo, it descends
from 17,000 to 15,000 feet, with a fall of 60 feet to the mile;
from 15,000 to 12,000 feet, the fall is 140 feet to the mile; in
the third part of its course it descends from 12,000 to 5000 feet,
with a fall of 160 feet to the mile; and in the lower part the
descent is from 5000 feet to the plains of India at 300 feet,
giving a fall of 50 feet to the mile. There is, however, no marked
limit to these divisions; its valley. gradually contracts, and its
course gradually becomes more rapid. It is worthy of notice that
the fall is at its maximum through that part of its valley of which
the flanks are the most loaded with snow; where the old moraines
are very conspicuous, and where the present accumulations from
landslips, etc., are the most extensive.*</p>

<p class="app">With reference to Kinchinjunga, these facts are of
importance, as showing that mere elevation is in physical geography
of secondary importance. That lofty mountain rises from a spur of
the great range of Donkia, and is quite removed from the watershed
or axis of the Himalaya, the rivers which drain its northern and
southern flanks alike flowing to the Ganges. Were the Himalaya to
be depressed 18,000 feet, Kubra, Junnoo, Pundim, etc., would form a
small cluster of rocky islands 1000 to 7000 feet high, grouped near
Kinchinjunga, itself a cape 10,000 feet high, which would be
connected by a low, marrow neck, with an extensive and mountainous
tract of land to its north-east; the latter being represented by
Donkia. To the north of Kinchin a deep bay or inlet would occupy
the present valley of the Arun, and would be bounded on the north
by the axis of the Himalaya, which would form a continuous tract of
land beyond it. Since writing the above, I have seen Professor J.
Forbes&rsquo;s beautiful work on the glaciers of Norway: it fully
justifies a comparison of the Himalaya to Norway, which has long
been a familiar subject of</p>

<p class="fnote">* It is not my intention to discuss here the
geological bearings of this curious question; but I may state that
as the humidity of the climate of the middle region of the
river-course tends to increase the fall in a given space, so I
believe the dryness of the climate of the loftier country has the
opposite effect, by preserving those accumulations which have
raised the floors of the valleys and rendered them level.</p>

<p class="app1">theoretical enquiry with Dr. Thomson and myself.
The deep narrow valleys of Sikkim admirably represent the Norwegian
fiords; the lofty, rugged, snowy mountains, those more or less
submerged islands of the Norwegian coast; the broad rearward
watershed, or axis of the chain, with its lakes, is the same in
both, and the Yaru-tsampu occupies the relative position of the
Baltic.</p>

<p class="app">Along the whole chain of the Himalaya east of Kumaon
there are, I have no doubt, a succession of such lofty masses as
Donkia, giving off stupendous spurs such as that on which Kinchin
forms so conspicuous a feature. In support of this view we find
every river rising far beyond the snowy peaks, which are separated
by continuously unsnowed ranges placed between the great white
masses that these spurs present to the observer from the south.*
From the Khasia mountains (south-east of Sikkim) many of these
groups or spurs were seen by Dr. Thomson and myself, at various
distances (80 to 210 miles); and these groups were between the
courses of the great rivers the Soobansiri, Monass, and Pachoo, all
east of Sikkim. Other masses seen from the Gangetic valley probably
thus mark the relative positions of the Arun, Cosi, Gunduk, and
Gogra rivers.</p>

<p class="app">Another mass like that of Chumulari and Donkia, is
that around the Mansarowar lakes, so ably surveyed by the brothers
Captains R. and H. Strachey, which is evidently the centre of the
Himalaya. From it the Gogra, Sutlej, Indus, and Yaru rivers all
flow to the Indian side of Asia; and from it spring four chains,
two of which are better known than the others. These are:&mdash;1.
The eastern Himalaya, whose axis runs north of Nepal, Sikkim, and
Bhotan, to the bend of the Yaru, the valley of which it divides
from the plains of India. 2. The north-west Himalaya, which
separates the valley of the Indus from the plains of India. Behind
these, and probably parallel to them, lie two other chains. 3. The
Kouenlun or Karakoram chain, dividing the Indus from the Yarkand
river. 4. The chain north of the Yaru, of which nothing is known.
All the waters from the two first of these chains, flow into the
Indian Ocean, as do those from</p>

<p class="fnote">* At vol. i. <a href="chap8.html#page 185">p.
185,</a> I have particularly called attention to the fact, that
west of Kinchinjunga there is no continuation of a snowy Himalaya,
as it is commonly called. So between Donkia and Chumulari there is
no perpetual snow, and the valley of the Machoo is very broad,
open, and comparatively flat.</p>

<p class="app1">the south faces of the third and fourth; those from
the north side of the Kouenlun, and of the chain north of the Yaru,
flow into the great valley of Lake Lhop, which may once have been
continuous with the Amoor river.*</p>

<p class="app">For this view of the physical geography of the
western Himalaya and central Asia, I am indebted to Dr. Thomson. It
is more consonant with nature, and with what we know of the
geography of the country and of the nature of mountain chains, than
that of the illustrious Humboldt, who divides central Asia by four
parallel chains, united by two meridional ones; one at each
extremity of the mountain district. It follows in continuation and
conclusion of our view that the mountain mass of Pamir or Bolor,
between the sources of the Oxus and those of the Yarkand river, may
be regarded as a centre from which spring the three greatest
mountain systems of Asia. These are:&mdash;1. A great chain, which
runs in a north-easterly direction as far as Behring&rsquo;s
Straits, separating all the rivers of Siberia from those which flow
into the Pacific Ocean. 2. The Hindoo Koosh, continued through
Persia, and Armenia into Taurus. And, 3. The Muztagh or Karakorum,
which probably extends due east into China, south of the Hoang-ho,
but which is broken up north of Mansarowar into the chains which
have been already enumerated.<br>

ON THE CLIMATE OF SIKKIM.</b><br>

<p class="app">The meteorology of Sikkim, as of every part of the
Himalayan range, is a subject of growing interest and importance;
as it becomes yearly more necessary for the Government to afford
increased facilities for a residence in the mountains to Europeans
in search of health, or of a salubrious climate for their families,
or for themselves on retirement from the exhausting service of the
plains. I was therefore surprised to find no further register of
the weather at Dorjiling, than</p>

<p class="app1">an insufficient one of the rain-fall, kept by the
medical officer in charge of the station; who, in this, as in all
similar cases,* has neither the time nor the opportunity to give
even the minimum of required attention to the subject of
meteorology. This defect has been in a measure remedied by Dr.
Chapman, who kept a twelve-months&rsquo; register in 1837, with
instruments carefully compared with Calcutta standards by the late
James Prinsep, Esq., one of the most accomplished men in literature
and science that India ever saw.</p>

<p class="app">The annual means of temperature, rain-fall, etc.,
vary greatly in the Himalaya; and apparently slight local causes
produce such great differences of temperature and humidity, that
one year&rsquo;s observations taken at one spot, however full and
accurate they may be, are insufficient: this is remarkably the case
in Sikkim, where the rainfall is great, and where the difference
between those of two consecutive years is often greater than the
whole annual London fall. My own meteorological observations
necessarily form but a broken series, but they were made with the
best instruments, and with a view to obtaining results that should
be comparable <i>inter se,</i> and with those of Calcutta; when
away from Dorjiling too, in the interior of Sikkim, I had the
advantage of Mr. Muller&rsquo;s services in taking observations at
hours agreed upon previous to my leaving, and these were of the
greatest importance, both for calculating elevations, and for
ascertaining the differences of temperature, humidity, diurnal
atmospheric tide, and rain-fall; all of which vary with the
elevation, and the distance from the plains of India.</p>

<p class="app">Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s house proved a most favourable
spot for an observatory, being placed on the top of the Dorjiling
spur, with its broad verandah facing the north, in which I
protected the instruments from</p>

<p class="fnote">* The government of India has gone to an immense
expense, and entailed a heavy duty upon its stationary medical
officers, in supplying them with sometimes admirable, but more
often very inaccurate, meteorological instruments, and requiring
that daily registers be made, and transmitted to Calcutta. In no
case have I found it to be in the officer&rsquo;s power to carry
out this object; he has never time, seldom the necessary knowledge
and experience, and far too often no inclination. The majority of
the observations are in most cases left to personal native or other
servants, and the laborious results I have examined are too
frequently worthless.</p>

<p class="app1">radiation* and wind. Broad grass-plots and a gravel
walk surrounded the house, and large trees were scattered about; on
three sides the ground sloped away, while to the north the spur
gently rose behind.</p>

<p class="app">Throughout the greater part of the year the
prevailing wind is from the south-east, and comes laden with
moisture from the Bay of Bengal: it rises at sunrise, and its
vapours are early condensed on the forests of Sinchul; billowy
clouds rapidly succeed small patches of vapour, which rolling over
to the north side of the mountain, are carried north-west, over a
broad intervening valley, to Dorjiling. There they bank on the east
side of the spur, and this being partially clear of wood, the
accumulation is slow, and always first upon the clumps of trees.
Very generally by 9 a.m., the whole eastern sky, from the top of
Dorjiling ridge, is enveloped in a dense fog, while the whole
western exposure enjoys sunshine for an hour or two later. At 7 or
8 a.m., very small patches are seen to collect on Tonglo, which
gradually dilate and coalesce, but do not shroud the mountain for
some hours, generally not before 11 a.m. or noon. Before that time,
however, masses of mist have been rolling over Dorjiling ridge to
the westward, and gradually filling up the valleys, so that by
noon, or 1 p.m., every object is in cloud. Towards sunset it falls
calm, when the mist rises, first from Sinchul, or if a south-east
wind sets in, from Tonglo first.</p>

<p class="app">The temperature is more uniform at Mr.
Hodgson&rsquo;s bungalow, which is on the top of the Dorjiling
ridge, than on either of its flanks; this is very much because a
good deal of wood is left upon it, whose cool foliage attracts and
condenses the mists. Its mean temperature is lower by nearly
2&middot;5&deg; than that of Mr. Muller&rsquo;s and Dr.
Campbell&rsquo;s houses, both situated on the slopes, 400 feet
below. This I ascertained by numerous comparative observations of
the temperature of the air, and by burying thermometers in the
earth:</p>

<p class="fnote">* This is a most important point, generally wholly
neglected in India, where I have usually seen the thermometer hung
in good shade, but exposed to reflected heat from walls, gravel
walks, or dry earth. I am accustomed from experience to view all
extreme temperatures with great suspicion, on this and other
accounts. It is very seldom that the temperature of the free shaded
air rises much above 100&deg;, except during hot winds, when the
lower stratum only of atmosphere (often loaded with hot particles
of sand), sweeps over the surface of a soil scorched by the direct
rays of the sun.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 404">[ 404 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">it is chiefly to be accounted for by the more
frequent sunshine at the lower stations, the power of the sun often
raising the thermometer in shade to 80&deg;, at Mr. Muller&rsquo;s;
whereas during the summer I spent at Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s it never
rose much above 70&deg;, attaining that height very seldom and for
a very short period only. The nights, again, are uniformly and
equally cloudy at both stations, so that there is no corresponding
cold of nocturnal radiation to reduce the temperature.</p>

<p class="app">The mean decrease of temperature due to elevation, I
have stated (Appendix I.) to be about 1&deg; for every 300 feet of
ascent; according to which law Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s should not be
more than 1&middot;5&deg; colder than Mr. Muller&rsquo;s. These
facts prove how difficult it is to choose unexceptionable sites for
meteorological observatories in mountainous countries;
discrepancies of so great an amount being due to local causes,
which, as in this case, are perhaps transient; for should the top
of the spur be wholly cleared of timber, its temperature would be
materially raised; at the expense, probably, of a deficiency of
water at certain seasons. Great inequalities of temperature are
also produced by ascending currents of heated air from the Great
Rungeet valley, which affect certain parts of the station only; and
these raise the thermometer 10&deg; (even when the sun is clouded)
above what it indicates at other places of equal elevation.</p>

<p class="app">The mean temperature of Dorjiling (elev. 7,430 feet)
is very nearly 50&deg;, or 2&deg; higher than that of London, and
26&deg; below that of Calcutta (78&deg;,* or 78&middot;5&deg; in
the latest published tables&dagger;); which, allowing 1&deg; of
diminution of temperature for every degree of latitude leaves
1&deg; due to every 300 feet of ascent above Calcutta to the height
of Dorjiling, agreeably to my own observations. This diminution is
not the same for greater heights, as I shall have occasion to show
in a separate chapter of this Appendix, on the decrement of heat
with elevation.</p>

<p class="app">A remarkable uniformity of temperature prevails
throughout the year at Dorjiling, there being only 22&deg;
difference between the mean temperatures of the hottest and coldest
months; whilst in London,</p>

difference is 27&deg;. At 11,000 feet this difference is equal to
that of London. In more elevated regions, it is still greater, the
climate becoming excessive at 15,000 feet, where the difference
amounts to 30&deg; at least.* The accompanying table is the result

<p class="app">Supposing the same formula to apply (which I
exceedingly doubt) to heights above 19,000 feet, 2&deg; would be
the mean annual temperature of the summit of Kinchinjunga, altitude
28,178 feet, the loftiest known spot on the globe: this is a degree
or two higher than the temperature of the poles of greatest cold on
the earth&rsquo;s surface, and about the temperature of Spitzbergen
and Melville island.</p>

<p class="app">The upper limit of phenogamic vegetation coincides
with a mean temperature of 30&deg; on the south flank of
Kinchinjunga, and of 22&deg; in Tibet; in both cases annuals and
perennial-rooted herbaceous plants are to be found at elevations
corresponding to these mean temperatures, and often at higher
elevations in sheltered localities. I have assumed the decrease of
temperature for a corresponding</p>

<p class="fnote">* This is contrary to the conclusions of all
meteorologists who have studied the climate of the Alps, and is
entirely due to the local disturbances which I have so often dwelt
upon, and principally to the unequal distribution of moisture in
the loftier rearward regions, and the aridity of Tibet. Professor
James Forbes states (Ed. Phil. Trans., v. xiv. p. 489):&mdash;1.
That the decrement of temperature with altitude is most rapid in
summer: this (as I shall hereafter show) is not the case in the
Himalaya, chiefly because the warm south moist wind then prevails.
2. That the annual range of temperature diminishes with the
elevation: this, too, is not the case in Sikkim, because of the
barer surface and more cloudless skies of the rearward loftier
regions. 3. That the diurnal range of temperature diminishes with
the height: that this is not the cane follows from the same cause.
4. That radiation is least in winter: this is negatived by the
influence of the summer rains.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 406">[ 406 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">amount of elevation to be gradually less in
ascending (1&deg;=320 feet at 6000 to 10,000 feet, 1&deg;=400 feet
at 14,000 to 18,000 feet). My observations appear to prove this,
but I do not regard them as conclusive; supposing them to be so, I
attribute it to a combination of various causes, especially to the
increased elevation and yet unsnowed condition of the mass of land
elevated above 16,000 feet, and consequent radiation of heat; also
to the greater amount of sunshine there; and to the less dense
mists which obstruct the sun&rsquo;s rays at all elevations. In
corroboration of this I may mention that the decrease of
temperature with elevation is much less in summer than in winter,
1&deg; of Fahr. being equivalent to only 250 feet in January
between 7000 and 13,000 feet, and to upwards of 400 feet in July.
Again, at Dorjiling (7,430 feet) the temperature hardly ever rises
above 70&deg; in the summer months, yet it often rises even higher
in Tibet at 12,000 to 14,000 feet. On the other hand, the winters,
and the winter nights especially, are disproportionately cold at
great heights, the thermometer falling upwards of 40&deg; below the
Dorjiling temperature at an elevation only 6000 feet higher.</p>

<p class="app">The diurnal distribution of temperature is equally
and similarly affected by the presence of vapour at different
altitudes. The lower and outer ranges of 6000 to 10,000 feet, first
receive the diurnal charge of vapour-loaded southerly winds; those
beyond them get more of the sun&rsquo;s rays, and the rearward ones
more still. Though the summer days of the northern localities are
warmer than their elevation would indicate, the nights are not
proportionally cold; for the light mist of 14,000 feet, which
replaces the dense fog of 7000 feet, effectually obstructs
nocturnal radiation, though it is less an obstacle to solar
radiation. Clear nights, be it observed, are as rare at Momay
(15,300 feet) as at Dorjiling, the nights if windy being rainy; or,
if calm, cold currents descend from the mountains, condensing the
moist vapours of the valleys, whose narrow floors are at sunrise
bathed in mist at all elevations in Sikkim. The rise and dispersion
of these dense mists, and their collection and recondensation on
the mountains in the morning, is one of the most magnificent
phenomena of the Himalaya, when viewed from a proper elevation; it
commences as soon as the sun appears on the horizon.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 407">[ 407 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app">The mean daily range of the thermometer at 7000 feet
is 13&deg; in cleared spots, but considerably less in wooded, and
certainly one-third less in the forest itself. At Calcutta, which
has almost an insular climate, it amounts to 17&deg;; at Delhi,
which has a continental one, to 24&middot;6&deg;; and in London to
17&middot;5&deg;. At 11,000 feet it amounts to about 20&deg;, and
at 15,000 feet to 27&deg;. These values vary widely in the
different months, being much less in the summer or rainy months.
The following is probably a fair approximation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="app1">At 7,000 feet it amounts to 8&ndash;9&deg; in Aug.
and Sept., and 17&deg; in Dec.<br>
At 11,000 feet it amounts to 12&deg; in Aug. and Sept., and 30&deg;
in Dec.<br>
At 15,000 feet it amounts to 15&deg; in Aug. and Sept., and 40&deg;
in Dec.<br>
At London it amounts to 20&deg; in Aug. and Sept., and 10&deg; in
Dec.</p>

<p class="app">The distribution of temperature throughout the day
and year varies less at Dorjiling than in most mountainous
countries, owing to the prevailing moisture, the effect of which is
analogous to that of a circumambient ocean to an island: the
difference being, that in the case of the island the bulk of water
maintains an uniform temperature; in that of Dorjiling the quantity
of vapour acts directly by interfering with terrestrial and
solar-radiation, and indirectly by nurturing a luxuriant
vegetation. The result in the latter case is a climate remarkable
for its equability, and similar in many features to that of New
Zealand, South-west Chili, Fuegia, and the damp west coasts of
Scotland and Ireland, and other countries exposed to moist sea
winds.</p>

<p class="app">The mean temperature of the year at Dorjiling, as
taken by maxima and minima thermometers* by Dr. Chapman, is nearly
the same as that of March and October: January, the coldest month,
is more than 13&middot;4&deg; colder than the mean of the year; but
the hottest month is only 8&middot;3&deg; warmer than the same
mean: at Calcutta the months vary less from the mean; at Delhi
more; and in London the distribution is wholly different; there
being no rains to modify the summer heat, July is 13&deg; hotter,
and January 14&deg; colder than the mean of the year.</p>

<p class="fnote">* The mean of several of the months, thus deduced,
often varies a good deal from the truth, owing to the unequal
diurnal distribution of heat; a very few minutes&rsquo; sunshine
raises the temperature l0&deg; or 15&deg; above the mean of the
day; which excessive heat (usually transient) the maximum
thermometer registers, and consequently gives too high a mean.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 408">[ 408 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app">This distribution of the seasons has a most
important effect upon vegetation, to which sufficient attention has
not been paid by cultivators of alpine Indian plants; in the first
place, though English winters are cold enough for such, the summers
are too hot and dry; and, in the second place, the great accession
of temperature, causing the buds to burst in spring, occurs in the
Himalaya in March, when the temperature at 7000 feet rises 8&deg;
above that of February, raising the radiating thermometer always
above the freezing point, whence the young leaves are never injured
by night frost: in England the corresponding rise is only 3&deg;,
and there is no such accession of temperature till May, which is
8&deg; warmer than April; hence, the young foliage of many
Himalayan plants is cut off by night frosts in English gardens
early in the season, of which <i>Abies Webbiana</i> is a
conspicuous example.</p>

<p class="app">The greatest heat of the day occurs at Dorjiling
about noon, owing to the prevalent cloud, especially during the
rainy months, when the sun shines only in the mornings, if at all,
and the clouds accumulate as the day advances. According to hourly
observations of my own, it occurred in July at noon, in August at 1
p.m., and in September (the most rainy month) there was only
four-tenths of a degree difference between the means of noon, 1
p.m., and 2 p.m., but I must refer to the abstracts at the end of
this chapter for evidence of this, and of the wonderful uniformity
of temperature during the rainy months. In the drier season again,
after September, the greatest heat occurs between 2 and 3 p.m.; in
Calcutta the hottest hour is about 2.45 p.m., throughout the year;
and in England also about 3 p.m.</p>

<p class="app">The hour whose temperature coincides with the mean
of the day necessarily varies with the distribution of cloud and
sunshine; it is usually about 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.; whereas in
Calcutta the same coincidence occurs at a little before 10 a.m.,
and in England at about 8 a.m.</p>

<p class="app">Next to the temperature of the air, observations on
that of the earth are perhaps of the greatest value; both from
their application to horticulture, and from the approximation they
afford to the mean temperature of the week or month in which they
are taken. These form the subject of a separate chapter.</p>

<p class="app">Nocturnal and solar radiation, the one causing the
formation of</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 409">[ 409 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">dew and hoar-frost when the air in the shade is
above freezing, end killing plants by the rapid abstraction of heat
from all their surfaces which are exposed to the clear sky, and the
other scorching the skin and tender plants during the day, are now
familiar phenomena, and particularly engaged my attention during my
whole Indian journey. Two phenomena particularly obstruct radiation
in Sikkim&mdash;the clouds and fog from the end of May till
October, and the haze from February till May. Two months alone are
usually clear; one before and one after the rains, when the air,
though still humid, is transparent. The haze has never been fully
explained, though a well-known phenomenon. On the plains of India,
at the foot of the hills, it begins generally in the forenoon of
the cold season, with the rise of the west wind; and, in February
especially, obscures the sun&rsquo;s disc by noon; frequently it
lasts throughout the twenty-four hours, and is usually accompanied
by great dryness of the atmosphere. It gradually diminishes in
ascending, and have never experienced it at 10,000 feet; at 7000,
however, it very often, in April, obscures the snowy ranges 30
miles off, which are bright and defined at sunrise, and either pale
away, or become of a lurid yellow-red, according to the density of
this haze, till they disappear at 10 a.m. I believe it always
accompanies a south-west wind (which is a deflected current of the
north-west) and dry atmosphere in Sikkim.</p>

<p class="app">The observations for solar radiation were taken with
a black-bulb thermometer, and also with actinometers, but the value
of the data afforded by the latter not being fixed or comparative,
I shall give the results in a separate section. (See <a href=
"appJ-K.html#page 459">Appendix K.</a>) From a multitude of
desultory observations, I conclude that at 7,400 feet,
125&middot;7&deg;, or +67&deg; above the temperature of the air, is
the average maximum effect of the sun&rsquo;s rays on a black-bulb
thermometer* throughout the year, amounting rarely to +70&deg; and
+80&deg; in the summer months, but more frequently in the winter or
spring. These results, though greatly above what are obtained at
Calcutta, are not much, if at all, above what may be observed on
the plains of India. This effect is</p>

<p class="fnote">* From the mean of very many observations, I find
that 10&deg; is the average difference at the level of the sea, in
India, between two similar thermometers, with spherical bulbs
(half-inch diam.), the one of black, and the other of plain glass,
and both being equally exposed to the sun&rsquo;s rays.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 410">[ 410 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">much increased with the elevation. At 10,000 feet
in December, at 9 a.m., I saw the mercury mount to 132&deg; with a
difl: of +94&deg;, whilst the temperature of shaded snow hard by
was 22&deg;; at 13,100 feet, in January, at 9 a.m., it has stood at
98&deg;, diff. +68&middot;2&deg;; and at 10 a.m., at 114&deg;,
diff. +81&middot;4&deg;, whilst the radiating thermometer on the
snow had fallen at sunrise to 0&middot;7&deg;. In December, at
13,500 feet, I have seen it 110&deg;, diff. +84&deg;; at 11 a.m.,
11,500 feet; 122&deg;, diff: +82&deg;. This is but a small
selection from many instances of the extraordinary power of solar
radiation in the coldest months, at great elevations.</p>

<p class="app">Nocturnal and terrestrial radiation are even more
difficult phenomena for the traveller to estimate than solar
radiation, the danger of exposing instruments at night being always
great in wild countries. I most frequently used a thermometer
graduated on the glass, and placed in the focus of a parabolic
reflector, and a similar one laid upon white cotton,* and found no
material difference in the mean of many observations of each,
though often 1&deg; to 2&deg; in individual ones. Avoiding
radiation from surrounding objects is very difficult, especially in
wooded countries. I have also tried the radiating power of grass
and the earth; the temperature of the latter is generally less, and
that of the former greater, than the thermometer exposed on cotton
or in the reflector, but much depends on the surface of the herbage
and soil.</p>

<p class="app">The power of terrestrial, like that of solar
radiation, increases with the elevation, but not in an equal
proportion. At 7,400 feet, the mean of all my observations shows a
temperature of 35&middot;4&deg;. During the rains, 3&deg; to 4&deg;
is the mean maximum, but the nights being almost invariably cloudy,
it is scarcely on one night out of six that there is any radiation.
From October to December the amount is greater=10&deg; to 12, and
from January till May greater</p>

<p class="fnote">* Snow radiates the most powerfully of any
substance I have tried; in one instance, at 13,000 feet, in
January, the thermometer on snow fell to 0&middot;2&deg;, which was
10&middot;8&deg; below the temperature at the time, the grass
showing 6&middot;7&deg;; and on another occasion to
1&middot;2&deg;, when the air at the time (before sunrise) was
21&middot;2&deg;; the difference therefore being 20&deg;. I have
frequently made this observation, and always with a similar result;
it may account for the great injury plants sustain from a thin
covering of ice on their foliage, even when the temperature is but
little below the freezing-point.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 411">[ 411 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">still, being as much as 15&deg;. During the winter
months the effect of radiation is often felt throughout the clear
days, dew forming abundantly at 4000 to 8000 feet in the shaded
bottoms of narrow valleys, into which the sun does not penetrate
till 10 a.m., and from which it disappears at 3 p.m. I have seen
the thermometer in the reflector fall 12&deg; at 10 a.m. in a
shaded valley. This often produces an anomalous effect, causing the
temperature in the shade to fall after sunrise; for the mists which
condense in the bottom of the valleys after midnight disperse after
sunrise, but long before reached by the sun, and powerful radiation
ensues, lowering the surrounding temperature: a fall of 1&deg; to
2&deg; after sunrise of air in the shade is hence common in valleys
in November and December.* The excessive radiation of the winter
months often gives rise to a curious phenomenon; it causes the
formation of copious dew on the blanket of the traveller&rsquo;s
bed, which radiates heat to the tent roof, and this inside either
an open or a closed tent. I have experienced this at various
elevations, from 6000 to 16,000 feet. Whether the minimum
temperature be as high as 50&deg;, or but little above zero, the
effect is the same, except that hoar-frost or ice forms in the
latter case. Another remarkable effect of nocturnal radiation is
the curl of the alpine rhododendron leaves in November, which is
probably due to the freezing and consequent expansion of the water
in the upper strata of cells exposed to the sky. The first curl is
generally repaired by the ensuing day&rsquo;s sun, but after two or
three nights the leaves become permanently curled, and remain so
till they fall in the following spring.</p>

<p class="app">I have said that the nocturnal radiation in the
English spring months is the great obstacle to the cultivation of
many Himalayan plants; but it is not therefore to be inferred that
there is no similar amount of radiation in the Himalaya; for, on
the contrary, in April its amount is much greater than in England,
frequently equalling 13&deg; of difference; and I have seen 16&deg;
at 7,500 feet; but the minimum</p>

<p class="fnote">* Such is the explanation which I have offered of
this phenomenon in the Hort. Soc. Journal. On thinking over the
matter since, I have speculated upon the probability of this fall
of temperature being due to the absorption of heat that must become
latent on the dispersion of the dense masses of white fog that
choke the valleys at sunrise.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 412">[ 412 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">temperature at the time is 51&deg;, and the
absolute amount of cold therefore immaterial. The mean minimum of
London is 38&deg;, and, when lowered 5&middot;5&deg; by radiation,
the consequent cold is very considerable. Mr. Daniell, in his
admirable essay on the climate of London, mentions 17&deg; as the
maximum effect of nocturnal radiation ever observed by him. I have
registered 16&deg; in April at Dorjiling; nearly as much at 6000
feet in February; twice 13&deg;, and once 14&middot;2&deg; in
September at 15,500 feet; and 10&deg; in October at 16,800 feet;
nearly 13&deg; in January at 7000 feet; 14&middot;5&deg; in
February at that elevation, and, on several occasions,
14&middot;7&deg; at 10,000 feet in November.</p>

<p class="app">The annual rain-fall at Dorjiling averages 120
inches (or 10 feet), but varies from 100 to 130 in different years;
this is fully three times the amount of the average English fall,*
and yet not one-fourth of what is experienced on the Khasia hills
in Eastern Bengal, where fifty feet of rain falls. The greater
proportion descends between June and September, as much as thirty
inches sometimes falling in one month. From November to February
inclusive, the months are comparatively dry; March and October are
characterised by violent storms at the equinoxes, with thunder,
destructive lightning, and hail.</p>

<p class="app">The rain-gauge takes no account of the enormous
deposition from mists and fogs: these keep the atmosphere in a
state of moisture, the amount of which I have estimated at
0&middot;88 as the saturation-point at Dorjiling, 0&middot;83 being
that of London. In July, the dampest month, the saturation-point is
0&middot;97; and in December, owing to the dryness of the air on
the neighbouring plains of India, whence dry blasts pass over
Sikkim, the mean saturation-point of the month sometimes falls as
low as 0&middot;69.</p>

<p class="app">The dew-point is on the average of the year
49&middot;3&deg;, or 3&deg; below the mean temperature of the air.
In the dampest month (July) the mean dew-point is only eight-tenths
of a degree below the temperature, whilst in December it sinks
10&deg; below it. In London the</p>

<p class="fnote">* The general ideas on the subject of the English
rain-fall are so very vague, that I may be pardoned for reminding
my readers that in 1852, the year of extraordinary rain, the
amounts varied from 28&middot;5 inches in Essex, to 50 inches at
Cirencester, and 67&middot;5 (average of five years) at Plympton
St. Mary&rsquo;s, and 102&middot;5 at Holme, on the Dart.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 413">[ 413 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">dew-point is on the average 5&middot;6&deg; below
the temperature; none of the English months are so wet as those of
Sikkim, but none are so dry as the Sikkim December sometimes
is.<br>
<br>
</p>

<center><i>On the weight of the atmosphere in Sikkim; and its
effects<br>
on the human frame.</i></center>

<p class="app">Of all the phenomena of climate, the weight of the
atmosphere is the most remarkable for its elusion of direct
observation, when unaided by instruments. At the level of the sea,
a man of ordinary bulk and stature is pressed upon by a
superincumbent weight of 30,000 pounds or 13&middot;5 tons. An inch
fall or rise in the barometer shows that this load is lightened or
increased, sometimes in a few hours, by nearly 1,000 pounds; and no
notice is taken of it, except by the meteorologist, or by the
speculative physician, seeking the subtle causes of epidemic and
endemic complaints. At Dorjiling (7,400 feet), this load is reduced
to less than 2,500 pounds, with no appreciable result whatever on
the frame, however suddenly it be transported to that elevation.
And the observation of my own habits convinced me that I took the
same amount of meat, drink, sleep, exercise and work, not only
without inconvenience, but without the slightest perception of my
altered circumstances. On ascending to 14,000 feet, owing to the
diminished supply of oxygen, exercise brings on vertigo and
headache; ascending higher still, lassitude and tension across the
forehead ensue, with retching, and a sense of weight dragging down
the stomach, probably due to dilatation of the air contained in
that organ. Such are the all but invariable effects of high
elevations; varying with most persons according to the suddenness
and steepness of the ascent, the amount and duration of exertion,
and the length of time previously passed at great heights. After
having lived for some weeks at 15,300 feet, I have thence ascended
several times to 18,500, and once above 19,000 feet, without any
sensations but lassitude and quickness of pulse;* but in these
instances it required great caution to avoid painful symptoms.
Residing at 15,300 feet, however, my functions were wholly
undisturbed; nor could I detect any quickness of pulse</p>

<p class="fnote">* I have in a note to vol. ii. <a href=
"chap23.html#page 160">p. 160,</a> stated that I never experienced
in my own person, nor saw in others, bleeding at the ears, nose,
lips, or eyelids.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">or of respiration when the body was at rest, below
17,000 feet. At that elevation, after resting a party of eight men
for an hour, the average of their and my pulses was above 100&deg;,
both before and after eating; in one case it was 120&deg;, in none
below 80&deg;.</p>

<p class="app">Not only is the frame of a transient visitor
unaffected (when at rest) by the pressure being reduced from 30,000
to 13,000 pounds, but the Tibetan, born and constantly residing at
upwards of 14,000 feet, differs in no respect that can be
attributed to diminished pressure, from the native of the level of
the sea. The averaged duration of life, and the amount of food and
exercise is the same; eighty years are rarely reached by either.
The Tibetan too, however inured to cold and great elevations, still
suffers when he crosses passes 18,000 or 19,000 feet high, and
apparently neither more nor less than I did.</p>

<p class="app">Liebig remarks (in his &ldquo;Animal
Chemistry&rdquo;) that in an equal number of respirations,* we
consume a larger amount of oxygen at the level of the sea than on a
mountain; and it can be shown that under ordinary circumstances at
Dorjiling, 20&middot;14 per cent. less is inhaled than on the
plains of India. Yet the chest cannot expand so as to inspire more
at once, nor is the respiration appreciably</p>

<p class="fnote">* For the following note I am indebted to my
friend, C. Muller, Esq., of Patna.&mdash;</p>

<p class="fnote2">According to Sir H. Davy, a man consumes 45,504
cubic inches of oxygen in twenty-four hours, necessitating the
inspiration of 147,520 cubic inches of atmospheric air.&mdash;At
pressure 23 inches, and temp. 60&deg; this volume of atmospheric
air (dry) would weigh 35,138&middot;75 grains.&mdash;At pressure 30
in., temp. 80&deg;, it would weigh 43,997&middot;63 gr.</p>

<p class="fnote2">The amount of oxygen in atmospheric air is
23&middot;32 per cent. by weight. The oxygen, then, in 147,520
cubic inches of dry air, at pressure 23 in., temp. 80&deg;, weighs
8,194&middot;35 gr.; and at pressure 30 in., temp. 80&deg;, it
weighs 10,260&middot;25 gr.</p>

<p class="fnote2">Hence the absolute quantity of oxygen in a given
volume of atmospheric air, when the pressure is 23 in., and the
temp. 60&deg;, is 20&middot;14 per cent. less than when the
pressure is 30 in. and the temp. 80&deg;.</p>

<p class="fnote2">When the air at pressure 23 in:, temp. 60&deg;,
is saturated with moisture, the proportion of dry air and aqueous
vapour in 100 cubic inches is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="app1">quickened; by either of which means nature would be
enabled to make up the deficiency. It is true that it is difficult
to count one&rsquo;s own respirations, but the average is
considered in a healthy man to be eighteen in a minute; in my own
case it is sixteen, an acceleration of which by three or four could
not have been overlooked, in the repeated trials I made at
Dorjiling, and still less the eight additional inhalations required
at 15,000 feet to make up for the deficiency of oxygen in the air
of that elevation.</p>

<p class="app">It has long been surmised that an alpine vegetation
may owe some of its peculiarities to the diminished atmospheric
pressure; and that the latter being a condition which the gardener
cannot supply, he can never successfully cultivate such plants in
general. I know of no foundation for this hypothesis; many plants,
natives of the level of the sea in other parts of the world, and
some even of the hot plains of Bengal, ascend to 12,000 and even
15,000 feet on the Himalaya, unaffected by the diminished pressure.
Any number of species from low countries may be cultivated, and
some have been for ages, at 10,000 to 14,000 feet without change.
It is the same with the lower animals; innumerable instances may
with ease be adduced of pressure alone inducing no appreciable
change, whilst there is absence of proof to the contrary. The
phenomena that accompany diminished pressure are the real obstacles
to the cultivation of alpine plants, of which cold and the
excessive climate are perhaps the most formidable. Plants that grow
in localities marked by sudden extremes of heat and cold, are
always very variable in stature, habit, and foliage. In a state of
nature we say the plants &ldquo;accommodate themselves&rdquo; to
these changes, and so they do within certain limits; but for one
that survives of all the seeds that germinate in these inhospitable
localities, thousands die. In our gardens we can neither imitate
the conditions of an alpine climate, nor offer others suited to the
plants of such climates.</p>

<p class="app">The mean height of the barometer at Mr.
Hodgson&rsquo;s was 23&middot;010, but varied 0&middot;161 between
July, when it was lowest, and October, when it was highest;
following the monthly rise and fall of Calcutta as to period, but
not as to amount (or amplitude); for the mercury at Calcutta stands
in July upwards of half an inch (0&middot;555 Prinsep) lower than
it does in December.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 416">[ 416 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app">The diurnal tide of atmosphere is as constant as to
the time of its ebb and flow at Dorjiling as at Calcutta; and a
number of very careful observations (made with special reference to
this object) between the level of the plains of India, and 17,000
feet, would indicate that there is no very material deviation from
this at any elevation in Sikkim. These times are very nearly 9.50
a.m. and about 10 p.m. for the maxima, the 9.50 a.m. very
constantly, and the 10 p.m. with more uncertainty; and 4 a.m. and 4
p.m. for the minima, the afternoon ebb being most true to its time,
except during the rains.</p>

<p class="app">At 9.50 a.m. the barometer is at its highest, and
falls till 4 p.m., when it stands on the average of the year
0&middot;074 of an inch lower; during the same period the Calcutta
fall is upwards of one-tenth of an inch (0&middot;121 Prinsep).</p>

<p class="app">It has been proved that at considerable elevations
in Europe, the hours of periodic ebb and flow differ materially
from those which prevail at the level of the sea; but this is
certainly not the case in the Sikkim Himalaya.</p>

<p class="app">The amplitude decreases in amount from 0&middot;100
at the foot of the hills, to 0&middot;074 at 7000 feet; and the
mean of 132 selected unexceptionable observations, taken at nine
stations between 8000 and 15,500 feet, at 9.50 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
gives an average fall of 0&middot;056 of an inch; a result which is
confirmed by interpolation from numerous horary observations at
these and many other elevations, where I could observe at the
critical hours.</p>

<p class="app">That the Calcutta amplitude is not exceptionally
great, is shewn by the register kept at different places in the
Gangetic valley and plains of India, between Saharunpore and the
Bay of Bengal. I have seen apparently trustworthy records of seven*
such, and find that in all it amounts to between 0&middot;084 and
0&middot;120 inch, the mean of the whole being 0&middot;101 of an
inch.</p>

<p class="app">The amplitude is greatest (0&middot;088) in the
spring months (March, April, and May), both at Dorjiling and
Calcutta: it is least at both in June and July, (0&middot;027 at
Dorjiling), and rises again in autumn (to &middot;082 in
September).</p>

<p class="app">The horary oscillations also are as remarkably
uniform at all</p>

<p class="fnote">* Calcutta, Berampore, Benares, Nagpore,
Moozufferpore, Delhi, and Saharunpore.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 417">[ 417 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">elevations, as the period of ebb and flow: the
mercury falls slowly from 9.50 a.m. (when it is at its highest)
till noon, then rapidly till 3 p.m., and slowly again till 4 p.m.;
after which there is little change until sunset; it rises rapidly
between 7 and 9 p.m., and a little more till 10 p.m.; thence till 4
a.m. the fall is inconsiderable, and the great rise occurs between
7 and 9 a.m.</p>

<p class="app">It is well known that these fluctuations of the
barometer are due to the expansion and contraction by heat and
moisture of the column of atmosphere that presses on the mercury,
in the cistern of the instrument: were the air dry, the effect
would be a single rise and fall;* the barometer would stand highest
at the hottest of the twenty-four hours, and lowest at the coldest;
and such is the case in arid continental regions which are
perennially dry. That such would also be the case at Calcutta and
throughout the Himalaya of Sikkim, is theoretically self-evident,
and proved by my horary observations taken during the rainy months
of 1848. An inspection of these at the end of this section (where a
column contains the pressure of dry air) shows but one maximum of
pressure, which occurs at the coldest time of the twenty-four hours
(early in the morning), and one minimum in the afternoon. In the
table of mean temperatures of the months, also appended to this
section, will also be found a column allowing the pressure of dry
air, whence it will be seen that there is but one maximum of the
pressure of dry air, occurring at the coldest season in December,
and one minimum, in July. The effect of the vapour is the same on
the annual as upon the diurnal march of the pressure, producing a
double maximum and minimum in the year in one case, and in the
twenty-four hours in the other.</p>

<p class="app">I append a meteorological register of the separate
months, but at the same time must remind the reader that it does
not pretend to strict accuracy. It is founded upon observations
made at Dorjiling by Dr. Chapman in the year 1837, for pressure
temperature and wet-bulb only; the other data and some
modifications of the above are supplied from observations of my
own. Those for terrestrial and</p>

<p class="fnote">* This law, for which we are indebted to Professor
Dove, has been clearly explained by Colonel Sabine in the appendix
to his translation of Humboldt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cosmos,&rdquo; vol.

<p class="app1">nocturnal radiation are accurate as far as they go,
that is to say, they are absolute temperatures taken by myself,
which may, I believe, be recorded in any year, but much higher are
no doubt often to be obtained. The dew-points and saturations are
generally calculated from the mean of two day observations (10 a.m.
and 4 p.m.) of the wet-bulb thermometer, together with the minimum,
or are taken from observations of Daniell&rsquo;s hygrometer; and
as I find the mean of the temperature of 10 a.m., 4 p.m., and the
minimum, to coincide within a few tenths with the mean temperature
of the whole day, I assume that the mean of the wet-bulb
observations of the same hours will give a near approach to that of
the twenty-four hours. The climate of Dorjiling station has been in
some degree altered by extensive clearances of forest, which render
it more variable, more exposed to night frosts and strong sun-heat,
and to drought, the drying up of small streams being one direct
consequence. My own observations were taken at Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s
house, elevated 7,430 feet, the position of which I have indicated
at the commencement of this section, where the differences of
climate due to local causes are sufficiently indicated to show that
in no two spots could similar meteorological results be obtained.
At Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s, for instance, the uniformity of temperature
and humidity is infinitely more remarkable than at Dr.
Chapman&rsquo;s, possibly from my guarding more effectually against
radiation, and from the greater forests about Mr. Hodgson&rsquo;s
house. I have not, however, ventured to interfere with the
temperature columns on this account.</p>
