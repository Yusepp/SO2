<br>
<p class="first">We left Churra on the 17th of November, and taking
boats at Pundua, crossed the Jheels to the Soormah, which we
ascended to Silhet. Thence we continued our voyage 120 miles up the
river in canoes, to Silchar, the capital of the district of Cachar:
the boats were such as I described at Chattuc, and though it was
impossible to sit upright in them, they were paddled with great
swiftness. The river at Silhet is 200 yards broad; it is muddy, and
flows with a gentle current of two to three miles an hour, between
banks six to twelve feet high. As we glided up its stream, villages
became rarer, and eminences more frequent in the Jheels. The people
are a tall, bold, athletic Mahometan race, who live much on the
water, and cultivate rice, sesamum, and</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 327">[ 327 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">radishes, with betel-pepper in thatched enclosures
as in Sikkim: maize and sugar are rarer, bamboos abound, and four
palms (<i>Borassus, Areca,</i> cocoa-nut, and <i>Caryota</i>) are
planted, but there are no date-palms.</p>

<p>The Teelas (or hillocks) are the haunts of wild boars, tigers,
and elephants, but not of the rhinoceros; they are 80 to 200 feet
high, of horizontally stratified gravel and sand, slates, and clay
conglomerates, with a slag-like honey-combed sandstone; they are
covered with oaks, figs, <i>Heretiera,</i> and bamboos, and besides
a multitude of common Bengal plants, there are some which, though
generally considered mountain or cold country genera, here descend
to the level of the sea; such are <i>Kadsura, Rubus, Camellia,</i>
and <i>Sabia</i>; <i>Aerides</i> and <i>Saccolabia</i> are the
common orchids, and rattan-canes and <i>Pandani</i> render the
jungles impenetrable.</p>

<p>A very long sedge (<i>Scleria</i>) grows by the water, and is
used for thatching: boatloads of it are collected for the Calcutta
market, for which also were destined many immense rafts of bamboo,
100 feet long. The people fish much, using square and triangular
drop-nets stretched upon bamboos, and rude basket-work weirs, that
retain the fish as the river falls. Near the villages we saw
fragments of pottery three feet below the surface of the ground,
shewing that the bank, which is higher than the surrounding
country, increases from the annual overflow.</p>

<p>About seventy miles up the river, the mountains on the north,
which are east of Jyntea, rise 4000 feet high in forest-clad ranges
like those of Sikkim. Swamps extend from the river to their base,
and penetrate their valleys, which are extremely malarious: these
forests are frequented by timber-cutters, who fell jarool
(<i>Lagerstr&oelig;mia Regin&aelig;</i>), a magnificent tree with
red wood, which, though soft, is durable under</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 328">[ 328 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">water, and therefore in universal use for
boat-building. The toon is also cut, with red sandal-wood
(<i>Adenanthera pavonina</i>); also Nageesa,* <i>Mesua ferrea,</i>
which is highly valued for its weight, strength, and durability:
<i>Aquilaria agallocha,</i> the eagle-wood, a tree yielding uggur
oil, is also much sought for its fragrant wood, which is carried to
Silhet and Azmerigunj, where it is broken up and distilled. Neither
teak, sissoo, sal, nor other <i>Dipterocarpi,</i> are found in
these forests.</p>

<p>Porpoises, and both the long and the short-nosed alligator,
ascend the Soormah for 120 miles, being found beyond Silchar, which
place we reached on the 22nd, and were most hospitably received by
Colonel Lister, the political agent commanding the Silhet Light
Infantry, who was inspecting the Cookie levy, a corps of
hill-natives which had lately been enrolled.</p>

<p>The station is a small one, and stands about forty feet above
the river, which however rises half that height in the rains. Long
low spurs of tertiary rocks stretch from the Tipperah hills for
many miles north, through the swampy Jheels to the river; and there
are also hills on the opposite or north side, but detached from the
Cookie hills, as the lofty blue range twelve miles north of the
Soormah is called. All these mountains swarm with tigers, wild
buffalos, and boars, which also infest the long grass of the
Jheels.</p>

<p>The elevation of the house we occupied at Silchar was</p>

<p class="fnote">* There is much dispute amongst oriental scholars
about the word Nageesa; the Bombay philologists refer it to a
species of <i>Garcinia,</i> whilst the pundits on the Calcutta side
of India consider it to be <i>Mesua ferrea.</i> Throughout our
travels in India, we were struck with the undue reliance placed on
native names of plants, and information of all kinds; and the
pertinacity with which each linguist adhered to his own crotchet as
to the application of terms to natural objects, and their
pronunciation. It is a very prevalent, but erroneous, impression,
that savage and half-civilised people have an accurate knowledge of
objects of natural history, and a uniform nomenclature for
them.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 329">[ 329 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">116 feet above the sea. The bank it stood on was
of clay, with soft rocks of conglomerate, which often assume the
appearance of a brown sandy slag.</p>

<p>During the first Birmese war, Colonel Lister was sent with a
force up to this remote corner of Bengal, when the country was an
uninhabited jungle, so full of tigers that not a day passed without
one or more of his grass or wood-cutters being carried off. Now,
thousands of acres are cultivated with rice, and during our stay we
did not see a tiger. The quantity of land brought into cultivation
in this part of Bengal, and indeed throughout the Gangetic delta,
has probably been doubled during the last twenty years, and speaks
volumes for the state of the peasant under the Indian
Company&rsquo;s sway, as compared with his former condition. The
Silchar rice is of admirable quality, and much is imported to
Silhet, the Jheels not producing grain enough for the consumption
of the people. Though Silchar grows enough for ten times its
population, there was actually a famine six weeks before our
arrival, the demand from Silhet being so great.</p>

<p>The villages of Cachar are peopled by Mahometans, Munniporees,
Nagas, and Cookies; the Cacharies themselves being a poor and
peaceful jungle tribe, confined to the mountains north of the
Soormah. The Munniporees* are emigrants from the kingdom of that
name, which lies beyond the British possessions, and borders on
Assam and</p>

<p class="fnote">* The Munnipore valley has never been explored by
any naturalist, its mountains are said to be pine-clad, and to rise
8000 feet above the level of the sea. The Rajah is much harassed by
the Birmese, and is a dependant of the British, who are in the very
frequent dilemma of supporting on the throne a sovereign opposed by
a strong faction of his countrymen, and who has very dubious claims
to his position. During our stay at Silchar, the supposed rightful
Rajah was prevailing over the usurper; a battle had been fought on
the hills on the frontier, and two bodies floated past our
bungalow, pierced with arrows.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 330">[ 330 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Birmah. Low ranges of forest-clad mountains at the
head of the Soormah, separate it from Silchar, with which it is
coterminous; the two chief towns being seven marches apart. To the
south-east of Silchar are interminable jungles, peopled by the
Cookies, a wild Indo-Chinese tribe, who live in a state of constant
warfare, and possess the whole hill-country from this, southward to
beyond Chittagong. Two years ago they invaded and ravaged Cachar,
carrying many of the inhabitants into slavery, and so frightening
the people, that land previously worth six rupees a biggah, is now
reduced to one and a half. Colonel Lister was sent with a strong
party to rescue the captives, and marched for many days through
their country without disturbing man or beast; penetrating deep
forests of gigantic trees and tall bamboos, never seeing the sun
above, or aught to the right and left, save an occasional clearance
and a deserted village. The incursion, however, had its effects,
and the better inclined near the frontier have since come forward,
and been enrolled as the Cookie levy.</p>

<p>The Munnipore emigrants are industrious settlers for a time, but
never remain long in one place: their religion is Hindoo, and they
keep up a considerable trade with their own country, whence they
import a large breed of buffalos, ponies, silks, and cotton cloths
dyed with arnotto (<i>Bixa</i>), and universally used for turbans.
They use bamboo blowing-tubes and arrows for shooting birds, make
excellent shields of rhinoceros hide (imported from Assam), and
play at hockey on horseback like the Western Tibetans. A fine black
varnish from the fruit of <i>Holigarna longifolia,</i> is imported
from Munnipore, as is another made from <i>Sesuvium Anacardium</i>
(marking-nut), and a remarkable black pigment resembling that from
<i>Melanorh&oelig;a usitatissima,</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 331">[ 331 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">which is white when fresh, and requires to be kept
under water.*</p>

<p>One fine moonlight night we went to see a Munnipore dance. A
large circular area was thatched with plantain leaves, growing on
their trunks, which were stuck in the ground; and round the
enclosure was a border neatly cut from the white leaf-sheaths of
the same tree. A double enclosure of bamboo, similarly ornamented,
left an inner circle for the performers, and an outer for the
spectators: the whole was lighted with oil lamps and Chinese paper
lanterns. The musicians sat on one side, with cymbals, tomtoms, and
flutes, and sang choruses.</p>

<p>The performances began by a copper-coloured Cupid entering and
calling the virgins with a flute; these appeared from a green-room,
to the number of thirty or forty, of all ages and sizes. Each had
her hair dressed in a topknot, and her head covered with a veil; a
scarlet petticoat loaded with tinsel concealed her naked feet, and
over this was a short red kirtle, and an enormous white shawl was
swathed round the body from the armpits to the waist. A broad belt
passed over the right shoulder and under the left arm, to which
hung gold and silver chains, corals, etc., with tinsel and small
mirrors sewed on everywhere: the arms and hands were bare, and
decorated with bangles and rings.</p>

<p>Many of the women were extremely tall, great stature being
common amongst the Munniporees. They commenced with a prostration
to Cupid, around whom they danced very slowly, with the arms
stretched out, and the</p>

<p class="fnote">* This turns of a beautiful black colour when
applied to a surface, owing, according to Sir D. Brewster, to the
fresh varnish consisting of a congeries of minute organised
particles, which disperse the rays of light in all directions; the
organic structure is destroyed when the varnish dries and the rays
of light are consequently transmitted.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 332">[ 332 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">hands in motion; at each step the free foot was
swung backwards and forwards. Cupid then chose a partner, and
standing in the middle went through the same motions, a compliment
the women acknowledged by curtseying and whirling round, making a
sort of cheese with their petticoats, which, however, were too
heavy to inflate properly.</p>

<p>The Nagas are another people found on this frontier, chiefly on
the hills to the north: they are a wild, copper-coloured, uncouth
jungle tribe, who have proved troublesome on the Assam frontier.
Their features are more Tartar than those of the Munniporees,
especially amongst the old men. They bury their dead under the
threshold of their cottages. The men are all but naked, and stick
plumes of hornbills&rsquo; feathers in their hair, which is bound
with strips of bamboo: tufts of small feathers are passed through
their ears, and worn as shoulder lappets. A short blue cotton
cloth, with a fringe of tinsel and tufts of goat&rsquo;s hair dyed
red, is passed over the loins in front only: they also wear brass
armlets, and necklaces of cowries, coral, amber, ivory, and
boar&rsquo;s teeth. The women draw a fringed blue cloth tightly
across the breast, and wear a checked or striped petticoat. They
are less ornamented than the men, and are pleasing looking; their
hair is straight, and cut short over the eyebrows.</p>

<p>The Naga dances are very different from those of the
Munniporees; being quick, and performed in excellent time to
harmonious music. The figures are regular, like quadrilles and
country-dances: the men hold their knives erect during the
performance, the women extend their arms only when turning
partners, and then their hands are not given, but the palms are
held opposite. The step is a sort of polka and balancez, very
graceful and lively. A bar of music</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 333">[ 333 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">is always played first, and at the end the
spectators applaud with two short shouts. Their ear for music, and
the nature of their dance, are as Tibetan as their countenances,
and different from those of the Indo-Chinese tribes of the
frontier.</p>

<p>We had the pleasure of meeting Lieutenant Raban at Silchar, and
of making several excursions in the neighbourhood with him; for
which Colonel Lister here, as at Churra, afforded us every facility
of elephants and men. Had we had time, it was our intention to have
visited Munnipore, but we were anxious to proceed to Chittagong. I
however made a three days&rsquo; excursion to the frontier, about
thirty miles distant, proceeding along the north bank of the
Soormah. On the way my elephant got bogged in crossing a deep muddy
stream: this is sometimes an alarming position, as should the
animal become terrified, he will seize his rider, or pad, or any
other object (except his driver), to place under his knees to
prevent his sinking. In this instance the driver in great alarm
ordered me off, and I had to flounder out through the black mud.
The elephant remained fast all night, and was released next morning
by men with ropes.</p>

<p>The country continued a grassy level, with marshes and rice
cultivation, to the first range of hills, beyond which the river is
unnavigable; there also a forest commences, of oaks, figs, and the
common trees of east Bengal. The road hence was a good one, cut by
Sepoys across the dividing ranges, the first of which is not 500
feet high. On the ascent bamboos abound, of the kind called Tuldah
or Dulloah, which has long very thin-walled joints; it attains no
great size, but is remarkably gregarious. On the east side of the
range, the road runs through soft shales and beds of clay, and
conglomerates,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 334">[ 334 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">descending to a broad valley covered with gigantic
scattered timber-trees of jarool, acacia, <i>Diospyros,
Urtice&aelig;,</i> and <i>Bauhini&aelig;,</i> rearing their
enormous trunks above the bamboo jungle: immense rattan-canes wound
through the forest, and in the gullies were groves of two kinds of
tree-fern, two of <i>Areca, Wallichia</i> palm, screw-pine, and <i>
Drac&aelig;na.</i> Wild rice grew abundantly in the marshes, with
tall grasses; and <i>Cardiopteris</i>* covered the trees for
upwards of sixty feet, like hops, with a mass of pale-green
foliage, and dry white glistening seed-vessels. This forest
differed from those of the Silhet and Khasia mountains, especially
in the abundance of bamboo jungle, which is, I believe, the
prevalent feature of the low hills in Birmah, Ava, and Munnipore;
also in the gigantic size of the rattans, 1arger palms, and
different forest trees, and in the scanty undergrowth of herbs and
bushes. I only saw, however, the skirts of the forest; the
mountains further east, which I am told rise several thousand feet
in limestone cliffs, are doubtless richer in herbaceous plants.</p>

<p>The climate of Cachar partakes of that of the Jheels in its damp
equable character: during our stay the weather was fine, and dense
fogs formed in the morning: the mean maximum was 80&deg;, minimum
58&middot;4&deg;.&dagger;</p>

<p>The annual rain-fall in 1850 was 111&middot;60 inches, according
to a register kindly given me by Captain Verner. There are few
mosquitos, which is one of the most curious facts in the
geographical distribution of these capricious bloodsuckers; for the
locality is surrounded by swamps, and</p>

<p class="fnote">* A remarkable plant of unknown affinity; see
Brown and Bennett, &ldquo;Flora Java:&rdquo; it is found in the
Assam valley and Chittagong.<br>
&dagger; The temperature does not rise above 90&deg; in summer, nor
sink below 45&deg; or 50&deg; in January: forty-seven comparative
observations with Calcutta showed the mean temperature to be
1&middot;8&deg; lower at Silchar, and the air damper, the
saturation point being, at Calcutta 0&middot;3791, at Silchar
0&middot;4379.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 335">[ 335 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">they swarm at Silhet, and on the river lower down.
Both on the passage up and down, we were tormented in our canoes by
them for eighty or ninety miles above Silhet, and thence onwards to
Cachar we were free.</p>

<p>On the 30th of November, we were preparing for our return to
Silhet, and our canoes were loading, when we were surprised by a
loud rushing noise, and saw a high wave coming down the river,
swamping every boat that remained on its banks, whilst most of
those that pushed out into the stream, escaped with a violent
rocking. It was caused by a slip of the bank three quarters of a
mile up the stream, of no great size, but which propagated a high
wave. This appeared to move on at about the rate of a mile in three
or four minutes, giving plenty of time for our boatmen to push out
from the land on hearing the shouts of those first overtaken by the
calamity; but they were too timid, and consequently one of our
canoes, full of papers, instruments, and clothes, was swamped.
Happily our dried collections were not embarked, and the hot sun
repaired much of the damage.</p>

<p>We left in the evening of the 2nd of December, and proceeded to
Silhet, where we were kindly received by Mr. Stainforth, the
district judge. Silhet, the capital of the district of the same
name, is a large Mahometan town, occupying a slightly raised part
of the Jheels, where many of the Teelas seem joined together by
beds of gravel and sand. In the rains it, is surrounded by water,
and all communication with other parts is by boats: in winter,
Jynteapore and Pundua may be reached by land, crossing creeks
innumerable on the way. Mr. Stainforth&rsquo;s house, like those of
most of the other Europeans, occupies the top of one of the Teelas,
150 feet high, and is surrounded</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 336">[ 336 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">by fine spreading oaks,* <i>Garcinia,</i> and <i>
Diospyros</i> trees. The rock of which the hill is composed, is a
slag-like ochreous sandstone, covered in most places with a
shrubbery of rose-flowered <i>Melastoma,</i> and some peculiar
plants.&dagger;</p>

<p>Broad flat valleys divide the hills, and are beautifully clothed
with a bright green jungle of small palms, and many kinds of ferns.
In sandy places, blue-flowered <i>Burmannia, Hypoxis,</i> and other
pretty tropical annuals, expand their blossoms, with an
inconspicuous <i>Stylidium,</i> a plant belonging to a small
natural family, whose limits are so confined to New Holland, that
this is almost the only kind that does not grow in that continent.
Where the ground is swampy, dwarf <i>Pandanus</i> abounds, with the
gigantic nettle, <i>Urtica crenulata</i> (&ldquo;Mealum-ma&rdquo;
of Sikkim, see <a href="chap24.html#page 189">p. 189</a>).</p>

<p>The most interesting botanical ramble about Silhet is to the
tree-fern groves on the path to Jynteapore, following the bottoms
of shallow valleys between the Teelas, and along clear streams, up
whose beds we waded for some miles, under an arching canopy of
tropical shrubs, trees, and climbers, tall grasses, screw-pines,
and <i>Aroide&aelig;.</i> In the narrower parts of the valleys the
tree-ferns are numerous on the slopes, rearing their slender brown
trunks forty feet</p>

<p class="fnote">* It is not generally known that oaks are often
very tropical plants; not only abounding at low elevations in the
mountains, but descending in abundance to the level of the sea.
Though unknown in Ceylon, the Peninsula of India, tropical Africa,
or South America, they abound in the hot valleys of the Eastern
Himalaya, East Bengal, Malay Peninsula, and Indian islands; where
perhaps more species grow than in any other part of the world. Such
facts as this disturb our preconceived notions of the geographical
distribution of the most familiar tribes of plants, and throw great
doubt on the conclusions which fossil plants are supposed to
indicate.<br>
&dagger; <i>Gelonium, Adelia, Moacurra, Linostoma, Justicia,
Trophis, Connarus, Ixora, Congea, Dalhousiea, Grewia, Myrsine,
Buttneria</i>; and on the shady exposures a <i>Calamus,
Briedelia,</i> and various ferns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">high, with feathery crowns of foliage, through
which the sun-beams trembled on the broad shining foliage of the
tropical herbage below.</p>

<p>Silhet, though hot and damp, is remarkably healthy, and does not
differ materially in temperature from Silchar, though it is more
equable and humid.* It derives some interest from having been first
brought into notice by the enterprise of one of the Lindsays of
Balcarres, at a time when the pioneers of commerce in India
encountered great hardships and much personal danger. Mr. Lindsay,
a writer in the service of the East India Company, established a
factory at Silhet, and commenced the lime trade with
Calcutta,&dagger; reaping an enormous fortune himself, and laying
the foundation of that prosperity amongst the people which has been
much advanced by the exertions of the Inglis family, and has
steadily progressed under the protecting rule of the Indian
government.</p>

<p>From Silhet we took large boats to navigate the Burrampooter and
Megna, to their embouchure in the Bay of Bengal at Noacolly, a
distance of 250 miles, whence we were to proceed across the head of
the bay to Chittagong, about 100 miles farther. We left on the 7th
of December, and arrived at Chattuc on the 9th, where we met our
Khasia collectors with large loads of plants, and paid them off.
The river was now low, and presented a busy scene, from the
numerous trading boats being confined to its fewer and deeper
channels. Long grasses and sedges</p>

<p class="fnote">* During our stay of five days the mean maximum
temperature was 74&deg;, minimum 64&middot;8&deg;: that of
thirty-two observations compared with Calcutta show that Silhet is
only 1&middot;7&deg; cooler, though Mr. Stainforth&rsquo;s house is
upwards of 2&deg; further north, and 160 feet more elevated. A
thermometer sunk two feet seven inches, stood at 73&middot;5&deg;.
The relative saturation-points were, Calcutta &middot;633, Silhet
&middot;821.<br>

<p class="first">(<i>Arundo, Saccharum</i> and <i>Scleria</i>),
were cut, and stacked along the water&rsquo;s edge, in huge brown
piles, for export and thatching.</p>

<p>On the 13th December, we entered the broad stream of the Megna.
Rice is cultivated along the mud flats left by the annual floods,
and the banks are lower and less defined than in the Soormah, and
support no long grasses or bushes. Enormous islets of living
water-grasses (<i>Oplismenus stagninus</i>) and other plants,
floated past, and birds became more numerous, especially martins
and egrets. The sun was hot, but the weather otherwise cool and
pleasant: the mean temperature was nearly that of Calcutta,
69&middot;7&deg;, but the atmosphere was more humid.*</p>

<p>On the 14th we passed the Dacca river; below which the Megna is
several miles wide, and there is an appearance of tide, from masses
of purple <i>Salvinia</i> (a floating plant, allied to ferns),
being thrown up on the beach like sea-weed. Still lower down, the
vegetation of the Sunderbunds commences; there is a narrow beach,
and behind it a mud bank several feet high, supporting a luxuriant
green jungle of palms (<i>Borassus</i> and <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i>),
immense fig-trees, covered with <i>Calami,</i> and tall
betel-palms, clothed with the most elegant drapery of <i>Arostichum
scandens,</i> a climbing fern with pendulous fronds.</p>

<p>Towards the embouchure, the banks rise ten feet high, the river
expands into a muddy sea, and a long swell rolls</p>

<p class="fnote">* The river-water was greenish, and a little
cooler (73&middot;8&deg;) than that of the Soormah
(74&middot;3&deg;), which was brown and muddy. The barometer on the
Soormah stood 0&middot;028 inch higher than that of Calcutta (on
the mean of thirty-eight observations), whereas on the Megna the
pressure was 0&middot;010 higher. As Calcutta is eighteen feet
above the level of the Bay of Bengal, this shows that the Megna
(which has no perceptible current) is at the level of the sea, and
that either the Soormah is upwards of thirty feet above that level,
or that the atmospheric pressure there, and at this season, is less
than at Calcutta, which, as I have hinted at <a href=
"chap27.html#page 259">p. 259</a>, is probably the case.</p>

<br>

<p class="page"><a name="page 339">[ 339 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">in, to the disquiet of our fresh-water boatmen.
Low islands of sand and mud stretch along the horizon: which,
together with the ships, distorted by extraordinary refraction,
flicker as if seen through smoke. Mud is the all prevalent feature;
and though the water is not salt, we do not observe in these broad
deltas that amount of animal life (birds, fish, alligators, and
porpoises), that teems in the narrow creeks of the western
Sunderbunds.</p>

<p>We landed in a canal-like creek at Tuktacolly,* on the 17th, and
walked to Noacolly, over a flat of hard mud or dried silt, covered
with turf of <i>Cynodon Dactylon.</i> We were hospitably received
by Dr. Baker, a gentleman who has resided here for twenty-three
years; and who communicated to us much interesting information
respecting the features of the Gangetic delta.</p>

<p>Noacolly is a station for collecting the revenue and preventing
the manufacture of salt, which, with opium, are the only monopolies
now in the hands of the East India Company. The salt itself is
imported from Arracan, Ceylon, and even Europe, and is stored in
great wooden buildings here and elsewhere. The ground being
impregnated with salt, the illicit manufacture by evaporation is
not easily checked; but whereas the average number of cases brought
to justice used to be twenty and thirty in a week, they are now
reduced to two or three. It is remarkable, that though the soil
yields such an abundance of this mineral, the water of the Megna at
Noacolly is only brackish, and it is therefore to repeated
inundations and surface evaporations that the salt is due. Fresh
water is found at a very few feet depth everywhere, but it is not
good.</p>

<p>When it is considered how comparatively narrow the sea-board of
the delta is, the amount of difference in the</p>

<p class="fnote">* &ldquo;Colly&rdquo; signifies a muddy creek,
such as intersect the delta.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 340">[ 340 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">physical features of the several parts, will
appear most extraordinary. I have stated that the difference
between the northern and southern halves of the delta is so great,
that, were all depressed and their contents fossilised, the
geologist who examined each by itself, would hardly recognise the
two parts as belonging to one epoch; and the difference between the
east and west halves of the lower delta is equally remarkable.</p>

<p>The total breadth of the delta is 260 miles, from Chittagong to
the mouth of the Hoogly, divided longitudinally by the Megna: all
to the west of that river presents a luxuriant vegetation, while to
the east is a bare muddy expanse, with no trees or shrubs but what
are planted On the west coast the tides rise twelve or thirteen
feet, on the east, from forty to eighty. On the west, the water is
salt enough for mangroves to grow for fifty miles up the Hoogly; on
the east, the sea coast is too fresh for that plant for ten miles
south of Chittagong. On the west, fifty inches is the Cuttack fall
of rain; on the east, 90 to 120 at Noacolly and Chittagong, and 200
at Arracan. The east coast is annually visited by earthquakes,
which are rare on the west; and lastly, the majority of the great
trees and shrubs carried down from the Cuttack and Orissa forests,
and deposited on the west coast of the delta, are not only
different in species, but in natural order, from those that the
Fenny and Chittagong rivers bring down from the jungles.*</p>

<p>We were glad to find at Noacolly that our observations</p>

<p class="fnote">* The Cuttack forests are composed of teak, Sal,
Sissoo, ebony, <i>Pentaptera, Buchanania,</i> and other trees of a
dry soil, and that require a dry season alternating with a wet one.
These are unknown in the Chittagong forests, which have Jarool
(<i>Lagerstr&oelig;mia</i>) <i>Mesua, Dipterocarpi,</i> nutmegs,
oaks of several kinds, and many other trees not known in the
Cuttack forests, and all typical of a perennially humid
atmosphere.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 341">[ 341 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">on the progression westwards of the Burrampooter
(see <a href="chap27.html#page 253">p. 253</a>) were confirmed by
the fact that the Megna also is gradually moving in that direction,
leaving much dry land on the Noacolly side, and forming islands
opposite that coast; whilst it encroaches on the Sunderbunds, and
is cutting away the islands in that direction. This advance of the
fresh waters amongst the Sunderbunds is destructive to the
vegetation of the latter, which requires salt; and if the Megna
continues its slow course westwards, the obliteration of thousands
of square miles of a very peculiar flora, and the extinction of
many species of plants and animals that exist nowhere else, may
ensue. In ordinary cases these plants, etc., would take up their
abode on the east coast, as they were driven from the west; but
such might not be the case in this delta; for the sweeping tides of
the east coast prevent any such vegetation establishing itself
there, and the mud which the eastern rivers carry down, becomes a
caking dry soil, unsuited to the germination of seeds.</p>

<p>On our arrival at Calcutta in the following February, Dr.
Falconer showed us specimens of very modern peat, dug out of the
banks of the Hoogly a few feet below the surface of the soil, in
which were seeds of the <i>Euryale ferox</i>:* this plant is not
now known to be found nearer than Dacca (sixty miles north-east,
see <a href="chap27.html#page 255">p. 255</a>), and indicates a
very different state of the surface at Calcutta at the date of its
deposition than that which exists now, and also shows that the
estuary was then much fresher.</p>

<p>The main land of Noacolly is gradually extending seawards, and
has advanced four miles within twenty-</p>

<p class="fnote">* This peat Dr. Falconer also found to contain
bones of birds and fish, seeds of <i>Cucumis Madraspatana</i> and
another Cucurbitaceous plant, leaves of <i>Saccharum Sara</i> and
<i>Ficus cordifolia.</i> Specks of some glistening substance were
scattered through the mass, apparently incipient carbonisation of
the peat.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 342">[ 342 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">three years: this seems sufficiently accounted for
by the recession of the Megna. The elevation of the surface of the
land is caused by the overwhelming tides and south-west hurricanes
in May and October: these extend thirty miles north and south of
Chittagong, and carry the waters of the Megna and Fenny back over
the land, in a series of tremendous waves, that cover islands of
many hundred acres, and roll three miles on to the main land. On
these occasions, the average earthy deposit of silt, separated by
micaceous sand, is an eighth of an inch for every tide; but in
October, 1848, these tides covered Sundeep island, deposited six
inches on its level surface, and filled ditches several feet deep.
These deposits become baked by a tropical sun, and resist to a
considerable degree denudation by rain. Whether any further rise is
caused by elevation from below is doubtful; there is no direct
evidence of it, though slight earthquakes annually occur; and even
when they have not been felt, the water of tanks has been seen to
oscillate for three-quarters of an hour without intermission, from
no discernible cause.*</p>

<p>Noacolly is considered a healthy spot, which is not the case
with the Sunderbund stations west of the Megna. The climate is
uniformly hot, but the thermometer never rises above 90&deg;, nor
sinks below 45&deg;; at this temperature hoar-frost will form on
straw, and ice on water placed in porous pans, indicating a
powerful radiation.&dagger;</p>

<p class="fnote">* The natives are familiar with this phenomenon,
of which Dr. Baker remembers two instances, one in the cold season
of 1834&ndash;5, the other in that of 1830&ndash;1. The earthquakes
do not affect any particular month, nor are they accompanied by any
meteorological phenomena.<br>
&dagger; The winds are north-west and north in the cold season
(from November to March), drawing round to west in the afternoons.
North-west winds and heavy hailstorms are frequent from March to
May, when violent gales set in from the southward. The rains
commence in June, with easterly and southerly winds, and the
temperature from 82&deg; to 84&deg;; May and October are the
hottest months. The rains cease in the end of October (on the 8th
of November in 1849, and 12th of November in 1850, the latest epoch
ever remembered): there is no land or sea breeze along any part of
the coast. During our stay we found the mean temperature for twelve
observations to be precisely that of Calcutta, but the humidity was
more, and the pressure 0&middot;040 1ower.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 343">[ 343 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">We left Noacolly on the 19th for Chittagong; the
state of the tide obliging us to go on board in the night. The
distance is only 100 miles, but the passage is considered dangerous
at this time (during the spring-tides) and we were therefore
provided with a large vessel and an experienced crew. The great
object in this navigation is to keep afloat and to make progress
towards the top of the tide and during its flood, and to ground
during the ebb in creeks where the bore (tidal wave) is not
violent; for where the channels are broad and open, the height and
force of this wave rolls the largest coasting craft over and swamps
them.</p>

<p>Our boatmen pushed out at 3 in the morning, and brought up at 5,
in a narrow muddy creek on the island of Sidhee. The waters retired
along channels scooped several fathoms deep in black mud, leaving
our vessel aground six or seven feet below the top of the bank, and
soon afterwards there was no water to be seen; as far as the eye
could reach, all was a glistening oozy mud, except the bleak level
surfaces of the islands, on which neither shrub nor tree grew. Soon
after 2 p.m. a white line was seen on the low black horizon, which
was the tide-wave, advancing at the rate of five miles an hour,
with a hollow roar; it bore back the mud that was gradually
slipping along the gentle slope, and we were afloat an hour after:
at night we grounded again, opposite the mouth of the Fenny.</p>

<p>By moonlight the scene was oppressively solemn: on all sides the
gurgling waters kept up a peculiar sound that filled the air with
sullen murmurs; the moonbeams slept</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 344">[ 344 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">upon the slimy surface of the mud, and made the
dismal landscape more ghastly still. Silence followed the ebb,
broken occasionally by the wild whistle of a bird like the curlew,
of which a few wheeled through the air: till the harsh roar of the
bore was heard, to which the sailors seemed to waken by instinct.
The waters then closed in on every side, and the far end of the
reflected moonbeam was broken into flashing light, that approached
and soon danced beside the boat.</p>

<p>We much regretted not being able to obtain any more accurate
data than I have given, as to the height of the tide at the mouth
of the Fenny; but where the ebb sometimes retires twenty miles from
high-water mark, it is obviously impossible to plant any
tide-gauge.</p>

<p>On the 21st we were ashore at daylight on the Chittagong coast
far north of the station, and were greeted by the sight of hills on
the horizon: we were lying fully twenty feet below high-water mark,
and the tide was out for several miles to the westward. The bank
was covered with flocks of white geese feeding on short grass, upon
what appeared to be detached islets on the surface of the mud.
These islets, which are often an acre in extent, are composed of
stratified mud; they have perpendicular sides several feet high,
and convex surfaces, owing to the tide washing away the earth from
under their sides; and they were further slipping seawards, along
the gently sloping mud-beach. Few or no shells or seaweed were to
be seen, nor is it possible to imagine a more lifeless sea than
these muddy coasts present.</p>

<p>We were three days and nights on this short voyage, without
losing sight of mud or land. I observed the barometer whenever the
boat was on the shore, and found the mean of six readings (all
reduced to the same level) to be</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 345">[ 345 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">identical with that at Calcutta. These being all
taken at elevations lower than that of the Calcutta observatory,
show either a diminished atmospheric pressure, or that the mean
level of high-water is not the same on the east and west coasts of
the Bay of Bengal: this is quite possible, considering the widely
different direction of the tides and currents on each, and that the
waters may be banked up, as it were, in the narrow channels of the
western Sunderbunds. The temperature of the air was the same as at
Calcutta, but the atmosphere was damper. The water was always a
degree warmer than the air.</p>

<p>We arrived at Chittagong on the 23rd of December, and became the
guests of Mr. Sconce, Judge of the district, and of Mr. Lautour; to
both of whom we were greatly indebted for their hospitality and
generous assistance in every way.</p>

<p>Chittagong is a large town of Mahometans and Mugs, a Birmese
tribe who inhabit many parts of the Malay peninsula, and the coast
to the northward of it. The town stands on the north shore of an
extensive delta, formed by rivers from the lofty mountains
separating this district from Birma. These mountains are fine
objects on the horizon, rising 4000 to 8000 feet; they are
forest-clad, and inhabited by turbulent races, who are coterminous
with the Cookies of the Cachar and Tipperah forests; if indeed they
be not the same people. The mountains abound with the splendid
timber-trees of the Cachar forests, but like these are said to want
teak, Sal, and Sissoo; they have, besides many others,, magnificent
Gurjun trees (<i>Dipterocarpi</i>), the monarchs of the forests of
these coasts.</p>

<p>The natives of Chittagong are excellent shipbuilders and active
traders, and export much rice and timber to Madras and Calcutta.
The town is large and beautifully situated,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 346">[ 346 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">interspersed with trees and tanks; the hills
resemble those of Silhet, and are covered with a similar
vegetation: on these the European houses are built. The climate is
very healthy, which is not remarkable, considering how closely it
approximates in character to that of Silhet and other places in
Eastern Bengal, but very extraordinary, if it be compared with
Arracan, only 200 miles further south, which is extremely
unhealthy. The prominent difference between the physical features
of Chittagong and Arracan, is the presence of mangrove swamps at
the latter place, for which the water is too fresh at the
former.</p>

<p>The hills about the station are not more than 150 or 200 feet
high, and are formed of stratified gravel, sand, and clay, that
often becomes nodular, and is interstratified with slag-like iron
clay. Fossil wood is found; and some of the old buildings about
Chittagong contain nummulitic limestone, probably imported from
Silhet or the peninsula of India, with which countries there is no
such trade now. The views are beautiful, of the blue mountains
forty to fifty miles distant, and the many-armed river, covered
with sails, winding amongst groves of cocoa-nuts, Areca palm, and
yellow rice fields. Good European houses surmount all the
eminences, surrounded by trees of <i>Acacia</i> and <i>
C&aelig;salpinia.</i> In the hollows are native huts amidst
vegetation of every hue, glossy green <i>Garcini&aelig;</i> and
figs, broad plantains, feathery <i>Cassia</i> and Acacias, dark <i>
Mesua</i>, red-purple <i>Terminalia,</i> leafless scarlet-flowered
<i>Bombax,</i> and grey <i>Casuarina.</i>* Seaward the tide leaves
immense flats, called churs, which stretch for many miles on either
side the offing.</p>

<p class="fnote">* This, which is almost exclusively an Australian
genus, is not indigenous at Chittagong: to it belongs an
extra-Australian species common in the Malay islands, and found
wild as far north as Arracan.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 347">[ 347 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We accompanied Mr. Sconce to a bungalow which he has built at
the telegraph station at the south head of the harbour: its
situation, on a hill 100 feet above the sea, is exposed, and at
this season the sea-breeze was invigorating, and even cold, as it
blew through the mat-walls of the bungalow.* To the south,
undulating dunes stretch along the coast, covered with low bushes,
of which a red-flowered <i>Melastoma</i> is the most
prevalent,&dagger; and is considered a species of <i>
Rhododendron</i> by many of the residents! The flats along the
beach are several miles broad, intersected with tidal creeks, and
covered with short grass, while below high-water mark all is mud,
coated with green <i>Conferva.</i> There are no leafy seaweeds or
mangroves, nor any seaside shrub but <i>Dilivaria ilicifolia.</i>
Animal life is extremely rare; and a <i>Cardium</i>-like shell and
small crab are found sparingly.</p>

<p>Coffee has been cultivated at Chittagong with great success; it
is said to have been introduced by Sir W. Jones, and Mr. Sconce has
a small plantation, from which his table is well supplied. Both
Assam and Chinese teas flourish, but Chinamen are wanted to cure
the leaves. Black pepper succeeds admirably, as do cinnamon,
arrowroot, and ginger.</p>

<p>Early in January we accompanied Mr. Lautour on an excursion to
the north, following a valley separated from the coast by a range
of wooded hills, 1000 feet high. For several marches the bottom of
this valley was broad, flat, and full of villages. At Sidhee, about
twenty-five miles</p>

<p class="fnote">* The mean temperature of the two days (29th and
30th) we spent at this bungalow was 66&middot;5&deg;, that of
Calcutta being 67&middot;6&deg;; the air was damp, and the
barometer 0&middot;144 lower at the flagstaff hill, but it fell and
rose with the Calcutta instrument.<br>
&dagger; <i>Melastoma,</i> jasmine, <i>Calamus, &AElig;gle
Marmelos, Adelia, Memecylon, Ixora, Limostoma, Congea,</i> climbing
<i>C&oelig;salpinia,</i> and many other plants; and along their
bases large trees of <i>Amoora, Gaurea,</i> figs, <i>Mesua,</i> and
<i>Micromelon.</i></p>

<p class="first">from Chittagong, it contracts, and spurs from the
hills on either flank project into the middle: they are 200 to 300
feet high, formed of red clay, and covered with brushwood. At
Kajee-ke-hath, the most northern point we reached, we were quite
amongst these hills, and in an extremely picturesque country,
intersected by long winding flat valleys, that join one another:
some are full of copsewood, while others present the most beautiful
park-like scenery, and a third class expand into grassy marshes or
lake-beds, with wooded islets rising out of them. The hillsides are
clothed with low jungle, above which tower magnificent Gurjun trees
(wood-oil). The whole contour of this country is that of a low bay,
whose coast is raised above the sea, and over which a high tide
once swept for ages.</p>

<p>The elevation of Hazari-ke-hath is not 100 feet above the level
of the sea. It is about ten miles west of the mouth of the Fenny,
from which it is separated by hills 1000 feet high; its river falls
into that at Chittagong, thirty miles south. Large myrtaceous trees
(<i>Eugenia</i>) are common, and show a tendency to the Malayan
flora, which is further demonstrated by the abundance of Gurjun
(<i>Dipterocarpus turbinatus</i>). This is the most superb tree we
met with in the Indian forests: we saw several species, but this is
the only common one here; it is conspicuous for its gigantic size,
and for the straightness and graceful form of its tall unbranched
pale grey trunk, and small symmetrical crown: many individuals were
upwards of 200 feet high, and fifteen in girth. Its leaves are
broad, glossy, and beautiful; the flowers (then falling) are not
conspicuous; the wood is hard, close-grained, and durable, and a
fragrant oil exudes from the trunk, which is extremely valuable as
pitch and varnish, etc., besides being a good medicine. The natives
procure it by cutting transverse holes in the trunk, pointing</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 349">[ 349 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">downwards, and lighting fires in them, which
causes the oil to flow.*</p>

<p>On the 8th of January we experienced a sharp earthquake,
preceded by a dull thumping sound; it lasted about twenty seconds,
and seemed to come up from the southward; the water of a tank by
which we were seated was</p>

<p class="fnote">* The other trees of these dry forests are many
oaks, <i>Henslowia, Gordonia, Engelhardtia, Duabanga, Adelia,
Byttneria, Bradleia,</i> and large trees of <i>Pongamia,</i> whose
seeds yield a useful oil.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 350">[ 350 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">smartly agitated. The same shock was felt at
Mymensing and at Dacca, 110 miles north-west of this.*</p>

<p>We crossed the dividing ridge of the littoral range on the 9th,
and descended to Seetakoond bungalow, on the high road from
Chittagong to Comilla. The forests at the foot of the range were
very extensive, and swarmed with large red ants that proved very
irritating: they build immense pendulous nests of dead and living
leaves at the ends of the branches of trees, and mat them with a
white web. Tigers, leopards, wild dogs, and boars, are numerous; as
are snipes, pheasants, peacocks, and jungle-fowl, the latter waking
the morn with their shrill crows; and in strange association with
them, common English woodcock, is occasionally found.</p>

<p>The trees are of little value, except the Gurjun, and
&ldquo;Kistooma,&rdquo; a species of <i>Bradleia,</i> which was
stacked extensively, being used for building purposes. The
papaw&dagger;* is abundantly cultivated, and its great gourd-like
fruit is eaten (called &ldquo;Papita&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Chinaman&rdquo;); the flavour is that of a bad melon, and a
white juice exudes from the rind. The <i>Hodgsonia heteroclita</i>
(<i>Trichosanthes</i> of Roxburgh), a magnificent Cucurbitaceous
climber, grows in these forests; it is the same species as the
Sikkim one (see <a href="chap18.html#page 7">p. 7</a>). The long
stem bleeds copiously when cut, and like almost all woody climbers,
is full of large vessels; the juice does not, however, exude from
these great tubes, which hold air, but from the close woody fibres.
A climbing <i>Apocyneous</i> plant grows in these forests, the</p>

<p class="fnote">* Earthquakes are extremely common, and sometimes
violent, at Chittagong, and doubtless belong to the volcanic forces
of the Malayan peninsula.<br>
&dagger; The Papaw tree is said to have the curious property of
rendering tough meat tender, when hung under its leaves, or touched
with the juice; this hastening the process of decay. With this
fact, well-known in the West Indies, I never found a person in the
East acquainted.</p>

<p class="first">milk of which flows in a continuous stream,
resembling caoutchouc (it is probably the <i>Urceola elastica,</i>
which yields Indian-rubber).</p>

<p>The subject of bleeding is involved in great obscurity, and the
systematic examination of the motions in the juices of tropical
climbers by resident observers, offers a fertile field to the
naturalist. I have often remarked that if a climbing stem, in which
the circulation is vigorous, be cut across, it bleeds freely from
both ends, and most copiously from the lower, if it be turned
downwards; but that if a truncheon be severed, there will be no
flow from either of its extremities. This is the case with all the
Indian watery-juiced climbers, at whatever season they may be cut.
When, however, the circulation in the plant is feeble, neither end
of a simple cut will bleed much, but if a truncheon be taken from
it, both the extremities will.</p>

<p>The ascent of the hills, which are densely wooded, was along
spurs, and over knolls of clay; the rocks were sandy and slaty (dip
north-east 60&deg;. The road was good, but always through bamboo
jungle, and it wound amongst the low spurs, so that there was no
defined crest or top of the pass, which is about 800 feet high.
There were no tall palms, tree-ferns, or plantains, no <i>
Hymenophylla</i> or <i>Lycopodia,</i> and altogether the forest was
smaller and poorer in plants than we had expected. The only palms
(except a few rattans) were two kinds of <i>Wallichia.</i></p>

<p>From the summit we obtained a very extensive and singular view.
At our feet was a broad, low, grassy, alluvial plain, intersected
by creeks, bounding a black expanse of mud which (the tide being
out) appeared to stretch almost continuously to Sundeep Island,
thirty miles distant; while beyond, the blue hills of Tipperah rose
on</p>

<p class="first">the north-west horizon. The rocks yielded a dry
poor soil, on which grew dwarf <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i> and cycas-palm
(<i>Cycas circinalis</i> or <i>pectinata</i>).</p>

<p>Descending, we rode several miles along an excellent road, that
runs to Tipperah, and stopped at the bungalow of Seetakoond,
twenty-five miles north of Chittagong. The west flank of the range
which we had crossed is much steeper than the east, often
precipitous, and presents the appearance of a sea-worn cliff
towards the Bay of Bengal. Near Seetakoond (which is on the plain)
a hill on the range, bearing the same name, rises 1,136 feet high,
and being damper and more luxuriantly wooded, we were anxious to
explore it, and therefore spent some days at the bungalow. Fields
of poppy and sun (<i>Crotalaria juncea</i>), formed most beautiful
crops; the latter grows from four to six feet high, and bears
masses of laburnum-like flowers, while the poppy fields resembled a
carpet of dark-green velvet, sprinkled with white stars; or, as I
have elsewhere remarked, a green lake studded with
water-lilies.</p>

<p>The road to the top of Seetakoond leads along a most beautiful
valley, and then winds up a cliff that is in many places almost
precipitous, the ascent being partly by steps cut in the rock, of
which there are 560. The mountain is very sacred, and there is a
large Brahmin temple on its flank; and near the base a perpetual
flame bursts out of the rock. This we were anxious to examine, and
were extremely disappointed to find it a small vertical hole in a
slaty rock, with a lateral one below for a draught; and that it is
daily supplied by pious pilgrims and Brahmins with such enormous
quantities of ghee (liquid butter), that it is to all intents and
purposes an artificial lamp; no trace of natural phenomena being
discoverable.</p>

<p>On the dry but wooded west face of the mountain,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 353">[ 353 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">grows <i>Falconeria,</i> a curious Euphorbiaceous
tree, with an acrid milky juice that affects the eyes when the wood
is cut. Beautiful <i>Cycas</i> palms are also common, with <i>
Terminalia, Bignonia, Sterculia,</i> dwarf <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i>
palm, and Gurjun trees. The east slope of the mountain is damper,
and much more densely wooded; we there found two wild species of
nutmeg trees, whose wood is full of a brown acrid oil, seven palms,
tree-ferns, and many other kinds of ferns, several kinds of oak,
<i>Drac&aelig;na,</i> and figs. The top is 1,136 feet above the
sea, and commands an extensive view to all points of the compass;
but the forests, in which the ashy bark of the Gurjun trees is
conspicuous, and the beautiful valley on the west, are the only
attractive features.</p>

<p>The weather on the east side of the range differs at this season
remarkably from that on the west, where the vicinity of the sea
keeps the atmosphere more humid and warm, and at the same time
prevents the formation of the dense fogs that hang over the valleys
to the eastward every morning at sunrise. We found the mean
temperature at the bungalow, from January 9th till the 13th, to be
70&middot;2&deg;.</p>

<p>We embarked again at Chittagong on the 16th of January, at 10
p.m., for Calcutta, in a very large vessel, rowed by twelve men: we
made wretchedly slow progress, for the reasons mentioned above (<a
href="#page 343">p. 343</a>), being for four days within sight of
Chittagong! On the 20th we only reached Sidhee, and thence made a
stretch to Hattiah, an island which may be said to be moving bodily
to the westward, the Megna annually cutting many acres from the
east side; and the tide-wave depositing mud on the west. The
surface is flat, and raised four feet above mean high-water level;
the tide rises about 14 feet up the bank, and then retires for
miles; the total rise and fall is,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 354">[ 354 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">however, much less here than in the Fenny, higher
up the gulf. The turf is composed of <i>Cynodon</i> and a <i>
Fimbristylis</i>; and the earth being impregnated with salt,
supports different kinds of <i>Chenopodium.</i> Two kinds of
tamarisk, and a thorny <i>Cassia</i> and <i>Ex&oelig;caria,</i> are
the only shrubs on the eastern islands; on the central ones a few
dwarf mangroves appear, with the holly-leaved <i>Dilivaria,</i>
dwarf screw-pine (<i>Pandanus</i>), a shrub of <i>
Composit&aelig;,</i> and a curious fern, a variety of <i>Aristichum
aureum.</i> Towards the northern end of Hattiah, Talipot, cocoa-nut
and date-palms appear.</p>

<p>On the 22nd we entered the Sunderbunds, rowing amongst narrow
channels, where the tide rises but a few feet. The banks were
covered with a luxuriant vegetation, chiefly of small trees, above
which rose stately palms. On the 25th, we were overtaken by a
steamer from Assam, a novel sight to us, and a very strange one in
these creeks, which in some places seemed hardly broad enough for
it to pass through. We jumped on board in haste, leaving our boat
and luggage to follow us. She had left Dacca two days before, and
this being the dry season, the route to Calcutta, which is but
sixty miles in a straight line, involved a d&eacute;tour of three
hundred.</p>

<p>From the masts of the steamer we obtained an excellent <i>
coup-d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i> of the Sunderbunds; its swamps clothed
with verdure, and intersected by innumerable inosculating channels,
with banks a foot or so high. The amount of tide, which never
exceeds ten feet, diminishes in proceeding westwards into the heart
of these swamps, and the epoch, direction, and duration of the ebb
and flow vary so much in every canal, that at times, after stemming
a powerful current, we found ourselves, without materially changing
our course, suddenly swept along with a favouring stream.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 355">[ 355 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">This is owing to the complex ramifications of the
creeks, the flow of whose waters is materially influenced by the
most trifling accidents of direction.</p>

<p>Receding from the Megna, the water became saltier, and <i>Nipa
fruticans</i> appeared, throwing up pale yellow-green tufts of
feathery leaves, from a short thick creeping stem, and bearing at
the base of the leaves its great head of nuts, of which millions
were floating on the waters, and vegetating in the mud. Marks of
tigers were very frequent, and the footprints of deer, wild boars,
and enormous crocodiles: these reptiles were extremely common, and
glided down the mud banks on the approach of the steamer, leaving
between the footmarks a deep groove in the mud made by their tail.
The <i>Ph&oelig;nix paludosa,</i> a dwarf slender-stemmed
date-palm, from six to eight feet high, is the all-prevalent
feature, covering the whole landscape with a carpet of feathery
fronds of the liveliest green. The species is eminently gregarious,
more so than any other Indian palm, and presents so dense a mass of
foliage, that when seen from above, the stems are wholly
hidden.*</p>

<p>The water is very turbid, and only ten to twenty feet deep,
which, we were assured by the captain, was not increased during the
rains: it is loaded with vegetable matter, but the banks are always
muddy, and we never saw any peat. Dense fogs prevented our progress
in the morning, and we always anchored at dusk. We did not see a
village or house in the heart of the Sunderbunds (though such do
occur), but we saw canoes, with fishermen, who use the tame otter
in fishing; and the banks were covered with piles of firewood,
stacked for the</p>

<p class="fnote">* <i>Sonneratia, Heritiera littoralis,</i> and <i>
Careya,</i> form small gnarled trees on the banks, with deep
shining green-leaved species of <i>Carallia Rhizophora,</i> and
other Mangroves. Occasionally the gigantic reed-mace (<i>Typha
elephantina</i>) is seen, and tufts of tall reeds
(<i>Arundo</i>).</p>

<p class="first">Calcutta market. As we approached the Hoogly, the
water became very salt and clear; the Nipa fruits were still most
abundant, floating out to sea, but no more of the plant itself was
seen. As the channels became broader, sand-flats appeared, with old
salt factories, and clumps of planted <i>Casuarina.</i></p>

<p>On the 28th of January we passed Saugor island, and entered the
Hoogly, steamed past Diamond Harbour, and landed at the Botanic
Garden Ghat, where we received a hearty welcome from Dr. Falconer.
Ten days later we bade farewell to India, reaching England on the
25th of March, 1851.</p>
