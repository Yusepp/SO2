<p class=MsoNormal>As you may be aware, Project Gutenberg has been involved with</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the writings of both the Alexandre Dumases for some time now,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and since we get a few questions about the order in which the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>books should be read, and in which they were published, these</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>following comments should hopefully help most of our readers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>***</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The Vicomte de Bragelonne</u> is the final volume of D'Artagnan Romances:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>it is usually split into three or four parts, and the final portion</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>is entitled <u>The Man in the Iron Mask</u>.  <u>The Man in the Iron Mask</u> we're</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>familiar with today is the last volume of the four-volume edition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>[Not all the editions split them in the same manner, hence some of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the confusion. . .but wait. . .there's yet more reason for confusion.]</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We intend to do ALL of <u>The Vicomte de Bragelonne</u>, split into
four etexts</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>entitled <u>The Vicomte de Bragelonne</u>, <u>Ten Years Later</u>, <u>Louise
de la Vallière</u>,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and <u>The Man in the Iron Mask.</u></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One thing that may be causing confusion is that the etext we have now,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>entitled <u>Ten Years Later</u>, says it's the sequel to <u>The Three
Musketeers</u>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While this is technically true, there's another book, <u>Twenty Years
After</u>,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that comes between.  The
confusion is generated by the two facts that we </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>published <u>Ten Years Later</u> BEFORE we published <u>Twenty Years
After</u>, and</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>that many people see those titles as meaning Ten and Twenty Years
&quot;After&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the original story. . .however, this is why the different words
&quot;After&quot; and </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Later&quot;. . .the Ten Years &quot;After&quot; is ten years
after the Twenty Years later. . .as </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>per history.  Also, the third
book of the D'Artagnan Romances, while entitled </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The Vicomte de Bragelonne</u>, has the subtitle <u>Ten Years Later</u>.  These two </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>titles are also given to different volumes: <u>The Vicomte de
Bragelonne</u> can </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>refer to the whole book, or the first volume of the three or
four-volume </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>editions.  <u>Ten Years Later</u>
can, similarly, refer to the whole book, or the </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>second volume of the four-volume edition.  To add to the confusion, in </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the case of our etexts, it refers to the first 104 chapters of the
whole book, </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>covering material in the first and second etexts in the new

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Introduction:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In the months of March-July in
1844, in the magazine <i>Le Siècle</i>, the first portion of a story appeared,
penned by the celebrated playwright Alexandre Dumas.  It was based, he claimed, on some manuscripts he had found a year
earlier in the Bibliotheque Nationale while researching a history he planned to
write on Louis XIV.  They chronicled the
adventures of a young man named D'Artagnan who, upon entering Paris, became
almost immediately embroiled in court intrigues, international politics, and
ill-fated affairs between royal lovers. 
Over the next six years, readers would enjoy the adventures of this
youth and his three famous friends, Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, as their
exploits unraveled behind the scenes of some of the most momentous events in
French and even English history.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Eventually
these serialized adventures were published in novel form, and became the three
D'Artagnan Romances known today.  Here
is a brief summary of the first two novels:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The Three Musketeers</u> (serialized March - July, 1844):
The year is 1625.  The young D'Artagnan
arrives in Paris at the tender age of 18, and almost immediately offends three
musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos. 
Instead of dueling, the four are attacked by five of the Cardinal's
guards, and the courage of the youth is made apparent during the battle.  The four become fast friends, and, when
asked by D'Artagnan's landlord to find his missing wife, embark upon an
adventure that takes them across both France and England in order to thwart the
plans of the Cardinal Richelieu.  Along
the way, they encounter a beautiful young spy, named simply Milady, who will
stop at nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of Austria before her husband, Louis
XIII, and take her revenge upon the four friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Twenty Years After</u> (serialized January - August,
1845): The year is now 1648, twenty years since the close of the last
story.  Louis XIII has died, as has
Cardinal Richelieu, and while the crown of France may sit upon the head of Anne
of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV, the real power resides with the
Cardinal Mazarin, her secret husband. 
D'Artagnan is now a lieutenant of musketeers, and his three friends have
retired to private life.  Athos turned
out to be a nobleman, the Comte de la Fère, and has retired to his home with
his son, Raoul de Bragelonne.  Aramis,
whose real name is D'Herblay, has followed his intention of shedding the
musketeer's cassock for the priest's robes, and Porthos has married a wealthy
woman, who left him her fortune upon her death.  But trouble is stirring in both France and England.  Cromwell menaces the institution of royalty
itself while marching against Charles I, and at home the Fronde is threatening
to tear France apart.  D'Artagnan brings
his friends out of retirement to save the threatened English monarch, but
Mordaunt, the son of Milady, who seeks to avenge his mother's death at the
musketeers' hands, thwarts their valiant efforts.  Undaunted, our heroes return to France just in time to help save
the young Louis XIV, quiet the Fronde, and tweak the nose of Cardinal Mazarin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
third novel, <u>The Vicomte de Bragelonne</u> (serialized October, 1847 - January,
1850), has enjoyed a strange history in its English translation.  It has been split into three, four, or five
volumes at various points in its history. 
The five-volume edition generally does not give titles to the smaller
portions, but the others do.  In the
three-volume edition, the novels are entitled <u>The Vicomte de Bragelonne</u>,
<u>Louise de la Vallière</u>, and <u>The Man in the Iron Mask</u>.  For the purposes of this etext, I have
chosen to split the novel as the four-volume edition does, with these titles: <u>The
Vicomte de Bragelonne</u>, <u>Ten Years Later</u>, <u>Louise de la Vallière</u>,
and <u>The Man in the Iron Mask</u>.  In
the first two etexts:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>The Vicomte de Bragelonne</u> (Etext 2609): It is the
year 1660, and D'Artagnan, after thirty-five years of loyal service, has become
disgusted with serving King Louis XIV while the real power resides with the
Cardinal Mazarin, and has tendered his resignation.  He embarks on his own project, that of restoring Charles II to
the throne of England, and, with the help of Athos, succeeds, earning himself
quite a fortune in the process. 
D'Artagnan returns to Paris to live the life of a rich citizen, and
Athos, after negotiating the marriage of Philip, the king's brother, to
Princess Henrietta of England, likewise retires to his own estate, La Fère.  Meanwhile, Mazarin has finally died, and
left Louis to assume the reigns of power, with the assistance of M. Colbert,
formerly Mazarin's trusted clerk. 
Colbert has an intense hatred for M. Fouquet, the king's superintendent
of finances, and has resolved to use any means necessary to bring about his
fall.  With the new rank of intendant
bestowed on him by Louis, Colbert succeeds in having two of Fouquet's loyal
friends tried and executed.  He then
brings to the king's attention that Fouquet is fortifying the island of
Belle-Île-en-Mer, and could possibly be planning to use it as a base for some
military operation against the king. 
Louis calls D'Artagnan out of retirement and sends him to investigate
the island, promising him a tremendous salary and his long-promised promotion
to captain of the musketeers upon his return. 
At Belle-Isle, D'Artagnan discovers that the engineer of the
fortifications is, in fact, Porthos, now the Baron du Vallon, and that's not
all.  The blueprints for the island,
although in Porthos's handwriting, show evidence of another script that has
been erased, that of Aramis.  D'Artagnan
later discovers that Aramis has become the bishop of Vannes, which is,
coincidentally, a parish belonging to M. Fouquet.  Suspecting that D'Artagnan has arrived on the king's behalf to
investigate, Aramis tricks D'Artagnan into wandering around Vannes in search of
Porthos, and sends Porthos on an heroic ride back to Paris to warn Fouquet of
the danger.  Fouquet rushes to the king,
and gives him Belle-Isle as a present, thus allaying any suspicion, and at the
same time humiliating Colbert, just minutes before the usher announces someone
else seeking an audience with the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Ten Years Later</u> (Etext 2681): As 1661 approaches,
Princess Henrietta of England arrives for her marriage, and throws the court of
France into complete disorder.  The
jealousy of the Duke of Buckingham, who is in love with her, nearly occasions a
war on the streets of Le Havre, thankfully prevented by Raoul's timely and
tactful intervention.  After the
marriage, though, Monsieur Philip becomes horribly jealous of Buckingham, and
has him exiled.  Before leaving,
however, the duke fights a duel with M. de Wardes at Calais.  De Wardes is a malicious and spiteful man,
the sworn enemy of D'Artagnan, and, by the same token, that of Athos, Aramis,
Porthos, and Raoul as well.  Both men
are seriously wounded, and the duke is taken back to England to recover.  Raoul's friend, the comte de Guiche, is the
next to succumb to Henrietta's charms, and Monsieur obtains his exile as well,
though De Guiche soon effects a reconciliation.  But then the king's eye falls on Madame Henrietta during the
comte's absence, and this time Monsieur's jealousy has no recourse.  Anne of Austria intervenes, and the king and
his sister-in-law decide to pick a young lady with whom the king can pretend to
be in love, the better to mask their own affair.  They unfortunately select Louise de la Vallière, Raoul's fiancée.  While the court is in residence at
Fontainebleau, the king unwitting overhears Louise confessing her love for him
while chatting with her friends beneath the royal oak, and the king promptly
forgets his affection for Madame.  That
same night, Henrietta overhears, at the same oak, De Guiche confessing his love
for her to Raoul.  The two embark on
their own affair.  A few days later,
during a rainstorm, Louis and Louise are trapped alone together, and the whole
court begins to talk of the scandal while their love affair blossoms.  Aware of Louise's attachment, the king
arranges for Raoul to be sent to England for an indefinite period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Meanwhile,
the struggle for power continues between Fouquet and Colbert.  Although the Belle-Isle plot backfired,
Colbert prompts the king to ask Fouquet for more and more money, and without
his two friends to raise it for him, Fouquet is sorely pressed.  The situation gets so bad that his new
mistress, Madame de Bellière, must resort to selling all her jewels and her
gold and silver plate.  Aramis, while
this is going on, has grown friendly with the governor of the Bastile, M. de
Baisemeaux, a fact that Baisemeaux unwittingly reveals to D'Artagnan while
inquiring of him as to Aramis's whereabouts. 
This further arouses the suspicions of the musketeer, who was made to
look ridiculous by Aramis.  He had
ridden overnight at an insane pace, but arrived a few minutes after Fouquet had
already presented Belle-Isle to the king. 
Aramis learns from the governor the location of a mysterious prisoner,
who bears a remarkable resemblance to Louis XIV - in fact, the two are
identical.  He uses the existence of
this secret to persuade a dying Franciscan monk, the general of the society of
the Jesuits, to name him, Aramis, the new general of the order.  On Aramis's advice, hoping to use Louise's influence
with the king to counteract Colbert's influence, Fouquet also writes a love
letter to La Vallière, unfortunately undated. 
It never reaches its destination, however, as the servant ordered to
deliver it turns out to be an agent of Colbert's.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><u>Louise de la Vallière (Etext 2710)</u>: Believing
D'Artagnan occupied at Fontainebleau and Porthos safely tucked away at Paris,
Aramis holds a funeral for the dead Franciscan - but in fact, Aramis is wrong
in both suppositions.  D'Artagnan has
left Fontainebleau, bored to tears by the <i>fêtes</i>, retrieved Porthos, and
is visiting the country-house of Planchet, his old lackey.  This house happens to be right next door to
the graveyard, and upon observing Aramis at this funeral, and his subsequent
meeting with a mysterious hooded lady, D'Artagnan, suspicions aroused, resolves
to make a little trouble for the bishop. 
He presents Porthos to the king at the same time as Fouquet presents
Aramis, thereby surprising the wily prelate. 
Aramis's professions of affection and innocence do only a little to
allay D'Artagnan's concerns, and he continues to regard Aramis's actions with a
curious and wary eye.  Meanwhile, much
to his delight, Porthos is invited to dine with the king as a result of his
presentation, and with D'Artagnan's guidance, manages to behave in such a
manner as to procure the king's marked favor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
mysterious woman turns out to be the Duchesse de Chevreuse, a notorious schemer
and former friend of Anne of Austria. 
She comes bearing more bad news for Fouquet, who is already in trouble,
as the king has invited himself to a <i>fête</i> at Vaux, Fouquet's magnificent
mansion, that will surely bankrupt the poor superintendent.  The Duchesse has letters from Mazarin that
prove that Fouquet has received thirteen million francs from the royal coffers,
and she wishes to sell these letters to Aramis.  Aramis refuses, and the letters are instead sold to Colbert.  Fouquet, meanwhile, discovers that the
receipt that proves his innocence in the affair has been stolen from him.  Even worse, Fouquet, desperate for money, is
forced to sell the parliamentary position that renders him untouchable by any
court proceedings.  As part of her deal
with Colbert, though, Chevreuse also obtains a secret audience with the
queen-mother, where the two discuss a shocking secret - Louis XIV has a twin
brother, long believed, however, to be dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Meanwhile,
in other quarters, De Wardes, Raoul's inveterate enemy, has returned from
Calais, barely recovered from his wounds, and no sooner does he return than he
begins again to insult people, particularly La Vallière, and this time the
comte de Guiche is the one to challenge him. 
The duel leaves De Guiche horribly wounded, but enables Madame to use
her influence to destroy De Wardes's standing at court.  The <i>fêtes</i>, however, come to an end,
and the court returns to Paris.  The
king has been more than obvious about his affections for Louise, and Madame,
the queen-mother, and the queen join forces to destroy her.  She is dishonorably discharged from court,
and in despair, she flees to the convent at Chaillot.  Along the way, though, she runs into D'Artagnan, who manages to
get word back to the king of what has taken place.  By literally begging Madame in tears, Louis manages to secure
Louise's return to court - but Madame still places every obstacle possible
before the lovers.  They have to resort
to building a secret staircase and meeting in the apartments of M. de
Saint-Aignan, where Louis has a painter create a portrait of Louise.  But Madame recalls Raoul from London and
shows him these proofs of Louise's infidelity. 
Raoul, crushed, challenges Saint-Aignan to a duel, which the king
prevents, and Athos, furious, breaks his sword before the king.  The king has D'Artagnan arrest Athos, and at
the Bastile they encounter Aramis, who is paying Baisemeaux another visit.  Raoul learns of Athos's arrest, and with
Porthos in tow, they effect a daring rescue, surprising the carriage containing
D'Artagnan and Athos as they leave the Bastile.  Although quite impressive, the intrepid raid is in vain, as
D'Artagnan has already secured Athos's pardon from the king.  Instead, everybody switches modes of
transport; D'Artagnan and Porthos take the horses back to Paris, and Athos and
Raoul take the carriage back to La Fère, where they intend to reside
permanently, as the king is now their sworn enemy, Raoul cannot bear to see
Louise, and they have no more dealings in Paris.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis,
left alone with Baisemeaux, inquires the governor of the prison about his
loyalties, in particular to the Jesuits. 
The bishop reveals that he is a confessor of the society, and invokes
their regulations in order to obtain access to this mysterious prisoner who
bears such a striking resemblance to Louis XIV...</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And so Baisemeaux is conducting Aramis to the prisoner as
the final section of <u>The Vicomte de Bragelonne</u> and this final story of
the D'Artagnan Romances opens.  I have
written a &quot;Cast of Historical Characters,&quot; Etext 2760, that will
enable curious readers to compare personages in the novel with their historical
counterparts.  Also of interest may be
an essay Dumas wrote on the possible identity of the real Man in the Iron Mask,
which is Project Gutenberg Etext 2751.

Aramis's singular transformation into a confessor of the order, Baisemeaux was
no longer the same man.  Up to that
period, the place which Aramis had held in the worthy governor's estimation was
that of a prelate whom he respected and a friend to whom he owed a debt of
gratitude; but now he felt himself an inferior, and that Aramis was his
master.  He himself lighted a lantern,
summoned a turnkey, and said, returning to Aramis, &quot;I am at your orders,
monseigneur.&quot;  Aramis merely nodded
his head, as much as to say, &quot;Very good&quot;; and signed to him with his
hand to lead the way.  Baisemeaux
advanced, and Aramis followed him.  It
was a calm and lovely starlit night; the steps of three men resounded on the
flags of the terraces, and the clinking of the keys hanging from the jailer's
girdle made itself heard up to the stories of the towers, as if to remind the
prisoners that the liberty of earth was a luxury beyond their reach.  It might have been said that the alteration
effected in Baisemeaux extended even to the prisoners.  The turnkey, the same who, on Aramis's first
arrival had shown himself so inquisitive and curious, was now not only silent,
but impassible.  He held his head down,
and seemed afraid to keep his ears open. 
In this wise they reached the basement of the Bertaudière, the two first
stories of which were mounted silently and somewhat slowly; for Baisemeaux,
though far from disobeying, was far from exhibiting any eagerness to obey.  On arriving at the door, Baisemeaux showed a
disposition to enter the prisoner's chamber; but Aramis, stopping him on the
threshold, said, &quot;The rules do not allow the governor to hear the
prisoner's confession.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Baisemeaux
bowed, and made way for Aramis, who took the lantern and entered; and then
signed to them to close the door behind him. 
For an instant he remained standing, listening whether Baisemeaux and
the turnkey had retired; but as soon as he was assured by the sound of their
descending footsteps that they had left the tower, he put the lantern on the
table and gazed around.  On a bed of
green serge, similar in all respect to the other beds in the Bastile, save that
it was newer, and under curtains half-drawn, reposed a young man, to whom we
have already once before introduced Aramis. 
According to custom, the prisoner was without a light.  At the hour of curfew, he was bound to
extinguish his lamp, and we perceive how much he was favored, in being allowed
to keep it burning even till then.  Near
the bed a large leathern armchair, with twisted legs, sustained his
clothes.  A little table - without pens,
books, paper, or ink - stood neglected in sadness near the window; while
several plates, still unemptied, showed that the prisoner had scarcely touched
his evening meal.  Aramis saw that the
young man was stretched upon his bed, his face half concealed by his arms.  The arrival of a visitor did not caused any
change of position; either he was waiting in expectation, or was asleep.  Aramis lighted the candle from the lantern,
pushed back the armchair, and approached the bed with an evident mixture of
interest and respect.  The young man
raised his head.  &quot;What is
it?&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
desired a confessor?&quot; replied Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>                &quot;Because you were
ill?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes.&quot;<br>                &quot;Very ill?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
young man gave Aramis a piercing glance, and answered, &quot;I thank
you.&quot;  After a moment's silence,
&quot;I have seen you before,&quot; he continued.  Aramis bowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Doubtless
the scrutiny the prisoner had just made of the cold, crafty, and imperious character
stamped upon the features of the bishop of Vannes was little reassuring to one
in his situation, for he added, &quot;I am better.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
so?&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
then - being better, I have no longer the same need of a confessor, I
think.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Not
even of the hair-cloth, which the note you found in your bread informed you
of?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
young man started; but before he had either assented or denied, Aramis
continued, &quot;Not even of the ecclesiastic from whom you were to hear an
important revelation?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
it be so,&quot; said the young man, sinking again on his pillow, &quot;it is
different; I am listening.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
then looked at him more closely, and was struck with the easy majesty of his
mien, one which can never be acquired unless Heaven has implanted it in the
blood or heart.  &quot;Sit down,
monsieur,&quot; said the prisoner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
bowed and obeyed.  &quot;How does the
Bastile agree with you?&quot; asked the bishop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
well.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
do not suffer?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have nothing to regret?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Not
even your liberty?&quot;<br>                &quot;What do you call
liberty, monsieur?&quot; asked the prisoner, with the tone of a man who is
preparing for a struggle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
call liberty, the flowers, the air, light, the stars, the happiness of going
whithersoever the sinewy limbs of one-and-twenty chance to wish to carry
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
young man smiled, whether in resignation or contempt, it was difficult to
tell.  &quot;Look,&quot; said he,
&quot;I have in that Japanese vase two roses gathered yesterday evening in the
bud from the governor's garden; this morning they have blown and spread their
vermilion chalice beneath my gaze; with every opening petal they unfold the
treasures of their perfumes, filling my chamber with a fragrance that embalms
it.  Look now on these two roses; even
among roses these are beautiful, and the rose is the most beautiful of
flowers.  Why, then, do you bid me
desire other flowers when I possess the loveliest of all?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
gazed at the young man in surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
<i>flowers</i> constitute liberty,&quot;
sadly resumed the captive, &quot;I am free, for I possess them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
the air!&quot; cried Aramis; &quot;air is so necessary to life!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
monsieur,&quot; returned the prisoner; &quot;draw near to the window; it is
open.  Between high heaven and earth the
wind whirls on its waftages of hail and lightning, exhales its torrid mist or
breathes in gentle breezes.  It caresses
my face.  When mounted on the back of
this armchair, with my arm around the bars of the window to sustain myself, I
fancy I am swimming the wide expanse before me.&quot;  The countenance of Aramis darkened as the young man continued:
&quot;Light I have! what is better than light? 
I have the sun, a friend who comes to visit me every day without the
permission of the governor or the jailer's company.  He comes in at the window, and traces in my room a square the
shape of the window, which lights up the hangings of my bed and floods the very
floor.  This luminous square increases
from ten o'clock till midday, and decreases from one till three slowly, as if,
having hastened to my presence, it sorrowed at bidding me farewell.  When its last ray disappears I have enjoyed
its presence for five hours.  Is not
that sufficient?  I have been told that
there are unhappy beings who dig in quarries, and laborers who toil in mines,
who never behold it at all.&quot; 
Aramis wiped the drops from his brow. 
&quot;As to the stars which are so delightful to view,&quot; continued
the young man, &quot;they all resemble each other save in size and
brilliancy.  I am a favored mortal, for
if you had not lighted that candle you would have been able to see the
beautiful stars which I was gazing at from my couch before your arrival, whose
silvery rays were stealing through my brain.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
lowered his head; he felt himself overwhelmed with the bitter flow of that
sinister philosophy which is the religion of the captive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;So
much, then, for the flowers, the air, the daylight, and the stars,&quot;
tranquilly continued the young man; &quot;there remains but exercise.  Do I not walk all day in the governor's
garden if it is fine - here if it rains? in the fresh air if it is warm; in
perfect warmth, thanks to my winter stove, if it be cold?  Ah! monsieur, do you fancy,&quot; continued
the prisoner, not without bitterness, &quot;that men have not done everything
for me that a man can hope for or desire?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Men!&quot;
said Aramis; &quot;be it so; but it seems to me you are forgetting
Heaven.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Indeed
I have forgotten Heaven,&quot; murmured the prisoner, with emotion; &quot;but
why do you mention it?  Of what use is
it to talk to a prisoner of Heaven?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
looked steadily at this singular youth, who possessed the resignation of a
martyr with the smile of an atheist. 
&quot;Is not Heaven in everything?&quot; he murmured in a reproachful
tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Say
rather, at the end of everything,&quot; answered the prisoner, firmly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Be
it so,&quot; said Aramis; &quot;but let us return to our starting-point.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
ask nothing better,&quot; returned the young man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am your confessor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
then, you ought, as a penitent, to tell me the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
whole desire is to tell it you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Every
prisoner has committed some crime for which he has been imprisoned.  What crime, then, have <i>you</i> committed?&quot;<br>                &quot;You asked me the
same question the first time you saw me,&quot; returned the prisoner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
then, as now you evaded giving me an answer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
what reason have you for thinking that I shall now reply to you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Because
this time I am your confessor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
if you wish me to tell what crime I have committed, explain to me in what a
crime consists.  For as my conscience
does not accuse me, I aver that I am not a criminal.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
are often criminals in the sight of the great of the earth, not alone for
having ourselves committed crimes, but because we know that crimes have been
committed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
prisoner manifested the deepest attention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
I understand you,&quot; he said, after a pause; &quot;yes, you are right,
monsieur; it is very possible that, in such a light, I am a criminal in the
eyes of the great of the earth.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
then you know something,&quot; said Aramis, who thought he had pierced not
merely through a defect in the harness, but through the joints of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
I am not aware of anything,&quot; replied the young man; &quot;but sometimes I
think - and I say to myself - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
do you say to yourself?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
if I were to think but a little more deeply I should either go mad or I should
divine a great deal.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
then - and then?&quot; said Aramis, impatiently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
I leave off.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
leave off?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
my head becomes confused and my ideas melancholy; I feel <i>ennui</i> overtaking me; I wish - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
don't know; but I do not like to give myself up to longing for things which I
do not possess, when I am so happy with what I have.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are afraid of death?&quot; said Aramis, with a slight uneasiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,&quot;
said the young man, smiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
felt the chill of that smile, and shuddered. 
&quot;Oh, as you fear death, you know more about matters than you
say,&quot; he cried.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
you,&quot; returned the prisoner, &quot;who bade me to ask to see you; you,
who, when I did ask to see you, came here promising a world of confidence; how
is it that, nevertheless, it is you who are silent, leaving it for me to speak?
 Since, then, we both wear masks, either
let us both retain them or put them aside together.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
felt the force and justice of the remark, saying to himself, &quot;This is no
ordinary man; I must be cautious. - Are you ambitious?&quot; said he suddenly
to the prisoner, aloud, without preparing him for the alteration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
do you mean by ambitious?&quot; replied the youth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ambition,&quot;
replied Aramis, &quot;is the feeling which prompts a man to desire more - much
more - than he possesses.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
said that I was contented, monsieur; but, perhaps, I deceive myself.  I am ignorant of the nature of ambition; but
it is not impossible I may have some. 
Tell me your mind; that is all I ask.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;An
ambitious man,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;is one who covets that which is beyond
his station.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
covet nothing beyond my station,&quot; said the young man, with an assurance of
manner which for the second time made the bishop of Vannes tremble.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He was
silent.  But to look at the kindling
eye, the knitted brow, and the reflective attitude of the captive, it was
evident that he expected something more than silence, - a silence which Aramis
now broke.  &quot;You lied the first
time I saw you,&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Lied!&quot;
cried the young man, starting up on his couch, with such a tone in his voice,
and such a lightning in his eyes, that Aramis recoiled, in spite of himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
<i>should</i> say,&quot; returned Aramis,
bowing, &quot;you concealed from me what you knew of your infancy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
man's secrets are his own, monsieur,&quot; retorted the prisoner, &quot;and not
at the mercy of the first chance-comer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;True,&quot;
said Aramis, bowing still lower than before, &quot;'tis true; pardon me, but
to-day do I still occupy the place of a chance-comer?  I beseech you to reply, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This
title slightly disturbed the prisoner; but nevertheless he did not appear
astonished that it was given him. 
&quot;I do not know you, monsieur,&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
but if I dared, I would take your hand and kiss it!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
young man seemed as if he were going to give Aramis his hand; but the light
which beamed in his eyes faded away, and he coldly and distrustfully withdrew
his hand again.  &quot;Kiss the hand of
a prisoner,&quot; he said, shaking his head, &quot;to what purpose?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why
did you tell me,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;that you were happy here?  Why, that you aspired to nothing?  Why, in a word, by thus speaking, do you
prevent me from being frank in my turn?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
same light shone a third time in the young man's eyes, but died ineffectually
away as before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
distrust me,&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
why say you so, monsieur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
for a very simple reason; if you know what you ought to know, you ought to
mistrust everybody.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
do not be astonished that I am mistrustful, since you suspect me of knowing
what I do not know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
was struck with admiration at this energetic resistance.  &quot;Oh, monseigneur! you drive me to
despair,&quot; said he, striking the armchair with his fist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And,
on my part, I do not comprehend you, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
then, try to understand me.&quot;  The
prisoner looked fixedly at Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Sometimes
it seems to me,&quot; said the latter, &quot;that I have before me the man whom
I seek, and then - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
then your man disappears, - is it not so?&quot; said the prisoner,
smiling.  &quot;So much the
better.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
rose.  &quot;Certainly,&quot; said he;
&quot;I have nothing further to say to a man who mistrusts me as you do.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
I, monsieur,&quot; said the prisoner, in the same tone, &quot;have nothing to
say to a man who will not understand that a prisoner ought to be mistrustful of
everybody.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Even
of his old friends,&quot; said Aramis. 
&quot;Oh, monseigneur, you are <i>too</i>
prudent!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Of
my old friends? - you one of my old friends, - you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you no longer remember,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;that you once saw, in the
village where your early years were spent - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you know the name of the village?&quot; asked the prisoner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
lang=FR>&quot;Noisy-le-Sec, monseigneur,&quot;
answered Aramis, firmly.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=FR>                </span>&quot;Go on,&quot; said
the young man, with an immovable aspect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Stay,
monseigneur,&quot; said Aramis; &quot;if you are positively resolved to carry
on this game, let us break off.  I am
here to tell you many things, 'tis true; but you must allow me to see that, on
your side, you have a desire to know them. 
Before revealing the important matters I still withhold, be assured I am
in need of some encouragement, if not candor; a little sympathy, if not
confidence.  But you keep yourself
intrenched in a pretended which paralyzes me. 
Oh, not for the reason you think; for, ignorant as you may be, or
indifferent as you feign to be, you are none the less what you are,
monseigneur, and there is nothing - nothing, mark me! which can cause you not
to be so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
promise you,&quot; replied the prisoner, &quot;to hear you without
impatience.  Only it appears to me that
I have a right to repeat the question I have already asked, 'Who <i>are</i> you?'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you remember, fifteen or eighteen years ago, seeing at Noisy-le-Sec a cavalier,
accompanied by a lady in black silk, with flame-colored ribbons in her
hair?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,&quot;
said the young man; &quot;I once asked the name of this cavalier, and they told
me that he called himself the Abbé d'Herblay. 
I was astonished that the abbé had so warlike an air, and they replied
that there was nothing singular in that, seeing that he was one of Louis
XIII.'s musketeers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,&quot;
said Aramis, &quot;that musketeer and abbé, afterwards bishop of Vannes, is your
confessor now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
know it; I recognized you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then,
monseigneur, if you know that, I must further add a fact of which you are
ignorant - that if the king were to know this evening of the presence of this
musketeer, this abbé, this bishop, this confessor, <i>here</i> - he, who has risked everything to visit you, to-morrow would
behold the steely glitter of the executioner's axe in a dungeon more gloomy,
more obscure than yours.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                While
listening to these words, delivered with emphasis, the young man had raised
himself on his couch, and was now gazing more and more eagerly at Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
result of his scrutiny was that he appeared to derive some confidence from
it.  &quot;Yes,&quot; he murmured,
&quot;I remember perfectly.  The woman
of whom you speak came once with you, and twice afterwards with
another.&quot;  He hesitated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;With
another, who came to see you every month - is it not so, monseigneur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you know who this lady was?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
light seemed ready to flash from the prisoner's eyes.  &quot;I am aware that she was one of the ladies of the
court,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
remember that lady well, do you not?&quot;<br>                &quot;Oh, my recollection
can hardly be very confused on this head, &quot; said the young prisoner.  &quot;I saw that lady once with a gentleman
about forty-five years old.  I saw her
once with you, and with the lady dressed in black.  I have seen her twice since then with the same person.  These four people, with my master, and old
Perronnette, my jailer, and the governor of the prison, are the only persons
with whom I have ever spoken, and, indeed, almost the only persons I have ever
seen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
you were in prison?&quot;<br>                &quot;If I am a prisoner
here, then I was comparatively free, although in a very narrow sense - a house
I never quitted, a garden surrounded with walls I could not climb, these constituted
my residence, but you know it, as you have been there.  In a word, being accustomed to live within
these bounds, I never cared to leave them. 
And so you will understand, monsieur, that having never seen anything of
the world, I have nothing left to care for; and therefore, if you relate
anything, you will be obliged to explain each item to me as you go along.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
I will do so,&quot; said Aramis, bowing; &quot;for it is my duty,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
then, begin by telling me who was my tutor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
worthy and, above all, an honorable gentleman, monseigneur; fit guide for both
body and soul.  Had you ever any reason
to complain of him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
no; quite the contrary.  But this
gentleman of yours often used to tell me that my father and mother were
dead.  Did he deceive me, or did he
speak the truth?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
was compelled to comply with the orders given him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
he lied?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
one respect.  Your father is dead.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
my mother?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;She
is dead <i>for you</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
then she lives for others, does she not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
I - and I, then&quot; (the young man looked sharply at Aramis) &quot;am
compelled to live in the obscurity of a prison?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Alas!  I fear so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
that because my presence in the world would lead to the revelation of a great
secret?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Certainly,
a very great secret.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
enemy must indeed be powerful, to be able to shut up in the Bastile a child
such as I then was.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;More
powerful than my mother, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And why do you ask
that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Because my mother would have
taken my part.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis hesitated.  &quot;Yes, monseigneur; more powerful than
your mother.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Seeing, then, that my nurse
and preceptor were carried off, and that I, also, was separated from them -
either they were, or I am, very dangerous to my enemy?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes; but you are alluding to
a peril from which he freed himself, by causing the nurse and preceptor to
disappear,&quot; answered Aramis, quietly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Disappear!&quot; cried the
prisoner, &quot;how did they disappear?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In a very sure way,&quot;
answered Aramis - &quot;they are dead.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The young man turned pale, and passed
his hand tremblingly over his face. 
&quot;Poison?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Poison.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The prisoner reflected a
moment.  &quot;My enemy must indeed have
been very cruel, or hard beset by necessity, to assassinate those two innocent
people, my sole support; for the worthy gentleman and the poor nurse had never
harmed a living being.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In your family, monseigneur,
necessity is stern.  And so it is
necessity which compels me, to my great regret, to tell you that this gentleman
and the unhappy lady have been assassinated.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh, you tell me nothing I am
not aware of,&quot; said the prisoner, knitting his brows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I suspected it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I will tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>At this moment the young man,
supporting himself on his two elbows, drew close to Aramis's face, with such an
expression of dignity, of self-command and of defiance even, that the bishop
felt the electricity of enthusiasm strike in devouring flashes from that great
heart of his, into his brain of adamant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Speak, monseigneur.  I have already told you that by conversing
with you I endanger my life.  Little
value as it has, I implore you to accept it as the ransom of your own.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well,&quot; resumed the young
man, &quot;this is why I suspected they had killed my nurse and my preceptor -
&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Whom you used to call your
father?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes; whom I called my father,
but whose son I well knew I was not.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Who caused you to suppose
so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Just as you, monsieur, are
too respectful for a friend, he was also too respectful for a father.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I, however,&quot; said
Aramis, &quot;have no intention to disguise myself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The young man nodded assent and
continued: &quot;Undoubtedly, I was not destined to perpetual seclusion,&quot;
said the prisoner; &quot;and that which makes me believe so, above all, now, is
the care that was taken to render me as accomplished a cavalier as
possible.  The gentleman attached to my
person taught me everything he knew himself - mathematics, a little geometry,
astronomy, fencing and riding.  Every
morning I went through military exercises, and practiced on horseback.  Well, one morning during the summer, it being
very hot, I went to sleep in the hall. 
Nothing, up to that period, except the respect paid me, had enlightened
me, or even roused my suspicions.  I
lived as children, as birds, as plants, as the air and the sun do.  I had just turned my fifteenth year - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;This, then, is eight years
ago?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, nearly; but I have
ceased to reckon time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Excuse me; but what did your
tutor tell you, to encourage you to work?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He used to say that a man was
bound to make for himself, in the world, that fortune which Heaven had refused
him at his birth.  He added that, being
a poor, obscure orphan, I had no one but myself to look to; and that nobody
either did, or ever would, take any interest in me.  I was, then, in the hall I have spoken of, asleep from fatigue
with long fencing.  My preceptor was in
his room on the first floor, just over me. 
Suddenly I heard him exclaim, and then he called: 'Perronnette!  Perronnette!'  It was my nurse whom he called.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, I know it,&quot; said
Aramis.  &quot;Continue,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Very likely she was in the
garden; for my preceptor came hastily downstairs.  I rose, anxious at seeing him anxious.  He opened the garden-door, still crying out, 'Perronnette!  Perronnette!'  The windows of the hall looked into the court; the shutters were
closed; but through a chink in them I saw my tutor draw near a large well,
which was almost directly under the windows of his study.  He stooped over the brim, looked into the
well, and again cried out, and made wild and affrighted gestures.  Where I was, I could not only see, but hear
- and see and hear I did.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Go on, I pray you,&quot; said
Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Dame Perronnette came running
up, hearing the governor's cries.  He
went to meet her, took her by the arm, and drew her quickly towards the edge;
after which, as they both bent over it together, 'Look, look,' cried he, 'what
a misfortune!'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'Calm yourself, calm
yourself,' said Perronnette; 'what is the matter?'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'The letter!' he exclaimed;
'do you see that letter?' pointing to the bottom of the well.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'What letter?' she cried.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'The letter you see down
there; the last letter from the queen.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;At this word I trembled.  My tutor - he who passed for my father, he
who was continually recommending me modesty and humility - in correspondence
with the queen!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'The queen's last letter!'
cried Perronnette, without showing more astonishment than at seeing this letter
at the bottom of the well; 'but how came it there?'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'A chance, Dame Perronnette -
a singular chance.  I was entering my
room, and on opening the door, the window, too, being open, a puff of air came
suddenly and carried off this paper - this letter of her majesty's; I darted
after it, and gained the window just in time to see it flutter a moment in the
breeze and disappear down the well.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'Well,' said Dame
Perronnette; 'and if the letter has fallen into the well, 'tis all the same as
if it was burnt; and as the queen burns all her letters every time she comes -
'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And so you see this lady who
came every month was the queen,&quot; said the prisoner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'Doubtless, doubtless,' continued
the old gentleman; 'but this letter contained instructions - how can I follow
them?'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'Write immediately to her;
give her a plain account of the accident, and the queen will no doubt write you
another letter in place of this.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'Oh! the queen would never
believe the story,' said the good gentleman, shaking his head; 'she will
imagine that I want to keep this letter instead of giving it up like the rest,
so as to have a hold over her.  She is
so distrustful, and M. de Mazarin so - Yon devil of an Italian is capable of
having us poisoned at the first breath of suspicion.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis almost imperceptibly smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'You know, Dame Perronnette,
they are both so suspicious in all that concerns Philippe.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Philippe was the name they
gave me,&quot; said the prisoner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'Well, 'tis no use
hesitating,' said Dame Perronnette, 'somebody must go down the well.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'Of course; so that the
person who goes down may read the paper as he is coming up.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'But let us choose some
villager who cannot read, and then you will be at ease.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'Granted; but will not any
one who descends guess that a paper must be important for which we risk a man's
life?  However, you have given me an
idea, Dame Perronnette; somebody shall go down the well, but that somebody
shall be myself.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;But at this notion Dame
Perronnette lamented and cried in such a manner, and so implored the old
nobleman, with tears in her eyes, that he promised her to obtain a ladder long
enough to reach down, while she went in search of some stout-hearted youth,
whom she was to persuade that a jewel had fallen into the well, and that this
jewel was wrapped in a paper.  'And as
paper,' remarked my preceptor, 'naturally unfolds in water, the young man would
not be surprised at finding nothing, after all, but the letter wide open.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'But perhaps the writing will
be already effaced by that time,' said Dame Perronnette.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;'No consequence, provided we
secure the letter.  On returning it to
the queen, she will see at once that we have not betrayed her; and
consequently, as we shall not rouse the distrust of Mazarin, we shall have
nothing to fear from him.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Having come to this
resolution, they parted.  I pushed back
the shutter, and, seeing that my tutor was about to re-enter, I threw myself on
my couch, in a confusion of brain caused by all I had just heard.  My governor opened the door a few moments
after, and thinking I was asleep gently closed it again.  As soon as ever it was shut, I rose, and,
listening, heard the sound of retiring footsteps.  Then I returned to the shutters, and saw my tutor and Dame
Perronnette go out together.  I was
alone in the house.  They had hardly closed
the gate before I sprang from the window and ran to the well.  Then, just as my governor had leaned over,
so leaned I.  Something white and
luminous glistened in the green and quivering silence of the water.  The brilliant disk fascinated and allured
me; my eyes became fixed, and I could hardly breathe.  The well seemed to draw me downwards with its slimy mouth and icy
breath; and I thought I read, at the bottom of the water, characters of fire
traced upon the letter the queen had touched. 
Then, scarcely knowing what I was about, and urged on by one of those
instinctive impulses which drive men to destruction, I lowered the cord from
the windlass of the well to within about three feet of the water, leaving the
bucket dangling, at the same time taking infinite pains not to disturb that
coveted letter, which was beginning to change its white tint for the hue of
chrysoprase, - proof enough that it was sinking, - and then, with the rope
weltering in my hands, slid down into the abyss.  When I saw myself hanging over the dark pool, when I saw the sky
lessening above my head, a cold shudder came over me, a chill fear got the better
of me, I was seized with giddiness, and the hair rose on my head; but my strong
will still reigned supreme over all the terror and disquietude.  I gained the water, and at once plunged into
it, holding on by one hand, while I immersed the other and seized the dear
letter, which, alas! came in two in my grasp. 
I concealed the two fragments in my body-coat, and, helping myself with
my feet against the sides of the pit, and clinging on with my hands, agile and
vigorous as I was, and, above all, pressed for time, I regained the brink,
drenching it as I touched it with the water that streamed off me.  I was no sooner out of the well with my
prize, than I rushed into the sunlight, and took refuge in a kind of shrubbery
at the bottom of the garden.  As I entered
my hiding-place, the bell which resounded when the great gate was opened,
rang.  It was my preceptor come back
again.  I had but just time.  I calculated that it would take ten minutes
before he would gain my place of concealment, even if, guessing where I was, he
came straight to it; and twenty if he were obliged to look for me.  But this was time enough to allow me to read
the cherished letter, whose fragments I hastened to unite again.  The writing was already fading, but I
managed to decipher it all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And will you tell me what you
read therein, monseigneur?&quot; asked Aramis, deeply interested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Quite enough, monsieur, to
see that my tutor was a man of noble rank, and that Perronnette, without being
a lady of quality, was far better than a servant; and also to perceived that I
must myself be high-born, since the queen, Anne of Austria, and Mazarin, the
prime minister, commended me so earnestly to their care.&quot;  Here the young man paused, quite overcome.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And what happened?&quot;
asked Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It happened, monsieur,&quot;
answered he, &quot;that the workmen they had summoned found nothing in the
well, after the closest search; that my governor perceived that the brink was
all watery; that I was not so dried by the sun as to prevent Dame Perronnette
spying that my garments were moist; and, lastly, that I was seized with a
violent fever, owing to the chill and the excitement of my discovery, an attack
of delirium supervening, during which I related the whole adventure; so that,
guided by my avowal, my governor found the pieces of the queen's letter inside
the bolster where I had concealed them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Aramis,
&quot;now I understand.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Beyond this, all is
conjecture.  Doubtless the unfortunate
lady and gentleman, not daring to keep the occurrence secret, wrote of all this
to the queen and sent back the torn letter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;After which,&quot; said
Aramis, &quot;you were arrested and removed to the Bastile.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;As you see.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Your two attendants
disappeared?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Alas!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Let us not take up our time
with the dead, but see what can be done with the living.  You told me you were resigned.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I repeat it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Without any desire for
freedom?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;As I told you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Without ambition, sorrow, or
thought?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The young man made no answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well,&quot; asked Aramis,
&quot;why are you silent?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I think I have spoken
enough,&quot; answered the prisoner, &quot;and that now it is your turn.  I am weary.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis gathered himself up, and a
shade of deep solemnity spread itself over his countenance.  It was evident that he had reached the
crisis in the part he had come to the prison to play.  &quot;One question,&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What is it? speak.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In the house you inhabited
there were neither looking-glasses nor mirrors?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What are those two words, and
what is their meaning?&quot; asked the young man; &quot;I have no sort of
knowledge of them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;They designate two pieces of
furniture which reflect objects; so that, for instance, you may see in them
your own lineaments, as you see mine now, with the naked eye.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No; there was neither a glass
nor a mirror in the house,&quot; answered the young man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis looked round him.  &quot;Nor is there anything of the kind
here, either,&quot; he said; &quot;they have again taken the same
precaution.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;To what end?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You will know directly.  Now, you have told me that you were
instructed in mathematics, astronomy, fencing, and riding; but you have not
said a word about history.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;My tutor sometimes related to
me the principal deeds of the king, St. Louis, King Francis I., and King Henry
IV.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Is that all?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Very nearly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;This also was done by design,
then; just as they deprived you of mirrors, which reflect the present, so they
left you in ignorance of history, which reflects the past.  Since your imprisonment, books have been
forbidden you; so that you are unacquainted with a number of facts, by means of
which you would be able to reconstruct the shattered mansion of your
recollections and your hopes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It is true,&quot; said the
young man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Listen, then; I will in a few
words tell you what has passed in France during the last twenty-three or
twenty-four years; that is, from the probable date of your birth; in a word,
from the time that interests you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Say on.&quot;  And the young man resumed his serious and
attentive attitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Do you know who was the son
of Henry IV.?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;At least I know who his
successor was.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;By means of a coin dated
1610, which bears the effigy of Henry IV.; and another of 1612, bearing that of
Louis XIII.  So I presumed that, there
being only two years between the two dates, Louis was Henry's successor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Then,&quot; said Aramis,
&quot;you know that the last reigning monarch was Louis XIII.?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I do,&quot; answered the
youth, slightly reddening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well, he was a prince full of
noble ideas and great projects, always, alas! deferred by the trouble of the
times and the dread struggle that his minister Richelieu had to maintain against
the great nobles of France.  The king
himself was of a feeble character, and died young and unhappy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I know it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He had been long anxious
about having a heir; a care which weighs heavily on princes, who desire to
leave behind them more than one pledge that their best thoughts and works will
be continued.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Did the king, then, die
childless?&quot; asked the prisoner, smiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No, but he was long without
one, and for a long while thought he should be the last of his race.  This idea had reduced him to the depths of
despair, when suddenly, his wife, Anne of Austria - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The prisoner trembled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Did you know,&quot; said
Aramis, &quot;that Louis XIII.'s wife was called Anne of Austria?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Continue,&quot; said the
young man, without replying to the question.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;When suddenly,&quot; resumed
Aramis, &quot;the queen announced an interesting event.  There was great joy at the intelligence, and
all prayed for her happy delivery.  On
the 5th of September, 1638, she gave birth to a son.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Here Aramis looked at his
companion, and thought he observed him turning pale.  &quot;You are about to hear,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;an account
which few indeed could now avouch; for it refers to a secret which they
imagined buried with the dead, entombed in the abyss of the confessional.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And you will tell me this
secret?&quot; broke in the youth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Aramis, with
unmistakable emphasis, &quot;I do not know that I ought to risk this secret by
intrusting it to one who has no desire to quit the Bastile.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I hear you, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The queen, then, gave birth
to a son.  But while the court was
rejoicing over the event, when the king had show the new-born child to the
nobility and people, and was sitting gayly down to table, to celebrate the
event, the queen, who was alone in her room, was again taken ill and gave birth
to a second son.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh!&quot; said the prisoner,
betraying a bitter acquaintance with affairs than he had owned to, &quot;I
thought that Monsieur was only born in - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis raised his finger;
&quot;Permit me to continue,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The prisoner sighed impatiently,
and paused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Aramis,
&quot;the queen had a second son, whom Dame Perronnette, the midwife, received
in her arms.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Dame Perronnette!&quot;
murmured the young man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;They ran at once to the
banqueting-room, and whispered to the king what had happened; he rose and quitted
the table.  But this time it was no
longer happiness that his face expressed, but something akin to terror.  The birth of twins changed into bitterness
the joy to which that of an only son had given rise, seeing that in France (a
fact you are assuredly ignorant of) it is the oldest of the king's sons who
succeeds his father.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I know it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And that the doctors and
jurists assert that there is ground for doubting whether the son that first
makes his appearance is the elder by the law of heaven and of nature.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The prisoner uttered a smothered
cry, and became whiter than the coverlet under which he hid himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Now you understand,&quot;
pursued Aramis, &quot;that the king, who with so much pleasure saw himself
repeated in one, was in despair about two; fearing that the second might
dispute the first's claim to seniority, which had been recognized only two
hours before; and so this second son, relying on party interests and caprices,
might one day sow discord and engender civil war throughout the kingdom; by
these means destroying the very dynasty he should have strengthened.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh, I understand! - I
understand!&quot; murmured the young man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well,&quot; continued Aramis;
&quot;this is what they relate, what they declare; this is why one of the
queen's two sons, shamefully parted from his brother, shamefully sequestered,
is buried in profound obscurity; this is why that second son has disappeared,
and so completely, that not a soul in France, save his mother, is aware of his
existence.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes! his mother, who has cast
him off,&quot; cried the prisoner in a tone of despair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Except, also,&quot; Aramis
went on, &quot;the lady in the black dress; and, finally, excepting - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Excepting yourself - is it
not?  You who come and relate all this;
you, who rouse in my soul curiosity, hatred, ambition, and, perhaps, even the
thirst of vengeance; except you, monsieur, who, if you are the man to whom I
expect, whom the note I have received applies to, whom, in short, Heaven ought
to send me, must possess about you - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What?&quot; asked Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;A portrait of the king, Louis
XIV., who at this moment reigns upon the throne of France.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Here is the portrait,&quot;
replied the bishop, handing the prisoner a miniature in enamel, on which Louis
was depicted life-like, with a handsome, lofty mien.  The prisoner eagerly seized the portrait, and gazed at it with
devouring eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And now, monseigneur,&quot;
said Aramis, &quot;here is a mirror.&quot; 
Aramis left the prisoner time to recover his ideas.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;So high! - so high!&quot;
murmured the young man, eagerly comparing the likeness of Louis with his own countenance
reflected in the glass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What do you think of
it?&quot; at length said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I think that I am lost,&quot;
replied the captive; &quot;the king will never set me free.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And I - I demand to
know,&quot; added the bishop, fixing his piercing eyes significantly upon the
prisoner, &quot;I demand to know which of these two is king; the one this
miniature portrays, or whom the glass reflects?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The king, monsieur,&quot;
sadly replied the young man, &quot;is he who is on the throne, who is not in
prison; and who, on the other hand, can cause others to be entombed there.  Royalty means power; and you behold how
powerless I am.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monseigneur,&quot; answered
Aramis, with a respect he had not yet manifested, &quot;the king, mark me,
will, if you desire it, be the one that, quitting his dungeon, shall maintain
himself upon the throne, on which his friends will place him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Tempt me not, monsieur,&quot;
broke in the prisoner bitterly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Be not weak,
monseigneur,&quot; persisted Aramis; &quot;I have brought you all the proofs of
your birth; consult them; satisfy yourself that you are a king's son; it is for
<i>us</i> to act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No, no; it is
impossible.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Unless, indeed,&quot; resumed
the bishop ironically, &quot;it be the destiny of your race, that the brothers
excluded from the throne should be always princes void of courage and honesty,
as was your uncle, M. Gaston d'Orléans, who ten times conspired against his
brother Louis XIII.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What!&quot; cried the prince,
astonished; &quot;my uncle Gaston 'conspired against his brother'; conspired to
dethrone him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Exactly, monseigneur; for no
other reason.  I tell you the
truth.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And he had friends - devoted
friends?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;As much so as I am to
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And, after all, what did he
do? - Failed!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He failed, I admit; but
always through his own fault; and, for the sake of purchasing - not his life -
for the life of the king's brother is sacred and inviolable - but his liberty,
he sacrificed the lives of all his friends, one after another.  And so, at this day, he is a very blot on
history, the detestation of a hundred noble families in this kingdom.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I understand, monsieur;
either by weakness or treachery, my uncle slew his friends.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;By weakness; which, in
princes, is always treachery.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And cannot a man fail, then,
from incapacity and ignorance?  Do you
really believe it possible that a poor captive such as I, brought up, not only
at a distance from the court, but even from the world - do you believe it
possible that such a one could assist those of his friends who should attempt
to serve him?&quot;  And as Aramis was
about to reply, the young man suddenly cried out, with a violence which
betrayed the temper of his blood, &quot;We are speaking of friends; but how can
<i>I</i> have any friends - I, whom no one
knows; and have neither liberty, money, nor influence, to gain any?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I fancy I had the honor to
offer myself to your royal highness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh, do not style me so,
monsieur; 'tis either treachery or cruelty. 
Bid me not think of aught beyond these prison-walls, which so grimly
confine me; let me again love, or, at least, submit to my slavery and my
obscurity.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monseigneur, monseigneur; if
you again utter these desperate words - if, after having received proof of your
high birth, you still remain poor-spirited in body and soul, I will comply with
your desire, I will depart, and renounce forever the service of a master, to
whom so eagerly I came to devote my assistance and my life!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; cried the
prince, &quot;would it not have been better for you to have reflected, before
telling me all that you have done, that you have broken my heart forever?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And so I desire to do,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;To talk to me about power,
grandeur, eye, and to prate of thrones! 
Is a prison the fit place?  You
wish to make me believe in splendor, and we are lying lost in night; you boast
of glory, and we are smothering our words in the curtains of this miserable
bed; you give me glimpses of power absolute whilst I hear the footsteps of the
every-watchful jailer in the corridor - that step which, after all, makes you
tremble more than it does me.  To render
me somewhat less incredulous, free me from the Bastile; let me breathe the
fresh air; give me my spurs and trusty sword, then we shall begin to understand
each other.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It is precisely my intention
to give you all this, monseigneur, and more; only, do you desire it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;A word more,&quot; said the
prince.  &quot;I know there are guards
in every gallery, bolts to every door, cannon and soldiery at every
barrier.  How will you overcome the
sentries - spike the guns?  How will you
break through the bolts and bars?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monseigneur, - how did you
get the note which announced my arrival to you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You can bribe a jailer for
such a thing as a note.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;If we can corrupt one
turnkey, we can corrupt ten.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well; I admit that it may be
possible to release a poor captive from the Bastile; possible so to conceal him
that the king's people shall not again ensnare him; possible, in some unknown
retreat, to sustain the unhappy wretch in some suitable manner.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monseigneur!&quot; said
Aramis, smiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I admit that, whoever would do
this much for me, would seem more than mortal in my eyes; but as you tell me I
am a prince, brother of the king, how can you restore me the rank and power
which my mother and my brother have deprived me of?  And as, to effect this, I must pass a life of war and hatred, how
can you cause me to prevail in those combats - render me invulnerable by my
enemies?  Ah! monsieur, reflect on all
this; place me, to-morrow, in some dark cavern at a mountain's base; yield me
the delight of hearing in freedom sounds of the river, plain and valley, of
beholding in freedom the sun of the blue heavens, or the stormy sky, and it is
enough.  Promise me no more than this,
for, indeed, more you cannot give, and it would be a crime to deceive me, since
you call yourself my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis waited in silence.  &quot;Monseigneur,&quot; he resumed, after a
moment's reflection, &quot;I admire the firm, sound sense which dictates your
words; I am happy to have discovered my monarch's mind.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Again, again! oh, God! for
mercy's sake,&quot; cried the prince, pressing his icy hands upon his clammy
brow, &quot;do not play with me!  I have
no need to be a king to be the happiest of men.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;But I, monseigneur, wish you
to be a king for the good of humanity.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah!&quot; said the prince,
with fresh distrust inspired by the word; &quot;ah! with what, then, has
humanity to reproach my brother?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I forgot to say, monseigneur,
that if you would allow me to guide you, and if you consent to become the most
powerful monarch in Christendom, you will have promoted the interests of all
the friends whom I devote to the success of your cause, and these friends are
numerous.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Numerous?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Less numerous than powerful,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Explain yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It is impossible; I will
explain, I swear before Heaven, on that day that I see you sitting on the
throne of France.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;But my brother?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You shall decree his
fate.  Do you pity him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Him, who leaves me to perish
in a dungeon?  No, no.  For him I have no pity!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;So much the better.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He might have himself come to
this prison, have taken me by the hand, and have said, 'My brother, Heaven
created us to love, not to contend with one another.  I come to you.  A
barbarous prejudice has condemned you to pass your days in obscurity, far from
mankind, deprived of every joy.  I will
make you sit down beside me; I will buckle round your waist our father's
sword.  Will you take advantage of this
reconciliation to put down or restrain me? 
Will you employ that sword to spill my blood?'  'Oh! never,' I would have replied to him, 'I look on you as my
preserver, I will respect you as my master. 
You give me far more than Heaven bestowed; for through you I possess
liberty and the privilege of loving and being loved in this world.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And you would have kept your
word, monseigneur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;On my life!  While now - now that I have guilty ones to
punish - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In what manner,
monseigneur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What do you say as to the
resemblance that Heaven has given me to my brother?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I say that there was in that
likeness a providential instruction which the king ought to have heeded; I say
that your mother committed a crime in rendering those different in happiness
and fortune whom nature created so startlingly alike, of her own flesh, and I
conclude that the object of punishment should be only to restore the
equilibrium.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;By which you mean - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That if I restore you to your
place on your brother's throne, he shall take yours in prison.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Alas! there's such infinity
of suffering in prison, especially it would be so for one who has drunk so
deeply of the cup of enjoyment.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Your royal highness will
always be free to act as you may desire; and if it seems good to you, after
punishment, you will have it in your power to pardon.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Good.  And now, are you aware of one thing, monsieur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Tell me, my prince.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It is that I will hear
nothing further from you till I am clear of the Bastile.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I was going to say to your
highness that I should only have the pleasure of seeing you once again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And when?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The day when my prince leaves
these gloomy walls.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Heavens! how will you give me
notice of it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;By myself coming to fetch
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yourself?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;My prince, do not leave this
chamber save with me, or if in my absence you are compelled to do so, remember
that I am not concerned in it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And so I am not to speak a
word of this to any one whatever, save to you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Save only to me.&quot;  Aramis bowed very low.  The prince offered his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; he said, in a
tone that issued from his heart, &quot;one word more, my last.  If you have sought me for my destruction; if
you are only a tool in the hands of my enemies; if from our conference, in
which you have sounded the depths of my mind, anything worse than captivity
result, that is to say, if death befall me, still receive my blessing, for you
will have ended my troubles and given me repose from the tormenting fever that
has preyed on me for eight long, weary years.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monseigneur, wait the results
ere you judge me,&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I say that, in such a case, I
bless and forgive you.  If, on the other
hand, you are come to restore me to that position in the sunshine of fortune
and glory to which I was destined by Heaven; if by your means I am enabled to
live in the memory of man, and confer luster on my race by deeds of valor, or
by solid benefits bestowed upon my people; if, from my present depths of
sorrow, aided by your generous hand, I raise myself to the very height of
honor, then to you, whom I thank with blessings, to you will I offer half my
power and my glory: though you would still be but partly recompensed, and your
share must always remain incomplete, since I could not divide with you the
happiness received at your hands.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monseigneur,&quot; replied
Aramis, moved by the pallor and excitement of the young man, &quot;the
nobleness of your heart fills me with joy and admiration.  It is not you who will have to thank me, but
rather the nation whom you will render happy, the posterity whose name you will
make glorious.  Yes; I shall indeed have
bestowed upon you more than life, I shall have given you immortality.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The prince offered his hand to
Aramis, who sank upon his knee and kissed it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It is the first act of homage
paid to our future king,&quot; said he. 
&quot;When I see you again, I shall say, 'Good day, sire.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Till then,&quot; said the
young man, pressing his wan and wasted fingers over his heart, - &quot;till
then, no more dreams, no more strain on my life - my heart would break!  Oh, monsieur, how small is my prison - how
low the window - how narrow are the doors! 
To think that so much pride, splendor, and happiness, should be able to
enter in and to remain here!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Your royal highness makes me
proud,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;since you infer it is I who brought all
this.&quot;  And he rapped immediately
on the door.  The jailer came to open it
with Baisemeaux, who, devoured by fear and uneasiness, was beginning, in spite
of himself, to listen at the door. 
Happily, neither of the speakers had forgotten to smother his voice,
even in the most passionate outbreaks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What a confessor!&quot; said
the governor, forcing a laugh; &quot;who would believe that a compulsory
recluse, a man as though in the very jaws of death, could have committed crimes
so numerous, and so long to tell of?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis made no reply.  He was eager to leave the Bastile, where the
secret which overwhelmed him seemed to double the weight of the walls.  As soon as they reached Baisemeaux's
quarters, &quot;Let us proceed to business, my dear governor,&quot; said
Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Alas!&quot; replied
Baisemeaux.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You have to ask me for my
receipt for one hundred and fifty thousand livres,&quot; said the bishop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And to pay over the first
third of the sum,&quot; added the poor governor, with a sigh, taking three
steps towards his iron strong-box.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Here is the receipt,&quot;
said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And here is the money,&quot;
returned Baisemeaux, with a threefold sigh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The order instructed me only
to give a receipt; it said nothing about receiving the money,&quot; rejoined
Aramis.  <span lang=FR>&quot;Adieu, monsieur le governeur!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>And he departed, leaving Baisemeaux
almost more than stifled with joy and surprise at this regal present so
liberally bestowed by the confessor extraordinary to the Bastile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>How Mouston Had
Become Fatter without Giving Porthos Notice Thereof, and of the Troubles Which
Consequently Befell that Worthy Gentleman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>S</span>ince
the departure of Athos for Blois, Porthos and D'Artagnan were seldom
together.  One was occupied with
harassing duties for the king, the other had been making many purchases of
furniture which he intended to forward to his estate, and by aid of which he
hoped to establish in his various residences something of the courtly luxury he
had witnessed in all its dazzling brightness in his majesty's society.  D'Artagnan, ever faithful, one morning
during an interval of service thought about Porthos, and being uneasy at not
having heard anything of him for a fortnight, directed his steps towards his
hotel, and pounced upon him just as he was getting up.  The worthy baron had a pensive - nay, more
than pensive - melancholy air.  He was
sitting on his bed, only half-dressed, and with legs dangling over the edge,
contemplating a host of garments, which with their fringes, lace, embroidery,
and slashes of ill-assorted hues, were strewed all over the floor.  Porthos, sad and reflective as La Fontaine's
hare, did not observe D'Artagnan's entrance, which was, moreover, screened at
this moment by M. Mouston, whose personal corpulency, quite enough at any time
to hide one man from another, was effectually doubled by a scarlet coat which
the intendant was holding up for his master's inspection, by the sleeves, that
he might the better see it all over. 
D'Artagnan stopped at the threshold and looked in at the pensive Porthos
and then, as the sight of the innumerable garments strewing the floor caused
mighty sighs to heave the bosom of that excellent gentleman, D'Artagnan thought
it time to put an end to these dismal reflections, and coughed by way of
announcing himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
exclaimed Porthos, whose countenance brightened with joy; &quot;ah! ah!  <span lang=FR>Here
is D'Artagnan.  </span>I shall then get
hold of an idea!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At
these words Mouston, doubting what was going on behind him, got out of the way,
smiling kindly at the friend of his master, who thus found himself freed from
the material obstacle which had prevented his reaching D'Artagnan.  Porthos made his sturdy knees crack again in
rising, and crossing the room in two strides, found himself face to face with
his friend, whom he folded to his breast with a force of affection that seemed
to increase with every day. 
&quot;Ah!&quot; he repeated, &quot;you are always welcome, dear friend;
but just now you are more welcome than ever.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
you seem to have the megrims here!&quot; exclaimed D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos
replied by a look expressive of dejection. 
&quot;Well, then, tell me all about it, Porthos, my friend, unless it is
a secret.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
the first place,&quot; returned Porthos, &quot;you know I have no secrets from
you.  This, then, is what saddens
me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Wait
a minute, Porthos; let me first get rid of all this litter of satin and
velvet!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
never mind,&quot; said Porthos, contemptuously; &quot;it is all trash.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Trash,
Porthos!  Cloth at twenty-five livres an
ell! gorgeous satin! regal velvet!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
you think these clothes are - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Splendid,
Porthos, splendid!  I'll wager that you
alone in France have so many; and suppose you never had any more made, and were
to live to be a hundred years of age, which wouldn't astonish me in the very
least, you could still wear a new dress the day of your death, without being
obliged to see the nose of a single tailor from now till then.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos
shook his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come,
my friend,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;this unnatural melancholy in you
frightens me.  My dear Porthos, pray get
it out, then.  And the sooner the
better.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
my friend, so I will: if, indeed, it is possible.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Perhaps
you have received bad news from Bracieux?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No:
they have felled the wood, and it has yielded a third more than the
estimate.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
there has been a falling-off in the pools of Pierrefonds?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
my friend: they have been fished, and there is enough left to stock all the
pools in the neighborhood.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Perhaps
your estate at Vallon has been destroyed by an earthquake?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
my friend; on the contrary, the ground was struck with lightning a hundred
paces from the château, and a fountain sprung up in a place entirely destitute
of water.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
in the world <i>is</i> the matter,
then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
fact is, I have received an invitation for the <i>fête</i> at Vaux,&quot; said Porthos, with a lugubrious expression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!
do you complain of that?  The king has
caused a hundred mortal heart-burnings among the courtiers by refusing
invitations.  And so, my dear friend,
you are really going to Vaux?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Indeed
I am!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will see a magnificent sight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Alas!  I doubt it, though.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Everything
that is grand in France will be brought together there!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
cried Porthos, tearing out a lock of hair in his despair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh!
good heavens, are you ill?&quot; cried D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am as firm as the Pont-Neuf!  It isn't
that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
what is it, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Tis
that I have no clothes!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
stood petrified.  &quot;No clothes!  Porthos, no clothes!&quot; he cried,
&quot;when I see at least fifty suits on the floor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Fifty,
truly; but not one which fits me!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What?
not one that fits you?  But are you not
measured, then, when you give an order?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
be sure he is,&quot; answered Mouston; &quot;but unfortunately <i>I</i> have gotten stouter!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!
<i>you</i> stouter!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;So much so that I am now
bigger than the baron.  Would you
believe it, monsieur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Parbleu!</i> it seems to me that is quite
evident.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you see, stupid?&quot; said Porthos, &quot;that is quite evident!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Be
still, my dear Porthos,&quot; resumed D'Artagnan, becoming slightly impatient,
&quot;I don't understand why your clothes should not fit you, because Mouston
has grown stouter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am going to explain it,&quot; said Porthos. 
&quot;You remember having related to me the story of the Roman general
Antony, who had always seven wild boars kept roasting, each cooked up to a
different point; so that he might be able to have his dinner at any time of the
day he chose to ask for it.  Well, then,
I resolved, as at any time I might be invited to court to spend a week, I resolved
to have always seven suits ready for the occasion.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Capitally
reasoned, Porthos - only a man must have a fortune like yours to gratify such
whims.  Without counting the time lost
in being measured, the fashions are always changing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is exactly the point,&quot; said Porthos, &quot;in regard to which I flattered
myself I had hit on a very ingenious device.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Tell
me what it is; for I don't doubt your genius.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
remember what Mouston once was, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
when he used to call himself Mousqueton.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
you remember, too, the period when he began to grow fatter?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
not exactly.  I beg your pardon, my good
Mouston.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
you are not in fault, monsieur,&quot; said Mouston, graciously.  &quot;You were in Paris, and as for us, we
were at Pierrefonds.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
well, my dear Porthos; there was a time when Mouston began to grow fat.  Is that what you wished to say?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
my friend; and I greatly rejoice over the period.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Indeed,
I believe you do,&quot; exclaimed D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
understand,&quot; continued Porthos, &quot;what a world of trouble it spared
for me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
I don't - by any means.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Look
here, my friend.  In the first place, as
you have said, to be measured is a loss of time, even though it occur only once
a fortnight.  And then, one may be
travelling; and then you wish to have seven suits always with you.  In short, I have a horror of letting any one
take my measure.  Confound it! either
one is a nobleman or not.  To be
scrutinized and scanned by a fellow who completely analyzes you, by inch and
line - 'tis degrading!  Here, they find
you too hollow; there, too prominent. 
They recognize your strong and weak points.  See, now, when we leave the measurer's hands, we are like those
strongholds whose angles and different thicknesses have been ascertained by a
spy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
truth, my dear Porthos, you possess ideas entirely original.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
you see when a man is an engineer - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
has fortified Belle-Isle - 'tis natural, my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
I had an idea, which would doubtless have proved a good one, but for Mouston's carelessness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
glanced at Mouston, who replied by a slight movement of his body, as if to say,
&quot;You will see whether I am at all to blame in all this.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
congratulated myself, then,&quot; resumed Porthos, &quot;at seeing Mouston get
fat; and I did all I could, by means of substantial feeding, to make him stout
- always in the hope that he would come to equal myself in girth, and could
then be measured in my stead.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
lang=FR>&quot;Ah!&quot; cried D'Artagnan.  </span>&quot;I see - that spared you both
time and humiliation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Consider
my joy when, after a year and a half's judicious feeding - for I used to feed
him up myself - the fellow - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!  I lent a good hand myself, monsieur,&quot;
said Mouston, humbly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That's
true.  Consider my joy when, one
morning, I perceived Mouston was obliged to squeeze in, as I once did myself,
to get through the little secret door that those fools of architects had made
in the chamber of the late Madame du Vallon, in the château of
Pierrefonds.  And, by the way, about
that door, my friend, I should like to ask you, who know everything, why these
wretches of architects, who ought to have the compasses run into them, just to
remind them, came to make doorways through which nobody but thin people can
pass?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
those doors,&quot; answered D'Artagnan, &quot;were meant for gallants, and they
have generally slight and slender figures.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Madame
du Vallon had no gallant!&quot; answered Porthos, majestically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Perfectly
true, my friend,&quot; resumed D'Artagnan; &quot;but the architects were
probably making their calculations on a basis of the probability of your
marrying again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
that is possible,&quot; said Porthos. 
&quot;And now I have received an explanation of how it is that doorways
are made too narrow, let us return to the subject of Mouston's fatness.  But see how the two things apply to each
other.  I have always noticed that
people's ideas run parallel.  And so,
observe this phenomenon, D'Artagnan.  I
was talking to you of Mouston, who is fat, and it led us on to Madame du Vallon
- &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
was thin?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Hum!  Is it not marvelous?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
dear friend, a <i>savant</i> of my
acquaintance, M. Costar, has made the same observation as you have, and he
calls the process by some Greek name which I forget.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!
my remark is not then original?&quot; cried Porthos, astounded.  &quot;I thought I was the discoverer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
friend, the fact was known before Aristotle's days - that is to say, nearly two
thousand years ago.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
well, 'tis no less true,&quot; said Porthos, delighted at the idea of having
jumped to a conclusion so closely in agreement with the greatest sages of
antiquity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Wonderfully
- but suppose we return to Mouston.  It
seems to me, we have left him fattening under our very eyes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monsieur,&quot; said Mouston.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,&quot;
said Porthos, &quot;Mouston fattened so well, that he gratified all my hopes,
by reaching my standard; a fact of which I was well able to convince myself, by
seeing the rascal, one day, in a waistcoat of mine, which he had turned into a
coat - a waistcoat, the mere embroidery of which was worth a hundred
pistoles.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Twas
only to try it on, monsieur,&quot; said Mouston.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;From
that moment I determined to put Mouston in communication with my tailors, and
to have him measured instead of myself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
capital idea, Porthos; but Mouston is a foot and a half shorter than you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Exactly!  They measured him down to the ground, and
the end of the skirt came just below my knee.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
a marvelous man you are, Porthos!  Such
a thing could happen only to you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
yes; pay your compliments; you have ample grounds to go upon.  It was exactly at that time - that is to
say, nearly two years and a half ago - that I set out for Belle-Isle,
instructing Mouston (so as always to have, in every event, a pattern of every
fashion) to have a coat made for himself every month.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
did Mouston neglect complying with your instructions?  Ah! that was anything but right, Mouston.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
monsieur, quite the contrary; quite the contrary!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
he never forgot to have his coats made; but he forgot to inform me that he had
got stouter!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
it was not my fault, monsieur! your tailor never told me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
this to such an extent, monsieur,&quot; continued Porthos, &quot;that the
fellow in two years has gained eighteen inches in girth, and so my last dozen
coats are all too large, from a foot to a foot and a half.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
the rest; those which were made when you were of the same size?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;They
are no longer the fashion, my dear friend. 
Were I to put them on, I should look like a fresh arrival from Siam; and
as though I had been two years away from court.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
understand your difficulty.  You have
how many new suits? nine? thirty-six? and yet not one to wear.  Well, you must have a thirty-seventh made,
and give the thirty-six to Mouston.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
monsieur!&quot; said Mouston, with a gratified air.  &quot;The truth is, that monsieur has always been very generous
to me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you mean to insinuate that I hadn't that idea, or that I was deterred by the
expense?  But it wants only two days to
the <i>fête</i>; I received the invitation
yesterday; made Mouston post hither with my wardrobe, and only this morning
discovered my misfortune; and from now till the day after to-morrow, there
isn't a single fashionable tailor who will undertake to make me a suit.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is to say, one covered all over with gold, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
wish it so! undoubtedly, all over.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
we shall manage it.  You won't leave for
three days.  The invitations are for
Wednesday, and this is only Sunday morning.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Tis
true; but Aramis has strongly advised me to be at Vaux twenty-four hours
beforehand.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How,
Aramis?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
it was Aramis who brought me the invitation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
to be sure, I see.  You are invited on
the part of M. Fouquet?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;By
no means! by the king, dear friend.  The
letter bears the following as large as life: 'M. le Baron du Vallon is informed
that the king has condescended to place him on the invitation list - '&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
good; but you leave with M. Fouquet?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
when I think,&quot; cried Porthos, stamping on the floor, &quot;when I think I
shall have no clothes, I am ready to burst with rage!  I should like to strangle somebody or smash something!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Neither
strangle anybody nor smash anything, Porthos; I will manage it all; put on one
of your thirty-six suits, and come with me to a tailor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Pooh!
my agent has seen them all this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Even
M. Percerin?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
is M. Percerin?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
only the king's tailor!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
ah, yes,&quot; said Porthos, who wished to appear to know the king's tailor,
but now heard his name mentioned for the first time; &quot;to M. Percerin's, by
Jove!  I was afraid he would be too
busy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Doubtless
he will be; but be at ease, Porthos; he will do for me what he wouldn't do for
another.  Only you must allow yourself
to be measured!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
said Porthos, with a sigh, &quot;'tis vexatious, but what would you have me
do?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do?  As others do; as the king does.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!
do they measure the king, too? does <i>he</i>
put up with it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
king is a beau, my good friend, and so are you, too, whatever you may say about
it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos
smiled triumphantly.  &quot;Let us go to
the king's tailor,&quot; he said; &quot;and since he measures the king, I
think, by my faith, I may do worse than allow him to measure <i>me!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Who Messire Jean
Percerin Was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he
king's tailor, Messire Jean Percerin, occupied a rather large house in the Rue
St. Honoré, near the Rue de l'Arbre Sec. 
He was a man of great taste in elegant stuffs, embroideries, and
velvets, being hereditary tailor to the king. 
The preferment of his house reached as far back as the time of Charles
IX.; from whose reign dated, as we know, fancy in <i>bravery</i> difficult enough to gratify.  The Percerin of that period was a Huguenot, like Ambrose Paré,
and had been spared by the Queen of Navarre, the beautiful Margot, as they used
to write and say, too, in those days; because, in sooth, he was the only one
who could make for her those wonderful riding-habits which she so loved to
wear, seeing that they were marvelously well suited to hide certain anatomical
defects, which the Queen of Navarre used very studiously to conceal.  Percerin being saved, made, out of
gratitude, some beautiful black bodices, very inexpensively indeed, for Queen
Catherine, who ended by being pleased at the preservation of a Huguenot people,
on whom she had long looked with detestation. 
But Percerin was a very prudent man; and having heard it said that there
was no more dangerous sign for a Protestant than to be smiled up on by
Catherine, and having observed that her smiles were more frequent than usual,
he speedily turned Catholic with all his family; and having thus become
irreproachable, attained the lofty position of master tailor to the Crown of
France.  Under Henry III., gay king as
he was, this position was a grand as the height of one of the loftiest peaks of
the Cordilleras.  Now Percerin had been
a clever man all his life, and by way of keeping up his reputation beyond the
grave, took very good care not to make a bad death of it, and so contrived to
die very skillfully; and that at the very moment he felt his powers of
invention declining.  He left a son and
a daughter, both worthy of the name they were called upon to bear; the son, a
cutter as unerring and exact as the square rule; the daughter, apt at
embroidery, and at designing ornaments. 
The marriage of Henry IV. and Marie de Medici, and the exquisite court-mourning
for the afore-mentioned queen, together with a few words let fall by M. de
Bassompière, king of the <i>beaux</i> of the
period, made the fortune of the second generation of Percerins.  M. Concino Concini, and his wife Galligaï,
who subsequently shone at the French court, sought to Italianize the fashion,
and introduced some Florentine tailors; but Percerin, touched to the quick in
his patriotism and his self-esteem, entirely defeated these foreigners, and
that so well that Concino was the first to give up his compatriots, and held
the French tailor in such esteem that he would never employ any other, and thus
wore a doublet of his on the very day that Vitry blew out his brains with a
pistol at the Pont du Louvre.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And so
it was a doublet issuing from M. Percerin's workshop, which the Parisians
rejoiced in hacking into so many pieces with the living human body it
contained.  Notwithstanding the favor
Concino Concini had shown Percerin, the king, Louis XIII., had the generosity
to bear no malice to his tailor, and to retain him in his service.  At the time that Louis the Just afforded this
great example of equity, Percerin had brought up two sons, one of whom made his
<i>début</i> at the marriage of Anne of
Austria, invented that admirable Spanish costume, in which Richelieu danced a
saraband, made the costumes for the tragedy of &quot;Mirame,&quot; and stitched
on to Buckingham's mantle those famous pearls which were destined to be
scattered about the pavements of the Louvre. 
A man becomes easily notable who has made the dresses of a Duke of
Buckingham, a M. de Cinq-Mars, a Mademoiselle Ninon, a M. de Beaufort, and a
Marion de Lorme.  And thus Percerin the
third had attained the summit of his glory when his father died.  This same Percerin III., old, famous and
wealthy, yet further dressed Louis XIV.; and having no son, which was a great
cause of sorrow to him, seeing that with himself his dynasty would end, he had
brought up several hopeful pupils.  He
possessed a carriage, a country house, men-servants the tallest in Paris; and
by special authority from Louis XIV., a pack of hounds.  He worked for MM. de Lyonne and Letellier,
under a sort of patronage; but politic man as he was, and versed in state
secrets, he never succeeded in fitting M. Colbert.  This is beyond explanation; it is a matter for guessing or for intuition.  Great geniuses of every kind live on unseen,
intangible ideas; they act without themselves knowing why.  The great Percerin (for, contrary to the
rule of dynasties, it was, above all, the last of the Percerins who deserved
the name of Great), the great Percerin was inspired when he cut a robe for the
queen, or a coat for the king; he could mount a mantle for Monsieur, the clock
of a stocking for Madame; but, in spite of his supreme talent, he could never
hit off anything approaching a creditable fit for M. Colbert.  &quot;That man,&quot; he used often to say,
&quot;is beyond my art; my needle can never dot him down.&quot;  We need scarcely say that Percerin was M.
Fouquet's tailor, and that the superintendent highly esteemed him.  M. Percerin was nearly eighty years old,
nevertheless still fresh, and at the same time so dry, the courtiers used to
say, that he was positively brittle. 
His renown and his fortune were great enough for M. le Prince, that king
of fops, to take his arm when talking over the fashions; and for those least
eager to pay never to dare to leave their accounts in arrear with him; for
Master Percerin would for the first time make clothes upon credit, but the
second never, unless paid for the former order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                It is
easy to see at once that a tailor of such renown, instead of running after
customers, made difficulties about obliging any fresh ones.  And so Percerin declined to fit <i>bourgeois</i>, or those who had but recently
obtained patents of nobility.  A story
used to circulate that even M. de Mazarin, in exchange for Percerin supplying
him with a full suit of ceremonial vestments as cardinal, one fine day slipped
letters of nobility into his pocket.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                It was
to the house of this grand llama of tailors that D'Artagnan took the despairing
Porthos; who, as they were going along, said to his friend, &quot;Take care, my
good D'Artagnan, not to compromise the dignity of a man such as I am with the
arrogance of this Percerin, who will, I expect, be very impertinent; for I give
you notice, my friend, that if he is wanting in respect I will infallibly
chastise him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Presented
by me,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, &quot;you have nothing to fear, even though
you were what you are not.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
'tis because - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What?  Have you anything against Percerin,
Porthos?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
think that I once sent Mouston to a fellow of that name.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
fellow refused to supply me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
a misunderstanding, no doubt, which it will be now exceedingly easy to set
right.  Mouston must have made a
mistake.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Perhaps.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
has confused the names.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Possibly.  That rascal Mouston never can remember
names.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will take it all upon myself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
good.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Stop
the carriage, Porthos; here we are.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Here!
how here?  We are at the Halles; and you
told me the house was at the corner of the Rue de l'Arbre Sec.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Tis
true, but look.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
I do look, and I see - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Pardieu!</i> that we are at the
Halles!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
do not, I suppose, want our horses to clamber up on the roof of the carriage in
front of us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nor
the carriage in front of us to mount on top of the one in front of it.  Nor that the second should be driven over
the roofs of the thirty or forty others which have arrived before us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
you are right, indeed.  What a number of
people!  And what are they all
about?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Tis
very simple.  They are waiting their
turn.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bah!  Have the comedians of the Hôtel de Bourgogne
shifted their quarters?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No;
their turn to obtain an entrance to M. Percerin's house.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
we are going to wait too?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
we shall show ourselves prompter and not so proud.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
are we to do, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Get
down, pass through the footmen and lackeys, and enter the tailor's house, which
I will answer for our doing, if you go first.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come
along, then,&quot; said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                They accordingly
alighted and made their way on foot towards the establishment.  The cause of the confusion was that M.
Percerin's doors were closed, while a servant, standing before them, was
explaining to the illustrious customers of the illustrious tailor that just
then M. Percerin could not receive anybody. 
It was bruited about outside still, on the authority of what the great
lackey had told some great noble whom he favored, in confidence, that M.
Percerin was engaged on five costumes for the king, and that, owing to the
urgency of the case, he was meditating in his office on the ornaments, colors,
and cut of these five suits.  Some,
contented with this reason, went away again, contented to repeat the tale to
others, but others, more tenacious, insisted on having the doors opened, and
among these last three Blue Ribbons, intended to take parts in a ballet, which
would inevitably fail unless the said three had their costumes shaped by the
very hand of the great Percerin himself. 
D'Artagnan, pushing on Porthos, who scattered the groups of people right
and left, succeeded in gaining the counter, behind which the journeyman tailors
were doing their best to answer queries. 
(We forgot to mention that at the door they wanted to put off Porthos
like the rest, but D'Artagnan, showing himself, pronounced merely these words,
&quot;The king's order,&quot; and was let in with his friend.)  The poor fellows had enough to do, and did
their best, to reply to the demands of the customers in the absence of their
master, leaving off drawing a stitch to knit a sentence; and when wounded
pride, or disappointed expectation, brought down upon them too cutting a
rebuke, he who was attacked made a dive and disappeared under the counter.  The line of discontented lords formed a
truly remarkable picture.  Our captain
of musketeers, a man of sure and rapid observation, took it all in at a glance;
and having run over the groups, his eye rested on a man in front of him.  This man, seated upon a stool, scarcely
showed his head above the counter that sheltered him.  He was about forty years of age, with a melancholy aspect, pale
face, and soft luminous eyes.  He was
looking at D'Artagnan and the rest, with his chin resting upon his hand, like a
calm and inquiring amateur.  Only on
perceiving, and doubtless recognizing, our captain, he pulled his hat down over
his eyes.  It was this action, perhaps,
that attracted D'Artagnan's attention. 
If so, the gentleman who had pulled down his hat produced an effect
entirely different from what he had desired. 
In other respects his costume was plain, and his hair evenly cut enough
for customers, who were not close observers, to take him for a mere tailor's
apprentice, perched behind the board, and carefully stitching cloth or velvet.  Nevertheless, this man held up his head too
often to be very productively employed with his fingers.  D'Artagnan was not deceived, - not he; and
he saw at once that if this man was working at anything, it certainly was not
at velvet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh!&quot;
said he, addressing this man, &quot;and so you have become a tailor's boy,
Monsieur Molière!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Hush,
M. d'Artagnan!&quot; replied the man, softly, &quot;you will make them
recognize me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
and what harm?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
fact is, there is no harm, but - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
were going to say there is no good in doing it either, is it not so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Alas!
no; for I was occupied in examining some excellent figures.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Go
on - go on, Monsieur Molière.  I quite
understand the interest you take in the plates - I will not disturb your
studies.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Thank
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
on one condition; that you tell me where M. Percerin really is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
willingly; in his own room.  Only -
&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Only
that one can't enter it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Unapproachable.&quot;<br>                &quot;For everybody?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Everybody.  He brought me here so that I might be at my
ease to make my observations, and then he went away.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
my dear Monsieur Molière, but you will go and tell him I am here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I!&quot;
exclaimed Molière, in the tone of a courageous dog, from which you snatch the
bone it has legitimately gained; &quot;I disturb myself!  Ah! 
Monsieur d'Artagnan, how hard you are upon me!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
you don't go directly and tell M. Percerin that I am here, my dear
Molière,&quot; said D'Artagnan, in a low tone, &quot;I warn you of one thing:
that I won't exhibit to you the friend I have brought with me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Molière
indicated Porthos by an imperceptible gesture, &quot;This gentleman, is it
not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Molière
fixed upon Porthos one of those looks which penetrate the minds and hearts of
men.  The subject doubtless appeared a
very promising one, for he immediately rose and led the way into the adjoining
chamber.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

all this time the noble mob was slowly heaving away, leaving at every angle of
the counter either a murmur or a menace, as the waves leave foam or scattered
seaweed on the sands, when they retire with the ebbing tide.  In about ten minutes Molière reappeared,
making another sign to D'Artagnan from under the hangings.  The latter hurried after him, with Porthos
in the rear, and after threading a labyrinth of corridors, introduced him to M.
Percerin's room.  The old man, with his
sleeves turned up, was gathering up in folds a piece of gold-flowered brocade,
so as the better to exhibit its luster. 
Perceiving D'Artagnan, he put the silk aside, and came to meet him, by
no means radiant with joy, and by no means courteous, but, take it altogether,
in a tolerably civil manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
captain of the king's musketeers will excuse me, I am sure, for I am
engaged.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh!
yes, on the king's costumes; I know that, my dear Monsieur Percerin.  You are making three, they tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Five,
my dear sir, five.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Three
or five, 'tis all the same to me, my dear monsieur; and I know that you will
make them most exquisitely.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
I know.  Once made they will be the most
beautiful in the world, I do not deny it; but that they may be the most
beautiful in the word, they must first be made; and to do this, captain, I am
pressed for time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
bah! there are two days yet; 'tis much more than you require, Monsieur
Percerin,&quot; said D'Artagnan, in the coolest possible manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Percerin
raised his head with the air of a man little accustomed to be contradicted,
even in his whims; but D'Artagnan did not pay the least attention to the airs
which the illustrious tailor began to assume.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
dear M. Percerin,&quot; he continued, &quot;I bring you a customer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
ah!&quot; exclaimed Percerin, crossly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
lang=FR>&quot;M. le Baron du Vallon de Bracieux de
Pierrefonds,&quot; continued D'Artagnan. 
</span>Percerin attempted a bow, which found no favor in the eyes of the
terrible Porthos, who, from his first entry into the room, had been regarding
the tailor askance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
very good friend of mine,&quot; concluded D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will attend to monsieur,&quot; said Percerin, &quot;but later.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Later?
but when?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;When
I have time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have already told my valet as much,&quot; broke in Porthos, discontentedly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
likely,&quot; said Percerin; &quot;I am nearly always pushed for time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
friend,&quot; returned Porthos, sententiously, &quot;there is always time to be
found when one chooses to seek it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Percerin
turned crimson; an ominous sign indeed in old men blanched by age.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
is quite at liberty to confer his custom elsewhere.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come,
come, Percerin,&quot; interposed D'Artagnan, &quot;you are not in a good temper
to-day.  Well, I will say one more word
to you, which will bring you on your knees; monsieur is not only a friend of
mine, but more, a friend of M. Fouquet's.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
ah!&quot; exclaimed the tailor, &quot;that is another thing.&quot;  Then turning to Porthos, &quot;Monsieur le
baron is attached to the superintendent?&quot; he inquired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am attached to myself,&quot; shouted Porthos, at the very moment that the
tapestry was raised to introduce a new speaker in the dialogue.  Molière was all observation, D'Artagnan
laughed, Porthos swore.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
dear Percerin,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;you will make a dress for the
baron.  'Tis I who ask you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
you I will not say nay, captain.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
that is not all; you will make it for him at once.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Tis
impossible within eight days.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That,
then, is as much as to refuse, because the dress is wanted for the <i>fête</i> at Vaux.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
repeat that it is impossible,&quot; returned the obstinate old man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;By
no means, dear Monsieur Percerin, above all if <i>I</i> ask you,&quot; said a mild voice at the door, a silvery voice
which made D'Artagnan prick up his ears. 
It was the voice of Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
d'Herblay!&quot; cried the tailor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
lang=FR>&quot;Aramis,&quot; murmured D'Artagnan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=FR>                </span>&quot;Ah! our
bishop!&quot; said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Good
morning, D'Artagnan; good morning, Porthos; good-morning, my dear
friends,&quot; said Aramis.  &quot;Come,
come, M. Percerin, make the baron's dress; and I will answer for it you will
gratify M. Fouquet.&quot;  And he
accompanied the words with a sign, which seemed to say, &quot;Agree, and
dismiss them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                It
appeared that Aramis had over Master Percerin an influence superior even to
D'Artagnan's, for the tailor bowed in assent, and turning round upon Porthos,
said, &quot;Go and get measured on the other side.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos
colored in a formidable manner. 
D'Artagnan saw the storm coming, and addressing Molière, said to him, in
an undertone, &quot;You see before you, my dear monsieur, a man who considers
himself disgraced, if you measure the flesh and bones that Heaven has given
him; study this type for me, Master Aristophanes, and profit by it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Molière
had no need of encouragement, and his gaze dwelt long and keenly on the Baron
Porthos.  &quot;Monsieur,&quot; he said,
&quot;if you will come with me, I will make them take your measure without
touching you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!&quot;
said Porthos, &quot;how do you make that out, my friend?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
say that they shall apply neither line nor rule to the seams of your
dress.  It is a new method we have
invented for measuring people of quality, who are too sensitive to allow
low-born fellows to touch them.  We know
some susceptible persons who will not put up with being measured, a process which,
as I think, wounds the natural dignity of a man; and if perchance monsieur
should be one of these - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Corbuf!</i>  I believe I am too!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
that is a capital and most consolatory coincidence, and you shall have the
benefit of our invention.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
how in the world can it be done?&quot; asked Porthos, delighted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
said Molière, bowing, &quot;if you will deign to follow me, you will see.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
observed this scene with all his eyes. 
Perhaps he fancied from D'Artagnan's liveliness that he would leave with
Porthos, so as not to lose the conclusion of a scene well begun.  But, clear-sighted as he was, Aramis
deceived himself.  Porthos and Molière
left together: D'Artagnan remained with Percerin.  Why?  From curiosity,
doubtless; probably to enjoy a little longer the society of his good friend
Aramis.  As Molière and Porthos
disappeared, D'Artagnan drew near the bishop of Vannes, a proceeding which
appeared particularly to disconcert him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
dress for you, also, is it not, my friend?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
smiled.  &quot;No,&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will go to Vaux, however?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
shall go, but without a new dress.  You
forget, dear D'Artagnan, that a poor bishop of Vannes is not rich enough to
have new dresses for every <i>fête</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bah!&quot;
said the musketeer, laughing, &quot;and do we write no more poems now,
either?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!  D'Artagnan,&quot; exclaimed Aramis, &quot;I
have long ago given up all such tomfoolery.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;True,&quot;
repeated D'Artagnan, only half convinced. 
As for Percerin, he was once more absorbed in contemplation of the
brocades.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Don't
you perceive,&quot; said Aramis, smiling, &quot;that we are greatly boring this
good gentleman, my dear D'Artagnan?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
ah!&quot; murmured the musketeer, aside; &quot;that is, I am boring you, my
friend.&quot;  Then aloud, &quot;Well,
then, let us leave; I have no further business here, and if you are as
disengaged as I, Aramis - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
not I - I wished - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
you had something particular to say to M. Percerin?  Why did you not tell me so at once?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Something
particular, certainly,&quot; repeated Aramis, &quot;but not for you,
D'Artagnan.  But, at the same time, I
hope you will believe that I can never have anything so particular to say that
a friend like you may not hear it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
no, no!  I am going,&quot; said
D'Artagnan, imparting to his voice an evident tone of curiosity; for Aramis's
annoyance, well dissembled as it was, had not a whit escaped him; and he knew
that, in that impenetrable mind, every thing, even the most apparently trivial,
was designed to some end; an unknown one, but an end that, from the knowledge
he had of his friend's character, the musketeer felt must be important.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                On his
part, Aramis saw that D'Artagnan was not without suspicion, and pressed
him.  &quot;Stay, by all means,&quot; he
said, &quot;this is what it is.&quot; 
Then turning towards the tailor, &quot;My dear Percerin,&quot; said he,
- &quot;I am even very happy that you are here, D'Artagnan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
indeed,&quot; exclaimed the Gascon, for the third time, even less deceived this
time than before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Percerin
never moved.  Aramis roused him
violently, by snatching from his hands the stuff upon which he was
engaged.  &quot;My dear Percerin,&quot;
said he, &quot;I have, near hand, M. Lebrun, one of M. Fouquet's
painters.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah,
very good,&quot; thought D'Artagnan; &quot;but why Lebrun?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
looked at D'Artagnan, who seemed to be occupied with an engraving of Mark
Antony.  &quot;And you wish that I
should make him a dress, similar to those of the Epicureans?&quot; answered
Percerin.  And while saying this, in an
absent manner, the worthy tailor endeavored to recapture his piece of brocade.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;An
Epicurean's dress?&quot; asked D'Artagnan, in a tone of inquiry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
see,&quot; said Aramis, with a most engaging smile, &quot;it is written that
our dear D'Artagnan shall know all our secrets this evening.  Yes, friend, you have surely heard speak of
M. Fouquet's Epicureans, have you not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Undoubtedly.  Is it not a kind of poetical society, of
which La Fontaine, Loret, Pélisson, and Molière are members, and which holds
its sittings at Saint-Mandé?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Exactly
so.  Well, we are going to put our poets
in uniform, and enroll them in a regiment for the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
very well, I understand; a surprise M. Fouquet is getting up for the king.  Be at ease; if that is the secret about M.
Lebrun, I will not mention it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Always
agreeable, my friend.  No, Monsieur
Lebrun has nothing to do with this part of it; the secret which concerns him is
far more important than the other.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then,
if it is so important as all that, I prefer not to know it,&quot; said
D'Artagnan, making a show of departure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come
in, M. Lebrun, come in,&quot; said Aramis, opening a side-door with his right
hand, and holding back D'Artagnan with his left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I'faith,
I too, am quite in the dark,&quot; quoth Percerin.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
took an &quot;opportunity,&quot; as is said in theatrical matters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
dear M. de Percerin,&quot; Aramis continued, &quot;you are making five dresses
for the king, are you not?  One in
brocade; one in hunting-cloth; one in velvet; one in satin; and one in
Florentine stuffs.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
but how - do you know all that, monseigneur?&quot; said Percerin, astounded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is all very simple, my dear monsieur; there will be a hunt, a banquet, concert,
promenade and reception; these five kinds of dress are required by
etiquette.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
know everything, monseigneur!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
a thing or two in addition,&quot; muttered D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,&quot;
cried the tailor, in triumph, &quot;what you do not know, monseigneur - prince
of the church though you are - what nobody will know - what only the king,
Mademoiselle de la Vallière, and myself do know, is the color of the materials
and nature of the ornaments, and the cut, the <i>ensemble</i>, the finish of it all!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,&quot;
said Aramis, &quot;that is precisely what I have come to ask you, dear
Percerin.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah,
bah!&quot; exclaimed the tailor, terrified, though Aramis had pronounced these
words in his softest and most honeyed tones. 
The request appeared, on reflection, so exaggerated, so ridiculous, so
monstrous to M. Percerin that first he laughed to himself, then aloud, and
finished with a shout.  D'Artagnan
followed his example, not because he found the matter so &quot;very
funny,&quot; but in order not to allow Aramis to cool.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;At
the outset, I appear to be hazarding an absurd question, do I not?&quot; said
Aramis.  &quot;But D'Artagnan, who is
incarnate wisdom itself, will tell you that I could not do otherwise than ask
you this.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
us see,&quot; said the attentive musketeer; perceiving with his wonderful
instinct that they had only been skirmishing till now, and that the hour of
battle was approaching.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
us see,&quot; said Percerin, incredulously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
now,&quot; continued Aramis, &quot;does M. Fouquet give the king a <i>fête?</i> - Is it not to please him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Assuredly,&quot;
said Percerin.  <span lang=FR>D'Artagnan nodded assent.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=FR>                </span>&quot;By delicate
attentions? by some happy device? by a succession of surprises, like that of
which we were talking? - the enrolment of our Epicureans.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Admirable.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
then; this is the surprise we intend. 
M. Lebrun here is a man who draws most excellently.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,&quot;
said Percerin; &quot;I have seen his pictures, and observed that his dresses
were highly elaborated.  That is why I
at once agreed to make him a costume - whether to agree with those of the
Epicureans, or an original one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
dear monsieur, we accept your offer, and shall presently avail ourselves of it;
but just now, M. Lebrun is not in want of the dresses you will make for
himself, but of those you are making for the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Percerin
made a bound backwards, which D'Artagnan - calmest and most appreciative of
men, did not consider overdone, so many strange and startling aspects wore the
proposal which Aramis had just hazarded. 
&quot;The king's dresses!  Give
the king's dresses to any mortal whatever! 
Oh! for once, monseigneur, your grace is mad!&quot; cried the poor
tailor in extremity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Help
me now, D'Artagnan,&quot; said Aramis, more and more calm and smiling.  &quot;Help me now to persuade monsieur, for <i>you</i> understand; do you not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh!
eh! - not exactly, I declare.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!
you do not understand that M. Fouquet wishes to afford the king the surprise of
finding his portrait on his arrival at Vaux; and that the portrait, which be a
striking resemblance, ought to be dressed exactly as the king will be on the
day it is shown?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
yes, yes,&quot; said the musketeer, nearly convinced, so plausible was this
reasoning.  &quot;Yes, my dear Aramis,
you are right; it is a happy idea.  I
will wager it is one of your own, Aramis.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
I don't know,&quot; replied the bishop; &quot;either mine or M.
Fouquet's.&quot;  Then scanning
Percerin, after noticing D'Artagnan's hesitation, &quot;Well, Monsieur
Percerin,&quot; he asked, &quot;what do you say to this?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
say, that - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
you are, doubtless, free to refuse.  I
know well - and I by no means count upon compelling you, my dear monsieur.  I will say more, I even understand all the
delicacy you feel in taking up with M. Fouquet's idea; you dread appearing to
flatter the king.  A noble spirit, M.
Percerin, a noble spirit!&quot;  The
tailor stammered.  &quot;It would,
indeed, be a very pretty compliment to pay the young prince,&quot; continued
Aramis; &quot;but as the surintendant told me, 'if Percerin refuse, tell him
that it will not at all lower him in my opinion, and I shall always esteem him,
only - '&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Only?'&quot;
repeated Percerin, rather troubled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Only,'&quot;
continued Aramis, &quot;'I shall be compelled to say to the king,' - you
understand, my dear Monsieur Percerin, that these are M. Fouquet's words, - 'I
shall be constrained to say to the king, &quot;Sire, I had intended to present
your majesty with your portrait, but owing to a feeling of delicacy, slightly
exaggerated perhaps, although creditable, M. Percerin opposed the
project.&quot;'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Opposed!&quot;
cried the tailor, terrified at the responsibility which would weigh upon him;
&quot;I to oppose the desire, the will of M. Fouquet when he is seeking to
please the king!  Oh, what a hateful
word you have uttered, monseigneur. 
Oppose!  Oh, 'tis not I who said
it, Heaven have mercy on me.  I call the
captain of the musketeers to witness it! 
Is it not true, Monsieur d'Artagnan, that I have opposed nothing?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
made a sign indicating that he wished to remain neutral.  He felt that there was an intrigue at the
bottom of it, whether comedy or tragedy; he was at his wit's end at not being
able to fathom it, but in the meanwhile wished to keep clear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                But
already Percerin, goaded by the idea that the king was to be told he stood in
the way of a pleasant surprise, had offered Lebrun a chair, and proceeded to
bring from a wardrobe four magnificent dresses, the fifth being still in the
workmen's hands; and these masterpieces he successively fitted upon four lay
figures, which, imported into France in the time of Concini, had been given to
Percerin II. by Marshal d'Onore, after the discomfiture of the Italian tailors
ruined in their competition.  The
painter set to work to draw and then to paint the dresses.  But Aramis, who was closely watching all the
phases of his toil, suddenly stopped him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
think you have not quite got it, my dear Lebrun,&quot; he said; &quot;your
colors will deceive you, and on canvas we shall lack that exact resemblance
which is absolutely requisite.  Time is
necessary for attentively observing the finer shades.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Quite
true,&quot; said Percerin, &quot;but time is wanting, and on that head, you
will agree with me, monseigneur, I can do nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
the affair will fail,&quot; said Aramis, quietly, &quot;and that because of a
want of precision in the colors.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Nevertheless
Lebrun went on copying the materials and ornaments with the closest fidelity -
a process which Aramis watched with ill-concealed impatience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
in the world, now, is the meaning of this imbroglio?&quot; the musketeer kept
saying to himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
will never do,&quot; said Aramis: &quot;M. Lebrun, close your box, and roll up
your canvas.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,
monsieur,&quot; cried the vexed painter, &quot;the light is abominable
here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;An
idea, M. Lebrun, an idea!  If we had a
pattern of the materials, for example, and with time, and a better light -
&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
then,&quot; cried Lebrun, &quot;I would answer for the effect.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Good!&quot;
said D'Artagnan, &quot;this ought to be the knotty point of the whole thing;
they want a pattern of each of the materials. 
<i>Mordioux!</i>  Will this Percerin give in now?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Percerin,
beaten from his last retreat, and duped, moreover, by the feigned good-nature of
Aramis, cut out five patterns and handed them to the bishop of Vannes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
like this better.  That is your opinion,
is it not?&quot; said Aramis to D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
dear Aramis,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;my opinion is that you are always the
same.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And,
consequently, always your friend,&quot; said the bishop in a charming tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
yes,&quot; said D'Artagnan, aloud; then, in a low voice, &quot;If I am your
dupe, double Jesuit that you are, I will not be your accomplice; and to prevent
it, 'tis time I left this place. - Adieu, Aramis,&quot; he added aloud,
&quot;adieu; I am going to rejoin Porthos.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
wait for me,&quot; said Aramis, pocketing the patterns, &quot;for I have done,
and shall be glad to say a parting word to our dear old friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Lebrun
packed up his paints and brushes, Percerin put back the dresses into the
closet, Aramis put his hand on his pocket to assure himself the patterns were
secure, - and they all left the study.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>D</span>'Artagnan
found Porthos in the adjoining chamber; but no longer an irritated Porthos, or
a disappointed Porthos, but Porthos radiant, blooming, fascinating, and
chattering with Molière, who was looking upon him with a species of idolatry,
and as a man would who had not only never seen anything greater, but not even
ever anything so great.  Aramis went
straight up to Porthos and offered him his white hand, which lost itself in the
gigantic clasp of his old friend, - an operation which Aramis never hazarded
without a certain uneasiness.  But the
friendly pressure having been performed not too painfully for him, the bishop
of Vannes passed over to Molière.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
monsieur,&quot; said he, &quot;will you come with me to Saint-Mandé?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will go anywhere you like, monseigneur,&quot; answered Molière.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
Saint-Mandé!&quot; cried Porthos, surprised at seeing the proud bishop of
Vannes fraternizing with a journeyman tailor. 
&quot;What, Aramis, are you going to take this gentleman to
Saint-Mandé?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,&quot;
said Aramis, smiling, &quot;our work is pressing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
besides, my dear Porthos,&quot; continued D'Artagnan, &quot;M. Molière is not
altogether what he seems.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
what way?&quot; asked Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
this gentleman is one of M. Percerin's chief clerks, and is expected at
Saint-Mandé to try on the dresses which M. Fouquet has ordered for the
Epicureans.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Tis
precisely so,&quot; said Molière.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come,
then, my dear M. Molière,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;that is, if you have done
with M. du Vallon.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
have finished,&quot; replied Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
you are satisfied?&quot; asked D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Completely
so,&quot; replied Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Molière
took his leave of Porthos with much ceremony, and grasped the hand which the
captain of the musketeers furtively offered him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Pray,
monsieur,&quot; concluded Porthos, mincingly, &quot;above all, be exact.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will have your dress the day after to-morrow, monsieur le baron,&quot; answered
Molière.  And he left with Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Then
D'Artagnan, taking Porthos's arm, &quot;What has this tailor done for you, my
dear Porthos,&quot; he asked, &quot;that you are so pleased with him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
has he done for me, my friend! done for me!&quot; cried Porthos,
enthusiastically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
I ask you, what has he done for you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
friend, he has done that which no tailor ever yet accomplished: he has taken my
measure without touching me!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah,
bah! tell me how he did it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;First,
then, they went, I don't know where, for a number of lay figures, of all
heights and sizes, hoping there would be one to suit mine, but the largest -
that of the drum-major of the Swiss guard - was two inches too short, and a
half foot too narrow in the chest.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Indeed!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is exactly as I tell you, D'Artagnan; but he is a great man, or at the very
least a great tailor, is this M. Molière. 
He was not at all put at fault by the circumstance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
did he do, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
it is a very simple matter.  I'faith,
'tis an unheard-of thing that people should have been so stupid as not to have
discovered this method from the first. 
What annoyance and humiliation they would have spared me!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Not
to mention of the costumes, my dear Porthos.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
thirty dresses.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
my dear Porthos, come, tell me M. Molière's plan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Molière?  You call him so, do you?  I shall make a point of recollecting his
name.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
or Poquelin, if you prefer that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No;
I like Molière best.  When I wish to
recollect his name, I shall think of <i>volière</i>
[an aviary]; and as I have one at Pierrefonds - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
lang=FR>&quot;Capital!&quot; returned
D'Artagnan.  </span>&quot;And M.
Molière's plan?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Tis
this: instead of pulling me to pieces, as all these rascals do - of making me
bend my back, and double my joints - all of them low and dishonorable practices
- &quot;  D'Artagnan made a sign of
approbation with his head.  &quot;'Monsieur,'
he said to me,&quot; continued Porthos, &quot;'a gentleman ought to measure
himself.  Do me the pleasure to draw
near this glass;' and I drew near the glass. 
I must own I did not exactly understand what this good M. Volière wanted
with me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
lang=FR>&quot;Molière!&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=FR>                &quot;Ah! yes, Molière -
Molière.  </span>And as the fear of
being measured still possessed me, 'Take care,' said I to him, 'what you are
going to do with me; I am very ticklish, I warn you.'  But he, with his soft voice (for he is a courteous fellow, we
must admit, my friend), he with his soft voice, 'Monsieur,' said he, 'that your
dress may fit you well, it must be made according to your figure.  Your figure is exactly reflected in this
mirror.  We shall take the measure of
this reflection.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
fact,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;you saw yourself in the glass; but where did
they find one in which you could see your whole figure?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
good friend, it is the very glass in which the king is used to look to see
himself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
but the king is a foot and a half shorter than you are.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
well, I know not how that may be; it is, no doubt, a cunning way of flattering
the king; but the looking-glass was too large for me.  'Tis true that its height was made up of three Venetian plates of
glass, placed one above another, and its breadth of three similar
parallelograms in juxtaposition.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
Porthos! what excellent words you have command of.  Where in the word did you acquire such a voluminous
vocabulary?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;At
Belle-Isle.  Aramis and I had to use
such words in our strategic studies and castramentative experiments.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
recoiled, as though the sesquipedalian syllables had knocked the breath out of
his body.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
very good.  Let us return to the
looking-glass, my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then,
this good M. Volière - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Molière.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes
- Molière - you are right.  You will see
now, my dear friend, that I shall recollect his name quite well.  This excellent M. Molière set to work
tracing out lines on the mirror, with a piece of Spanish chalk, following in
all the make of my arms and my shoulders, all the while expounding this maxim,
which I thought admirable: 'It is advisable that a dress should not incommode
its wearer.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
reality,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;that is an excellent maxim, which is,
unfortunately, seldom carried out in practice.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is why I found it all the more astonishing, when he expatiated upon it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
he expatiated?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Parbleu!&quot;</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>                </i>&quot;Let me hear his
theory.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Seeing
that,' he continued, 'one may, in awkward circumstances, or in a troublesome
position, have one's doublet on one's shoulder, and not desire to take one's
doublet off - '&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
lang=FR>&quot;True,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=FR>                </span>&quot;'And so,' continued
M. Volière - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
lang=FR>&quot;Molière.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=FR>                &quot;Molière, yes.  </span>'And so,' went on M. Molière, 'you
want to draw your sword, monsieur, and you have your doublet on your back.  What do you do?'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'I
take it off,' I answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;'Well, no,' he replied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;'How no?'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'I
say that the dress should be so well made, that it will in no way encumber you,
even in drawing your sword.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;'Ah, ah!'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;'Throw yourself on guard,'
pursued he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I did it with such wondrous
firmness, that two panes of glass burst out of the window.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;''Tis nothing, nothing,' said
he.  'Keep your position.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
raised my left arm in the air, the forearm gracefully bent, the ruffle
drooping, and my wrist curved, while my right arm, half extended, securely
covered my wrist with the elbow, and my breast with the wrist.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Yes,&quot; said D'Artagnan,
&quot;'tis the true guard - the academic guard.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;You have said the very word,
dear friend.  In the meanwhile, Volière
- &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Molière.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Hold!  I should certainly, after all, prefer to
call him - what did you say his other name was?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Poquelin.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I prefer to call him
Poquelin.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;And how will you remember
this name better than the other?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;You understand, he calls
himself Poquelin, does he not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;If I were to call to mind
Madame Coquenard.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Good.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;And change <i>Coc</i> into <i>Poc</i>, <i>nard</i> into <i>lin</i>; and instead of Coquenard I shall
have Poquelin.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Tis
wonderful,&quot; cried D'Artagnan, astounded. 
&quot;Go on, my friend, I am listening to you with admiration.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;This Coquelin sketched my arm
on the glass.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I beg your pardon -
Poquelin.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;What did I say, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;You said Coquelin.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
true.  This Poquelin, then, sketched my
arm on the glass; but he took his time over it; he kept looking at me a good
deal.  The fact is, that I must have
been looking particularly handsome.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;'Does it weary you?' he
asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;'A little,' I replied,
bending a little in my hands, 'but I could hold out for an hour or so longer.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'No,
no, I will not allow it; the willing fellows will make it a duty to support
your arms, as of old, men supported those of the prophet.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;'Very good,' I answered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;'That will not be humiliating
to you?'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'My
friend,' said I, 'there is, I think, a great difference between being supported
and being measured.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;The distinction is full of
the soundest sense,&quot; interrupted D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then,&quot;
continued Porthos, &quot;he made a sign: two lads approached; one supported my
left arm, while the other, with infinite address, supported my right.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Another,
my man,' cried he.  A third
approached.  'Support monsieur by the
waist,' said he.  The <i>garçon</i> complied.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;So that you were at
rest?&quot; asked D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Perfectly; and Pocquenard
drew me on the glass.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Poquelin, my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Poquelin - you are
right.  Stay, decidedly I prefer calling
him Volière.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Yes; and then it was over,
wasn't it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;During that time Volière drew
me as I appeared in the mirror.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;'Twas delicate in him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I much like the plan; it is
respectful, and keeps every one in his place.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;And there it ended?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Without a soul having touched
me, my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Except the three <i>garçons</i> who supported you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Doubtless;
but I have, I think, already explained to you the difference there is between
supporting and measuring.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Tis
true,&quot; answered D'Artagnan; who said afterwards to himself, &quot;I'faith,
I greatly deceive myself, or I have been the means of a good windfall to that
rascal Molière, and we shall assuredly see the scene hit off to the life in
some comedy or other.&quot;  Porthos
smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;What are you laughing
at?&quot; asked D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Must I confess?  Well, I was laughing over my good
fortune.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
that is true; I don't know a happier man than you.  But what is this last piece of luck that has befallen you?'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Well, my dear fellow,
congratulate me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I desire nothing better.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;It seems that I am the first
who has had his measure taken in that manner.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Are you so sure of it?'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nearly
so.  Certain signs of intelligence which
passed between Volière and the other <i>garçons</i>
showed me the fact.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Well, my friend, that does
not surprise me from Molière,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Volière, my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
no, no, indeed!  I am very willing to
leave you to go on saying Volière; but, as for me, I shall continued to say
Molière.  Well, this, I was saying, does
not surprise me, coming from Molière, who is a very ingenious fellow, and
inspired you with this grand idea.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;It will be of great use to
him by and by, I am sure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Won't
it be of use to him, indeed?  I believe
you, it will, and that in the highest degree; - for you see my friend Molière
is of all known tailors the man who best clothes our barons, comtes, and
marquises - according to their measure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                On this
observation, neither the application nor depth of which we shall discuss,
D'Artagnan and Porthos quitted M. de Percerin's house and rejoined their
carriages, wherein we will leave them, in order to look after Molière and
Aramis at Saint-Mandé.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Chapter VI:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>The Bee-Hive, the

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he
bishop of Vannes, much annoyed at having met D'Artagnan at M. Percerin's,
returned to Saint-Mandé in no very good humor. 
Molière, on the other hand, quite delighted at having made such a
capital rough sketch, and at knowing where to find his original again, whenever
he should desire to convert his sketch into a picture, Molière arrived in the
merriest of moods.  All the first story
of the left wing was occupied by the most celebrated Epicureans in Paris, and
those on the freest footing in the house - every one in his compartment, like
the bees in their cells, employed in producing the honey intended for that
royal cake which M. Fouquet proposed to offer his majesty Louis XIV. during the
<i>fête</i> at Vaux.  Pélisson, his head leaning on his hand, was
engaged in drawing out the plan of the prologue to the &quot;Fâcheux,&quot; a
comedy in three acts, which was to be put on the stage by Poquelin de Molière,
as D'Artagnan called him, or Coquelin de Volière, as Porthos styled him.  Loret, with all the charming innocence of a
gazetteer, - the gazetteers of all ages have always been so artless! - Loret
was composing an account of the <i>fêtes</i>
at Vaux, before those <i>fêtes</i> had taken
place.  La Fontaine sauntered about from
one to the other, a peripatetic, absent-minded, boring, unbearable dreamer, who
kept buzzing and humming at everybody's elbow a thousand poetic abstractions.  He so often disturbed Pélisson, that the
latter, raising his head, crossly said, &quot;At least, La Fontaine, supply me
with a rhyme, since you have the run of the gardens at Parnassus.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
rhyme do you want?&quot; asked the <i>Fabler</i>
as Madame de Sévigné used to call him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
want a rhyme to <i>lumière</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
lang=FR>&quot;<i>Ornière</i>,&quot;
answered La Fontaine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=FR>                </span>&quot;Ah, but, my good
friend, one cannot talk of <i>wheel-ruts</i>
when celebrating the delights of Vaux,&quot; said Loret.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Besides,
it doesn't rhyme,&quot; answered Pélisson.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!
doesn't rhyme!&quot; cried La Fontaine, in surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
you have an abominable habit, my friend, - a habit which will ever prevent your
becoming a poet of the first order.  You
rhyme in a slovenly manner.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
oh, you think so, do you, Pélisson?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
I do, indeed.  Remember that a rhyme is
never good so long as one can find a better.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
I will never write anything again save in prose,&quot; said La Fontaine, who
had taken up Pélisson's reproach in earnest. 
&quot;Ah!  I often suspected I
was nothing but a rascally poet!  Yes,
'tis the very truth.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
not say so; your remark is too sweeping, and there is much that is good in your
'Fables.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
to begin,&quot; continued La Fontaine, following up his idea, &quot;I will go
and burn a hundred verses I have just made.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Where
are your verses?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
my head.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
if they are in your head you cannot burn them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;True,&quot;
said La Fontaine; &quot;but if I do not burn them - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
what will happen if you do not burn them?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;They
will remain in my mind, and I shall never forget them!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
deuce!&quot; cried Loret; &quot;what a dangerous thing!  One would go mad with it!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
deuce! the deuce!&quot; repeated La Fontaine; &quot;what can I do?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have discovered the way,&quot; said Molière, who had entered just at this point
of the conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
way?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Write
them first and burn them afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
simple!  Well, I should never have
discovered that.  What a mind that devil
of a Molière has!&quot; said La Fontaine. 
Then, striking his forehead, &quot;Oh, thou wilt never be aught but an
ass, Jean La Fontaine!&quot; he added.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>What</i> are you saying there, my
friend?&quot; broke in Molière, approaching the poet, whose aside he had heard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
say I shall never be aught but an ass,&quot; answered La Fontaine, with a heavy
sigh and swimming eyes.  &quot;Yes, my
friend,&quot; he added, with increasing grief, &quot;it seems that I rhyme in a
slovenly manner.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
'tis wrong to say so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nay,
I am a poor creature!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
said so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Parbleu!</i> 'twas Pélisson; did you not,
Pélisson?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Pélisson,
again absorbed in his work, took good care not to answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
if Pélisson said you were so,&quot; cried Molière, &quot;Pélisson has seriously
offended you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you think so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!  I advise you, as you are a gentleman, not to
leave an insult like that unpunished.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>What!</i>&quot; exclaimed La Fontaine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Did
you ever fight?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Once
only, with a lieutenant in the light horse.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
wrong had he done you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
seems he ran away with my wife.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah,
ah!&quot; said Molière, becoming slightly pale; but as, at La Fontaine's
declaration, the others had turned round, Molière kept upon his lips the
rallying smile which had so nearly died away, and continuing to make La
Fontaine speak - </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
what was the result of the duel?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
result was, that on the ground my opponent disarmed me, and then made an
apology, promising never again to set foot in my house.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
you considered yourself satisfied?&quot; said Molière.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Not
at all! on the contrary, I picked up my sword. 
'I beg your pardon, monsieur,' I said, 'I have not fought you because
you were my wife's friend, but because I was told I ought to fight.  So, as I have never known any peace save
since you made her acquaintance, do me the pleasure to continue your visits as
heretofore, or <i>morbleu!</i> let us set to
again.'  And so,&quot; continued La
Fontaine, &quot;he was compelled to resume his friendship with madame, and I
continue to be the happiest of husbands.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                All
burst out laughing.  Molière alone
passed his hand across his eyes. 
Why?  Perhaps to wipe away a
tear, perhaps to smother a sigh.  Alas!
we know that Molière was a moralist, but he was not a philosopher.  &quot;'Tis all one,&quot; he said, returning
to the topic of the conversation, &quot;Pélisson has insulted you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah,
truly!  I had already forgotten
it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
I am going to challenge him on your behalf.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
you can do so, if you think it indispensable.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
do think it indispensable, and I am going to - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Stay,&quot;
exclaimed La Fontaine, &quot;I want your advice.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Upon
what? this insult?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No;
tell me really now whether <i>lumière</i>
does not rhyme with <i>ornière</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
should make them rhyme.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!  I knew you would.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
I have made a hundred thousand such rhymes in my time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
hundred thousand!&quot; cried La Fontaine. 
&quot;Four times as many as 'La Pucelle,' which M. Chaplain is
meditating.  Is it also on this subject,
too, that you have composed a hundred thousand verses?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Listen
to me, you eternally absent-minded creature,&quot; said Molière.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is certain,&quot; continued La Fontaine, &quot;that <i>légume</i>, for instance, rhymes with <i>posthume</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
the plural, above all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
above all in the plural, seeing that then it rhymes not with three letters, but
with four; as <i>ornière</i> does with <i>lumière</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
give me <i>ornières</i> and <i>lumières</i> in the plural, my dear
Pélisson,&quot; said La Fontaine, clapping his hand on the shoulder of his
friend, whose insult he had quite forgotten, &quot;and they will rhyme.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Hem!&quot;
coughed Pélisson.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Molière
says so, and Molière is a judge of such things; he declares he has himself made
a hundred thousand verses.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come,&quot;
said Molière, laughing, &quot;he is off now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is like <i>rivage</i>, which rhymes
admirably with <i>herbage</i>.  I would take my oath of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
- &quot; said Molière.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
tell you all this,&quot; continued La Fontaine, &quot;because you are preparing
a <i>divertissement</i> for Vaux, are you
not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
the 'Fâcheux.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah,
yes, the 'Fâcheux;' yes, I recollect. 
Well, I was thinking a prologue would admirably suit your <i>divertissement</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Doubtless
it would suit capitally.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
you are of my opinion?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;So
much so, that I have asked you to write this very prologue.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
asked <i>me</i> to write it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
you, and on your refusal begged you to ask Pélisson, who is engaged upon it at
this moment.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
that is what Pélisson is doing, then? 
I'faith, my dear Molière, you are indeed often right.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;When?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;When
you call me absent-minded.  It is a monstrous
defect; I will cure myself of it, and do your prologue for you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
inasmuch as Pélisson is about it! - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah,
true, miserable rascal that I am!  Loret
was indeed right in saying I was a poor creature.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
was not Loret who said so, my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
then, whoever said so, 'tis the same to me! 
And so your <i>divertissement</i> is
called the 'Fâcheux?'  Well, can you
make <i>heureux</i> rhyme with <i>fâcheux?</i>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
obliged, yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
even with <i>capriceux</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
no, no.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
would be hazardous, and yet why so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
is too great a difference in the cadences.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
was fancying,&quot; said La Fontaine, leaving Molière for Loret - &quot;I was
fancying - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
were you fancying?&quot; said Loret, in the middle of a sentence.  &quot;Make haste.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are writing the prologue to the 'Fâcheux,' are you not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No!
<i>mordieu!</i> it is Pélisson.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah,
Pélisson,&quot; cried La Fontaine, going over to him, &quot;I was
fancying,&quot; he continued, &quot;that the nymph of Vaux - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah,
beautiful!&quot; cried Loret.  &quot;The
nymph of Vaux! thank you, La Fontaine; you have just given me the two
concluding verses of my paper.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
if you can rhyme so well, La Fontaine,&quot; said Pélisson, &quot;tell me now
in what way you would begin my prologue?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
should say, for instance, 'Oh! nymph, who - ' 
After 'who' I should place a verb in the second person singular of the
present indicative; and should go on thus: 'this grot profound.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
the verb, the verb?&quot; asked Pélisson.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
admire the greatest king of all kings round,&quot; continued La Fontaine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
the verb, the verb,&quot; obstinately insisted Pélisson.  &quot;This second person singular of the
present indicative?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
then; quittest:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                                <span
style='font-size:8.0pt;'>&quot;Oh, nymph, who quittest
now this grot profound,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:8.0pt;'>                                To admire the
greatest king of all kings round.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
would not put 'who quittest,' would you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why
not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Quittest,'
after 'you who'?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
my dear fellow,&quot; exclaimed La Fontaine, &quot;you are a shocking
pedant!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Without
counting,&quot; said Molière, &quot;that the second verse, 'king of all kings
round,' is very weak, my dear La Fontaine.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
you see clearly I am nothing but a poor creature, - a shuffler, as you
said.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
never said so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then,
as Loret said.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
it was not Loret either; it was Pélisson.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
Pélisson was right a hundred times over. 
But what annoys me more than anything, my dear Molière, is, that I fear
we shall not have our Epicurean dresses.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
expected yours, then, for the <i>fête?</i>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
for the <i>fête</i>, and then for after the <i>fête</i>. 
My housekeeper told me that my own is rather faded.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Diable!</i> your housekeeper is right;
rather more than faded.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah,
you see,&quot; resumed La Fontaine, &quot;the fact is, I left it on the floor
in my room, and my cat - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
your cat - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;She
made her nest upon it, which has rather changed its color.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Molière
burst out laughing; Pélisson and Loret followed his example.  At this juncture, the bishop of Vannes
appeared, with a roll of plans and parchments under his arm.  As if the angel of death had chilled all gay
and sprightly fancies - as if that wan form had scared away the Graces to whom
Xenocrates sacrificed - silence immediately reigned through the study, and
every one resumed his self-possession and his pen.  Aramis distributed the notes of invitation, and thanked them in
the name of M. Fouquet.  &quot;The
superintendent,&quot; he said, &quot;being kept to his room by business, could
not come and see them, but begged them to send him some of the fruits of their
day's work, to enable him to forget the fatigue of his labor in the
night.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At
these words, all settled down to work. 
La Fontaine placed himself at a table, and set his rapid pen an endless
dance across the smooth white vellum; Pélisson made a fair copy of his
prologue; Molière contributed fifty fresh verses, with which his visit to
Percerin had inspired him; Loret, an article on the marvelous <i>fêtes</i> he predicted; and Aramis, laden
with his booty like the king of the bees, that great black drone, decked with
purple and gold, re-entered his apartment, silent and busy.  But before departing, &quot;Remember, gentlemen,&quot;
said he, &quot;we leave to-morrow evening.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
that case, I must give notice at home,&quot; said Molière.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
poor Molière!&quot; said Loret, smiling; &quot;he loves his home.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'<i>He</i> loves,' yes,&quot; replied Molière,
with his sad, sweet smile.  &quot;'He
loves,' that does not mean, they love <i>him</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;As
for me,&quot; said La Fontaine, &quot;they love me at Château Thierry, I am
very sure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
here re-entered after a brief disappearance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Will
any one go with me?&quot; he asked. 
&quot;I am going by Paris, after having passed a quarter of an hour with
M. Fouquet.  I offer my carriage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Good,&quot;
said Molière, &quot;I accept it.  I am
in a hurry.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
shall dine here,&quot; said Loret. 
&quot;M. de Gourville has promised me some craw-fish.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
has promised me some whitings.  Find a
rhyme for that, La Fontaine.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
went out laughing, as only he could laugh, and Molière followed him.  They were at the bottom of the stairs, when
La Fontaine opened the door, and shouted out:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                                <span
style='font-size:8.0pt;'>&quot;He has promised us some
whitings,</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:8.0pt;'>                                In return for
these our writings.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
shouts of laughter reached the ears of Fouquet at the moment Aramis opened the
door of the study.  As to Molière, he
had undertaken to order the horses, while Aramis went to exchange a parting
word with the superintendent.  &quot;Oh,
how they are laughing there!&quot; said Fouquet, with a sigh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you not laugh, monseigneur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
laugh no longer now, M. d'Herblay.  The <i>fête</i> is approaching; money is
departing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Have
I not told you that was my business?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
you promised me millions.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
shall have them the day after the king's <i>entrée</i>
into Vaux.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
looked closely at Aramis, and passed the back of his icy hand across his
moistened brow.  Aramis perceived that
the superintendent either doubted him, or felt he was powerless to obtain the
money.  How could Fouquet suppose that a
poor bishop, ex-abbé, ex-musketeer, could find any?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why
doubt me?&quot; said Aramis.  Fouquet
smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Man
of little faith!&quot; added the bishop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
dear M. d'Herblay,&quot; answered Fouquet, &quot;if I fall - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well;
if you 'fall'?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
shall, at least, fall from such a height, that I shall shatter myself in
falling.&quot;  Then giving himself a
shake, as though to escape from himself, &quot;Whence came you,&quot; said he,
&quot;my friend?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;From
Paris - from Percerin.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
what have you been doing at Percerin's, for I suppose you attach no great
importance to our poets' dresses?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No;
I went to prepare a surprise.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Surprise?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
which you are going to give to the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
will it cost much?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
a hundred pistoles you will give Lebrun.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
painting? - Ah! all the better!  And
what is this painting to represent?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will tell you; then at the same time, whatever you may say or think of it, I
went to see the dresses for our poets.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bah!
and they will be rich and elegant?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Splendid!  There will be few great monseigneurs with so
good.  People will see the difference
there is between the courtiers of wealth and those of friendship.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ever
generous and grateful, dear prelate.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
your school.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
grasped his hand.  &quot;And where are
you going?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I am off to Paris, when you
shall have given a certain letter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;For whom?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;M. de Lyonne.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;And what do you want with
Lyonne?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I wish to make him sign a <i>lettre de cachet</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'><span lang=FR>&quot;'<i>Lettre de cachet!</i>'  </span>Do you desire to put somebody in the
Bastile?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;On the contrary - to let
somebody out.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;And who?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
poor devil - a youth, a lad who has been Bastiled these ten years, for two
Latin verses he made against the Jesuits.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Two
Latin verses!' and, for 'two Latin verses,' the miserable being has been in
prison for ten years!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Yes!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;And has committed no other
crime?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Beyond this, he is as
innocent as you or I.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;On your word?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;On my honor!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;And his name is - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Seldon.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Yes. - But it is too
bad.  You knew this, and you never told
me!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;'Twas only yesterday his
mother applied to me, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;And the woman is poor!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;In the deepest misery.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Heaven,&quot;
said Fouquet, &quot;sometimes bears with such injustice on earth, that I hardly
wonder there are wretches who doubt of its existence.  Stay, M. d'Herblay.&quot; 
And Fouquet, taking a pen, wrote a few rapid lines to his colleague
Lyonne.  Aramis took the letter and made
ready to go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Wait,&quot;
said Fouquet.  He opened his drawer, and
took out ten government notes which were there, each for a thousand
francs.  &quot;Stay,&quot; he said;
&quot;set the son at liberty, and give this to the mother; but, above all, do
not tell her - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;What, monseigneur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
she is ten thousand livres richer than I. 
She would say I am but a poor superintendent!  Go! and I pray that God will bless those who are mindful of his
poor!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;So also do I pray,&quot;
replied Aramis, kissing Fouquet's hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And he
went out quickly, carrying off the letter for Lyonne and the notes for Seldon's
mother, and taking up Molière, who was beginning to lose patience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Another Supper at the
Bastile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>S</span>even
o'clock sounded from the great clock of the Bastile, that famous clock, which,
like all the accessories of the state prison, the very use of which is a torture,
recalled to the prisoners' minds the destination of every hour of their
punishment.  The time-piece of the
Bastile, adorned with figures, like most of the clocks of the period,
represented St. Peter in bonds.  It was
the supper hour of the unfortunate captives. 
The doors, grating on their enormous hinges, opened for the passage of
the baskets and trays of provisions, the abundance and the delicacy of which,
as M. de Baisemeaux has himself taught us, was regulated by the condition in
life of the prisoner.  We understand on
this head the theories of M. de Baisemeaux, sovereign dispenser of gastronomic
delicacies, head cook of the royal fortress, whose trays, full-laden, were
ascending the steep staircases, carrying some consolation to the prisoners in
the shape of honestly filled bottles of good vintages.  This same hour was that of M. le
gouverneur's supper also.  He had a
guest to-day, and the spit turned more heavily than usual.  Roast partridges, flanked with quails and
flanking a larded leveret; boiled fowls; hams, fried and sprinkled with white
wine, <i>cardons</i> of Guipuzcoa and <i>la bisque écrevisses</i>: these, together
with soups and <i>hors d'uvres</i>,
constituted the governor's bill of fare. 
Baisemeaux, seated at table, was rubbing his hands and looking at the
bishop of Vannes, who, booted like a cavalier, dressed in gray and sword at
side, kept talking of his hunger and testifying the liveliest impatience.  M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun was not
accustomed to the unbending movements of his greatness my lord of Vannes, and
this evening Aramis, becoming sprightly, volunteered confidence on
confidence.  The prelate had again a
little touch of the musketeer about him. 
The bishop just trenched on the borders only of license in his style of
conversation.  As for M. de Baisemeaux,
with the facility of vulgar people, he gave himself up entirely upon this point
of his guest's freedom. 
&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said he, &quot;for indeed to-night I dare not call
you monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;By
no means,&quot; said Aramis; &quot;call me monsieur; I am booted.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you know, monsieur, of whom you remind me this evening?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No!
faith,&quot; said Aramis, taking up his glass; &quot;but I hope I remind you of
a capital guest.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
remind me of two, monsieur.  François,
shut the window; the wind may annoy his greatness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
let him go,&quot; added Aramis. 
&quot;The supper is completely served, and we shall eat it very well
without waiters.  I like exceedingly to
be <i>tête-à-tête</i> when I am with a
friend.&quot;  Baisemeaux bowed
respectfully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
like exceedingly,&quot; continued Aramis, &quot;to help myself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
lang=FR>&quot;Retire, François,&quot; cried
Baisemeaux.  </span>&quot;I was saying
that your greatness puts me in mind of two persons; one very illustrious, the
late cardinal, the great Cardinal de la Rochelle, who wore boots like
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Indeed,&quot;
said Aramis; &quot;and the other?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
other was a certain musketeer, very handsome, very brave, very adventurous,
very fortunate, who, from being abbé, turned musketeer, and from musketeer
turned abbé.&quot;  Aramis condescended
to smile.  &quot;From abbé,&quot;
continued Baisemeaux, encouraged by Aramis's smile - &quot;from abbé, bishop -
and from bishop - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
stay there, I beg,&quot; exclaimed Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have just said, monsieur, that you gave me the idea of a cardinal.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Enough,
dear M. Baisemeaux.  As you said, I have
on the boots of a cavalier, but I do not intend, for all that, to embroil
myself with the church this evening.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
you have wicked intentions, nevertheless, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
yes, wicked, I own, as everything mundane is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
traverse the town and the streets in disguise?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
disguise, as you say.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
you still make use of your sword?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
I should think so; but only when I am compelled.  Do me the pleasure to summon François.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Have
you no wine there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Tis
not for wine, but because it is hot here, and the window is shut.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
shut the windows at supper-time so as not to hear the sounds or the arrival of
couriers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah,
yes.  You hear them when the window is
open?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
too well, and that disturbs me.  You
understand?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nevertheless
I am suffocated.   <span lang=FR>François.&quot; 
François entered.  </span>&quot;Open
the windows, I pray you, Master François,&quot; said Aramis.  &quot;You will allow him, dear M.
Baisemeaux?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are at home here,&quot; answered the governor. 
The window was opened.  &quot;Do
you not think,&quot; said M. de Baisemeaux, &quot;that you will find yourself
very lonely, now M. de la Fère has returned to his household gods at
Blois?  He is a very old friend, is he
not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
know it as I do, Baisemeaux, seeing that you were in the musketeers with
us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bah!
with my friends I reckon neither bottles of wine nor years.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
you are right.  But I do more than love
M. de la Fère, dear Baisemeaux; I venerate him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
for my part, though 'tis singular,&quot; said the governor, &quot;I prefer M.
d'Artagnan to him.  There is a man for
you, who drinks long and well!  That
kind of people allow you at least to penetrate their thoughts.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Baisemeaux,
make me tipsy to-night; let us have a merry time of it as of old, and if I have
a trouble at the bottom of my heart, I promise you, you shall see it as you
would a diamond at the bottom of your glass.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bravo!&quot;
said Baisemeaux, and he poured out a great glass of wine and drank it off at a
draught, trembling with joy at the idea of being, by hook or by crook, in the
secret of some high archiepiscopal misdemeanor.  While he was drinking he did not see with what attention Aramis
was noting the sounds in the great court. 
A courier came in about eight o'clock as François brought in the fifth
bottle, and, although the courier made a great noise, Baisemeaux heard nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
devil take him,&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!
who?&quot; asked Baisemeaux.  &quot;I
hope 'tis neither the wine you drank nor he who is the cause of your drinking
it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No;
it is a horse, who is making noise enough in the court for a whole
squadron.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Pooh!
some courier or other,&quot; replied the governor, redoubling his attention to
the passing bottle.  &quot;Yes; and may
the devil take him, and so quickly that we shall never hear him speak more.  Hurrah! hurrah!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
forget me, Baisemeaux! my glass is empty,&quot; said Aramis, lifting his
dazzling Venetian goblet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Upon
my honor, you delight me.  <span
lang=FR>François, wine!&quot;  François entered.  </span>&quot;Wine, fellow! and better.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monsieur, yes; but a courier has just arrived.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
him go to the devil, I say.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monsieur, but - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
him leave his news at the office; we will see to it to-morrow.  To-morrow, there will be time to-morrow;
there will be daylight,&quot; said Baisemeaux, chanting the words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah,
monsieur,&quot; grumbled the soldier François, in spite of himself,
&quot;monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Take
care,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;take care!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Of
what? dear M. d'Herblay,&quot; said Baisemeaux, half intoxicated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
letter which the courier brings to the governor of a fortress is sometimes an
order.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nearly
always.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
not orders issue from the ministers?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
undoubtedly; but - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
what to these ministers do but countersign the signature of the king?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Perhaps
you are right.  Nevertheless, 'tis very
tiresome when you are sitting before a good table, <i>tête-à-tête</i> with a friend - Ah! I beg your pardon, monsieur; I
forgot it is I who engage you at supper, and that I speak to a future
cardinal.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
us pass over that, dear Baisemeaux, and return to our soldier, to
François.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
and what has François done?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
has demurred!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
was wrong, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;However,
he <i>has</i> demurred, you see; 'tis
because there is something extraordinary in this matter.  It is very possible that it was not François
who was wrong in demurring, but you, who are in the wrong in not listening to
him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Wrong?  I to be wrong before François? that seems
rather hard.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Pardon
me, merely an irregularity.  But I
thought it my duty to make an observation which I deem important.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
perhaps you are right,&quot; stammered Baisemeaux.  &quot;The king's order is sacred; but as to orders that arrive
when one is at supper, I repeat that the devil - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
you had said as much to the great cardinal - hem! my dear Baisemeaux, and if
his order had any importance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
do it that I may not disturb a bishop.  <i>Mordioux!</i> am I not, then,
excusable?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
not forget, Baisemeaux, that I have worn the soldier's coat, and I am
accustomed to obedience everywhere.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
wish, then - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
wish that you would do your duty, my friend; yes, at least before this
soldier.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Tis
mathematically true,&quot; exclaimed Baisemeaux.  François still waited: &quot;Let them send this order of the
king's up to me,&quot; he repeated, recovering himself.  And he added in a low tone, &quot;Do you
know what it is?  I will tell you
something about as interesting as this. 
'Beware of fire near the powder magazine;' or, 'Look close after such
and such a one, who is clever at escaping,' 
Ah! if you only knew, monseigneur, how many times I have been suddenly
awakened from the very sweetest, deepest slumber, by messengers arriving at
full gallop to tell me, or rather, bring me a slip of paper containing these
words: 'Monsieur de Baisemeaux, what news?' 
'Tis clear enough that those who waste their time writing such orders
have never slept in the Bastile.  They
would know better; they have never considered the thickness of my walls, the
vigilance of my officers, the number of rounds we go.  But, indeed, what can you expect, monseigneur?  It is their business to write and torment me
when I am at rest, and to trouble me when I am happy,&quot; added Baisemeaux,
bowing to Aramis.  &quot;Then let them
do their business.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
do you do yours,&quot; added the bishop, smiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                François
re-entered; Baisemeaux took from his hands the minister's order.  He slowly undid it, and as slowly read
it.  Aramis pretended to be drinking, so
as to be able to watch his host through the glass.  Then, Baisemeaux, having read it: &quot;What was I just
saying?&quot; he exclaimed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is it?&quot; asked the bishop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;An
order of release!  There, now; excellent
news indeed to disturb us!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Excellent
news for him whom it concerns, you will at least agree, my dear governor!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
at eight o'clock in the evening!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is charitable!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
charity is all very well, but it is for that fellow who says he is so weary and
tired, but not for me who am amusing myself,&quot; said Baisemeaux,
exasperated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Will
you lose by him, then?  And is the
prisoner who is to be set at liberty a good payer?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
yes, indeed! a miserable, five-franc rat!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
me see it,&quot; asked M. d'Herblay. 
&quot;It is no indiscretion?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;By
no means; read it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
is 'Urgent,' on the paper; you have seen that, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
admirable!  'Urgent!' - a man who has
been there ten years!  It is <i>urgent</i> to set him free to-day, this very
evening, at eight o'clock! - <i>urgent!</i>&quot;  And Baisemeaux, shrugging his shoulders with
an air of supreme disdain, flung the order on the table and began eating again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;They
are fond of these tricks!&quot; he said, with his mouth full; &quot;they seize
a man, some fine day, keep him under lock and key for ten years, and write to
you, 'Watch this fellow well,' or 'Keep him very strictly.'  And then, as soon as you are accustomed to
look upon the prisoner as a dangerous man, all of a sudden, without rhyme or
reason they write - 'Set him at liberty,' and actually add to their missive -
'urgent.'  You will own, my lord, 'tis
enough to make a man at dinner shrug his shoulders!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
do you expect?  It is for them to
write,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;for you to execute the order.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Good!
good! execute it!  Oh, patience!  You must not imagine that I am a
slave.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Gracious
Heaven! my very good M. Baisemeaux, who ever said so?  Your independence is well known.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Thank
Heaven!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
your goodness of heart is also known.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
don't speak of it!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
your obedience to your superiors.  Once
a soldier, you see, Baisemeaux, always a soldier.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
I shall directly obey; and to-morrow morning, at daybreak, the prisoner
referred to shall be set free.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;At
dawn.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why
not this evening, seeing that the <i>lettre
de cachet</i> bears, both on the direction and inside, '<i>urgent</i>'?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Because
this evening we are at supper, and our affairs are urgent, too!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Dear
Baisemeaux, booted though I be, I feel myself a priest, and charity has higher
claims upon me than hunger and thirst. 
This unfortunate man has suffered long enough, since you have just told
me that he has been your prisoner these ten years.  Abridge his suffering. 
His good time has come; give him the benefit quickly.  God will repay you in Paradise with years of
felicity.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
wish it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
entreat you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!
in the very middle of our repast?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
implore you; such an action is worth ten Benedicites.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
shall be as you desire, only our supper will get cold.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
never heed that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Baisemeaux
leaned back to ring for François, and by a very natural motion turned round
towards the door.  The order had
remained on the table; Aramis seized the opportunity when Baisemeaux was not
looking to change the paper for another, folded in the same manner, which he
drew swiftly from his pocket. 
&quot;François,&quot; said the governor, &quot;let the major come up
here with the turnkeys of the Bertaudière.&quot;  François bowed and quitted the room, leaving the two companions
alone. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Chapter VIII:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>The General of the

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>here
was now a brief silence, during which Aramis never removed his eyes from
Baisemeaux for a moment.  The latter
seemed only half decided to disturb himself thus in the middle of supper, and
it was clear he was trying to invent some pretext, whether good or bad, for
delay, at any rate till after dessert. 
And it appeared also that he had hit upon an excuse at last.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh!
but it is impossible!&quot; he cried.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
impossible?&quot; said Aramis. 
&quot;Give me a glimpse of this impossibility.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Tis
impossible to set a prisoner at liberty at such an hour.  Where can he go to, a man so unacquainted
with Paris?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
will find a place wherever he can.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
see, now, one might as well set a blind man free!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have a carriage, and will take him wherever he wishes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have an answer for everything. 
François, tell monsieur le major to go and open the cell of M. Seldon,
No. 3, Bertaudière.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Seldon!&quot;
exclaimed Aramis, very naturally. 
&quot;You said Seldon, I think?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
said Seldon, of course.  'Tis the name
of the man they set free.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
you mean to say Marchiali?&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Marchiali?
oh! yes, indeed.  No, no, Seldon.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
think you are making a mistake, Monsieur Baisemeaux.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have read the order.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
I also.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
I saw 'Seldon' in letters as large as that,&quot; and Baisemeaux held up his
finger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
I read 'Marchiali' in characters as large as this,&quot; said Aramis, also
holding up two fingers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
the proof; let us throw a light on the matter,&quot; said Baisemeaux, confident
he was right.  &quot;There is the paper,
you have only to read it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
read 'Marchiali,'&quot; returned Aramis, spreading out the paper.  &quot;Look.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Baisemeaux
looked, and his arms dropped suddenly. 
&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; he said, quite overwhelmed; &quot;yes,
Marchiali.  'Tis plainly written
Marchiali!  Quite true!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
- &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How?
the man of whom we have talked so much? 
The man whom they are every day telling me to take such care of?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
is 'Marchiali,'&quot; repeated the inflexible Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
must own it, monseigneur.  But I
understand nothing about it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
believe your eyes, at any rate.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
tell me very plainly there is 'Marchiali.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
in a good handwriting, too.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Tis
a wonder!  I still see this order and
the name of Seldon, Irishman.  I see
it.  Ah!  I even recollect that under this name there was a blot of
ink.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
there is no ink; no, there is no blot.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
but there was, though; I know it, because I rubbed my finger - this very one -
in the powder that was over the blot.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
a word, be it how it may, dear M. Baisemeaux,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;and
whatever you may have seen, the order is signed to release Marchiali, blot or
no blot.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
order is signed to release Marchiali,&quot; replied Baisemeaux, mechanically,
endeavoring to regain his courage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
you are going to release this prisoner. 
If your heart dictates you to deliver Seldon also, I declare to you I
will not oppose it the least in the world.&quot;  Aramis accompanied this remark with a smile, the irony of which
effectually dispelled Baisemeaux's confusion of mind, and restored his courage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur,&quot;
he said, &quot;this Marchiali is the very same prisoner whom the other day a
priest confessor of <i>our order</i> came to
visit in so imperious and so secret a manner.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
don't know that, monsieur,&quot; replied the bishop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Tis
no such long time ago, dear Monsieur d'Herblay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is true.  But <i>with us</i>, monsieur, it is good that the man of to-day should no
longer know what the man of yesterday did.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
any case,&quot; said Baisemeaux, &quot;the visit of the Jesuit confessor must
have given happiness to this man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
made no reply, but recommenced eating and drinking.  As for Baisemeaux, no longer touching anything that was on the
table, he again took up the order and examined it every way.  This investigation, under ordinary
circumstances, would have made the ears of the impatient Aramis burn with
anger; but the bishop of Vannes did not become incensed for so little, above
all, when he had murmured to himself that to do so was dangerous.  &quot;Are you going to release Marchiali?&quot;
he said.  &quot;What mellow, fragrant
and delicious sherry this is, my dear governor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur,&quot;
replied Baisemeaux, &quot;I shall release the prisoner Marchiali when I have
summoned the courier who brought the order, and above all, when, by interrogating
him, I have satisfied myself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
order is sealed, and the courier is ignorant of the contents.  What do you want to satisfy yourself
about?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Be
it so, monseigneur; but I shall send to the ministry, and M. de Lyonne will
either confirm or withdraw the order.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is the good of all that?&quot; asked Aramis, coldly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
good?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
what is your object, I ask?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
object of never deceiving oneself, monseigneur; nor being wanting in the
respect which a subaltern owes to his superior officers, nor infringing the
duties of a service one has accepted of one's own free will.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
good; you have just spoken so eloquently, that I cannot but admire you.  It is true that a subaltern owes respect to
his superiors; he is guilty when he deceives himself, and he should be punished
if he infringed either the duties or laws of his office.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Baisemeaux
looked at the bishop with astonishment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
follows,&quot; pursued Aramis, &quot;that you are going to ask advice, to put
your conscience at ease in the matter?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
if a superior officer gives you orders, you will obey?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Never
doubt it, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
know the king's signature well, M. de Baisemeaux?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is
it not on this order of release?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is true, but it may - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Be
forged, you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is evident, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are right.  And that of M. de
Lyonne?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
see it plain enough on the order; but for the same reason that the king's
signature may have been forged, so also, and with even greater probability, may
M. de Lyonne's.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
logic has the stride of a giant, M. de Baisemeaux,&quot; said Aramis; &quot;and
your reasoning is irresistible.  But on
what special grounds do you base your idea that these signatures are
false?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;On
this: the absence of counter-signatures. 
Nothing checks his majesty's signature; and M. de Lyonne is not there to
tell me he has signed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
Monsieur de Baisemeaux,&quot; said Aramis, bending an eagle glance on the
governor, &quot;I adopt so frankly your doubts, and your mode of clearing them
up, that I will take a pen, if you will give me one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Baisemeaux
gave him a pen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
a sheet of white paper,&quot; added Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Baisemeaux
handed him some paper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Now,
I - I, also - I, here present - incontestably, I - am going to write an order
to which I am certain you will give credence, incredulous as you are!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Baisemeaux
turned pale at this icy assurance of manner. 
It seemed to him that the voice of the bishop's, but just now so playful
and gay, had become funereal and sad; that the wax lights changed into the
tapers of a mortuary chapel, the very glasses of wine into chalices of blood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
took a pen and wrote.  Baisemeaux, in
terror, read over his shoulder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A.
M. D. G.,&quot; wrote the bishop; and he drew a cross under these four letters,
which signify <i>ad majorem Dei gloriam</i>,
&quot;to the greater glory of God;&quot; and thus he continued: &quot;It is our
pleasure that the order brought to M. de Baisemeaux de Montlezun, governor, for
the king, of the castle of the Bastile, be held by him good and effectual, and
be immediately carried into operation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>&quot;(Signed)
D'HERBLAY</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>&quot;General of the
Order, by the grace of God.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Baisemeaux
was so profoundly astonished, that his features remained contracted, his lips
parted, and his eyes fixed.  He did not
move an inch, nor articulate a sound. 
Nothing could be heard in that large chamber but the wing-whisper of a
little moth, which was fluttering to its death about the candles.  Aramis, without even deigning to look at the
man whom he had reduced to so miserable a condition, drew from his pocket a
small case of black wax; he sealed the letter, and stamped it with a seal
suspended at his breast, beneath his doublet, and when the operation was
concluded, presented - still in silence - the missive to M. de Baisemeaux.  The latter, whose hands trembled in a manner
to excite pity, turned a dull and meaningless gaze upon the letter.  A last gleam of feeling played over his
features, and he fell, as if thunder-struck, on a chair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come,
come,&quot; said Aramis, after a long silence, during which the governor of the
Bastile had slowly recovered his senses, &quot;do not lead me to believe, dear
Baisemeaux, that the presence of the general of the order is as terrible as
His, and that men die merely from having seen Him.  Take courage, rouse yourself; give me your hand - obey.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Baisemeaux,
reassured, if not satisfied, obeyed, kissed Aramis's hand, and rose.  &quot;Immediately?&quot; he murmured.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
there is no pressing haste, my host; take your place again, and do the honors
over this beautiful dessert.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur,
I shall never recover such a shock as this; I who have laughed, who have jested
with you!  I who have dared to treat you
on a footing of equality!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Say
nothing about it, old comrade,&quot; replied the bishop, who perceived how
strained the cord was and how dangerous it would have been to break it;
&quot;say nothing about it.  Let us each
live in our own way; to you, my protection and my friendship; to me, your
obedience.  Having exactly fulfilled
these two requirements, let us live happily.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Baisemeaux
reflected; he perceived, at a glance, the consequence of this withdrawal of a
prisoner by means of a forged order; and, putting in the scale the guarantee
offered him by the official order of the general, did not consider it of any
value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
divined this.  &quot;My dear
Baisemeaux,&quot; said he, &quot;you are a simpleton.  Lose this habit of reflection when I give myself the trouble to
think for you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And at
another gesture he made, Baisemeaux bowed again.  &quot;How shall I set about it?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is the process for releasing a prisoner?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have the regulations.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
then, follow the regulations, my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
go with my major to the prisoner's room, and conduct him, if he is a personage
of importance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
this Marchiali is not an important personage,&quot; said Aramis carelessly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
don't know,&quot; answered the governor, as if he would have said, &quot;It is
for you to instruct me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
if you don't know it, I am right; so act towards Marchiali as you act towards
one of obscure station.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Good;
the regulations so provide.  They are to
the effect that the turnkey, or one of the lower officials, shall bring the
prisoner before the governor, in the office.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
'tis very wise, that; and then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
we return to the prisoner the valuables he wore at the time of his
imprisonment, his clothes and papers, if the minister's orders have not
otherwise dictated.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
was the minister's order as to this Marchiali?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nothing;
for the unhappy man arrived here without jewels, without papers, and almost
without clothes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;See
how simple, then, all is.  Indeed,
Baisemeaux, you make a mountain of everything. 
Remain here, and make them bring the prisoner to the governor's
house.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Baisemeaux
obeyed.  He summoned his lieutenant, and
gave him an order, which the latter passed on, without disturbing himself about
it, to the next whom it concerned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Half an
hour afterwards they heard a gate shut in the court; it was the door to the
dungeon, which had just rendered up its prey to the free air.  Aramis blew out all the candles which
lighted the room but one, which he left burning behind the door.  This flickering glare prevented the sight
from resting steadily on any object.  It
multiplied tenfold the changing forms and shadows of the place, by its wavering
uncertainty.  Steps drew near.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Go
and meet your men,&quot; said Aramis to Baisemeaux.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
governor obeyed.  The sergeant and
turnkeys disappeared.  Baisemeaux
re-entered, followed by a prisoner. 
Aramis had placed himself in the shade; he saw without being seen.  Baisemeaux, in an agitated tone of voice,
made the young man acquainted with the order which set him at liberty.  The prisoner listened, without making a
single gesture or saying a word.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will swear ('tis the regulation that requires it),&quot; added the governor,
&quot;never to reveal anything that you have seen or heard in the
Bastile.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
prisoner perceived a crucifix; he stretched out his hands and swore with his
lips.  &quot;And now, monsieur, you are
free.  Whither do you intend
going?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
prisoner turned his head, as if looking behind him for some protection, on
which he ought to rely.  Then was it
that Aramis came out of the shade: &quot;I am here,&quot; he said, &quot;to
render the gentleman whatever service he may please to ask.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
prisoner slightly reddened, and, without hesitation, passed his arm through
that of Aramis.  &quot;God have you in
his holy keeping,&quot; he said, in a voice the firmness of which made the
governor tremble as much as the form of the blessing astonished him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis,
on shaking hands with Baisemeaux, said to him; &quot;Does my order trouble
you?  Do you fear their finding it here,
should they come to search?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
desire to keep it, monseigneur,&quot; said Baisemeaux.  &quot;If they found it here, it would be a
certain indication I should be lost, and in that case you would be a powerful
and a last auxiliary for me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Being
your accomplice, you mean?&quot; answered Aramis, shrugging his shoulders.  &quot;Adieu, Baisemeaux,&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
horses were in waiting, making each rusty spring reverberate the carriage again
with their impatience.  Baisemeaux
accompanied the bishop to the bottom of the steps.  Aramis caused his companion to mount before him, then followed,
and without giving the driver any further order, &quot;Go on,&quot; said
he.  The carriage rattled over the
pavement of the courtyard.  An officer
with a torch went before the horses, and gave orders at every post to let them
pass.  During the time taken in opening
all the barriers, Aramis barely breathed, and you might have heard his
&quot;sealed heart knock against his ribs.&quot;  The prisoner, buried in a corner of the carriage, made no more
sign of life than his companion.  At
length, a jolt more sever than the others announced to them that they had
cleared the last watercourse.  Behind
the carriage closed the last gate, that in the Rue St. Antoine.  No more walls either on the right or the
left; heaven everywhere, liberty everywhere, and life everywhere.  The horses, kept in check by a vigorous
hand, went quietly as far as the middle of the faubourg.  There they began to trot.  Little by little, whether they were warming
to their work, or whether they were urged, they gained in swiftness, and once
past Bercy, the carriage seemed to fly, so great was the ardor of the
coursers.  The horses galloped thus as
far as Villeneuve St. George's, where relays were waiting.  Then four instead of two whirled the
carriage away in the direction of Melun, and pulled up for a moment in the
middle of the forest of Senart.  No
doubt the order had been given the postilion beforehand, for Aramis had no
occasion even to make a sign.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is the matter?&quot; asked the prisoner, as if waking from a long dream.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
matter is, monseigneur,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;that before going further, it
is necessary your royal highness and I should converse.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will await an opportunity, monsieur,&quot; answered the young prince.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
could not have a better, monseigneur. 
We are in the middle of a forest, and no one can hear us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
postilion?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
postilion of this relay is deaf and dumb, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am at your service, M. d'Herblay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is
it your pleasure to remain in the carriage?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
we are comfortably seated, and I like this carriage, for it has restored me to
liberty.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Wait,
monseigneur; there is yet a precaution to be taken.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
are here on the highway; cavaliers or carriages traveling like ourselves might
pass, and seeing us stopping, deem us in some difficulty.  Let us avoid offers of assistance, which
would embarrass us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Give
the postilion orders to conceal the carriage in one of the side avenues.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Tis
exactly what I wished to do, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
made a sign to the deaf and dumb driver of the carriage, whom he touched on the
arm.  The latter dismounted, took the
leaders by the bridle, and led them over the velvet sward and the mossy grass
of a winding alley, at the bottom of which, on this moonless night, the deep
shades formed a curtain blacker than ink. 
This done, the man lay down on a slope near his horses, who, on either
side, kept nibbling the young oak shoots.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am listening,&quot; said the young prince to Aramis; &quot;but what are you
doing there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am disarming myself of my pistols, of which we have no further need,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>The Tempter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>&quot;M</span>y
prince,&quot; said Aramis, turning in the carriage towards his companion,
&quot;weak creature as I am, so unpretending in genius, so low in the scale of
intelligent beings, it has never yet happened to me to converse with a man
without penetrating his thoughts through that living mask which has been thrown
over our mind, in order to retain its expression.  But to-night, in this darkness, in the reserve which you
maintain, I can read nothing on your features, and something tells me that I
shall have great difficulty in wresting from you a sincere declaration.  I beseech you, then, not for love of me, for
subjects should never weigh as anything in the balance which princes hold, but
for love of yourself, to retain every syllable, every inflexion which, under
the present most grave circumstances, will all have a sense and value as
important as any every uttered in the world.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
listen,&quot; replied the young prince, &quot;decidedly, without either eagerly
seeking or fearing anything you are about to say to me.&quot;  And he buried himself still deeper in the
thick cushions of the carriage, trying to deprive his companion not only of the
sight of him, but even of the very idea of his presence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Black
was the darkness which fell wide and dense from the summits of the intertwining
trees.  The carriage, covered in by this
prodigious roof, would not have received a particle of light, not even if a ray
could have struggled through the wreaths of mist that were already rising in
the avenue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur,&quot;
resumed Aramis, &quot;you know the history of the government which to-day
controls France.  The king issued from
an infancy imprisoned like yours, obscure as yours, and confined as yours;
only, instead of ending, like yourself, this slavery in a prison, this
obscurity in solitude, these straightened circumstances in concealment, he was
fain to bear all these miseries, humiliations, and distresses, in full
daylight, under the pitiless sun of royalty; on an elevation flooded with
light, where every stain appears a blemish, every glory a stain.  The king has suffered; it rankles in his
mind; and he will avenge himself.  He
will be a bad king.  I say not that he
will pour out his people's blood, like Louis XI., or Charles IX.; for he has no
mortal injuries to avenge; but he will devour the means and substance of his
people; for he has himself undergone wrongs in his own interest and money.  In the first place, then, I acquit my
conscience, when I consider openly the merits and the faults of this great
prince; and if I condemn him, my conscience absolves me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
paused.  It was not to listen if the
silence of the forest remained undisturbed, but it was to gather up his
thoughts from the very bottom of his soul - to leave the thoughts he had
uttered sufficient time to eat deeply into the mind of his companion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;All
that Heaven does, Heaven does well,&quot; continued the bishop of Vannes;
&quot;and I am so persuaded of it that I have long been thankful to have been
chosen depositary of the secret which I have aided you to discover.  To a just Providence was necessary an
instrument, at once penetrating, persevering, and convinced, to accomplish a great
work.  I am this instrument.  I possess penetration, perseverance,
conviction; I govern a mysterious people, who has taken for its motto, the
motto of God, '<i>Patiens quia ternus</i>.'&quot;  The prince moved.  &quot;I divine, monseigneur, why you are raising your head, and
are surprised at the people I have under my command.  You did not know you were dealing with a king - oh! monseigneur,
king of a people very humble, much disinherited; humble because they have no
force save when creeping; disinherited, because never, almost never in this
world, do my people reap the harvest they sow, nor eat the fruit they
cultivate.  They labor for an abstract
idea; they heap together all the atoms of their power, to from a single man;
and round this man, with the sweat of their labor, they create a misty halo,
which his genius shall, in turn, render a glory gilded with the rays of all the
crowns in Christendom.  Such is the man
you have beside you, monseigneur.  It is
to tell you that he has drawn you from the abyss for a great purpose, to raise
you above the powers of the earth - above himself.&quot; <b><sup>1</sup></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
prince lightly touched Aramis's arm. 
&quot;You speak to me,&quot; he said, &quot;of that religious order
whose chief you are.  For me, the result
of your words is, that the day you desire to hurl down the man you shall have
raised, the event will be accomplished; and that you will keep under your hand
your creation of yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Undeceive
yourself, monseigneur,&quot; replied the bishop.  &quot;I should not take the trouble to play this terrible game
with your royal highness, if I had not a double interest in gaining it.  The day you are elevated, you are elevated
forever; you will overturn the footstool, as you rise, and will send it rolling
so far, that not even the sight of it will ever again recall to you its right
to simple gratitude.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
monsieur!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
movement, monseigneur, arises from an excellent disposition.  I thank you.  Be well assured, I aspire to more than gratitude!  I am convinced that, when arrived at the
summit, you will judge me still more worthy to be your friend; and then,
monseigneur, we two will do such great deeds, that ages hereafter shall long
speak of them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Tell
me plainly, monsieur - tell me without disguise - what I am to-day, and what
you aim at my being to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are the son of King Louis XIII., brother of Louis XIV., natural and legitimate
heir to the throne of France.  In
keeping you near him, as Monsieur has been kept - Monsieur, your younger
brother - the king reserved to himself the right of being legitimate
sovereign.  The doctors only could
dispute his legitimacy.  But the doctors
always prefer the king who is to the king who is not.  Providence has willed that you should be persecuted; this
persecution to-day consecrates you king of France.  You had, then, a right to reign, seeing that it is disputed; you
had a right to be proclaimed seeing that you have been concealed; and you
possess royal blood, since no one has dared to shed yours, as that of your
servants has been shed.  Now see, then,
what this Providence, which you have so often accused of having in every way
thwarted you, has done for you.  It has
given you the features, figure, age, and voice of your brother; and the very
causes of your persecution are about to become those of your triumphant restoration.  To-morrow, after to-morrow - from the very
first, regal phantom, living shade of Louis XIV., you will sit upon his throne,
whence the will of Heaven, confided in execution to the arm of man, will have
hurled him, without hope of return.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
understand,&quot; said the prince, &quot;my brother's blood will not be shed,
then.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will be sole arbiter of his fate.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
secret of which they made an evil use against me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will employ it against him.  What did he
do to conceal it?  He concealed you.  Living image of himself, you will defeat the
conspiracy of Mazarin and Anne of Austria. 
You, my prince, will have the same interest in concealing him, who will,
as a prisoner, resemble you, as you will resemble him as a king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
fall back on what I was saying to you. 
Who will guard him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
guarded <i>you?</i>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
know this secret - you have made use of it with regard to myself.  Who else knows it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
queen-mother and Madame de Chevreuse.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
will they do?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nothing,
if you choose.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
is that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
can they recognize you, if you act in such a manner that no one can recognize
you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Tis
true; but there are grave difficulties.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;State
them, prince.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
brother is married; I cannot take my brother's wife.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will cause Spain to consent to a divorce; it is in the interest of your new
policy; it is human morality.  All that
is really noble and really useful in this world will find its account
therein.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
imprisoned king will speak.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
whom do you think he will speak - to the walls?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
mean, by walls, the men in whom you put confidence.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
need be, yes.  And besides, your royal
highness - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Besides?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
was going to say, that the designs of Providence do not stop on such a fair
road.  Every scheme of this caliber is
completed by its results, like a geometrical calculation.  The king, in prison, will not be for you the
cause of embarrassment that you have been for the king enthroned.  His soul is naturally proud and impatient;
it is, moreover, disarmed and enfeebled, by being accustomed to honors, and by
the license of supreme power.  The same
Providence which has willed that the concluding step in the geometrical
calculation I have had the honor of describing to your royal highness should be
your ascension to the throne, and the destruction of him who is hurtful to you,
has also determined that the conquered one shall soon end both his own and your
sufferings.  Therefore, his soul and
body have been adapted for but a brief agony. 
Put into prison as a private individual, left alone with your doubts,
deprived of everything, you have exhibited the most sublime, enduring principle
of life in withstanding all this.  But
your brother, a captive, forgotten, and in bonds, will not long endure the
calamity; and Heaven will resume his soul at the appointed time - that is to
say, <i>soon</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At this
point in Aramis's gloomy analysis, a bird of night uttered from the depths of
the forest that prolonged and plaintive cry which makes every creature tremble.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will exile the deposed king,&quot; said Philippe, shuddering; &quot;'twill be
more human.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
king's good pleasure will decide the point,&quot; said Aramis.  &quot;But has the problem been well
put?  Have I brought out of the solution
according to the wishes or the foresight of your royal highness?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monsieur, yes; you have forgotten nothing - except, indeed, two things.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
first?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
us speak of it at once, with the same frankness we have already conversed
in.  Let us speak of the causes which
may bring about the ruin of all the hopes we have conceived.  Let us speak of the risks we are
running.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;They
would be immense, infinite, terrific, insurmountable, if, as I have said, all
things did not concur to render them of absolutely no account.  There is no danger either for you or for me,
if the constancy and intrepidity of your royal highness are equal to that
perfection of resemblance to your brother which nature has bestowed upon
you.  I repeat it, there are no dangers,
only obstacles; a word, indeed, which I find in all languages, but have always
ill-understood, and, were I king, would have obliterated as useless and
absurd.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
indeed, monsieur; there is a very serious obstacle, an insurmountable danger,
which you are forgetting.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
is conscience, which cries aloud; remorse, that never dies.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;True,
true,&quot; said the bishop; &quot;there is a weakness of heart of which you
remind me.  You are right, too, for
that, indeed, is an immense obstacle. 
The horse afraid of the ditch, leaps into the middle of it, and is
killed!  The man who trembling crosses
his sword with that of another leaves loopholes whereby his enemy has him in
his power.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Have
you a brother?&quot; said the young man to Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am alone in the world,&quot; said the latter, with a hard, dry voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,
surely, there is some one in the world whom you love?&quot; added Philippe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No
one! - Yes, I love you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
young man sank into so profound a silence, that the mere sound of his
respiration seemed like a roaring tumult for Aramis.  &quot;Monseigneur,&quot; he resumed, &quot;I have not said all I
had to say to your royal highness; I have not offered you all the salutary
counsels and useful resources which I have at my disposal.  It is useless to flash bright visions before
the eyes of one who seeks and loves darkness: useless, too, is it to let the
magnificence of the cannon's roar make itself heard in the ears of one who
loves repose and the quiet of the country. 
Monseigneur, I have your happiness spread out before me in my thoughts;
listen to my words; precious they indeed are, in their import and their sense,
for you who look with such tender regard upon the bright heavens, the verdant
meadows, the pure air.  I know a country
instinct with delights of every kind, an unknown paradise, a secluded corner of
the world - where alone, unfettered and unknown, in the thick covert of the
woods, amidst flowers, and streams of rippling water, you will forget all the
misery that human folly has so recently allotted you.  Oh! listen to me, my prince. 
I do not jest.  I have a heart,
and mind, and soul, and can read your own, - aye, even to its depths.  I will not take you unready for your task,
in order to cast you into the crucible of my own desires, of my caprice, or my
ambition.  Let it be all or
nothing.  You are chilled and galled,
sick at heart, overcome by excess of the emotions which but one hour's liberty
has produced in you.  For me, that is a
certain and unmistakable sign that you do not wish to continue at liberty.  Would you prefer a more humble life, a life
more suited to your strength?  Heaven is
my witness, that I wish your happiness to be the result of the trial to which I
have exposed you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Speak,
speak,&quot; said the prince, with a vivacity which did not escape Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
know,&quot; resumed the prelate, &quot;in the Bas-Poitou, a canton, of which no
one in France suspects the existence. 
Twenty leagues of country is immense, is it not?  Twenty leagues, monseigneur, all covered
with water and herbage, and reeds of the most luxuriant nature; the whole
studded with islands covered with woods of the densest foliage.  These large marshes, covered with reeds as
with a thick mantle, sleep silently and calmly beneath the sun's soft and
genial rays.  A few fishermen with their
families indolently pass their lives away there, with their great living-rafts
of poplar and alder, the flooring formed of reeds, and the roof woven out of
thick rushes.  These barks, these
floating-houses, are wafted to and fro by the changing winds.  Whenever they touch a bank, it is but by
chance; and so gently, too, that the sleeping fisherman is not awakened by the
shock.  Should he wish to land, it is
merely because he has seen a large flight of landrails or plovers, of wild
ducks, teal, widgeon, or woodchucks, which fall an easy pray to net or
gun.  Silver shad, eels, greedy pike,
red and gray mullet, swim in shoals into his nets; he has but to choose the
finest and largest, and return the others to the waters.  Never yet has the food of the stranger, be
he soldier or simple citizen, never has any one, indeed, penetrated into that
district.  The sun's rays there are soft
and tempered: in plots of solid earth, whose soil is swart and fertile, grows
the vine, nourishing with generous juice its purple, white, and golden
grapes.  Once a week, a boat is sent to
deliver the bread which has been baked at an oven - the common property of
all.  There - like the seigneurs of
early days - powerful in virtue of your dogs, your fishing-lines, your guns,
and your beautiful reed-built house, would you live, rich in the produce of the
chase, in plentitude of absolute secrecy. 
There would years of your life roll away, at the end of which, no longer
recognizable, for you would have been perfectly transformed, you would have
succeeded in acquiring a destiny accorded to you by Heaven.  There are a thousand pistoles in this bag,
monseigneur - more, far more, than sufficient to purchase the whole marsh of
which I have spoken; more than enough to live there as many years as you have
days to live; more than enough to constitute you the richest, the freest, and
the happiest man in the country.  Accept
it, as I offer it you - sincerely, cheerfully. 
Forthwith, without a moment's pause, I will unharness two of my horses,
which are attached to the carriage yonder, and they, accompanied by my servant
- my deaf and dumb attendant - shall conduct you - traveling throughout the
night, sleeping during the day - to the locality I have described; and I shall,
at least, have the satisfaction of knowing that I have rendered to my prince
the major service he himself preferred. 
I shall have made one human being happy; and Heaven for that will hold
me in better account than if I had made one man powerful; the former task is
far more difficult.  And now,
monseigneur, your answer to this proposition? 
Here is the money.  Nay, do not
hesitate.  At Poitou, you can risk
nothing, except the chance of catching the fevers prevalent there; and even of
them, the so-called wizards of the country will cure you, for the sake of your
pistoles.  If you play the other game,
you run the chance of being assassinated on a throne, strangled in a
prison-cell.  Upon my soul, I assure
you, now I begin to compare them together, I myself should hesitate which lot I
should accept.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
replied the young prince, &quot;before I determine, let me alight from this
carriage, walk on the ground, and consult that still voice within me, which
Heaven bids us all to hearken to.  Ten
minutes is all I ask, and then you shall have your answer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;As
you please, monseigneur,&quot; said Aramis, bending before him with respect, so
solemn and august in tone and address had sounded these strange words.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Chapter X:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Crown and Tiara.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>A</span>ramis
was the first to descend from the carriage; he held the door open for the young
man.  He saw him place his foot on the
mossy ground with a trembling of the whole body, and walk round the carriage
with an unsteady and almost tottering step. 
It seemed as if the poor prisoner was unaccustomed to walk on God's earth.  It was the 15th of August, about eleven
o'clock at night; thick clouds, portending a tempest, overspread the heavens,
and shrouded every light and prospect underneath their heavy folds.  The extremities of the avenues were
imperceptibly detached from the copse, by a lighter shadow of opaque gray,
which, upon closer examination, became visible in the midst of the
obscurity.  But the fragrance which
ascended from the grass, fresher and more penetrating than that which exhaled
from the trees around him; the warm and balmy air which enveloped him for the
first time for many years past; the ineffable enjoyment of liberty in an open
country, spoke to the prince in so seductive a language, that notwithstanding
the preternatural caution, we would almost say dissimulation of his character,
of which we have tried to give an idea, he could not restrain his emotion, and
breathed a sigh of ecstasy.  Then, by
degrees, he raised his aching head and inhaled the softly scented air, as it
was wafted in gentle gusts to his uplifted face.  Crossing his arms on his chest, as if to control this new
sensation of delight, he drank in delicious draughts of that mysterious air
which interpenetrates at night the loftiest forests.  The sky he was contemplating, the murmuring waters, the universal
freshness - was not all this reality? 
Was not Aramis a madman to suppose that he had aught else to dream of in
this world?  Those exciting pictures of
country life, so free from fears and troubles, the ocean of happy days that
glitters incessantly before all young imaginations, are real allurements
wherewith to fascinate a poor, unhappy prisoner, worn out by prison cares,
emaciated by the stifling air of the Bastile. 
It was the picture, it will be remembered, drawn by Aramis, when he
offered the thousand pistoles he had with him in the carriage to the prince,
and the enchanted Eden which the deserts of Bas-Poitou hid from the eyes of the
world.  Such were the reflections of
Aramis as he watched, with an anxiety impossible to describe, the silent
progress of the emotions of Philippe, whom he perceived gradually becoming more
and more absorbed in his meditations. 
The young prince was offering up an inward prayer to Heaven, to be
divinely guided in this trying moment, upon which his life or death
depended.  It was an anxious time for
the bishop of Vannes, who had never before been so perplexed.  His iron will, accustomed to overcome all
obstacles, never finding itself inferior or vanquished on any occasion, to be
foiled in so vast a project from not having foreseen the influence which a view
of nature in all its luxuriance would have on the human mind!  Aramis, overwhelmed by anxiety, contemplated
with emotion the painful struggle that was taking place in Philippe's mind.  This suspense lasted the whole ten minutes
which the young man had requested. 
During this space of time, which appeared an eternity, Philippe
continued gazing with an imploring and sorrowful look towards the heavens;
Aramis did not remove the piercing glance he had fixed on Philippe.  Suddenly the young man bowed his head.  His thought returned to the earth, his looks
perceptibly hardened, his brow contracted, his mouth assuming an expression of
undaunted courage; again his looks became fixed, but this time they wore a
worldly expression, hardened by covetousness, pride, and strong desire.  Aramis's look immediately became as soft as
it had before been gloomy.  Philippe,
seizing his hand in a quick, agitated manner, exclaimed:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Lead
me to where the crown of France is to be found.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is
this your decision, monseigneur?&quot; asked Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Irrevocably
so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Philippe
did not even deign to reply.  He gazed
earnestly at the bishop, as if to ask him if it were possible for a man to
waver after having once made up his mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Such
looks are flashes of the hidden fire that betrays men's character,&quot; said
Aramis, bowing over Philippe's hand; &quot;you will be great, monseigneur, I
will answer for that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
us resume our conversation.  I wished to
discuss two points with you; in the first place the dangers, or the obstacles we
may meet with.  That point is
decided.  The other is the conditions
you intend imposing on me.  It is your
turn to speak, M. d'Herblay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
lang=FR>&quot;The conditions, monseigneur?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=FR>                </span>&quot;Doubtless.  You will not allow so mere a trifle to stop
me, and you will not do me the injustice to suppose that I think you have no
interest in this affair.  Therefore,
without subterfuge or hesitation, tell me the truth - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will do so, monseigneur.  Once a king -
&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;When
will that be?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To-morrow
evening - I mean in the night.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Explain
yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;When
I shall have asked your highness a question.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
sent to your highness a man in my confidence with instructions to deliver some
closely written notes, carefully drawn up, which will thoroughly acquaint your
highness with the different persons who compose and will compose your
court.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
perused those notes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Attentively?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
know them by heart.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
understand them?  Pardon me, but I may
venture to ask that question of a poor, abandoned captive of the Bastile?  In a week's time it will not be requisite to
further question a mind like yours.  You
will then be in full possession of liberty and power.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Interrogate
me, then, and I will be a scholar representing his lesson to his master.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
will begin with your family, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
mother, Anne of Austria! all her sorrows, her painful malady.  Oh! 
I know her - I know her.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
second brother?&quot; asked Aramis, bowing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
these notes,&quot; replied the prince, &quot;you have added portraits so
faithfully painted, that I am able to recognize the persons whose characters,
manners, and history you have so carefully portrayed.  Monsieur, my brother, is a fine, dark young man, with a pale
face; he does not love his wife, Henrietta, whom I, Louis XIV., loved a little,
and still flirt with, even although she made me weep on the day she wished to
dismiss Mademoiselle de la Vallière from her service in disgrace.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will have to be careful with regard to the watchfulness of the latter,&quot;
said Aramis; &quot;she is sincerely attached to the actual king.  The eyes of a woman who loves are not easily
deceived.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;She
is fair, has blue eyes, whose affectionate gaze reveals her identity.  She halts slightly in her gait; she writes a
letter every day, to which I have to send an answer by M. de
Saint-Aignan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you know the latter?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;As
if I saw him, and I know the last verses he composed for me, as well as those I
composed in answer to his.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
good.  Do you know your ministers?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Colbert,
an ugly, dark-browed man, but intelligent enough, his hair covering his
forehead, a large, heavy, full head; the mortal enemy of M. Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;As
for the latter, we need not disturb ourselves about him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No;
because necessarily you will not require me to exile him, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis,
struck with admiration at the remark, said, &quot;You will become very great,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
see,&quot; added the prince, &quot;that I know my lesson by heart, and with
Heaven's assistance, and yours afterwards, I shall seldom go wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have still an awkward pair of eyes to deal with, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
the captain of the musketeers, M. d'Artagnan, your friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
I can well say 'my friend.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
who escorted La Vallière to Le Chaillot; he who delivered up Monk, cooped in an
iron box, to Charles II.; he who so faithfully served my mother; he to whom the
crown of France owes so much that it owes everything.  Do you intend to ask me to exile him also?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Never,
sire.  D'Artagnan is a man to whom, at a
certain given time, I will undertake to reveal everything; but be on your guard
with him, for if he discovers our plot before it is revealed to him, you or I
will certainly be killed or taken.  He
is a bold and enterprising man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will think it over.  Now tell me about
M. Fouquet; what do you wish to be done with regard to him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;One
moment more, I entreat you, monseigneur; and forgive me, if I seem to fail in
respect to questioning you further.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is your duty to do so, nay, more than that, your right.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Before
we pass to M. Fouquet, I should very much regret forgetting another friend of
mine.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
du Vallon, the Hercules of France, you mean; oh! as far as he is concerned, his
interests are more than safe.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No;
it is not he whom I intended to refer to.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
lang=FR>&quot;The Comte de la Fère, then?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=FR>                </span>&quot;And his son, the
son of all four of us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
poor boy who is dying of love for La Vallière, whom my brother so disloyally
bereft him of?  Be easy on that
score.  I shall know how to rehabilitate
his happiness.  Tell me only one thing,
Monsieur d'Herblay; do men, when they love, forget the treachery that has been
shown them?  Can a man ever forgive the
woman who has betrayed him?  Is that a
French custom, or is it one of the laws of the human heart?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
man who loves deeply, as deeply as Raoul loves Mademoiselle de la Vallière,
finishes by forgetting the fault or crime of the woman he loves; but I do not
yet know whether Raoul will be able to forget.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will see after that.  Have you anything
further to say about your friend?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No;
that is all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
then, now for M. Fouquet.  What do you
wish me to do for him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
keep him on as surintendant, in the capacity in which he has hitherto acted, I
entreat you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Be
it so; but he is the first minister at present.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Not
quite so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
king, ignorant and embarrassed as I shall be, will, as a matter of course,
require a first minister of state.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
majesty will require a friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have only one, and that is yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will have many others by and by, but none so devoted, none so zealous for your
glory.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
shall be my first minister of state.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Not
immediately, monseigneur, for that would give rise to too much suspicion and
astonishment.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
de Richelieu, the first minister of my grandmother, Marie de Medici, was simply
bishop of Luçon, as you are bishop of Vannes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
perceive that your royal highness has studied my notes to great advantage; your
amazing perspicacity overpowers me with delight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am perfectly aware that M. de Richelieu, by means of the queen's protection,
soon became cardinal.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
would be better,&quot; said Aramis, bowing, &quot;that I should not be
appointed first minister until your royal highness has procured my nomination
as cardinal.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
shall be nominated before two months are past, Monsieur d'Herblay.  But that is a matter of very trifling
moment; you would not offend me if you were to ask more than that, and you
would cause me serious regret if you were to limit yourself to that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
that case, I have something still further to hope for, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Speak!
speak!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
Fouquet will not keep long at the head of affairs, he will soon get old.  He is fond of pleasure, consistently, I
mean, with all his labors, thanks to the youthfulness he still retains; but
this protracted youth will disappear at the approach of the first serious
annoyance, or at the first illness he may experience.  We will spare him the annoyance, because he is an agreeable and
noble-hearted man; but we cannot save him from ill-health.  So it is determined.  When you shall have paid all M. Fouquet's
debts, and restored the finances to a sound condition, M. Fouquet will be able
to remain the sovereign ruler in his little court of poets and painters, - we
shall have made him rich.  When that has
been done, and I have become your royal highness's prime minister, I shall be
able to think of my own interests and yours.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
young man looked at his interrogator.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
de Richelieu, of whom we were speaking just now, was very much to blame in the
fixed idea he had of governing France alone, unaided.  He allowed two kings, King Louis XIII. and himself, to be seated
on the self-same throne, whilst he might have installed them more conveniently
upon two separate and distinct thrones.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Upon
two thrones?&quot; said the young man, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
fact,&quot; pursued Aramis, quietly, &quot;a cardinal, prime minister of
France, assisted by the favor and by the countenance of his Most Christian
Majesty the King of France, a cardinal to whom the king his master lends the
treasures of the state, his army, his counsel, such a man would be acting with
twofold injustice in applying these mighty resources to France alone.  Besides,&quot; added Aramis, &quot;you will
not be a king such as your father was, delicate in health, slow in judgment,
whom all things wearied; you will be a king governing by your brain and by your
sword; you will have in the government of the state no more than you will be
able to manage unaided; I should only interfere with you.  Besides, our friendship ought never to be, I
do not say impaired, but in any degree affected, by a secret thought.  I shall have given you the throne of France,
you will confer on me the throne of St. Peter. 
Whenever your loyal, firm, and mailed hand should joined in ties of
intimate association the hand of a pope such as I shall be, neither Charles V.,
who owned two-thirds of the habitable globe, nor Charlemagne, who possessed it
entirely, will be able to reach to half your stature.  I have no alliances, I have no predilections; I will not throw
you into persecutions of heretics, nor will I cast you into the troubled waters
of family dissension; I will simply say to you: The whole universe is our own;
for me the minds of men, for you their bodies. 
And as I shall be the first to die, you will have my inheritance.  What do you say of my plan,
monseigneur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
say that you render me happy and proud, for no other reason than that of having
comprehended you thoroughly.  Monsieur
d'Herblay, you shall be cardinal, and when cardinal, my prime minister; and
then you will point out to me the necessary steps to be taken to secure your
election as pope, and I will take them. 
You can ask what guarantees from me you please.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is useless.  Never shall I act except in
such a manner that you will be the gainer; I shall never ascend the ladder of
fortune, fame, or position, until I have first seen you placed upon the round
of the ladder immediately above me; I shall always hold myself sufficiently
aloof from you to escape incurring your jealousy, sufficiently near to sustain
your personal advantage and to watch over your friendship.  All the contracts in the world are easily
violated because the interests included in them incline more to one side than
to another.  With us, however, this will
never be the case; I have no need of any guarantees.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
so - my dear brother - will disappear?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Simply.  We will remove him from his bed by means of
a plank which yields to the pressure of the finger.  Having retired to rest a crowned sovereign, he will awake a captive.  Alone you will rule from that moment, and
you will have no interest dearer and better than that of keeping me near
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
believe it.  There is my hand on it,
Monsieur d'Herblay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Allow
me to kneel before you, sire, most respectfully.  We will embrace each other on the day we shall have upon our
temples, you the crown, I the tiara.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Still
embrace me this very day also, and be, for and towards me, more than great,
more than skillful, more than sublime in genius; be kind and indulgent - be my
father!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
was almost overcome as he listened to his voice; he fancied he detected in his
own heart an emotion hitherto unknown; but this impression was speedily
removed.  &quot;His father!&quot; he
thought; &quot;yes, his Holy Father.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
they resumed their places in the carriage, which sped rapidly along the road
leading to Vaux-le-Vicomte.</p>

20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he château
of Vaux-le-Vicomte, situated about a league from Melun, had been built by
Fouquet in 1655, at a time when there was a scarcity of money in France;
Mazarin had taken all that there was, and Fouquet expended the remainder.  However, as certain men have fertile, false,
and useful vices, Fouquet, in scattering broadcast millions of money in the
construction of this palace, had found a means of gathering, as the result of
his generous profusion, three illustrious men together: Levau, the architect of
the building; Lenôtre, the designer of the gardens; and Lebrun, the decorator
of the apartments.  If the Château de
Vaux possessed a single fault with which it could be reproached, it was its
grand, pretentious character.  It is
even at the present day proverbial to calculate the number of acres of roofing,
the restoration of which would, in our age, be the ruin of fortunes cramped and
narrowed as the epoch itself. 
Vaux-le-Vicomte, when its magnificent gates, supported by caryatides,
have been passed through, has the principal front of the main building opening
upon a vast, so-called, court of honor, inclosed by deep ditches, bordered by a
magnificent stone balustrade.  Nothing
could be more noble in appearance than the central forecourt raised upon the
flight of steps, like a king upon his throne, having around it four pavilions
at the angles, the immense Ionic columns of which rose majestically to the
whole height of the building.  The
friezes ornamented with arabesques, and the pediments which crowned the
pilasters, conferred richness and grace on every part of the building, while
the domes which surmounted the whole added proportion and majesty.  This mansion, built by a subject, bore a far
greater resemblance to those royal residences which Wolsey fancied he was
called upon to construct, in order to present them to his master form the fear
of rendering him jealous.  But if
magnificence and splendor were displayed in any one particular part of this
palace more than another, - if anything could be preferred to the wonderful
arrangement of the interior, to the sumptuousness of the gilding, and to the
profusion of the paintings and statues, it would be the park and gardens of
Vaux.  The <i>jets d'eau</i>, which were regarded as wonderful in 1653, are still so,
even at the present time; the cascades awakened the admiration of kings and
princes; and as for the famous grotto, the theme of so many poetical effusions,
the residence of that illustrious nymph of Vaux, whom Pélisson made converse
with La Fontaine, we must be spared the description of all its beauties.  We will do as Despréaux did, - we will enter
the park, the trees of which are of eight years' growth only - that is to say,
in their present position - and whose summits even yet, as they proudly tower
aloft, blushingly unfold their leaves to the earliest rays of the rising
sun.  Lenôtre had hastened the pleasure
of the Mæcenas of his period; all the nursery-grounds had furnished trees whose
growth had been accelerated by careful culture and the richest plant-food.  Every tree in the neighborhood which
presented a fair appearance of beauty or stature had been taken up by its roots
and transplanted to the park.  Fouquet
could well afford to purchase trees to ornament his park, since he had bought
up three villages and their appurtenances (to use a legal word) to increase its
extent.  M. de Scudéry said of this
palace, that, for the purpose of keeping the grounds and gardens well watered,
M. Fouquet had divided a river into a thousand fountains, and gathered the
waters of a thousand fountains into torrents. 
This same Monsieur de Scudéry said a great many other things in his
&quot;Clélie,&quot; about this palace of Valterre, the charms of which he
describes most minutely.  We should be
far wiser to send our curious readers to Vaux to judge for themselves, than to
refer them to &quot;Clélie;&quot; and yet there are as many leagues from Paris
to Vaux, as there are volumes of the &quot;Clélie.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This
magnificent palace had been got ready for the reception of the greatest
reigning sovereign of the time.  M.
Fouquet's friends had transported thither, some their actors and their dresses,
others their troops of sculptors and artists; not forgetting others with their
ready-mended pens, - floods of impromptus were contemplated.  The cascades, somewhat rebellious nymphs
though they were, poured forth their waters brighter and clearer than crystal:
they scattered over the bronze triton and nereids their waves of foam, which
glistened like fire in the rays of the sun. 
An army of servants were hurrying to and fro in squadrons in the
courtyard and corridors; while Fouquet, who had only that morning arrived,
walked all through the palace with a calm, observant glance, in order to give
his last orders, after his intendants had inspected everything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                It was,
as we have said, the 15th of August. 
The sun poured down its burning rays upon the heathen deities of marble
and bronze: it raised the temperature of the water in the conch shells, and
ripened, on the walls, those magnificent peaches, of which the king, fifty
years later, spoke so regretfully, when, at Marly, on an occasion of a scarcity
of the finer sorts of peaches being complained of, in the beautiful gardens
there - gardens which had cost France double the amount that had been expended
on Vaux - the <i>great king</i> observed to
some one: &quot;You are far too young to have eaten any of M. Fouquet's
peaches.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Oh,
fame!  Oh, blazon of renown!  Oh, glory of this earth!  That very man whose judgment was so sound
and accurate where merit was concerned - he who had swept into his coffers the
inheritance of Nicholas Fouquet, who had robbed him of Lenôtre and Lebrun, and
had sent him to rot for the remainder of his life in one of the state prisons -
merely remembered the peaches of that vanquished, crushed, forgotten
enemy!  It was to little purpose that
Fouquet had squandered thirty millions of francs in the fountains of his
gardens, in the crucibles of his sculptors, in the writing-desks of his
literary friends, in the portfolios of his painters; vainly had he fancied that
thereby he might be remembered.  A peach
- a blushing, rich-flavored fruit, nestling in the trellis work on the
garden-wall, hidden beneath its long, green leaves, - this little vegetable
production, that a dormouse would nibble up without a thought, was sufficient
to recall to the memory of this great monarch the mournful shade of the last
surintendant of France.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                With a
perfect reliance that Aramis had made arrangements fairly to distribute the
vast number of guests throughout the palace, and that he had not omitted to
attend to any of the internal regulations for their comfort, Fouquet devoted
his entire attention to the <i>ensemble</i>
alone.  In one direction Gourville
showed him the preparations which had been made for the fireworks; in another,
Molière led him over the theater; at last, after he had visited the chapel, the
<i>salons</i>, and the galleries, and was
again going downstairs, exhausted with fatigue, Fouquet saw Aramis on the
staircase.  The prelate beckoned to
him.  The surintendant joined his
friend, and, with him, paused before a large picture scarcely finished.  Applying himself, heart and soul, to his
work, the painter Lebrun, covered with perspiration, stained with paint, pale
from fatigue and the inspiration of genius, was putting the last finishing
touches with his rapid brush.  It was
the portrait of the king, whom they were expecting, dressed in the court suit
which Percerin had condescended to show beforehand to the bishop of
Vannes.  Fouquet placed himself before
this portrait, which seemed to live, as one might say, in the cool freshness of
its flesh, and in its warmth of color. 
He gazed upon it long and fixedly, estimated the prodigious labor that
had been bestowed upon it, and, not being able to find any recompense
sufficiently great for this Herculean effort, he passed his arm round the
painter's neck and embraced him.  The
surintendant, by this action, had utterly ruined a suit of clothes worth a
thousand pistoles, but he had satisfied, more than satisfied, Lebrun.  It was a happy moment for the artist; it was
an unhappy moment for M. Percerin, who was walking behind Fouquet, and was
engaged in admiring, in Lebrun's painting, the suit that he had made for his
majesty, a perfect <i>objet d'art</i>, as he
called it, which was not to be matched except in the wardrobe of the
surintendant.  His distress and his
exclamations were interrupted by a signal which had been given from the summit
of the mansion.  In the direction of
Melun, in the still empty, open plain, the sentinels of Vaux had just perceived
the advancing procession of the king and the queens.  His majesty was entering Melun with his long train of carriages
and cavaliers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
an hour - &quot; said Aramis to Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
an hour!&quot; replied the latter, sighing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
the people who ask one another what is the good of these royal <i>fêtes!</i>&quot; continued the bishop of
Vannes, laughing, with his false smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Alas!  I, too, who am not the people, ask myself
the same thing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will answer you in four and twenty hours, monseigneur.  Assume a cheerful countenance, for it should
be a day of true rejoicing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
believe me or not, as you like, D'Herblay,&quot; said the surintendant, with a swelling
heart, pointing at the <i>cortège</i> of
Louis, visible in the horizon, &quot;he certainly loves me but very little, and
I do not care much more for him; but I cannot tell you how it is, that since he
is approaching my house - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
what?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
since I know he is on his way here, as my guest, he is more sacred than ever
for me; he is my acknowledged sovereign, and as such is very dear to me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Dear?
yes,&quot; said Aramis, playing upon the word, as the Abbé Terray did, at a
later period, with Louis XV.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
not laugh, D'Herblay; I feel that, if he really seemed to wish it, I could love
that young man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
should not say that to me,&quot; returned Aramis, &quot;but rather to M.
Colbert.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
M. Colbert!&quot; exclaimed Fouquet. 
&quot;Why so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Because
he would allow you a pension out of the king's privy purse, as soon as he
becomes surintendant,&quot; said Aramis, preparing to leave as soon as he had
dealt this last blow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Where
are you going?&quot; returned Fouquet, with a gloomy look.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
my own apartment, in order to change my costume, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Whereabouts
are you lodging, D'Herblay?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
the blue room on the second story.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
room immediately over the king's room?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Precisely.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will be subject to very great restraint there. 
What an idea to condemn yourself to a room where you cannot stir or move
about!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;During
the night, monseigneur, I sleep or read in my bed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
your servants?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have but one attendant with me.  I find
my reader quite sufficient.  Adieu,
monseigneur; do not overfatigue yourself; keep yourself fresh for the arrival
of the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
shall see you by and by, I suppose, and shall see your friend Du Vallon
also?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
is lodging next to me, and is at this moment dressing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
Fouquet, bowing, with a smile, passed on like a commander-in-chief who pays the
different outposts a visit after the enemy has been signaled in sight. <b><sup>2</sup></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he
king had, in point of fact, entered Melun with the intention of merely passing
through the city.  The youthful monarch
was most eagerly anxious for amusements; only twice during the journey had he
been able to catch a glimpse of La Vallière, and, suspecting that his only
opportunity of speaking to her would be after nightfall, in the gardens, and
after the ceremonial of reception had been gone through, he had been very
desirous to arrive at Vaux as early as possible.  But he reckoned without his captain of the musketeers, and
without M. Colbert.  Like Calypso, who
could not be consoled at the departure of Ulysses, our Gascon could not console
himself for not having guessed why Aramis had asked Percerin to show him the
king's new costumes.  &quot;There is not
a doubt,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;that my friend the bishop of Vannes
had some motive in that;&quot; and then he began to rack his brains most
uselessly.  D'Artagnan, so intimately
acquainted with all the court intrigues, who knew the position of Fouquet
better than even Fouquet himself did, had conceived the strangest fancies and
suspicions at the announcement of the <i>fête</i>,
which would have ruined a wealthy man, and which became impossible, utter
madness even, for a man so poor as he was. 
And then, the presence of Aramis, who had returned from Belle-Isle, and
been nominated by Monsieur Fouquet inspector-general of all the arrangements;
his perseverance in mixing himself up with all the surintendant's affairs; his
visits to Baisemeaux; all this suspicious singularity of conduct had
excessively troubled and tormented D'Artagnan during the last two weeks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;With
men of Aramis's stamp,&quot; he said, &quot;one is never the stronger except
sword in hand.  So long as Aramis
continued a soldier, there was hope of getting the better of him; but since he
has covered his cuirass with a stole, we are lost.  But what can Aramis's object possibly be?&quot;  And D'Artagnan plunged again into deep
thought.  &quot;What does it matter to
me, after all,&quot; he continued, &quot;if his only object is to overthrow M.
Colbert?  And what else can he be
after?&quot;  And D'Artagnan rubbed his
forehead - that fertile land, whence the plowshare of his nails had turned up
so many and such admirable ideas in his time. 
He, at first, thought of talking the matter over with Colbert, but his
friendship for Aramis, the oath of earlier days, bound him too strictly.  He revolted at the bare idea of such a thing,
and, besides, he hated the financier too cordially.  Then, again, he wished to unburden his mind to the king; but yet
the king would not be able to understand the suspicions which had not even a
shadow of reality at their base.  He
resolved to address himself to Aramis, direct, the first time he met him.  &quot;I will get him,&quot; said the
musketeer, &quot;between a couple of candles, suddenly, and when he least
expects it, I will place my hand upon his heart, and he will tell me - What
will he tell me?  Yes, he will tell me
something, for <i>mordioux!</i> there is
something in it, I know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Somewhat
calmer, D'Artagnan made every preparation for the journey, and took the
greatest care that the military household of the king, as yet very
inconsiderable in numbers, should be well officered and well disciplined in its
meager and limited proportions.  The
result was that, through the captain's arrangements, the king, on arriving at
Melun, saw himself at the head of both the musketeers and Swiss guards, as well
as a picket of the French guards.  It
might almost have been called a small army. 
M. Colbert looked at the troops with great delight: he even wished they
had been a third more in number.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
why?&quot; said the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
order to show greater honor to M. Fouquet,&quot; replied Colbert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
order to ruin him the sooner,&quot; thought D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                When
this little army appeared before Melun, the chief magistrates came out to meet
the king, and to present him with the keys of the city, and invited him to
enter the Hôtel de Ville, in order to partake of the wine of honor.  The king, who expected to pass through the
city and to proceed to Vaux without delay, became quite red in the face from
vexation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
was fool enough to occasion this delay?&quot; muttered the king, between his
teeth, as the chief magistrate was in the middle of a long address.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Not
I, certainly,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, &quot;but I believe it was M.
Colbert.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Colbert,
having heard his name pronounced, said, &quot;What was M. d'Artagnan good
enough to say?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
was good enough to remark that it was you who stopped the king's progress, so
that he might taste the <i>vin de Brie</i>.  Was I right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Quite
so, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
that case, then, it was you whom the king called some name or other.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
name?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
hardly know; but wait a moment - idiot, I think it was - no, no, it was fool or
dolt.  Yes; his majesty said that the
man who had thought of the <i>vin de Melun</i>
was something of the sort.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan,
after this broadside, quietly caressed his mustache; M. Colbert's large head
seemed to become larger and larger than ever. 
D'Artagnan, seeing how ugly anger made him, did not stop half-way.  The orator still went on with his speech,
while the king's color was visibly increasing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Mordioux!</i>&quot; said the musketeer,
coolly, &quot;the king is going to have an attack of determination of blood to
the head.  Where the deuce did you get
hold of that idea, Monsieur Colbert? 
You have no luck.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
said the financier, drawing himself up, &quot;my zeal for the king's service
inspired me with the idea.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bah!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,
Melun is a city, an excellent city, which pays well, and which it would be
imprudent to displease.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There,
now!  I, who do not pretend to be a
financier, saw only one idea in your idea.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
was that, monsieur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
of causing a little annoyance to M. Fouquet, who is making himself quite giddy
on his donjons yonder, in waiting for us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This
was a home-stroke, hard enough in all conscience.  Colbert was completely thrown out of the saddle by it, and
retired, thoroughly discomfited. 
Fortunately, the speech was now at an end; the king drank the wine which
was presented to him, and then every one resumed the progress through the
city.  The king bit his lips in anger,
for the evening was closing in, and all hope of a walk with La Vallière was at
an end.  In order that the whole of the
king's household should enter Vaux, four hours at least were necessary, owing
to the different arrangements.  The
king, therefore, who was boiling with impatience, hurried forward as much as
possible, in order to reach it before nightfall.  But, at the moment he was setting off again, other and fresh
difficulties arose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is
not the king going to sleep at Melun?&quot; said Colbert, in a low tone of
voice, to D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                M.
Colbert must have been badly inspired that day, to address himself in that
manner to the chief of the musketeers; for the latter guessed that the king's
intention was very far from that of remaining where he was.  D'Artagnan would not allow him to enter Vaux
except he were well and strongly accompanied; and desired that his majesty
would not enter except with all the escort. 
On the other hand, he felt that these delays would irritate that
impatient monarch beyond measure.  In
what way could he possibly reconcile these difficulties?  D'Artagnan took up Colbert's remark, and
determined to repeated it to the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Sire,&quot;
he said, &quot;M. Colbert has been asking me if your majesty does not intend to
sleep at Melun.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Sleep
at Melun!  What for?&quot; exclaimed
Louis XIV.  &quot;Sleep at Melun!  Who, in Heaven's name, can have thought of
such a thing, when M. Fouquet is expecting us this evening?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
was simply,&quot; replied Colbert, quickly, &quot;the fear of causing your
majesty the least delay; for, according to established etiquette, you cannot
enter any place, with the exception of your own royal residences, until the
soldiers' quarters have been marked out by the quartermaster, and the garrison
properly distributed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
listened with the greatest attention, biting his mustache to conceal his
vexation; and the queens were not less interested.  They were fatigued, and would have preferred to go to rest
without proceeding any farther; more especially, in order to prevent the king
walking about in the evening with M. de Saint-Aignan and the ladies of the
court, for, if etiquette required the princesses to remain within their own
rooms, the ladies of honor, as soon as they had performed the services required
of them, had no restrictions placed upon them, but were at liberty to walk
about as they pleased.  It will easily
be conjectured that all these rival interests, gathering together in vapors,
necessarily produced clouds, and that the clouds were likely to be followed by
a tempest.  The king had no mustache to
gnaw, and therefore kept biting the handle of his whip instead, with
ill-concealed impatience.  How could he
get out of it?  D'Artagnan looked as
agreeable as possible, and Colbert as sulky as he could.  Who was there he could get in a passion
with?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
will consult the queen,&quot; said Louis XIV., bowing to the royal ladies.  And this kindness of consideration softened
Maria Theresa's heart, who, being of a kind and generous disposition, when left
to her own free-will, replied:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
shall be delighted to do whatever your majesty wishes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
long will it take us to get to Vaux?&quot; inquired Anne of Austria, in slow
and measured accents, placing her hand upon her bosom, where the seat of her
pain lay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;An
hour for your majesty's carriages,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;the roads are
tolerably good.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The king
looked at him.  &quot;And a quarter of
an hour for the king,&quot; he hastened to add.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
should arrive by daylight?&quot; said Louis XIV.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
the billeting of the king's military escort,&quot; objected Colbert, softly,
&quot;will make his majesty lose all the advantage of his speed, however quick
he may be.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Double
ass that you are!&quot; thought D'Artagnan; &quot;if I had any interest or
motive in demolishing your credit with the king, I could do it in ten
minutes.  If I were in the king's
place,&quot; he added aloud, &quot;I should, in going to M. Fouquet, leave my
escort behind me; I should go to him as a friend; I should enter accompanied
only by my captain of the guards; I should consider that I was acting more
nobly, and should be invested with a still more sacred character by doing so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Delight
sparkled in the king's eyes.  &quot;That
is indeed a very sensible suggestion. 
We will go to see a friend as friends; the gentlemen who are with the
carriages can go slowly: but we who are mounted will ride on.&quot;  And he rode off, accompanied by all those
who were mounted.  Colbert hid his ugly
head behind his horse's neck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
shall be quits,&quot; said D'Artagnan, as he galloped along, &quot;by getting a
little talk with Aramis this evening. 
And then, M. Fouquet is a man of honor. 
<i>Mordioux!</i>  I have said so, and it must be so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
this was the way how, towards seven o'clock in the evening, without announcing
his arrival by the din of trumpets, and without even his advanced guard,
without out-riders or musketeers, the king presented himself before the gate of
Vaux, where Fouquet, who had been informed of his royal guest's approach, had
been waiting for the last half-hour, with his head uncovered, surrounded by his
household and his friends.</p>

Fouquet held the stirrup of the king, who, having dismounted, bowed most
graciously, and more graciously still held out his hand to him, which Fouquet,
in spite of a slight resistance on the king's part, carried respectfully to his
lips.  The king wished to wait in the
first courtyard for the arrival of the carriages, nor had he long to wait, for
the roads had been put into excellent order by the superintendent, and a stone
would hardly have been found of the size of an egg the whole way from Melun to
Vaux; so that the carriages, rolling along as though on a carpet, brought the
ladies to Vaux, without jolting or fatigue, by eight o'clock.  They were received by Madame Fouquet, and at
the moment they made their appearance, a light as bright as day burst forth
from every quarter, trees, vases, and marble statues.  This species of enchantment lasted until their majesties had
retired into the palace.  All these
wonders and magical effects which the chronicler has heaped up, or rather
embalmed, in his recital, at the risk of rivaling the brain-born scenes of
romancers; these splendors whereby night seemed vanquished and nature
corrected, together with every delight and luxury combined for the satisfaction
of all the senses, as well as the imagination, Fouquet did in real truth offer
to his sovereign in that enchanting retreat of which no monarch could at that
time boast of possessing an equal.  We
do not intend to describe the grand banquet, at which the royal guests were
present, nor the concerts, nor the fairy-like and more than magic transformations
and metamorphoses; it will be enough for our purpose to depict the countenance
the king assumed, which, from being gay, soon wore a very gloomy, constrained,
and irritated expression.  He remembered
his own residence, royal though it was, and the mean and indifferent style of
luxury that prevailed there, which comprised but little more than what was
merely useful for the royal wants, without being his own personal
property.  The large vases of the
Louvre, the older furniture and plate of Henry II., of Francis I., and of Louis
XI., were but historic monuments of earlier days; nothing but specimens of art,
the relics of his predecessors; while with Fouquet, the value of the article
was as much in the workmanship as in the article itself.  Fouquet ate from a gold service, which
artists in his own employ had modeled and cast for him alone.  Fouquet drank wines of which the king of
France did not even know the name, and drank them out of goblets each more
valuable than the entire royal cellar.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                What,
too, was to be said of the apartments, the hangings, the pictures, the servants
and officers, of every description, of his household?  What of the mode of service in which etiquette was replaced by
order; stiff formality by personal, unrestrained comfort; the happiness and
contentment of the guest became the supreme law of all who obeyed the
host?  The perfect swarm of busily
engaged persons moving about noiselessly; the multitude of guests, - who were,
however, even less numerous than the servants who waited on them, - the myriad
of exquisitely prepared dishes, of gold and silver vases; the floods of
dazzling light, the masses of unknown flowers of which the hot-houses had been
despoiled, redundant with luxuriance of unequaled scent and beauty; the perfect
harmony of the surroundings, which, indeed, was no more than the prelude of the
promised <i>fête</i>, charmed all who were
there; and they testified their admiration over and over again, not by voice or
gesture, but by deep silence and rapt attention, those two languages of the
courtier which acknowledge the hand of no master powerful enough to restrain
them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As for
the king, his eyes filled with tears; he dared not look at the queen.  Anne of Austria, whose pride was superior to
that of any creature breathing, overwhelmed her host by the contempt with which
she treated everything handed to her. 
The young queen, kind-hearted by nature and curious by disposition,
praised Fouquet, ate with an exceedingly good appetite, and asked the names of
the strange fruits as they were placed upon the table.  Fouquet replied that he was not aware of
their names.  The fruits came from his
own stores; he had often cultivated them himself, having an intimate
acquaintance with the cultivation of exotic fruits and plants.  The king felt and appreciated the delicacy
of the replies, but was only the more humiliated; he thought the queen a little
too familiar in her manners, and that Anne of Austria resembled Juno a little
too much, in being too proud and haughty; his chief anxiety, however, was
himself, that he might remain cold and distant in his behavior, bordering
lightly the limits of supreme disdain or simple admiration.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                But
Fouquet had foreseen all this; he was, in fact, one of those men who foresee
everything.  The king had expressly
declared that, so long as he remained under Fouquet's roof, he did not wish his
own different repasts to be served in accordance with the usual etiquette, and
that he would, consequently, dine with the rest of society; but by the
thoughtful attention of the surintendant, the king's dinner was served up
separately, if one may so express it, in the middle of the general table; the
dinner, wonderful in every respect, from the dishes of which was composed,
comprised everything the king liked and generally preferred to anything
else.  Louis had no excuse - he, indeed,
who had the keenest appetite in his kingdom - for saying that he was not
hungry.  Nay, M. Fouquet did even better
still; he certainly, in obedience to the king's expressed desire, seated
himself at the table, but as soon as the soups were served, he arose and
personally waited on the king, while Madame Fouquet stood behind the
queen-mother's armchair.  The disdain of
Juno and the sulky fits of temper of Jupiter could not resist this excess of
kindly feeling and polite attention. 
The queen ate a biscuit dipped in a glass of San-Lucar wine; and the
king ate of everything, saying to M. Fouquet: &quot;It is impossible, monsieur
le surintendant, to dine better anywhere.&quot;  Whereupon the whole court began, on all sides, to devour the
dishes spread before them with such enthusiasm that it looked as though a cloud
of Egyptian locusts was settling down on green and growing crops.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As
soon, however, as his hunger was appeased, the king became morose and
overgloomed again; the more so in proportion to the satisfaction he fancied he
had previously manifested, and particularly on account of the deferential
manner which his courtiers had shown towards Fouquet.  D'Artagnan, who ate a good deal and drank but little, without
allowing it to be noticed, did not lose a single opportunity, but made a great
number of observations which he turned to good profit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                When
the supper was finished, the king expressed a wish not to lose the
promenade.  The park was illuminated;
the moon, too, as if she had placed herself at the orders of the lord of Vaux,
silvered the trees and lake with her own bright and quasi-phosphorescent
light.  The air was strangely soft and
balmy; the daintily shell-gravelled walks through the thickly set avenues
yielded luxuriously to the feet.  The <i>fête</i> was complete in every respect, for
the king, having met La Vallière in one of the winding paths of the wood, was
able to press her hand and say, &quot;I love you,&quot; without any one
overhearing him except M. d'Artagnan, who followed, and M. Fouquet, who
preceded him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
dreamy night of magical enchantments stole smoothly on.  The king having requested to be shown to his
room, there was immediately a movement in every direction.  The queens passed to their own apartments,
accompanied by them music of theorbos and lutes; the king found his musketeers
awaiting him on the grand flight of steps, for M. Fouquet had brought them on
from Melun and had invited them to supper. 
D'Artagnan's suspicions at once disappeared.  He was weary, he had supped well, and wished, for once in his
life, thoroughly to enjoy a <i>fête</i>
given by a man who was in every sense of the word a king.  &quot;M. Fouquet,&quot; he said, &quot;is
the man for me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
king was conducted with the greatest ceremony to the chamber of Morpheus, of
which we owe some cursory description to our readers.  It was the handsomest and largest in the palace.  Lebrun had painted on the vaulted ceiling
the happy as well as the unhappy dreams which Morpheus inflicts on kings as
well as on other men.  Everything that
sleep gives birth to that is lovely, its fairy scenes, its flowers and nectar,
the wild voluptuousness or profound repose of the senses, had the painter
elaborated on his frescoes.  It was a
composition as soft and pleasing in one part as dark and gloomy and terrible in
another.  The poisoned chalice, the
glittering dagger suspended over the head of the sleeper; wizards and phantoms
with terrific masks, those half-dim shadows more alarming than the approach of
fire or the somber face of midnight, these, and such as these, he had made the
companions of his more pleasing pictures. 
No sooner had the king entered his room than a cold shiver seemed to
pass through him, and on Fouquet asking him the cause of it, the king replied,
as pale as death:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am sleepy, that is all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Does
your majesty wish for your attendants at once?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No;
I have to talk with a few persons first,&quot; said the king.  &quot;Will you have the goodness to tell M.
Colbert I wish to see him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
bowed and left the room.</p>

had determined to lose no time, and in fact he never was in the habit of doing
so.  After having inquired for Aramis,
he had looked for him in every direction until he had succeeded in finding
him.  Besides, no sooner had the king
entered Vaux, than Aramis had retired to his own room, meditating, doubtless,
some new piece of gallant attention for his majesty's amusement.  D'Artagnan desired the servants to announce
him, and found on the second story (in a beautiful room called the Blue
Chamber, on account of the color of its hangings) the bishop of Vannes in
company with Porthos and several of the modern Epicureans.  Aramis came forward to embrace his friend,
and offered him the best seat.  As it
was after awhile generally remarked among those present that the musketeer was
reserved, and wished for an opportunity for conversing secretly with Aramis,
the Epicureans took their leave. 
Porthos, however, did not stir; for true it is that, having dined
exceedingly well, he was fast asleep in his armchair; and the freedom of
conversation therefore was not interrupted by a third person.  Porthos had a deep, harmonious snore, and
people might talk in the midst of its loud bass without fear of disturbing
him.  D'Artagnan felt that he was called
upon to open the conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
and so we have come to Vaux,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
yes, D'Artagnan.  And how do you like
the place?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
much, and I like M. Fouquet, also.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is
he not a charming host?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No
one could be more so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am told that the king began by showing great distance of manner towards M.
Fouquet, but that his majesty grew much more cordial afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
did not notice it, then, since you say you have been told so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No;
I was engaged with the gentlemen who have just left the room about the
theatrical performances and the tournaments which are to take place
to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah,
indeed! you are the comptroller-general of the <i>fêtes</i> here, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
know I am a friend of all kinds of amusement where the exercise of the
imagination is called into activity; I have always been a poet in one way or
another.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
I remember the verses you used to write, they were charming.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have forgotten them, but I am delighted to read the verses of others, when
those others are known by the names of Molière, Pélisson, La Fontaine,
etc.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you know what idea occurred to me this evening, Aramis?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No;
tell me what it was, for I should never be able to guess it, you have so
many.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
the idea occurred to me, that the true king of France is not Louis XIV.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>What!</i>&quot; said Aramis, involuntarily,
looking the musketeer full in the eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
it is Monsieur Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
breathed again, and smiled.  &quot;Ah!
you are like all the rest, jealous,&quot; he said.  &quot;I would wager that it was M. Colbert who turned that pretty
phrase.&quot;  D'Artagnan, in order to
throw Aramis off his guard, related Colbert's misadventures with regard to the <i>vin de Melun</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
comes of a mean race, does Colbert,&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Quite
true.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;When
I think, too,&quot; added the bishop, &quot;that that fellow will be your
minister within four months, and that you will serve him as blindly as you did
Richelieu or Mazarin - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
as you serve M. Fouquet,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;With
this difference, though, that M. Fouquet is not M. Colbert.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;True,
true,&quot; said D'Artagnan, as he pretended to become sad and full of
reflection; and then, a moment after, he added, &quot;Why do you tell me that
M. Colbert will be minister in four months?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Because
M. Fouquet will have ceased to be so,&quot; replied Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
will be ruined, you mean?&quot; said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Completely
so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why
does he give these <i>fêtes</i>, then?&quot;
said the musketeer, in a tone so full of thoughtful consideration, and so well
assumed, that the bishop was for the moment deceived by it.  &quot;Why did you not dissuade him from
it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
latter part of the phrase was just a little too much, and Aramis's former
suspicions were again aroused.  &quot;It
is done with the object of humoring the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;By
ruining himself?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
by ruining himself for the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
most eccentric, one might say, sinister calculation, that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Necessity,
necessity, my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
don't see that, dear Aramis.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you not?  Have you not remarked M.
Colbert's daily increasing antagonism, and that he is doing his utmost to drive
the king to get rid of the superintendent?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;One
must be blind not to see it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
that a cabal is already armed against M. Fouquet?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is well known.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
likelihood is there that the king would join a party formed against a man who
will have spent everything he had to please him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;True,
true,&quot; said D'Artagnan, slowly, hardly convinced, yet curious to broach
another phase of the conversation. 
&quot;There are follies, and follies,&quot; he resumed, &quot;and I do
not like those you are committing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
do you allude to?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;As
for the banquet, the ball, the concert, the theatricals, the tournaments, the
cascades, the fireworks, the illuminations, and the presents - these are well
and good, I grant; but why were not these expenses sufficient?  Why was it necessary to have new liveries
and costumes for your whole household?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are quite right.  I told M. Fouquet that
myself; he replied, that if he were rich enough he would offer the king a newly
erected château, from the vanes at the houses to the very sub-cellars;
completely new inside and out; and that, as soon as the king had left, he would
burn the whole building and its contents, in order that it might not be made
use of by any one else.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
completely Spanish!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
told him so, and he then added this: 'Whoever advises me to spare expense, I
shall look upon as my enemy.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is positive madness; and that portrait, too!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
portrait?&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
of the king, and the surprise as well.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
surprise?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
surprise you seem to have in view, and on account of which you took some
specimens away, when I met you at Percerin's.&quot;  D'Artagnan paused.  The
shaft was discharged, and all he had to do was to wait and watch its effect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is merely an act of graceful attention,&quot; replied Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
went up to his friend, took hold of both his hands, and looking him full in the
eyes, said, &quot;Aramis, do you still care for me a very little?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
a question to ask!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
good.  One favor, then.  Why did you take some patterns of the king's
costumes at Percerin's?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come
with me and ask poor Lebrun, who has been working upon them for the last two
days and nights.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Aramis,
that may be truth for everybody else, but for me - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Upon
my word, D'Artagnan, you astonish me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Be
a little considerate.  Tell me the exact
truth; you would not like anything disagreeable to happen to me, would
you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
dear friend, you are becoming quite incomprehensible.  What suspicion can you have possibly got hold of?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you believe in my instinctive feelings? 
Formerly you used to have faith in them.  Well, then, an instinct tells me that you have some concealed
project on foot.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
- a project?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am convinced of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
nonsense!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am not only sure of it, but I would even swear it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Indeed,
D'Artagnan, you cause me the greatest pain. 
Is it likely, if I have any project in hand that I ought to keep secret
from you, I should tell you about it? 
If I had one that I could and ought to have revealed, should I not have
long ago divulged it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
Aramis, no.  There are certain projects
which are never revealed until the favorable opportunity arrives.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
that case, my dear fellow,&quot; returned the bishop, laughing, &quot;the only
thing now is, that the 'opportunity' has not yet arrived.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
shook his head with a sorrowful expression. 
&quot;Oh, friendship, friendship!&quot; he said, &quot;what an idle word
you are!  Here is a man who, if I were
but to ask it, would suffer himself to be cut in pieces for my sake.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are right,&quot; said Aramis, nobly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
this man, who would shed every drop of blood in his veins for me, will not open
up before me the least corner in his heart. 
Friendship, I repeat, is nothing but an unsubstantial shadow - a lure,
like everything else in this bright, dazzling world.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is not thus you should speak of <i>our</i>
friendship,&quot; replied the bishop, in a firm, assured voice; &quot;for ours
is not of the same nature as those of which you have been speaking.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Look
at us, Aramis; three out of the old 'four.' 
You are deceiving me; I suspect you; and Porthos is fast asleep.  An admirable trio of friends, don't you
think so?  What an affecting relic of
the former dear old times!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
can only tell you one thing, D'Artagnan, and I swear it on the Bible: I love
you just as I used to do.  If I ever
suspect you, it is on account of others, and not on account of either of
us.  In everything I may do, and should
happen to succeed in, you will find your fourth.  Will you promise me the same favor?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
I am not mistaken, Aramis, your words - at the moment you pronounce them - are
full of generous feeling.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Such
a thing is very possible.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are conspiring against M. Colbert.  If
that be all, <i>mordioux</i>, tell me so at
once.  I have the instrument in my own
hand, and will pull out the tooth easily enough.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
could not conceal a smile of disdain that flitted over his haughty
features.  &quot;And supposing that I
were conspiring against Colbert, what harm would there be in <i>that?</i>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
no; that would be too trifling a matter for you to take in hand, and it was not
on that account you asked Percerin for those patterns of the king's
costumes.  Oh!  Aramis, we are not enemies, remember - we are brothers.  Tell me what you wish to undertake, and,
upon the word of a D'Artagnan, if I cannot help you, I will swear to remain
neuter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am undertaking nothing,&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Aramis,
a voice within me speaks and seems to trickle forth a rill of light within my
darkness: it is a voice that has never yet deceived me.  It is the king you are conspiring
against.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
king?&quot; exclaimed the bishop, pretending to be annoyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
face will not convince me; the king, I repeat.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Will
you help me?&quot; said Aramis, smiling ironically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Aramis,
I will do more than help you - I will do more than remain neuter - I will save
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are mad, D'Artagnan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am the wiser of the two, in this matter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
to suspect me of wishing to assassinate the king!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
spoke of such a thing?&quot; smiled the musketeer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
let us understand one another.  I do not
see what any one can do to a legitimate king as ours is, if he does not
assassinate him.&quot;  D'Artagnan did
not say a word.  &quot;Besides, you have
your guards and your musketeers here,&quot; said the bishop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;True.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are not in M. Fouquet's house, but in your own.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;True;
but in spite of that, Aramis, grant me, for pity's sake, one single word of a
true friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
true friend's word is ever truth itself. 
If I think of touching, even with my finger, the son of Anne of Austria,
the true king of this realm of France - if I have not the firm intention of
prostrating myself before his throne - if in every idea I may entertain
to-morrow, here at Vaux, will not be the most glorious day my king ever enjoyed
- may Heaven's lightning blast me where I stand!&quot;  Aramis had pronounced these words with his
face turned towards the alcove of his own bedroom, where D'Artagnan, seated
with his back towards the alcove, could not suspect that any one was lying
concealed.  The earnestness of his
words, the studied slowness with which he pronounced them, the solemnity of his
oath, gave the musketeer the most complete satisfaction.  He took hold of both Aramis's hands, and
shook them cordially.  Aramis had
endured reproaches without turning pale, and had blushed as he listened to
words of praise.  D'Artagnan, deceived,
did him honor; but D'Artagnan, trustful and reliant, made him feel
ashamed.  &quot;Are you going
away?&quot; he said, as he embraced him, in order to conceal the flush on his
face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes.  Duty summons me.  I have to get the watch-word. 
It seems I am to be lodged in the king's ante-room.  Where does Porthos sleep?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Take
him away with you, if you like, for he rumbles through his sleepy nose like a
park of artillery.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
he does not stay with you, then?&quot; said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Not
the least in the world.  He has a
chamber to himself, but I don't know where.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
good!&quot; said the musketeer; from whom this separation of the two associates
removed his last suspicion, and he touched Porthos lightly on the shoulder; the
latter replied by a loud yawn. 
&quot;Come,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What,
D'Artagnan, my dear fellow, is that you? 
What a lucky chance!  Oh, yes -
true; I have forgotten; I am at the <i>fête</i>
at Vaux.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
and your beautiful dress, too.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
it was very attentive on the part of Monsieur Coquelin de Volière, was it
not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Hush!&quot;
said Aramis.  &quot;You are walking so
heavily you will make the flooring give way.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;True,&quot;
said the musketeer; &quot;this room is above the dome, I think.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
I did not choose it for a fencing-room, I assure you,&quot; added the
bishop.  &quot;The ceiling of the king's
room has all the lightness and calm of wholesome sleep.  Do not forget, therefore, that my flooring
is merely the covering of his ceiling. 
Good night, my friends, and in ten minutes I shall be asleep
myself.&quot;  And Aramis accompanied
them to the door, laughing quietly all the while.  As soon as they were outside, he bolted the door, hurriedly;
closed up the chinks of the windows, and then called out, &quot;Monseigneur! -
monseigneur!&quot;  Philippe made his
appearance from the alcove, as he pushed aside a sliding panel placed behind
the bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
d'Artagnan entertains a great many suspicions, it seems,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
- you recognized M. d'Artagnan, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Before
you called him by his name, even.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
is your captain of musketeers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
is very devoted to <i>me</i>,&quot; replied
Philippe, laying a stress upon the personal pronoun.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;As
faithful as a dog; but he bites sometimes. 
If D'Artagnan does not recognize you before <i>the other</i> has disappeared, rely upon D'Artagnan to the end of the
world; for in that case, if he has seen nothing, he will keep his
fidelity.  If he sees, when it is too
late, he is a Gascon, and will never admit that he has been deceived.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
thought so.  What are we to do,
now?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Sit
in this folding-chair.  I am going to
push aside a portion of the flooring; you will look through the opening, which
answers to one of the false windows made in the dome of the king's
apartment.  Can you see?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Philippe,
starting as at the sight of an enemy; &quot;I see the king!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;What is he doing?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;He seems to wish some man to
sit down close to him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;M. Fouquet?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;No, no; wait a moment -
&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Look at the notes and the
portraits, my prince.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;The man whom the king wishes
to sit down in his presence is M. Colbert.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Colbert sit down in the king's
presence!&quot; exclaimed Aramis. 
&quot;It is impossible.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Look.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
looked through the opening in the flooring. 
&quot;Yes,&quot; he said. 
&quot;Colbert himself.  Oh,
monseigneur! what can we be going to hear - and what can result from this
intimacy?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Nothing good for M. Fouquet,
at all events.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>The prince did not deceive himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We have
seen that Louis XIV. had sent for Colbert, and Colbert had arrived.  The conversation began between them by the
king according to him one of the highest favors that he had ever done; it was
true the king was alone with his subject. 
&quot;Colbert,&quot; said he, &quot;sit down.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
intendant, overcome with delight, for he feared he was about to be dismissed,
refused this unprecedented honor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Does he accept?&quot; said
Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;No, he remains standing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
us listen, then.&quot;  And the future
king and the future pope listened eagerly to the simple mortals they held under
their feet, ready to crush them when they liked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Colbert,&quot; said the king,
&quot;you have annoyed me exceedingly to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I know it, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'> &quot;Very good; I like that answer.  Yes, you knew it, and there was courage in the doing of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
ran the risk of displeasing your majesty, but I risked, also, the concealment
of your best interests.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;What! you were afraid of
something on<i> my</i> account?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
was, sire, even if it were nothing more than an indigestion,&quot; said
Colbert; &quot;for people do not give their sovereigns such banquets as the one
of to-day, unless it be to stifle them beneath the burden of good living.&quot;  Colbert awaited the effect this coarse jest
would produce upon the king; and Louis XIV., who was the vainest and the most
fastidiously delicate man in his kingdom, forgave Colbert the joke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
truth is,&quot; he said, &quot;that M. Fouquet has given me too good a
meal.  Tell me, Colbert, where does he
get all the money required for this enormous expenditure, - can you tell?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Yes, I do know, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Will you be able to prove it
with tolerable certainty?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Easily; and to the utmost
farthing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I know you are very
exact.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Exactitude is the principal
qualification required in an intendant of finances.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;But all are not so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I thank you majesty for so
flattering a compliment from your own lips.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;M. Fouquet, therefore, is
rich - very rich, and I suppose every man knows he is so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Every one, sire; the living
as well as the dead.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;What does that mean, Monsieur
Colbert?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
living are witnesses of M. Fouquet's wealth, - they admire and applaud the
result produced; but the dead, wiser and better informed than we are, know how
that wealth was obtained - and they rise up in accusation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;So that M. Fouquet owes his
wealth to some cause or other.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;The occupation of an
intendant very often favors those who practice it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have something to say to me more confidentially, I perceive; do not be afraid,
we are quite alone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am never afraid of anything under the shelter of my own conscience, and under
the protection of your majesty,&quot; said Colbert, bowing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;If the dead, therefore, were
to speak - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;They do speak sometimes, sire,
- read.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
murmured Aramis, in the prince's ear, who, close beside him, listened without
losing a syllable, &quot;since you are placed here, monseigneur, in order to
learn your vocation of a king, listen to a piece of infamy - of a nature truly
royal.  You are about to be a witness of
one of those scenes which the foul fiend alone conceives and executes.  Listen attentively, - you will find your
advantage in it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
prince redoubled his attention, and saw Louis XIV. take from Colbert's hands a
letter the latter held out to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;The late cardinal's
handwriting,&quot; said the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
majesty has an excellent memory,&quot; replied Colbert, bowing; &quot;it is an
immense advantage for a king who is destined for hard work to recognize
handwritings at the first glance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
king read Mazarin's letter, and, as its contents are already known to the
reader, in consequence of the misunderstanding between Madame de Chevreuse and
Aramis, nothing further would be learned if we stated them here again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I do not quite understand,&quot;
said the king, greatly interested.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Your majesty has not acquired
the utilitarian habit of checking the public accounts.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I see that it refers to money
that had been given to M. Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Thirteen millions.  A tolerably good sum.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes.  Well, these thirteen millions are wanting to
balance the total of the account.  That
is what I do not very well understand. 
How was this deficit possible?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Possible I do not say; but
there is no doubt about fact that it is really so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;You say that these thirteen
millions are found to be wanting in the accounts?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I do not say so, but the
registry does.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
this letter of M. Mazarin indicates the employment of that sum and the name of
the person with whom it was deposited?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;As your majesty can judge for
yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Yes; and the result is, then,
that M. Fouquet has not yet restored the thirteen millions.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;That results from the
accounts, certainly, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Well, and, consequently -
&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
sire, in that case, inasmuch as M. Fouquet has not yet given back the thirteen
millions, he must have appropriated them to his own purpose; and with those
thirteen millions one could incur four times and a little more as much expense,
and make four times as great a display, as your majesty was able to do at
Fontainebleau, where we only spent three millions altogether, if you
remember.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                For a
blunderer, the <i>souvenir</i> he had evoked
was a rather skillfully contrived piece of baseness; for by the remembrance of
his own <i>fête</i> he, for the first time,
perceived its inferiority compared with that of Fouquet.  Colbert received back again at Vaux what
Fouquet had given him at Fontainebleau, and, as a good financier, returned it
with the best possible interest.  Having
once disposed the king's mind in this artful way, Colbert had nothing of much
importance to detain him.  He felt that
such was the case, for the king, too, had again sunk into a dull and gloomy
state.  Colbert awaited the first words
from the king's lips with as much impatience as Philippe and Aramis did from
their place of observation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Are
you aware what is the usual and natural consequence of all this, Monsieur
Colbert?&quot; said the king, after a few moments' reflection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;No, sire, I do not
know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Well, then, the fact of the
appropriation of the thirteen millions, if it can be proved - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;But it is so already.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I mean if it were to be
declared and certified, M. Colbert.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I think it will be to-morrow,
if your majesty - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Were
we not under M. Fouquet's roof, you were going to say, perhaps,&quot; replied
the king, with something of nobility in his demeanor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
king is in his own palace wherever he may be - especially in houses which the
royal money has constructed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
think,&quot; said Philippe in a low tone to Aramis, &quot;that the architect
who planned this dome ought, anticipating the use it could be put to at a
future opportunity, so to have contrived that it might be made to fall upon the
heads of scoundrels such as M. Colbert.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I think so too,&quot; replied
Aramis; &quot;but M. Colbert is so very <i>near
the king</i> at this moment.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;That is true, and that would
open the succession.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Of
which your younger brother would reap all the advantage, monseigneur.  But stay, let us keep quiet, and go on
listening.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;We shall not have long to
listen,&quot; said the young prince.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Why not, monseigneur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Because, if I were king, I
should make no further reply.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;And what would you do?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I should wait until to-morrow
morning to give myself time for reflection.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Louis
XIV. at last raised his eyes, and finding Colbert attentively waiting for his
next remarks, said, hastily, changing the conversation, &quot;M. Colbert, I
perceive it is getting very late, and I shall now retire to bed.  By to-morrow morning I shall have made up my
mind.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
good, sire,&quot; returned Colbert, greatly incensed, although he restrained
himself in the presence of the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
king made a gesture of adieu, and Colbert withdrew with a respectful bow.  &quot;My attendants!&quot; cried the king;
and, as they entered the apartment, Philippe was about to quit his post of
observation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
moment longer,&quot; said Aramis to him, with his accustomed gentleness of
manner; &quot;what has just now taken place is only a detail, and to-morrow we
shall have no occasion to think anything more about it; but the ceremony of the
king's retiring to rest, the etiquette observed in addressing the king, that
indeed is of the greatest importance. 
Learn, sire, and study well how you ought to go to bed of a night.  Look! look!&quot;</p>

will tell us, or rather history has told us, of the various events of the
following day, of the splendid <i>fêtes</i>
given by the surintendant to his sovereign. 
Nothing but amusement and delight was allowed to prevail throughout the
whole of the following day; there was a promenade, a banquet, a comedy to be
acted, and a comedy, too, in which, to his great amazement, Porthos recognized
&quot;M. Coquelin de Volière&quot; as one of the actors, in the piece called
&quot;Les Fâcheux.&quot;  Full of
preoccupation, however, from the scene of the previous evening, and hardly
recovered from the effects of the poison which Colbert had then administered to
him, the king, during the whole of the day, so brilliant in its effects, so
full of unexpected and startling novelties, in which all the wonders of the
&quot;Arabian Night's Entertainments&quot; seemed to be reproduced for his
especial amusement - the king, we say, showed himself cold, reserved, and
taciturn.  Nothing could smooth the
frowns upon his face; every one who observed him noticed that a deep feeling of
resentment, of remote origin, increased by slow degrees, as the source becomes
a river, thanks to the thousand threads of water that increase its body, was
keenly alive in the depths of the king's heart.  Towards the middle of the day only did he begin to resume a
little serenity of manner, and by that time he had, in all probability, made up
his mind.  Aramis, who followed him step
by step in his thoughts, as in his walk, concluded that the event he was
expecting would not be long before it was announced.  This time Colbert seemed to walk in concert with the bishop of
Vannes, and had he received for every annoyance which he inflicted on the king
a word of direction from Aramis, he could not have done better.  During the whole of the day the king, who,
in all probability, wished to free himself from some of the thoughts which
disturbed his mind, seemed to seek La Vallière's society as actively as he
seemed to show his anxiety to flee that of M. Colbert or M. Fouquet.  The evening came.  The king had expressed a wish not to walk in the park until after
cards in the evening.  In the interval
between supper and the promenade, cards and dice were introduced.  The king won a thousand pistoles, and,
having won them, put them in his pocket, and then rose, saying, &quot;And now,
gentlemen, to the park.&quot;  He found
the ladies of the court were already there. 
The king, we have before observed, had won a thousand pistoles, and had
put them in his pocket; but M. Fouquet had somehow contrived to lose ten
thousand, so that among the courtiers there was still left a hundred and ninety
thousand francs' profit to divide, a circumstance which made the countenances
of the courtiers and the officers of the king's household the most joyous
countenances in the world.  It was not
the same, however, with the king's face; for, notwithstanding his success at
play, to which he was by no means insensible, there still remained a slight
shade of dissatisfaction.  Colbert was
waiting for or upon him at the corner of one of the avenues; he was most
probably waiting there in consequence of a rendezvous which had been given him
by the king, as Louis XIV., who had avoided him, or who had seemed to avoid
him, suddenly made him a sign, and they then struck into the depths of the park
together.  But La Vallière, too, had
observed the king's gloomy aspect and kindling glances; she had remarked this -
and as nothing which lay hidden or smoldering in his heart was hidden from the
gaze of her affection, she understood that this repressed wrath menaced some
one; she prepared to withstand the current of his vengeance, and intercede like
an angel of mercy.  Overcome by sadness,
nervously agitated, deeply distressed at having been so long separated from her
lover, disturbed at the sight of the emotion she had divined, she accordingly
presented herself to the king with an embarrassed aspect, which in his then
disposition of mind the king interpreted unfavorably.  Then, as they were alone - nearly alone, inasmuch as Colbert, as
soon as he perceived the young girl approaching, had stopped and drawn back a
dozen paces - the king advanced towards La Vallière and took her by the
hand.  &quot;Mademoiselle,&quot; he said
to her, &quot;should I be guilty of an indiscretion if I were to inquire if you
were indisposed? for you seem to breathe as if you were oppressed by some
secret cause of uneasiness, and your eyes are filled with tears.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
sire, if I be indeed so, and if my eyes are indeed full of tears, I am
sorrowful only at the sadness which seems to oppress your majesty.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
sadness?  You are mistaken,
mademoiselle; no, it is not sadness I experience.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is it, then, sire?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Humiliation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Humiliation?
oh! sire, what a word for you to use!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
mean, mademoiselle, that wherever I may happen to be, no one else ought to be
the master.  Well, then, look round you
on every side, and judge whether I am not eclipsed - I, the king of France -
before the monarch of these wide domains. 
Oh!&quot; he continued, clenching his hands and teeth, &quot;when I
think that this king - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
sire?&quot; said Louise, terrified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;
- That this king is a faithless, unworthy servant, who grows proud and
self-sufficient upon the strength of property that belongs to me, and which he
has stolen.  And therefore I am about to
change this impudent minister's <i>fête</i>
into sorrow and mourning, of which the nymph of Vaux, as the poets say, shall
not soon lose the remembrance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
your majesty - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
mademoiselle, are you about to take M. Fouquet's part?&quot; said Louis,
impatiently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
sire; I will only ask whether you are well informed.  Your majesty has more than once learned the value of accusations
made at court.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Louis
XIV. made a sign for Colbert to approach. 
&quot;Speak, Monsieur Colbert,&quot; said the young prince, &quot;for I
almost believe that Mademoiselle de la Vallière has need of your assistance
before she can put any faith in the king's word.  Tell mademoiselle what M. Fouquet has done; and you,
mademoiselle, will perhaps have the kindness to listen.  It will not be long.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Why did
Louis XIV. insist upon it in such a manner? 
A very simple reason - his heart was not at rest, his mind was not
thoroughly convinced; he imagined there lay some dark, hidden, tortuous
intrigue behind these thirteen millions of francs; and he wished that the pure
heart of La Vallière, which had revolted at the idea of theft or robbery,
should approve - even were it only by a single word - the resolution he had
taken, and which, nevertheless, he hesitated before carrying into execution.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Speak,
monsieur,&quot; said La Vallière to Colbert, who had advanced; &quot;speak,
since the king wishes me to listen to you. 
Tell me, what is the crime with which M. Fouquet is charged?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
not very heinous, mademoiselle,&quot; he returned, &quot;a mere abuse of
confidence.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Speak,
speak, Colbert; and when you have related it, leave us, and go and inform M.
d'Artagnan that I have certain orders to give him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
d'Artagnan, sire!&quot; exclaimed La Vallière; &quot;but why send for M.
d'Artagnan?  I entreat you to tell
me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Pardieu!</i> in order to arrest this
haughty, arrogant Titan who, true to his menace, threatens to scale my
heaven.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Arrest
M. Fouquet, do you say?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
does that surprise you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
his own house!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why
not?  If he be guilty, he is as guilty
in his own house as anywhere else.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
Fouquet, who at this moment is ruining himself for his sovereign.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
plain truth, mademoiselle, it seems as if you were defending this
traitor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Colbert
began to chuckle silently.  The king
turned round at the sound of this suppressed mirth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Sire,&quot;
said La Vallière, &quot;it is not M. Fouquet I am defending; it is
yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Me!
you are defending me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Sire,
you would dishonor yourself if you were to give such an order.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Dishonor
myself!&quot; murmured the king, turning pale with anger.  &quot;In plain truth, mademoiselle, you show
a strange persistence in what you say.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
I do, sire, my only motive is that of serving your majesty,&quot; replied the
noble-hearted girl: &quot;for that I would risk, I would sacrifice my very
life, without the least reserve.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Colbert
seemed inclined to grumble and complain. 
La Vallière, that timid, gentle lamb, turned round upon him, and with a
glance like lightning imposed silence upon him.  &quot;Monsieur,&quot; she said, &quot;when the king acts well,
whether, in doing so, he does either myself or those who belong to me an
injury, I have nothing to say; but were the king to confer a benefit either
upon me or mine, and if he acted badly, I should tell him so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
it appears to me, mademoiselle,&quot; Colbert ventured to say, &quot;that I too
love the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur, we both love him, but each in a different manner,&quot; replied La
Vallière, with such an accent that the heart of the young king was powerfully
affected by it.  &quot;I love him so
deeply, that the whole world is aware of it; so purely, that the king himself
does not doubt my affection.  He is my
king and my master; I am the least of all his servants.  But whoso touches his honor assails my life.  Therefore, I repeat, that they dishonor the
king who advise him to arrest M. Fouquet under his own roof.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Colbert
hung down his head, for he felt that the king had abandoned him.  However, as he bent his head, he murmured,
&quot;Mademoiselle, I have only one word to say.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
not say it, then, monsieur; for I would not listen to it.  Besides, what could you have to tell
me?  That M. Fouquet has been guilty of
certain crimes?  I believe he has,
because the king has said so; and, from the moment the king said, 'I think so,'
I have no occasion for other lips to say, 'I affirm it.'  But, were M. Fouquet the vilest of men, I
should say aloud, 'M. Fouquet's person is sacred to the king because he is the
guest of M. Fouquet.  Were his house a
den of thieves, were Vaux a cave of coiners or robbers, his home is sacred, his
palace is inviolable, since his wife is living in it; and that is an asylum
which even executioners would not dare to violate.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                La
Vallière paused, and was silent.  In
spite of himself the king could not but admire her; he was overpowered by the
passionate energy of her voice; by the nobleness of the cause she
advocated.  Colbert yielded, overcome by
the inequality of the struggle.  At last
the king breathed again more freely, shook his head, and held out his hand to
La Vallière.  &quot;Mademoiselle,&quot;
he said, gently, &quot;why do you decide against me?  Do you know what this wretched fellow will do, if I give him time
to breathe again?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is
he not a prey which will always be within your grasp?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Should
he escape, and take to flight?&quot; exclaimed Colbert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
monsieur, it will always remain on record, to the king's eternal honor, that he
allowed M. Fouquet to flee; and the more guilty he may have been, the greater
will the king's honor and glory appear, compared with such unnecessary misery
and shame.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Louis
kissed La Vallière's hand, as he knelt before her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am lost,&quot; thought Colbert; then suddenly his face brightened up
again.  &quot;Oh! no, no, aha, old fox!
- not yet,&quot; he said to himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
while the king, protected from observation by the thick covert of an enormous
lime, pressed La Vallière to his breast, with all the ardor of ineffable
affection, Colbert tranquilly fumbled among the papers in his pocket-book and
drew out of it a paper folded in the form of a letter, somewhat yellow,
perhaps, but one that must have been most precious, since the intendant smiled
as he looked at it; he then bent a look, full of hatred, upon the charming
group which the young girl and the king formed together - a group revealed but
for a moment, as the light of the approaching torches shone upon it.  Louis noticed the light reflected upon La
Vallière's white dress.  &quot;Leave me,
Louise,&quot; he said, &quot;for some one is coming.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Mademoiselle,
mademoiselle, some one is coming,&quot; cried Colbert, to expedite the young
girl's departure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Louise
disappeared rapidly among the trees; and then, as the king, who had been on his
knees before the young girl, was rising from his humble posture, Colbert
exclaimed, &quot;Ah!  Mademoiselle de la
Vallière has let something fall.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is it?&quot; inquired the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
paper - a letter - something white; look there, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
king stooped down immediately and picked up the letter, crumpling it in his
hand, as he did so; and at the same moment the torches arrived, inundating the
blackness of the scene with a flood of light as bight as day.</p>

torches we have just referred to, the eager attention every one displayed, and
the new ovation paid to the king by Fouquet, arrived in time to suspend the
effect of a resolution which La Vallière had already considerably shaken in
Louis XIV.'s heart.  He looked at
Fouquet with a feeling almost of gratitude for having given La Vallière an
opportunity of showing herself so generously disposed, so powerful in the
influence she exercised over his heart. 
The moment of the last and greatest display had arrived.  Hardly had Fouquet conducted the king
towards the château, when a mass of fire burst from the dome of Vaux, with a
prodigious uproar, pouring a flood of dazzling cataracts of rays on every side,
and illumining the remotest corners of the gardens.  The fireworks began. 
Colbert, at twenty paces from the king, who was surrounded and <i>fêted</i> by the owner of Vaux, seemed, by
the obstinate persistence of his gloomy thoughts, to do his utmost to recall
Louis's attention, which the magnificence of the spectacle was already, in his
opinion, too easily diverting. 
Suddenly, just as Louis was on the point of holding it out to Fouquet,
he perceived in his hand the paper which, as he believed, La Vallière had dropped
at his feet as she hurried away.  The still
stronger magnet of love drew the young prince's attention towards the <i>souvenir</i> of his idol; and, by the
brilliant light, which increased momentarily in beauty, and drew from the
neighboring villages loud cheers of admiration, the king read the letter, which
he supposed was a loving and tender epistle La Vallière had destined for
him.  But as he read it, a death-like
pallor stole over his face, and an expression of deep-seated wrath, illumined
by the many-colored fire which gleamed so brightly, soaringly around the scene,
produced a terrible spectacle, which every one would have shuddered at, could
they only have read into his heart, now torn by the most stormy and most bitter
passions.  There was no truce for him
now, influenced as he was by jealousy and mad passion.  From the very moment when the dark truth was
revealed to him, every gentler feeling seemed to disappear; pity, kindness of
consideration, the religion of hospitality, all were forgotten.  In the bitter pang which wrung his heart,
he, still too weak to hide his sufferings, was almost on the point of uttering
a cry of alarm, and calling his guards to gather round him.  This letter which Colbert had thrown down at
the king's feet, the reader has doubtlessly guessed, was the same that had
disappeared with the porter Toby at Fontainebleau, after the attempt which
Fouquet had made upon La Vallière's heart. 
Fouquet saw the king's pallor, and was far from guessing the evil;
Colbert saw the king's anger, and rejoiced inwardly at the approach of the storm.  Fouquet's voice drew the young prince from
his wrathful reverie.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is the matter, sire?&quot; inquired the superintendent, with an expression of
graceful interest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Louis
made a violent effort over himself, as he replied, &quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am afraid your majesty is suffering?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am suffering, and have already told you so, monsieur; but it is nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And the
king, without waiting for the termination of the fireworks, turned towards the
château.  Fouquet accompanied him, and
the whole court followed, leaving the remains of the fireworks consuming for
their own amusement.  The superintendent
endeavored again to question Louis XIV., but did not succeed in obtaining a
reply.  He imagined there had been some
misunderstanding between Louis and La Vallière in the park, which had resulted
in a slight quarrel; and that the king, who was not ordinarily sulky by
disposition, but completely absorbed by his passion for La Vallière, had taken
a dislike to every one because his mistress had shown herself offended with
him.  This idea was sufficient to
console him; he had even a friendly and kindly smile for the young king, when
the latter wished him good night.  This,
however, was not all the king had to submit to; he was obliged to undergo the
usual ceremony, which on that evening was marked by close adherence to the
strictest etiquette.  The next day was
the one fixed for the departure; it was but proper that the guests should thank
their host, and show him a little attention in return for the expenditure of
his twelve millions.  The only remark,
approaching to amiability, which the king could find to say to M. Fouquet, as
he took leave of him, were in these words, &quot;M. Fouquet, you shall hear
from me.  Be good enough to desire M.
d'Artagnan to come here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                But the
blood of Louis XIV., who had so profoundly dissimulated his feelings, boiled in
his veins; and he was perfectly willing to order M. Fouquet to be put an end to
with the same readiness, indeed, as his predecessor had caused the
assassination of le Maréchal d'Ancre; and so he disguised the terrible
resolution he had formed beneath one of those royal smiles which, like
lightning-flashes, indicated <i>coups d'état</i>.  Fouquet took the king's hand and kissed it;
Louis shuddered throughout his whole frame, but allowed M. Fouquet to touch his
hand with his lips.  Five minutes
afterwards, D'Artagnan, to whom the royal order had been communicated, entered
Louis XIV.'s apartment.  Aramis and
Philippe were in theirs, still eagerly attentive, and still listening with all
their ears.  The king did not even give
the captain of the musketeers time to approach his armchair, but ran forward to
meet him.  &quot;Take care,&quot; he
exclaimed, &quot;that no one enters here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
good, sire,&quot; replied the captain, whose glance had for a long time past
analyzed the stormy indications on the royal countenance.  He gave the necessary order at the door;
but, returning to the king, he said, &quot;Is there something fresh the matter,
your majesty?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
many men have you here?&quot; inquired the king, without making any other reply
to the question addressed to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
for, sire?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
many men have you, I say?&quot; repeated the king, stamping upon the ground
with his foot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have the musketeers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well;
and what others?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Twenty
guards and thirteen Swiss.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
many men will be required to - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
do what, sire?&quot; replied the musketeer, opening his large, calm eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
arrest M. Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
fell back a step.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
arrest M. Fouquet!&quot; he burst forth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Are
you going to tell me that it is impossible?&quot; exclaimed the king, in tones
of cold, vindictive passion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
never say that anything is impossible,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, wounded to the
quick.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
well; do it, then.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
turned on his heel, and made his way towards the door; it was but a short
distance, and he cleared it in half a dozen paces; when he reached it he
suddenly paused, and said, &quot;Your majesty will forgive me, but, in order to
effect this arrest, I should like written directions.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;For
what purpose - and since when has the king's word been insufficient for
you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Because
the word of a king, when it springs from a feeling of anger, may possibly
change when the feeling changes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
truce to set phrases, monsieur; you have another thought besides that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
I, at least, have certain thoughts and ideas, which, unfortunately, others have
not,&quot; D'Artagnan replied, impertinently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
king, in the tempest of his wrath, hesitated, and drew back in the face of
D'Artagnan's frank courage, just as a horse crouches on his haunches under the
strong hand of a bold and experienced rider. 
&quot;What is your thought?&quot; he exclaimed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;This,
sire,&quot; replied D'Artagnan: &quot;you cause a man to be arrested when you
are still under his roof; and passion is alone the cause of that.  When your anger shall have passed, you will
regret what you have done; and then I wish to be in a position to show you your
signature.  If that, however, should
fail to be a reparation, it will at least show us that the king was wrong to
lose his temper.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Wrong
to lose his temper!&quot; cried the king, in a loud, passionate voice.  &quot;Did not my father, my grandfathers,
too, before me, lose their temper at times, in Heaven's name?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
king your father and the king your grandfather never lost their temper except
when under the protection of their own palace.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
king is master wherever he may be.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is a flattering, complimentary phrase which cannot proceed from any one but M.
Colbert; but it happens not to be the truth. 
The king is at home in every man's house when he has driven its owner
out of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
king bit his lips, but said nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Can
it be possible?&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;here is a man who is positively
ruining himself in order to please you, and you wish to have him arrested!  <i>Mordioux!</i>  Sire, if my name was Fouquet, and people
treated me in that manner, I would swallow at a single gulp all sorts of
fireworks and other things, and I would set fire to them, and send myself and
everybody else in blown-up atoms to the sky. 
But it is all the same; it is your wish, and it shall be done.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Go,&quot;
said the king; &quot;but have you men enough?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you suppose I am going to take a whole host to help me?  Arrest M. Fouquet! why, that is so easy that
a very child might do it!  It is like
drinking a glass of wormwood; one makes an ugly face, and that is all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
he defends himself?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He!
it is not at all likely.  Defend himself
when such extreme harshness as you are going to practice makes the man a very
martyr!  Nay, I am sure that if he has a
million of francs left, which I very much doubt, he would be willing enough to
give it in order to have such a termination as this.  But what does that matter? it shall be done at once.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Stay,&quot;
said the king; &quot;do not make his arrest a public affair.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
will be more difficult.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why
so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Because
nothing is easier than to go up to M. Fouquet in the midst of a thousand
enthusiastic guests who surround him, and say, 'In the king's name, I arrest
you.'  But to go up to him, to turn him
first one way and then another, to drive him up into one of the corners of the
chess-board, in such a way that he cannot escape; to take him away from his
guests, and keep him a prisoner for you, without one of them, alas! having
heard anything about it; that, indeed, is a genuine difficulty, the greatest of
all, in truth; and I hardly see how it is to be done.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
had better say it is impossible, and you will have finished much sooner.  Heaven help me, but I seem to be surrounded
by people who prevent me doing what I wish.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
do not prevent your doing anything. 
Have you indeed decided?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Take
care of M. Fouquet, until I shall have made up my mind by to-morrow
morning.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
shall be done, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
return, when I rise in the morning, for further orders; and now leave me to
myself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
do not even want M. Colbert, then?&quot; said the musketeer, firing his last
shot as he was leaving the room.  The
king started.  With his whole mind fixed
on the thought of revenge, he had forgotten the cause and substance of the
offense.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
no one,&quot; he said; &quot;no one here! 
Leave me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
quitted the room.  The king closed the
door with his own hands, and began to walk up and down his apartment at a
furious pace, like a wounded bull in an arena, trailing from his horn the
colored streamers and the iron darts. 
At last he began to take comfort in the expression of his violent
feelings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Miserable
wretch that he is! not only does he squander my finances, but with his
ill-gotten plunder he corrupts secretaries, friends, generals, artists, and all,
and tries to rob me of the one to whom I am most attached.  This is the reason that perfidious girl so
boldly took his part!  Gratitude! and
who can tell whether it was not a stronger feeling - love itself?&quot;  He gave himself up for a moment to the bitterest
reflections.  &quot;A satyr!&quot; he
thought, with that abhorrent hate with which young men regard those more
advanced in life, who still think of love. 
&quot;A man who has never found opposition or resistance in any one, who
lavishes his gold and jewels in every direction, and who retains his staff of
painters in order to take the portraits of his mistresses in the costume of
goddesses.&quot;  The king trembled with
passion as he continued, &quot;He pollutes and profanes everything that belongs
to me!  He destroys everything that is
mine.  He will be my death at last, I
know.  That man is too much for me; he
is my mortal enemy, but he shall forthwith fall!  I hate him - I hate him - I hate him!&quot; and as he pronounced
these words, he struck the arm of the chair in which he was sitting violently,
over and over again, and then rose like one in an epileptic fit.  &quot;To-morrow! to-morrow! oh, happy
day!&quot; he murmured, &quot;when the sun rises, no other rival shall that
brilliant king of space possess but me. 
That man shall fall so low that when people look at the abject ruin my
anger shall have wrought, they will be forced to confess at last and at least
that I am indeed greater than he.&quot; 
The king, who was incapable of mastering his emotions any longer,
knocked over with a blow of his fist a small table placed close to his bedside,
and in the very bitterness of anger, almost weeping, and half-suffocated, he
threw himself on his bed, dressed as he was, and bit the sheets in his
extremity of passion, trying to find repose of body at least there.  The bed creaked beneath his weight, and with
the exception of a few broken sounds, emerging, or, one might say, exploding,
from his overburdened chest, absolute silence soon reigned in the chamber of
Morpheus.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he
ungovernable fury which took possession of the king at the sight and at the
perusal of Fouquet's letter to La Vallière by degrees subsided into a feeling
of pain and extreme weariness.  Youth,
invigorated by health and lightness of spirits, requiring soon that what it
loses should be immediately restored - youth knows not those endless, sleepless
nights which enable us to realize the fable of the vulture unceasingly feeding
on Prometheus.  In cases where the man
of middle life, in his acquired strength of will and purpose, and the old, in
their state of natural exhaustion, find incessant augmentation of their bitter
sorrow, a young man, surprised by the sudden appearance of misfortune, weakens
himself in sighs, and groans, and tears, directly struggling with his grief,
and is thereby far sooner overthrown by the inflexible enemy with whom he is
engaged.  Once overthrown, his struggles
cease.  Louis could not hold out more
than a few minutes, at the end of which he had ceased to clench his hands, and
scorch in fancy with his looks the invisible objects of his hatred; he soon
ceased to attack with his violent imprecations not M. Fouquet alone, but even
La Vallière herself; from fury he subsided into despair, and from despair to
prostration.  After he had thrown himself
for a few minutes to and fro convulsively on his bed, his nerveless arms fell
quietly down; his head lay languidly on his pillow; his limbs, exhausted with
excessive emotion, still trembled occasionally, agitated by muscular
contractions; while from his breast faint and infrequent sighs still
issued.  Morpheus, the tutelary deity of
the apartment, towards whom Louis raised his eyes, wearied by his anger and
reconciled by his tears, showered down upon him the sleep-inducing poppies with
which his hands are ever filled; so presently the monarch closed his eyes and
fell asleep.  Then it seemed to him, as
it often happens in that first sleep, so light and gentle, which raises the
body above the couch, and the soul above the earth - it seemed to him, we say, as
if the god Morpheus, painted on the ceiling, looked at him with eyes resembling
human eyes; that something shone brightly, and moved to and fro in the dome
above the sleeper; that the crowd of terrible dreams which thronged together in
his brain, and which were interrupted for a moment, half revealed a human face,
with a hand resting against the mouth, and in an attitude of deep and absorbed
meditation.  And strange enough, too,
this man bore so wonderful a resemblance to the king himself, that Louis fancied
he was looking at his own face reflected in a mirror; with the exception,
however, that the face was saddened by a feeling of the profoundest pity.  Then it seemed to him as if the dome
gradually retired, escaping from his gaze, and that the figures and attributes
painted by Lebrun became darker and darker as the distance became more and more
remote.  A gentle, easy movement, as
regular as that by which a vessel plunges beneath the waves, had succeeded to
the immovableness of the bed.  Doubtless
the king was dreaming, and in this dream the crown of gold, which fastened the
curtains together, seemed to recede from his vision, just as the dome, to which
it remained suspended, had done, so that the winged genius which, with both its
hand, supported the crown, seemed, though vainly so, to call upon the king, who
was fast disappearing from it.  The bed
still sunk.  Louis, with his eyes open,
could not resist the deception of this cruel hallucination.  At last, as the light of the royal chamber
faded away into darkness and gloom, something cold, gloomy, and inexplicable in
its nature seemed to infect the air.  No
paintings, nor gold, nor velvet hangings, were visible any longer, nothing but
walls of a dull gray color, which the increasing gloom made darker every
moment.  And yet the bed still continued
to descend, and after a minute, which seemed in its duration almost an age to
the king, it reached a stratum of air, black and chill as death, and then it
stopped.  The king could no longer see
the light in his room, except as from the bottom of a well we can see the light
of day.  &quot;I am under the influence
of some atrocious dream,&quot; he thought. 
&quot;It is time to awaken from it. 
Come! let me wake.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Every
one has experienced the sensation the above remark conveys; there is hardly a
person who, in the midst of a nightmare whose influence is suffocating, has not
said to himself, by the help of that light which still burns in the brain when
every human light is extinguished, &quot;It is nothing but a dream, after all.&quot;  This was precisely what Louis XIV. said to
himself; but when he said, &quot;Come, come! wake up,&quot; he perceived that
not only was he already awake, but still more, that he had his eyes open
also.  And then he looked all round
him.  On his right hand and on his left
two armed men stood in stolid silence, each wrapped in a huge cloak, and the
face covered with a mask; one of them held a small lamp in his hand, whose
glimmering light revealed the saddest picture a king could look upon.  Louis could not help saying to himself that
his dream still lasted, and that all he had to do to cause it to disappear was
to move his arms or to say something aloud; he darted from his bed, and found
himself upon the damp, moist ground. 
Then, addressing himself to the man who held the lamp in his hand, he
said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is this, monsieur, and what is the meaning of this jest?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is no jest,&quot; replied in a deep voice the masked figure that held the
lantern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you belong to M. Fouquet?&quot; inquired the king, greatly astonished at his
situation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
matters very little to whom we belong,&quot; said the phantom; &quot;we are
your masters now, that is sufficient.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
king, more impatient than intimidated, turned to the other masked figure.  &quot;If this is a comedy,&quot; he said,
&quot;you will tell M. Fouquet that I find it unseemly and improper, and that I
command it should cease.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
second masked person to whom the king had addressed himself was a man of huge
stature and vast circumference.  He held
himself erect and motionless as any block of marble.  &quot;Well!&quot; added the king, stamping his foot, &quot;you do
not answer!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
do not answer you, my good monsieur,&quot; said the giant, in a stentorian
voice, &quot;because there is nothing to say.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;At
least, tell me what you want,&quot; exclaimed Louis, folding his arms with a
passionate gesture.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will know by and by,&quot; replied the man who held the lamp.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
the meantime tell me where I am.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Look.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Louis
looked all round him; but by the light of the lamp which the masked figure
raised for the purpose, he could perceive nothing but the damp walls which
glistened here and there with the slimy traces of the snail.  &quot;Oh - oh! - a dungeon,&quot; cried the
king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
a subterranean passage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Which
leads - ?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Will
you be good enough to follow us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
shall not stir from hence!&quot; cried the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
you are obstinate, my dear young friend,&quot; replied the taller of the two,
&quot;I will lift you up in my arms, and roll you up in your own cloak, and if
you should happen to be stifled, why - so much the worse for you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As he
said this, he disengaged from beneath his cloak a hand of which Milo of Crotona
would have envied him the possession, on the day when he had that unhappy idea
of rending his last oak.  The king
dreaded violence, for he could well believe that the two men into whose power
he had fallen had not gone so far with any idea of drawing back, and that they
would consequently be ready to proceed to extremities, if necessary.  He shook his head and said: &quot;It seems I
have fallen into the hands of a couple of assassins.  Move on, then.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Neither
of the men answered a word to this remark. 
The one who carried the lantern walked first, the king followed him,
while the second masked figure closed the procession.  In this manner they passed along a winding gallery of some
length, with as many staircases leading out of it as are to be found in the
mysterious and gloomy palaces of Ann Radcliffe's creation.  All these windings and turnings, during
which the king heard the sound of running water <i>over his head</i>, ended at last in a long corridor closed by an iron
door.  The figure with the lamp opened
the door with one of the keys he wore suspended at his girdle, where, during
the whole of the brief journey, the king had heard them rattle.  As soon as the door was opened and admitted
the air, Louis recognized the balmy odors that trees exhale in hot summer
nights.  He paused, hesitatingly, for a
moment or two; but the huge sentinel who followed him thrust him out of the
subterranean passage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Another
blow,&quot; said the king, turning towards the one who had just had the
audacity to touch his sovereign; &quot;what do you intend to do with the king
of France?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Try
to forget that word,&quot; replied the man with the lamp, in a tone which as
little admitted of a reply as one of the famous decrees of Minos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
deserve to be broken on the wheel for the words that you have just made use
of,&quot; said the giant, as he extinguished the lamp his companion handed to
him; &quot;but the king is too kind-hearted.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Louis,
at that threat, made so sudden a movement that it seemed as if he meditated
flight; but the giant's hand was in a moment placed on his shoulder, and fixed
him motionless where he stood. 
&quot;But tell me, at least, where we are going,&quot; said the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come,&quot;
replied the former of the two men, with a kind of respect in his manner, and
leading his prisoner towards a carriage which seemed to be in waiting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
carriage was completely concealed amid the trees.  Two horses, with their feet fettered, were fastened by a halter
to the lower branches of a large oak.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Get
in,&quot; said the same man, opening the carriage-door and letting down the
step.  The king obeyed, seated himself
at the back of the carriage, the padded door of which was shut and locked
immediately upon him and his guide.  As
for the giant, he cut the fastenings by which the horses were bound, harnessed
them himself, and mounted on the box of the carriage, which was
unoccupied.  The carriage set off
immediately at a quick trot, turned into the road to Paris, and in the forest
of Senart found a relay of horses fastened to the trees in the same manner the
first horses had been, and without a postilion.  The man on the box changed the horses, and continued to follow
the road towards Paris with the same rapidity, so that they entered the city
about three o'clock in the morning. 
They carriage proceeded along the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, and, after
having called out to the sentinel, &quot;By the king's order,&quot; the driver
conducted the horses into the circular inclosure of the Bastile, looking out
upon the courtyard, called La Cour du Gouvernement.  There the horses drew up, reeking with sweat, at the flight of
steps, and a sergeant of the guard ran forward.  &quot;Go and wake the governor,&quot; said the coachman in a
voice of thunder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                With
the exception of this voice, which might have been heard at the entrance of the
Faubourg Saint-Antoine, everything remained as calm in the carriage as in the
prison.  Ten minutes afterwards, M. de
Baisemeaux appeared in his dressing-gown on the threshold of the door.  &quot;What is the matter now?&quot; he
asked; &quot;and whom have you brought me there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The man
with the lantern opened the carriage-door, and said two or three words to the
one who acted as driver, who immediately got down from his seat, took up a short
musket which he kept under his feet, and placed its muzzle on his prisoner's
chest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
fire at once if he speaks!&quot; added aloud the man who alighted from the
carriage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
good,&quot; replied his companion, without another remark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                With
this recommendation, the person who had accompanied the king in the carriage
ascended the flight of steps, at the top of which the governor was awaiting
him.  &quot;Monsieur d'Herblay!&quot;
said the latter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Hush!&quot;
said Aramis.  &quot;Let us go into your
room.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Good
heavens! what brings you here at this hour?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
mistake, my dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux,&quot; Aramis replied, quietly.  &quot;It appears that you were quite right
the other day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
about?&quot; inquired the governor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;About
the order of release, my dear friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Tell
me what you mean, monsieur - no, monseigneur,&quot; said the governor, almost
suffocated by surprise and terror.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is a very simple affair: you remember, dear M. de Baisemeaux, that an order of
release was sent to you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
for Marchiali.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
good! we both thought that it was for Marchiali?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Certainly;
you will recollect, however, that I would not credit it, but that you compelled
me to believe it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!  Baisemeaux, my good fellow, what a word to
make use of! - strongly recommended, that was all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Strongly
recommended, yes; strongly recommended to give him up to you; and that you
carried him off with you in your carriage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
my dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux, it was a mistake; it was discovered at the
ministry, so that I now bring you an order from the king to set at liberty
Seldon, - that poor Seldon fellow, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Seldon!
are you sure this time?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
read it yourself,&quot; added Aramis, handing him the order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,&quot;
said Baisemeaux, &quot;this order is the very same that has already passed
through my hands.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Indeed?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is the very one I assured you I saw the other evening.  <i>Parbleu!</i>  I recognize it by the blot of ink.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
do not know whether it is that; but all I know is, that I bring it for
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
then, what about the other?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
other?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Marchiali.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have got him here with me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
that is not enough for me.  I require a
new order to take him back again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Don't
talk such nonsense, my dear Baisemeaux; you talk like a child!  Where is the order you received respecting Marchiali?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Baisemeaux
ran to his iron chest and took it out. 
Aramis seized hold of it, coolly tore it in four pieces, held them to
the lamp, and burnt them.  &quot;Good
heavens! what are you doing?&quot; exclaimed Baisemeaux, in an extremity of
terror.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Look
at your position quietly, my good governor,&quot; said Aramis, with
imperturbable self-possession, &quot;and you will see how very simple the whole
affair is.  You no longer possess any
order justifying Marchiali's release.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am a lost man!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Far
from it, my good fellow, since I have brought Marchiali back to you, and all
accordingly is just the same as if he had never left.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
said the governor, completely overcome by terror.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Plain
enough, you see; and you will go and shut him up immediately.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
should think so, indeed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
you will hand over this Seldon to me, whose liberation is authorized by this
order.  Do you understand?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
- I - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
do understand, I see,&quot; said Aramis. 
&quot;Very good.&quot; 
Baisemeaux clapped his hands together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
why, at all events, after having taken Marchiali away from me, do you bring him
back again?&quot; cried the unhappy governor, in a paroxysm of terror, and
completely dumbfounded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;For
a friend such as you are,&quot; said Aramis - &quot;for so devoted a servant, I
have no secrets;&quot; and he put his mouth close to Baisemeaux's ear, as he
said, in a low tone of voice, &quot;you know the resemblance between that
unfortunate fellow, and - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
the king? - yes!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
good; the first use that Marchiali made of his liberty was to persist - Can you
guess what?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
is it likely I should guess?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
persist in saying that he was king of France; to dress himself up in clothes
like those of the king; and then pretend to assume that he was the king
himself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Gracious
heavens!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is the reason why I have brought him back again, my dear friend.  He is mad and lets every one see how mad he
is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is to be done, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is very simple; let no one hold any communication with him.  You understand that when his peculiar style
of madness came to the king's ears, the king, who had pitied his terrible
affliction, and saw that all his kindness had been repaid by black ingratitude,
became perfectly furious; so that, now - and remember this very distinctly,
dear Monsieur de Baisemeaux, for it concerns you most closely - so that there
is now, I repeat, sentence of death pronounced against all those who may allow
him to communicate with any one else but me or the king himself.  You understand, Baisemeaux, sentence of
death!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
need not ask me whether I understand.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
now, let us go down, and conduct this poor devil back to his dungeon again,
unless you prefer he should come up here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
would be the good of that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
would be better, perhaps, to enter his name in the prison-book at once!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Of
course, certainly; not a doubt of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
that case, have him up.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Baisemeaux
ordered the drums to be beaten and the bell to be rung, as a warning to every
one to retire, in order to avoid meeting a prisoner, about whom it was desired
to observe a certain mystery.  Then,
when the passages were free, he went to take the prisoner from the carriage, at
whose breast Porthos, faithful to the directions which had been given him,
still kept his musket leveled. 
&quot;Ah! is that you, miserable wretch?&quot; cried the governor, as
soon as he perceived the king. 
&quot;Very good, very good.&quot; 
And immediately, making the king get out of the carriage, he led him,
still accompanied by Porthos, who had not taken off his mask, and Aramis, who
again resumed his, up the stairs, to the second Bertaudière, and opened the
door of the room in which Philippe for six long years had bemoaned his
existence.  The king entered the cell
without pronouncing a single word: he faltered in as limp and haggard as a
rain-struck lily.  Baisemeaux shut the
door upon him, turned the key twice in the lock, and then returned to
Aramis.  &quot;It is quite true,&quot;
he said, in a low tone, &quot;that he bears a striking resemblance to the king;
but less so than you said.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;So
that,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;you would not have been deceived by the
substitution of the one for the other?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
a question!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are a most valuable fellow, Baisemeaux,&quot; said Aramis; &quot;and now, set
Seldon free.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
yes.  I was going to forget that.  I will go and give orders at once.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bah!
to-morrow will be time enough.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To-morrow!
- oh, no.  This very minute.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well;
go off to your affairs, I will go away to mine.  But it is quite understood, is it not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
'is quite understood'?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
no one is to enter the prisoner's cell, expect with an order from the king; an
order which I will myself bring.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Quite
so.  Adieu, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
returned to his companion.  &quot;Now,
Porthos, my good fellow, back again to Vaux, and as fast as possible.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
man is light and easy enough, when he has faithfully served his king; and, in
serving him, saved his country,&quot; said Porthos.  &quot;The horses will be as light as if our tissues were
constructed of the wind of heaven.  So
let us be off.&quot;  And the carriage,
lightened of a prisoner, who might well be - as he in fact was - very heavy in
the sight of Aramis, passed across the drawbridge of the Bastile, which was
raised again immediately behind it.</p>

anguish, and suffering in human life are always in proportion to the strength
with which a man is endowed.  We will
not pretend to say that Heaven always apportions to a man's capability of
endurance the anguish with which he afflicts him; for that, indeed, would not be
true, since Heaven permits the existence of death, which is, sometimes, the
only refuge open to those who are too closely pressed - too bitterly afflicted,
as far as the body is concerned. 
Suffering is in proportion to the strength which has been accorded; in
other words, the weak suffer more, where the trial is the same, than the
strong.  And what are the elementary
principles, we may ask, that compose human strength?  Is it not - more than anything else - exercise, habit,
experience?  We shall not even take the
trouble to demonstrate this, for it is an axiom in morals, as in physics.  When the young king, stupefied and crushed
in every sense and feeling, found himself led to a cell in the Bastile, he
fancied death itself is but a sleep; that it, too, has its dreams as well; that
the bed had broken through the flooring of his room at Vaux; that death had
resulted from the occurrence; and that, still carrying out his dream, the king,
Louis XIV., now no longer living, was dreaming one of those horrors, impossible
to realize in life, which is termed dethronement, imprisonment, and insult
towards a sovereign who formerly wielded unlimited power.  To be present at - an actual witness, too -
of this bitterness of death; to float, indecisively, in an incomprehensible
mystery, between resemblance and reality; to hear everything, to see
everything, without interfering in a single detail of agonizing suffering, was
- so the king thought within himself - a torture far more terrible, since it
might last forever.  &quot;Is this what
is termed eternity - hell?&quot; he murmured, at the moment the door was closed
upon him, which we remember Baisemeaux had shut with his own hands.  He did not even look round him; and in the
room, leaning with his back against the wall, he allowed himself to be carried
away by the terrible supposition that he was already dead, as he closed his
eyes, in order to avoid looking upon something even worse still.  &quot;How can I have died?&quot; he said to
himself, sick with terror.  &quot;The
bed might have been let down by some artificial means?  But no! 
I do not remember to have felt a bruise, nor any shock either.  Would they not rather have poisoned me at my
meals, or with the fumes of wax, as they did my ancestress, Jeanne
d'Albret?&quot;  Suddenly, the chill of
the dungeons seemed to fall like a wet cloak upon Louis's shoulders.  &quot;I have seen,&quot; he said, &quot;my
father lying dead upon his funeral couch, in his regal robes.  That pale face, so calm and worn; those
hands, once so skillful, lying nerveless by his side; those limbs stiffened by
the icy grasp of death; nothing there betokened a sleep that was disturbed by
dreams.  And yet, how numerous were the
dreams which Heaven might have sent that royal corpse - him whom so many others
had preceded, hurried away by him into eternal death!  No, that king was still the king: he was enthroned still upon
that funeral couch, as upon a velvet armchair; he had not abdicated one title
of his majesty.  God, who had not
punished him, cannot, will not punish me, who have done nothing.&quot;  A strange sound attracted the young man's
attention.  He looked round him, and saw
on the mantel-shelf, just below an enormous crucifix, coarsely painted in
fresco on the wall, a rat of enormous size engaged in nibbling a piece of dry
bread, but fixing all the time, an intelligent and inquiring look upon the new
occupant of the cell.  The king could
not resist a sudden impulse of fear and disgust: he moved back towards the
door, uttering a loud cry; and as if he but needed this cry, which escaped from
his breast almost unconsciously, to recognize himself, Louis knew that he was
alive and in full possession of his natural senses.  &quot;A prisoner!&quot; he cried.  &quot;I - I, a prisoner!&quot; 
He looked round him for a bell to summon some one to him.  &quot;There are no bells in the
Bastile,&quot; he said, &quot;and it is in the Bastile I am imprisoned.  In what way can I have been made a
prisoner?  It must have been owing to a
conspiracy of M. Fouquet.  I have been
drawn to Vaux, as to a snare.  M.
Fouquet cannot be acting alone in this affair. 
His agent - That voice that I but just now heard was M. d'Herblay's; I
recognized it.  Colbert was right,
then.  But what is Fouquet's
object?  To reign in my place and stead?
- Impossible.  Yet who knows!&quot;
thought the king, relapsing into gloom again. 
&quot;Perhaps my brother, the Duc d'Orléans, is doing that which my
uncle wished to do during the whole of his life against my father.  But the queen? - My mother, too?  And La Vallière?  Oh!  La Vallière, she will
have been abandoned to Madame.  Dear,
dear girl!  Yes, it is - it must be
so.  They have shut her up as they have
me.  We are separated forever!&quot;  And at this idea of separation the poor
lover burst into a flood of tears and sobs and groans.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
is a governor in this place,&quot; the king continued, in a fury of passion;
&quot;I will speak to him, I will summon him to me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He
called - no voice replied to his.  He
seized hold of his chair, and hurled it against the massive oaken door.  The wood resounded against the door, and
awakened many a mournful echo in the profound depths of the staircase; but from
a human creature, none.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This
was a fresh proof for the king of the slight regard in which he was held at the
Bastile.  Therefore, when his first fit
of anger had passed away, having remarked a barred window through which there
passed a stream of light, lozenge-shaped, which must be, he knew, the bright
orb of approaching day, Louis began to call out, at first gently enough, then
louder and louder still; but no one replied. 
Twenty other attempts which he made, one after another, obtained no
other or better success.  His blood
began to boil within him, and mount to his head.  His nature was such, that, accustomed to command, he trembled at
the idea of disobedience.  The prisoner
broke the chair, which was too heavy for him to lift, and made use of it as a
battering ram to strike against the door. 
He struck so loudly, and so repeatedly, that the perspiration soon began
to pour down his face.  The sound became
tremendous and continuous; certain stifled, smothered cries replied in
different directions.  This sound
produced a strange effect upon the king. 
He paused to listen; it was the voice of the prisoners, formerly his
victims, now his companions.  The voices
ascended like vapors through the thick ceilings and the massive walls, and rose
in accusations against the author of this noise, as doubtless their sighs and
tears accused, in whispered tones, the author of their captivity.  After having deprived so many people of their
liberty, the king came among them to rob them of their rest.  This idea almost drove him mad; it redoubled
his strength, or rather his well, bent upon obtaining some information, or a
conclusion to the affair.  With a
portion of the broken chair he recommenced the noise.  At the end of an hour, Louis heard something in the corridor,
behind the door of his cell, and a violent blow, which was returned upon the
door itself, made him cease his own.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Are
you mad?&quot; said a rude, brutal voice. 
&quot;What is the matter with you this morning?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;This
morning!&quot; thought the king; but he said aloud, politely, &quot;Monsieur,
are you the governor of the Bastile?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
good fellow, your head is out of sorts,&quot; replied the voice; &quot;but that
is no reason why you should make such a terrible disturbance.  Be quiet; <i>mordioux!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Are
you the governor?&quot; the king inquired again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He
heard a door on the corridor close; the jailer had just left, not condescending
to reply a single word.  When the king
had assured himself of his departure, his fury knew no longer any bounds.  As agile as a tiger, he leaped from the
table to the window, and struck the iron bars with all his might.  He broke a pane of glass, the pieces of
which fell clanking into the courtyard below. 
He shouted with increasing hoarseness, &quot;The governor, the governor!&quot;  This excess lasted fully an hour, during
which time he was in a burning fever. 
With his hair in disorder and matted on his forehead, his dress torn and
covered with dust and plaster, his linen in shreds, the king never rested until
his strength was utterly exhausted, and it was not until then that he clearly
understood the pitiless thickness of the walls, the impenetrable nature of the
cement, invincible to every influence but that of time, and that he possessed
no other weapon but despair.  He leaned
his forehead against the door, and let the feverish throbbings of his heart
calm by degrees; it had seemed as if one single additional pulsation would have
made it burst.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
moment will come when the food which is given to the prisoners will be brought to
me.  I shall then see some one, I shall
speak to him, and get an answer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And the
king tried to remember at what hour the first repast of the prisoners was
served at the Bastile; he was ignorant even of this detail.  The feeling of remorse at this remembrance
smote him like the thrust of a dagger, that he should have lived for five and
twenty years a king, and in the enjoyment of every happiness, without having
bestowed a moment's thought on the misery of those who had been unjustly
deprived of their liberty.  The king
blushed for very shame.  He felt that
Heaven, in permitting this fearful humiliation, did no more than render to the
man the same torture as had been inflicted by that man upon so many
others.  Nothing could be more
efficacious for reawakening his mind to religious influences than the
prostration of his heart and mind and soul beneath the feeling of such acute
wretchedness.  But Louis dared not even
kneel in prayer to God to entreat him to terminate his bitter trial.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Heaven
is right,&quot; he said; &quot;Heaven acts wisely.  It would be cowardly to pray to Heaven for that which I have so
often refused my own fellow-creatures.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He had
reached this stage of his reflections, that is, of his agony of mind, when a
similar noise was again heard behind his door, followed this time by the sound
of the key in the lock, and of the bolts being withdrawn from their
staples.  The king bounded forward to be
nearer to the person who was about to enter, but, suddenly reflecting that it
was a movement unworthy of a sovereign, he paused, assumed a noble and calm
expression, which for him was easy enough, and waited with his back turned
towards the window, in order, to some extent, to conceal his agitation from the
eyes of the person who was about to enter. 
It was only a jailer with a basket of provisions.  The king looked at the man with restless
anxiety, and waited until he spoke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
said the latter, &quot;you have broken your chair.  I said you had done so! 
Why, you have gone quite mad.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
said the king, &quot;be careful what you say; it will be a very serious affair
for you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
jailer placed the basket on the table, and looked at his prisoner
steadily.  &quot;What do you say?&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Desire
the governor to come to me,&quot; added the king, in accents full of calm and
dignity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come,
my boy,&quot; said the turnkey, &quot;you have always been very quiet and
reasonable, but you are getting vicious, it seems, and I wish you to know it in
time.  You have broken your chair, and
made a great disturbance; that is an offense punishable by imprisonment in one
of the lower dungeons.  Promise me not
to begin over again, and I will not say a word about it to the governor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
wish to see the governor,&quot; replied the king, still governing his passions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
will send you off to one of the dungeons, I tell you; so take care.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
insist upon it, do you hear?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
ah! your eyes are becoming wild again. 
Very good!  I shall take away
your knife.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And the
jailer did what he said, quitted the prisoner, and closed the door, leaving the
king more astounded, more wretched, more isolated than ever.  It was useless, though he tried it, to make
the same noise again on his door, and equally useless that he threw the plates
and dishes out of the window; not a single sound was heard in recognition.  Two hours afterwards he could not be
recognized as a king, a gentleman, a man, a human being; he might rather be
called a madman, tearing the door with his nails, trying to tear up the
flooring of his cell, and uttering such wild and fearful cries that the old
Bastile seemed to tremble to its very foundations for having revolted against
its master.  As for the governor, the
jailer did not even think of disturbing him; the turnkeys and the sentinels had
reported the occurrence to him, but what was the good of it?  Were not these madmen common enough in such
a prison? and were not the walls still stronger?  M. de Baisemeaux, thoroughly impressed with what Aramis had told
him, and in perfect conformity with the king's order, hoped only that one thing
might happen; namely, that the madman Marchiali might be mad enough to hang
himself to the canopy of his bed, or to one of the bars of the window.  In fact, the prisoner was anything but a
profitable investment for M. Baisemeaux, and became more annoying than
agreeable to him.  These complications
of Seldon and Marchiali - the complications first of setting at liberty and
then imprisoning again, the complications arising from the strong likeness in
question - had at last found a very proper <i>dénouement</i>.  Baisemeaux even thought he had remarked that
D'Herblay himself was not altogether dissatisfied with the result.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
then, really,&quot; said Baisemeaux to his next in command, &quot;an ordinary
prisoner is already unhappy enough in being a prisoner; he suffers quite
enough, indeed, to induce one to hope, charitably enough, that his death may
not be far distant.  With still greater
reason, accordingly, when the prisoner has gone mad, and might bite and make a
terrible disturbance in the Bastile; why, in such a case, it is not simply an
act of mere charity to wish him dead; it would be almost a good and even
commendable action, quietly to have him put out of his misery.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And the
good-natured governor thereupon sat down to his late breakfast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>D</span>'Artagnan,
still confused and oppressed by the conversation he had just had with the king,
could not resist asking himself if he were really in possession of his senses,
if he were really and truly at Vaux; if he, D'Artagnan, were really the captain
of the musketeers, and M. Fouquet the owner of the château in which Louis XIV.
was at that moment partaking of his hospitality.  These reflections were not those of a drunken man, although
everything was in prodigal profusion at Vaux, and the surintendant's wines had
met with a distinguished reception at the <i>fête</i>.  The Gascon, however, was a man of calm
self-possession; and no sooner did he touch his bright steel blade, than he
knew how to adopt morally the cold, keen weapon as his guide of action.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,&quot;
he said, as he quitted the royal apartment, &quot;I seem now to be mixed up
historically with the destinies of the king and of the minister; it will be
written, that M. d'Artagnan, a younger son of a Gascon family, placed his hand
on the shoulder of M. Nicolas Fouquet, the surintendant of the finances of
France.  My descendants, if I have any,
will flatter themselves with the distinction which this arrest will confer,
just as the members of the De Luynes family have done with regard to the
estates of the poor Maréchal d'Ancre. 
But the thing is, how best to execute the king's directions in a proper
manner.  Any man would know how to say
to M. Fouquet, 'Your sword, monsieur.' 
But it is not every one who would be able to take care of M. Fouquet
without others knowing anything about it. 
How am I to manage, then, so that M. le surintendant pass from the
height of favor to the direst disgrace; that Vaux be turned into a dungeon for
him; that after having been steeped to his lips, as it were, in all the
perfumes and incense of Ahasuerus, he is transferred to the gallows of Haman;
in other words, of Enguerrand de Marigny?&quot;  And at this reflection, D'Artagnan's brow became clouded with perplexity.  The musketeer had certain scruples on the
matter, it must be admitted.  To deliver
up to death (for not a doubt existed that Louis hated Fouquet mortally) the man
who had just shown himself so delightful and charming a host in every way, was
a real insult to one's conscience. 
&quot;It almost seems,&quot; said D'Artagnan to himself, &quot;that if I
am not a poor, mean, miserable fellow, I should let M. Fouquet know the opinion
the king has about him.  Yet, if I
betray my master's secret, I shall be a false-hearted, treacherous knave, a
traitor, too, a crime provided for and punishable by military laws - so much
so, indeed, that twenty times, in former days when wars were rife, I have seen
many a miserable fellow strung up to a tree for doing, in but a small degree,
what my scruples counsel me to undertake upon a great scale now.  No, I think that a man of true readiness of
wit ought to get out of this difficulty with more skill than that.  And now, let us admit that I do possess a
little readiness of invention; it is not at all certain, though, for, after having
for forty years absorbed so large a quantity, I shall be lucky if there were to
be a pistole's-worth left.&quot; 
D'Artagnan buried his head in his hands, tore at his mustache in sheer
vexation, and added, &quot;What can be the reason of M. Fouquet's disgrace?  There seem to be three good ones: the first,
because M. Colbert doesn't like him; the second, because he wished to fall in
love with Mademoiselle de la Vallière; and lastly, because the king likes M.
Colbert and loves Mademoiselle de la Vallière. 
Oh! he is lost!  But shall I put
my foot on his neck, I, of all men, when he is falling a prey to the intrigues
of a pack of women and clerks?  For
shame!  If he be dangerous, I will lay
him low enough; if, however, he be only persecuted, I will look on.  I have come to such a decisive
determination, that neither king nor living man shall change my mind.  If Athos were here, he would do as I have
done.  Therefore, instead of going, in cold
blood, up to M. Fouquet, and arresting him off-hand and shutting him up altogether,
I will try and conduct myself like a man who understands what good manners
are.  People will talk about it, of
course; but they shall talk well of it, I am determined.&quot;  And D'Artagnan, drawing by a gesture
peculiar to himself his shoulder-belt over his shoulder, went straight off to
M. Fouquet, who, after he had taken leave of his guests, was preparing to
retire for the night and to sleep tranquilly after the triumphs of the
day.  The air was still perfumed, or
infected, whichever way it may be considered, with the odors of the torches and
the fireworks.  The wax-lights were
dying away in their sockets, the flowers fell unfastened from the garlands, the
groups of dancers and courtiers were separating in the salons.  Surrounded by his friends, who complimented
him and received his flattering remarks in return, the surintendant half-closed
his wearied eyes.  He longed for rest
and quiet; he sank upon the bed of laurels which had been heaped up for him for
so many days past; it might almost have been said that he seemed bowed beneath
the weight of the new debts which he had incurred for the purpose of giving the
greatest possible honor to this <i>fête</i>.  Fouquet had just retired to his room, still
smiling, but more than half-asleep.  He
could listen to nothing more, he could hardly keep his eyes open; his bed
seemed to possess a fascinating and irresistible attraction for him.  The god Morpheus, the presiding deity of the
dome painted by Lebrun, had extended his influence over the adjoining rooms,
and showered down his most sleep-inducing poppies upon the master of the
house.  Fouquet, almost entirely alone,
was being assisted by his <i>valet de
chambre</i> to undress, when M. d'Artagnan appeared at the entrance of the
room.  D'Artagnan had never been able to
succeed in making himself common at the court; and notwithstanding he was seen
everywhere and on all occasions, he never failed to produce an effect wherever
and whenever he made his appearance. 
Such is the happy privilege of certain natures, which in that respect
resemble either thunder or lightning; every one recognizes them; but their
appearance never fails to arouse surprise and astonishment, and whenever they
occur, the impression is always left that the last was the most conspicuous or
most important.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!  M. d'Artagnan?&quot; said Fouquet, who had
already taken his right arm out of the sleeve of his doublet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;At
your service,&quot; replied the musketeer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come
in, my dear M. d'Artagnan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Thank
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Have
you come to criticise the <i>fête?</i>  You are ingenious enough in your criticisms,
I know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;By
no means.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Are
not your men looked after properly?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
every way.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are not comfortably lodged, perhaps?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nothing
could be better.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
that case, I have to thank you for being so amiably disposed, and I must not
fail to express my obligations to you for all your flattering kindness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                These
words were as much as to say, &quot;My dear D'Artagnan, pray go to bed, since
you have a bed to lie down on, and let me do the same.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
did not seem to understand it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Are
you going to bed already?&quot; he said to the superintendent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
have you anything to say to me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nothing,
monsieur, nothing at all.  You sleep in

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
as you see.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have given a most charming <i>fête</i> to

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is

would not choose so unworthy a messenger, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
do not do yourself justice, Monsieur d'Artagnan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is
that your bed, there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
but why do you ask?  Are you not
satisfied with your own?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
I speak frankly to you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Most
assuredly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
then, I am not.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
started; and then replied, &quot;Will you take my room, Monsieur
d'Artagnan?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!
deprive you of it, monseigneur? never!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
am I to do, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Allow
me to share yours with you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
looked at the musketeer fixedly. 
&quot;Ah! ah!&quot; he said, &quot;you have just left the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
the king wishes you to pass the night in my room?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur
- &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
well, Monsieur d'Artagnan, very well. 
You are the master here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
assure you, monseigneur, that I do not wish to abuse - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
turned to his valet, and said, &quot;Leave us.&quot;  When the man had left, he said to D'Artagnan, &quot;You have
something to say to me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
man of your superior intelligence cannot have come to talk with a man like
myself, at such an hour as the present, without grave motives.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
not interrogate me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;On
the contrary.  What do you want with
me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nothing
more than the pleasure of your society.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come
into the garden, then,&quot; said the superintendent suddenly, &quot;or into
the park.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,&quot;
replied the musketeer, hastily, &quot;no.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
fresh air - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come,
admit at once that you arrest me,&quot; said the superintendent to the captain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Never!&quot;
said the latter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
intend to look after me, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur, I do, upon my honor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Upon
your honor - ah! that is quite another thing! 
So I am to be arrested in my own house.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
not say such a thing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;On
the contrary, I will proclaim it aloud.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
you do so, I shall be compelled to request you to be silent.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
good!  Violence towards me, and in my
own house, too.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
do not seem to understand one another at all. 
Stay a moment; there is a chess-board there; we will have a game, if you
have no objections.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
d'Artagnan, I am in disgrace, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Not
at all; but - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am prohibited, I suppose, from withdrawing from your sight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
do not understand a word you are saying, monseigneur; and if you wish me to
withdraw, tell me so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
dear Monsieur d'Artagnan, your mode of action is enough to drive me mad; I was
almost sinking for want of sleep, but you have completely awakened me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
shall never forgive myself, I am sure; and if you wish to reconcile me with
myself, why, go to sleep in your bed in my presence; and I shall be
delighted.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am under surveillance, I see.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will leave the room if you say any such thing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are beyond my comprehension.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Good
night, monseigneur,&quot; said D'Artagnan, as he pretended to withdraw.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
ran after him.  &quot;I will not lie
down,&quot; he said.  &quot;Seriously,
and since you refuse to treat me as a man, and since you finesse with me, I
will try and set you at bay, as a hunter does a wild boar.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bah!&quot;
cried D'Artagnan, pretending to smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
shall order my horses, and set off for Paris,&quot; said Fouquet, sounding the
captain of the musketeers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
that be the case, monseigneur, it is very difficult.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will arrest me, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
but I shall go along with you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is quite sufficient, Monsieur d'Artagnan,&quot; returned Fouquet, coldly.  &quot;It was not for nothing you acquired
your reputation as a man of intelligence and resource; but with me all this is
quite superfluous.  Let us come to the
point.  Do me a service.  Why do you arrest me?  What have I done?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!  I know nothing about what you may have done;
but I do not arrest you - this evening, at least!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;This
evening!&quot; said Fouquet, turning pale, &quot;but to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is not to-morrow just yet, monseigneur. 
Who can ever answer for the morrow?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Quick,
quick, captain! let me speak to M. d'Herblay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Alas!
that is quite impossible, monseigneur. 
I have strict orders to see that you hold no communication with any
one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;With
M. d'Herblay, captain - with your friend!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur,
is M. d'Herblay the only person with whom you ought to be prevented holding any
communication?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
colored, and then assuming an air of resignation, he said: &quot;You are right,
monsieur; you have taught me a lesson I ought not to have evoked.  A fallen man cannot assert his right to
anything, even from those whose fortunes he may have made; for a still stronger
reason, he cannot claim anything from those to whom he may never have had the
happiness of doing a service.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is perfectly true, Monsieur d'Artagnan; you have always acted in the most
admirable manner towards me - in such a manner, indeed, as most becomes the man
who is destined to arrest me.  You, at
least, have never asked me anything.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
replied the Gascon, touched by his eloquent and noble tone of grief, &quot;will
you - I ask it as a favor - pledge me your word as a man of honor that you will
not leave this room?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is the use of it, dear Monsieur d'Artagnan, since you keep watch and ward over
me?  Do you suppose I should contend
against the most valiant sword in the kingdom?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is not that, at all, monseigneur; but that I am going to look for M. d'Herblay,
and, consequently, to leave you alone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
uttered a cry of delight and surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
look for M. d'Herblay! to leave me alone!&quot; he exclaimed, clasping his
hands together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Which
is M. d'Herblay's room?  The blue room
is it not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
my friend, yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
friend! thank you for that word, monseigneur; you confer it upon me to-day, at
least, if you have never done so before.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
you have saved me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
will take a good ten minutes to go from hence to the blue room, and to
return?&quot; said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nearly
so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
then to wake Aramis, who sleeps very soundly, when he <i>is </i>asleep, I put that down at another five minutes; making a total
of fifteen minutes' absence.  And now,
monseigneur, give me your word that you will not in any way attempt to make
your escape, and that when I return I shall find you here again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
give it, monsieur,&quot; replied Fouquet, with an expression of the warmest and
deepest gratitude.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
disappeared.  Fouquet looked at him as
he quitted the room, waited with a feverish impatience until the door was
closed behind him, and as soon as it was shut, flew to his keys, opened two or
three secret doors concealed in various articles of furniture in the room,
looked vainly for certain papers, which doubtless he had left at Saint-Mandé,
and which he seemed to regret not having found in them; then hurriedly seizing
hold of letters, contracts, papers, writings, he heaped them up into a pile,
which he burnt in the extremest haste upon the marble hearth of the fireplace,
not even taking time to draw from the interior of it the vases and pots of
flowers with which it was filled.  As
soon as he had finished, like a man who has just escaped an imminent danger,
and whose strength abandons him as soon as the danger is past, he sank down, completely
overcome, on a couch.  When D'Artagnan
returned, he found Fouquet in the same position; the worthy musketeer had not
the slightest doubt that Fouquet, having given his word, would not even think
of failing to keep it, but he had thought it most likely that Fouquet would
turn his (D'Artagnan's) absence to the best advantage in getting rid of all the
papers, memorandums, and contracts, which might possibly render his position,
which was even now serious enough, more dangerous than ever.  And so, lifting up his head like a dog who
has regained the scent, he perceived an odor resembling smoke he had relied on
finding in the atmosphere, and having found it, made a movement of his head in
token of satisfaction.  As D'Artagnan
entered, Fouquet, on his side, raised his head, and not one of D'Artagnan's
movements escaped him.  And then the
looks of the two men met, and they both saw that they had understood each other
without exchanging a syllable.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!&quot;
asked Fouquet, the first to speak, &quot;and M. d'Herblay?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Upon
my word, monseigneur,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, &quot;M. d'Herblay must be
desperately fond of walking out at night, and composing verses by moonlight in
the park of Vaux, with some of your poets, in all probability, for he is not in
his own room.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!
not in his own room?&quot; cried Fouquet, whose last hope thus escaped him; for
unless he could ascertain in what way the bishop of Vannes could assist him, he
perfectly well knew that he could expect assistance from no other quarter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Or,
indeed,&quot; continued D'Artagnan, &quot;if he is in his own room, he has very
good reasons for not answering.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;But surely you did not call
him in such a manner that he could have heard you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
can hardly suppose, monseigneur, that having already exceeded my orders, which
forbade me leaving you a single moment - you can hardly suppose, I say, that I
should have been mad enough to rouse the whole house and allow myself to be
seen in the corridor of the bishop of Vannes, in order that M. Colbert might
state with positive certainty that I gave you time to burn your papers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;My papers?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Of
course; at least that is what I should have done in your place.  When any one opens a door for me I always
avail myself of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Yes, yes, and I thank you,
for I have availed myself of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
you have done perfectly right.  Every man
has his own peculiar secrets with which others have nothing to do.  But let us return to Aramis,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Well, then, I tell you, you
could not have called loud enough, or Aramis would have heard you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;However
softly any one may call Aramis, monseigneur, Aramis always hears when he has an
interest in hearing.  I repeat what I
said before - Aramis was not in his own room, or Aramis had certain reasons for
not recognizing my voice, of which I am ignorant, and of which you may be even
ignorant yourself, notwithstanding your liege-man is His Greatness the Lord
Bishop of Vannes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
drew a deep sigh, rose from his seat, took three or four turns in his room, and
finished by seating himself, with an expression of extreme dejection, upon his
magnificent bed with velvet hangings, and costliest lace.  D'Artagnan looked at Fouquet with feelings
of the deepest and sincerest pity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have seen a good many men arrested in my life,&quot; said the musketeer, sadly;
&quot;I have seen both M. de Cinq-Mars and M. de Chalais arrested, though I was
very young then.  I have seen M. de
Condé arrested with the princes; I have seen M. de Retz arrested; I have seen
M. Broussel arrested.  Stay a moment,
monseigneur, it is disagreeable to have to say, but the very one of all those
whom you most resemble at this moment was that poor fellow Broussel.  You were very near doing as he did, putting
your dinner napkin in your portfolio, and wiping your mouth with your papers.  <i>Mordioux!</i>  Monseigneur Fouquet, a man like you ought
not to be dejected in this manner. 
Suppose your friends saw you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
d'Artagnan,&quot; returned the surintendant, with a smile full of gentleness,
&quot;you do not understand me; it is precisely because my friends are not
looking on, that I am as you see me now. 
I do not live, exist even, isolated from others; I am nothing when left
to myself.  Understand that throughout
my whole life I have passed every moment of my time in making friends, whom I
hoped to render my stay and support.  In
times of prosperity, all these cheerful, happy voices - rendered so through and
by my means - formed in my honor a concert of praise and kindly actions.  In the least disfavor, these humbler voices
accompanied in harmonious accents the murmur of my own heart.  Isolation I have never yet known.  Poverty (a phantom I have sometimes beheld,
clad in rags, awaiting me at the end of my journey through life) - poverty has
been the specter with which many of my own friends have trifled for years past,
which they poetize and caress, and which has attracted me towards them.  Poverty! 
I accept it, acknowledge it, receive it, as a disinherited sister; for
poverty is neither solitude, nor exile, nor imprisonment.  Is it likely I shall ever be poor, with such
friends as Pélisson, as La Fontaine, as Molière? with such a mistress as - Oh!
if you knew how utterly lonely and desolate I feel at this moment, and how you,
who separate me from all I love, seem to resemble the image of solitude, of
annihilation - death itself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
I have already told you, Monsieur Fouquet,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, moved to
the depths of his soul, &quot;that you are woefully exaggerating.  The king likes you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;No, no,&quot; said Fouquet,
shaking his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;M. Colbert hates you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;M. Colbert!  What does that matter to me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;He will ruin you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Ah!  I defy him to do that, for I am ruined already.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At this
singular confession of the superintendent, D'Artagnan cast his glance all round
the room; and although he did not open his lips, Fouquet understood him so
thoroughly, that he added: &quot;What can be done with such wealth of substance
as surrounds us, when a man can no longer cultivate his taste for the
magnificent?  Do you know what good the
greater part of the wealth and the possessions which we rich enjoy, confer upon
us? merely to disgust us, by their very splendor even, with everything which
does not equal it!  Vaux! you will say,
and the wonders of Vaux!  What of
it?  What boot these wonders?  If I am ruined, how shall I fill with water
the urns which my Naiads bear in their arms, or force the air into the lungs of
my Tritons?  To be rich enough, Monsieur
d'Artagnan, a man must be too rich.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>D'Artagnan shook his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!  I know very well what you think,&quot;
replied Fouquet, quickly.  &quot;If Vaux
were yours, you would sell it, and would purchase an estate in the country; an
estate which should have woods, orchards, and land attached, so that the estate
should be made to support its master. 
With forty millions you might - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Ten millions,&quot;
interrupted D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Not
a million, my dear captain.  No one in
France is rich enough to give two millions for Vaux, and to continue to
maintain it as I have done; no one could do it, no one would know how.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Well,&quot; said D'Artagnan,
&quot;in any case, a million is not abject misery.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is not far from it, my dear monsieur. 
But you do not understand me. 
No; I will not sell my residence at Vaux; I will give it to you, if you
like;&quot; and Fouquet accompanied these words with a movement of the
shoulders to which it would be impossible to do justice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Give it to the king; you will
make a better bargain.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
king does not require me to give it to him,&quot; said Fouquet; &quot;he will
take it away from me with the most absolute ease and grace, if it pleases him
to do so; and that is the very reason I should prefer to see it perish.  Do you know, Monsieur d'Artagnan, that if
the king did not happen to be under my roof, I would take this candle, go
straight to the dome, and set fire to a couple of huge chests of fusees and
fireworks which are in reserve there, and would reduce my palace to
ashes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bah!&quot;
said the musketeer, negligently. 
&quot;At all events, you would not be able to burn the gardens, and that
is the finest feature of the place.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
yet,&quot; resumed Fouquet, thoughtfully, &quot;what was I saying?  Great heavens! burn Vaux! destroy my
palace!  But Vaux is not mine; these
wonderful creations are, it is true, the property, as far as sense of enjoyment
goes, of the man who has paid for them; but as far as duration is concerned,
they belong to those who created them. 
Vaux belongs to Lebrun, to Lenôtre, to Pélisson, to Levau, to La
Fontaine, to Molière; Vaux belongs to posterity, in fact.  You see, Monsieur d'Artagnan, that my very
house has ceased to be my own.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is all well and good,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;the idea is agreeable
enough, and I recognize M. Fouquet himself in it.  That idea, indeed, makes me forget that poor fellow Broussel
altogether; and I now fail to recognize in you the whining complaints of that
old Frondeur.  If you are ruined, monsieur,
look at the affair manfully, for you too, <i>mordioux!</i>
belong to posterity, and have no right to lessen yourself in any way.  Stay a moment; look at me, I who seem to
exercise in some degree a kind of superiority over you, because I am arresting
you; fate, which distributes their different parts to the comedians of this
world, accorded me a less agreeable and less advantageous part to fill than
yours has been.  I am one of those who
think that the parts which kings and powerful nobles are called upon to act are
infinitely of more worth than the parts of beggars or lackeys.  It is far better on the stage - on the
stage, I mean, of another theater than the theater of this world - it is far
better to wear a fine coat and to talk a fine language, than to walk the boards
shod with a pair of old shoes, or to get one's backbone gently polished by a
hearty dressing with a stick.  In one
word, you have been a prodigal with money, you have ordered and been obeyed -
have been steeped to the lips in enjoyment; while I have dragged my tether
after me, have been commanded and have obeyed, and have drudged my life
away.  Well, although I may seem of such
trifling importance beside you, monseigneur, I do declare to you, that the recollection
of what I have done serves me as a spur, and prevents me from bowing my old
head too soon.  I shall remain unto the
very end a trooper; and when my turn comes, I shall fall perfectly straight,
all in a heap, still alive, after having selected my place beforehand.  Do as I do, Monsieur Fouquet, you will not
find yourself the worse for it; a fall happens only once in a lifetime to men
like yourself, and the chief thing is, to take it gracefully when the chance
presents itself.  There is a Latin proverb
- the words have escaped me, but I remember the sense of it very well, for I
have thought over it more than once - which says, 'The end crowns the
work!'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
rose from his seat, passed his arm round D'Artagnan's neck, and clasped him in
a close embrace, whilst with the other hand he pressed his hand.  &quot;An excellent homily,&quot; he said,
after a moment's pause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;A soldier's,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;You have a regard for me, in
telling me all that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Perhaps.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
resumed his pensive attitude once more, and then, a moment after, he said:
&quot;Where can M. d'Herblay be?  I dare
not ask you to send for him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
would not ask me, because I would not do it, Monsieur Fouquet.  People would learn it, and Aramis, who is
not mixed up with the affair, might possibly be compromised and included in
your disgrace.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I will wait here till
daylight,&quot; said Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Yes; that is best.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;What shall we do when
daylight comes?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I know nothing at all about
it, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur d'Artagnan, will you
do me a favor?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Most willingly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;You guard me, I remain; you are
acting in the full discharge of your duty, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
good, then; remain as close to me as my shadow if you like; and I infinitely
prefer such a shadow to any one else.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>D'Artagnan bowed to the compliment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,
forget that you are Monsieur d'Artagnan, captain of the musketeers; forget that
I am Monsieur Fouquet, surintendant of the finances; and let us talk about my
affairs.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;That is rather a delicate
subject.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Indeed?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
but, for your sake, Monsieur Fouquet, I will do what may almost be regarded as
an impossibility.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Thank you.  What did the king say to you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Ah! is that the way you
talk?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;The deuce!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;What do you think of my
situation?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I do not know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;However, unless you have some
ill feeling against me - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Your position is a difficult
one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;In what respect?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Because you are under your
own roof.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;However difficult it may be,
I understand it very well.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Do you suppose that, with any
one else but yourself, I should have shown so much frankness?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;What! so much frankness, do
you say? you, who refuse to tell me the slightest thing?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;At all events, then, so much
ceremony and consideration.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Ah!  I have nothing to say in that respect.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;One
moment, monseigneur: let me tell you how I should have behaved towards any one
but yourself.  It might be that I
happened to arrive at your door just as your guests or your friends had left
you - or, if they had not gone yet, I should wait until they were leaving, and
should then catch them one after the other, like rabbits; I should lock them up
quietly enough, I should steal softly along the carpet of your corridor, and
with one hand upon you, before you suspected the slightest thing amiss, I
should keep you safely until my master's breakfast in the morning.  In this way, I should just the same have
avoided all publicity, all disturbance, all opposition; but there would also
have been no warning for M. Fouquet, no consideration for his feelings, none of
those delicate concessions which are shown by persons who are essentially
courteous in their natures, whenever the decisive moment may arrive.  Are you satisfied with the plan?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;It makes me shudder.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
thought you would not like it.  It would
have been very disagreeable to have made my appearance to-morrow, without any preparation,
and to have asked you to deliver up your sword.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Oh! monsieur, I should have
died of shame and anger.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Your gratitude is too
eloquently expressed.  I have not done
enough to deserve it, I assure you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Most certainly, monsieur, you
will never get me to believe that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
then, monseigneur, if you are satisfied with what I have done, and have
somewhat recovered from the shock which I prepared you for as much as I
possibly could, let us allow the few hours that remain to pass away undisturbed.  You are harassed, and should arrange your
thoughts; I beg you, therefore, go to sleep, or pretend to go to sleep, either
on your bed, or in your bed; I will sleep in this armchair; and when I fall
asleep, my rest is so sound that a cannon would not wake me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
smiled.  &quot;I expect, however,&quot;
continued the musketeer, &quot;the case of a door being opened, whether a
secret door, or any other; or the case of any one going out of, or coming into,
the room - for anything like that my ear is as quick and sensitive as the ear
of a mouse.  Creaking noises make me
start.  It arises, I suppose, from a
natural antipathy to anything of the kind. 
Move about as much as you like; walk up and down in any part of the
room, write, efface, destroy, burn, - nothing like that will prevent me from
going to sleep or even prevent me from snoring, but do not touch either the key
or the handle of the door, for I should start up in a moment, and that would
shake my nerves and make me ill.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
d'Artagnan,&quot; said Fouquet, &quot;you are certainly the most witty and the
most courteous man I ever met with; and you will leave me only one regret, that
of having made your acquaintance so late.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
drew a deep sigh, which seemed to say, &quot;Alas! you have perhaps made it too
soon.&quot;  He then settled himself in
his armchair, while Fouquet, half lying on his bed and leaning on his arm, was
meditating on his misadventures.  In
this way, both of them, leaving the candles burning, awaited the first dawn of
the day; and when Fouquet happened to sigh too loudly, D'Artagnan only snored
the louder.  Not a single visit, not
even from Aramis, disturbed their quietude: not a sound even was heard
throughout the whole vast palace. 
Outside, however, the guards of honor on duty, and the patrol of musketeers,
paced up and down; and the sound of their feet could be heard on the gravel
walks.  It seemed to act as an
additional soporific for the sleepers, while the murmuring of the wind through
the trees, and the unceasing music of the fountains whose waters tumbled in the
basin, still went on uninterruptedly, without being disturbed at the slight
noises and items of little moment that constitute the life and death of human
nature.</p>

vivid contrast to the sad and terrible destiny of the king imprisoned in the
Bastile, and tearing, in sheer despair, the bolts and bars of his dungeon, the
rhetoric of the chroniclers of old would not fail to present, as a complete
antithesis, the picture of Philippe lying asleep beneath the royal canopy.  We do not pretend to say that such rhetoric
is always bad, and always scatters, in places where they have no right to grow,
the flowers with which it embellishes and enlivens history.  But we shall, on the present occasion,
carefully avoid polishing the antithesis in question, but shall proceed to draw
another picture as minutely as possible, to serve as foil and counterfoil to
the one in the preceding chapter.  The
young prince alighted from Aramis's room, in the same way the king had
descended from the apartment dedicated to Morpheus.  The dome gradually and slowly sank down under Aramis's pressure,
and Philippe stood beside the royal bed, which had ascended again after having
deposited its prisoner in the secret depths of the subterranean passage.  Alone, in the presence of all the luxury
which surrounded him; alone, in the presence of his power; alone, with the part
he was about to be forced to act, Philippe for the first time felt his heart,
and mind, and soul expand beneath the influence of a thousand mutable emotions,
which are the vital throbs of a king's heart. 
He could not help changing color when he looked upon the empty bed,
still tumbled by his brother's body. 
This mute accomplice had returned, after having completed the work it
had been destined to perform; it returned with the traces of the crime; it
spoke to the guilty author of that crime, with the frank and unreserved
language which an accomplice never fears to use in the company of his companion
in guilt; for it spoke the truth.  Philippe
bent over the bed, and perceived a pocket-handkerchief lying on it, which was
still damp from the cold sweat which had poured from Louis XIV.'s face.  This sweat-bestained handkerchief terrified
Philippe, as the gore of Abel frightened Cain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am face to face with my destiny,&quot; said Philippe, his eyes on fire, and his
face a livid white.  &quot;Is it likely
to be more terrifying than my captivity has been sad and gloomy?  Though I am compelled to follow out, at
every moment, the sovereign power and authority I have usurped, shall I cease
to listen to the scruples of my heart? 
Yes! the king has lain on this bed; it is indeed his head that has left
its impression on this pillow; his bitter tears that have stained this
handkerchief: and yet, I hesitate to throw myself on the bed, or to press in my
hand the handkerchief which is embroidered with my brother's arms.  Away with such weakness; let me imitate M.
d'Herblay, who asserts that a man's action should be always one degree above
his thoughts; let me imitate M. d'Herblay, whose thoughts are of and for
himself alone, who regards himself as a man of honor, so long as he injures or
betrays his enemies only.  I, I alone,
should have occupied this bed, if Louis XIV. had not, owing to my mother's
criminal abandonment, stood in my way; and this handkerchief, embroidered with
the arms of France, would in right and justice belong to me alone, if, as M.
d'Herblay observes, I had been left my royal cradle.  Philippe, son of France, take your place on that bed; Philippe,
sole king of France, resume the blazonry that is yours!  Philippe, sole heir presumptive to Louis
XIII., your father, show yourself without pity or mercy for the usurper who, at
this moment, has not even to suffer the agony of the remorse of all that you
have had to submit to.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                With
these words, Philippe, notwithstanding an instinctive repugnance of feeling,
and in spite of the shudder of terror which mastered his will, threw himself on
the royal bed, and forced his muscles to press the still warm place where Louis
XIV. had lain, while he buried his burning face in the handkerchief still
moistened by his brother's tears.  With
his head thrown back and buried in the soft down of his pillow, Philippe
perceived above him the crown of France, suspended, as we have stated, by
angels with outspread golden wings.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                A man
may be ambitious of lying in a lion's den, but can hardly hope to sleep there
quietly.  Philippe listened attentively
to every sound; his heart panted and throbbed at the very suspicion of approaching
terror and misfortune; but confident in his own strength, which was confirmed
by the force of an overpoweringly resolute determination, he waited until some
decisive circumstance should permit him to judge for himself.  He hoped that imminent danger might be
revealed to him, like those phosphoric lights of the tempest which show the
sailors the altitude of the waves against which they have to struggle.  But nothing approached.  Silence, that mortal enemy of restless
hearts, and of ambitious minds, shrouded in the thickness of its gloom during
the remainder of the night the future king of France, who lay there sheltered
beneath his stolen crown.  Towards the
morning a shadow, rather than a body, glided into the royal chamber; Philippe
expected his approach and neither expressed nor exhibited any surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
M. d'Herblay?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
sire, all is accomplished.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Exactly
as we expected.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Did
he resist?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Terribly!
tears and entreaties.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
perfect stupor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
at last?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
at last, a complete victory, and absolute silence.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Did
the governor of the Bastile suspect anything?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
resemblance, however - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Was
the cause of the success.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
the prisoner cannot fail to explain himself. 
Think well of that.  I have
myself been able to do as much as that, on former occasion.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have already provided for every chance. 
In a few days, sooner if necessary, we will take the captive out of his
prison, and will send him out of the country, to a place of exile so remote -
&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;People
can return from their exile, Monsieur d'Herblay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
a place of exile so distant, I was going to say, that human strength and the
duration of human life would not be enough for his return.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Once
more a cold look of intelligence passed between Aramis and the young king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
M. du Vallon?&quot; asked Philippe in order to change the conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
will be presented to you to-day, and confidentially will congratulate you on
the danger which that conspirator has made you run.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is to be done with him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;With
M. du Vallon?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
confer a dukedom on him, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
dukedom,&quot; replied Aramis, smiling in a significant manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why
do you laugh, Monsieur d'Herblay?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
laugh at the extreme caution of your idea.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Cautious,
why so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
majesty is doubtless afraid that poor Porthos may possible become a troublesome
witness, and you wish to get rid of him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!
in making him a duke?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Certainly;
you would assuredly kill him, for he would die from joy, and the secret would
die with him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Good
heavens!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,&quot;
said Aramis, phlegmatically; &quot;I should lose a very good friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At this
moment, and in the middle of this idle conversation, under the light tone of
which the two conspirators concealed their joy and pride at their mutual
success, Aramis heard something which made him prick up his ears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is that?&quot; said Philippe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
dawn, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
before you retired to bed last night, you probably decided to do something this
morning at break of day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
I told my captain of the musketeers,&quot; replied the young man hurriedly,
&quot;that I should expect him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
you told him that, he will certainly be here, for he is a most punctual
man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
hear a step in the vestibule.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
must be he.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come,
let us begin the attack,&quot; said the young king resolutely.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Be
cautious for Heaven's sake.  To begin
the attack, and with D'Artagnan, would be madness.  D'Artagnan knows nothing, he has seen nothing; he is a hundred
miles from suspecting our mystery in the slightest degree, but if he comes into
this room the first this morning, he will be sure to detect something of what
has taken place, and which he would imagine it his business to occupy himself
about.  Before we allow D'Artagnan to
penetrate into this room, we must air the room thoroughly, or introduce so many
people into it, that the keenest scent in the whole kingdom may be deceived by
the traces of twenty different persons.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
how can I send him away, since I have given him a rendezvous?&quot; observed
the prince, impatient to measure swords with so redoubtable an antagonist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will take care of that,&quot; replied the bishop, &quot;and in order to begin,
I am going to strike a blow which will completely stupefy our man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He,
too, is striking a blow, for I hear him at the door,&quot; added the prince,
hurriedly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And, in
fact, a knock at the door was heard at that moment.  Aramis was not mistaken; for it was indeed D'Artagnan who adopted
that mode of announcing himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                We have
seen how he passed the night in philosophizing with M. Fouquet, but the
musketeer was very weary even of feigning to fall asleep, and as soon as
earliest dawn illumined with its gloomy gleams of light the sumptuous cornices
of the superintendent's room, D'Artagnan rose from his armchair, arranged his sword,
brushed his coat and hat with his sleeve, like a private soldier getting ready
for inspection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Are
you going out?&quot; said Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur.  And you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
shall remain.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
pledge your word?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Certainly.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
good.  Besides, my only reason for going
out is to try and get that reply, - you know what I mean?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;That sentence, you mean -
&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Stay,
I have something of the old Roman in me. 
This morning, when I got up, I remarked that my sword had got caught in
one of the <i>aiguillettes</i>, and that my
shoulder-belt had slipped quite off. 
That is an infallible sign.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Of prosperity?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
be sure of it; for every time that that confounded belt of mine stuck fast to
my back, it always signified a punishment from M. de Tréville, or a refusal of
money by M. de Mazarin.  Every time my
sword hung fast to my shoulder-belt, it always predicted some disagreeable
commission or another for me to execute, and I have had showers of them all my
life through.  Every time, too, my sword
danced about in its sheath, a duel, fortunate in its result, was sure to
follow: whenever it dangled about the calves of my legs, it signified a slight
wound; every time it fell completely out of the scabbard, I was booked, and
made up my mind that I should have to remain on the field of battle, with two
or three months under surgical bandages into the bargain.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
did not know your sword kept you so well informed,&quot; said Fouquet, with a
faint smile, which showed how he was struggling against his own weakness.  &quot;Is your sword bewitched, or under the
influence of some imperial charm?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
you must know that my sword may almost be regarded as part of my own body.  I have heard that certain men seem to have
warnings given them by feeling something the matter with their legs, or a
throbbing of their temples.  With me, it
is my sword that warns me.  Well, it
told me of nothing this morning.  But,
stay a moment - look here, it has just fallen of its own accord into the last
hole of the belt.  Do you know what that
is a warning of?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Well, that tells me of an
arrest that will have to be made this very day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,&quot;
said the surintendant, more astonished than annoyed by this frankness, &quot;if
there is nothing disagreeable predicted to you by your sword, I am to conclude
that it is not disagreeable for you to arrest me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;You! arrest <i>you!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Of course.  The warning - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Does
not concern you, since you have been arrested ever since yesterday.  It is not you I shall have to arrest, be
assured of that.  That is the reason why
I am delighted, and also the reason why I said that my day will be a happy
one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
with these words, pronounced with the most affectionate graciousness of manner,
the captain took leave of Fouquet in order to wait upon the king.  He was on the point of leaving the room,
when Fouquet said to him, &quot;One last mark of kindness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;What is it,
monseigneur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;M. d'Herblay; let me see
Monsieur d'Herblay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I am going to try and get him
to come to you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan did not think himself so
good a prophet.  It was written that the
day would pass away and realize all the predictions that had been made in the
morning.  He had accordingly knocked, as
we have seen, at the king's door.  The
door opened.  The captain thought that
it was the king who had just opened it himself; and this supposition was not
altogether inadmissible, considering the state of agitation in which he had
left Louis XIV. the previous evening; but instead of his royal master, whom he
was on the point of saluting with the greatest respect, he perceived the long,
calm features of Aramis.  So extreme was
his surprise that he could hardly refrain from uttering a loud
exclamation.  &quot;Aramis!&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Good morning, dear
D'Artagnan,&quot; replied the prelate, coldly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;You here!&quot; stammered out
the musketeer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;His majesty desires you to
report that he is still sleeping, after having been greatly fatigued during the
whole night.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah!&quot; said D'Artagnan,
who could not understand how the bishop of Vannes, who had been so indifferent
a favorite the previous evening, had become in half a dozen hours the most
magnificent mushroom of fortune that had ever sprung up in a sovereign's
bedroom.  In fact, to transmit the
orders of the king even to the mere threshold of that monarch's room, to serve
as an intermediary of Louis XIV. so as to be able to give a single order in his
name at a couple paces from him, he must have become more than Richelieu had
ever been to Louis XIII.  D'Artagnan's
expressive eye, half-opened lips, his curling mustache, said as much indeed in
the plainest language to the chief favorite, who remained calm and perfectly
unmoved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Moreover,&quot; continued the
bishop, &quot;you will be good enough, monsieur le capitaine des mousquetaires,
to allow those only to pass into the king's room this morning who have special
permission.  His majesty does not wish
to be disturbed just yet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;But,&quot; objected
D'Artagnan, almost on the point of refusing to obey this order, and
particularly of giving unrestrained passage to the suspicions which the king's
silence had aroused - &quot;but, monsieur l'évêque, his majesty gave me a
rendezvous for this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Later, later,&quot; said the
king's voice, from the bottom of the alcove; a voice which made a cold shudder
pass through the musketeer's veins.  He
bowed, amazed, confused, and stupefied by the smile with which Aramis seemed to
overwhelm him, as soon as these words had been pronounced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And then,&quot; continued the
bishop, &quot;as an answer to what you were coming to ask the king, my dear
D'Artagnan, here is an order of his majesty, which you will be good enough to
attend to forthwith, for it concerns M. Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan took the order which was
held out to him.  &quot;To be set at
liberty!&quot; he murmured. 
&quot;Ah!&quot; and he uttered a second &quot;ah!&quot; still more full
of intelligence than the former; for this order explained Aramis's presence
with the king, and that Aramis, in order to have obtained Fouquet's pardon,
must have made considerable progress in the royal favor, and that this favor
explained, in its tenor, the hardly conceivable assurance with which M.
d'Herblay issued the order in the king's name. 
For D'Artagnan it was quite sufficient to have understood something of
the matter in hand to order to understand the rest.  He bowed and withdrew a couple of paces, as though he were about
to leave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;I am going with you,&quot;
said the bishop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Where to?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;To M. Fouquet; I wish to be a
witness of his delight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Ah!  Aramis, how you puzzled me just now!&quot; said D'Artagnan again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;But you understand <i>now</i>, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Of course I understand,&quot;
he said aloud; but added in a low tone to himself, almost hissing the words
between his teeth, &quot;No, no, I do not understand yet.  But it is all the same, for here is the
order for it.&quot;  And then he added,
&quot;I will lead the way, monseigneur,&quot; and he conducted Aramis to
Fouquet's apartments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>F</span>ouquet
was waiting with anxiety; he had already sent away many of his servants and
friends, who, anticipating the usual hour of his ordinary receptions, had
called at his door to inquire after him. 
Preserving the utmost silence respecting the danger which hung suspended
by a hair above his head, he only asked them, as he did every one, indeed, who
came to the door, where Aramis was. 
When he saw D'Artagnan return, and when he perceived the bishop of
Vannes behind him, he could hardly restrain his delight; it was fully equal to
his previous uneasiness.  The mere sight
of Aramis was a complete compensation to the surintendant for the unhappiness
he had undergone in his arrest.  The
prelate was silent and grave; D'Artagnan completely bewildered by such an
accumulation of events.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
captain, so you have brought M. d'Herblay to me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
something better still, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Liberty.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am free!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
by the king's order.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
resumed his usual serenity, that he might interrogate Aramis with a look.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
yes, you can thank M. l'évêque de Vannes,&quot; pursued D'Artagnan, &quot;for
it is indeed to him that you owe the change that has taken place in the
king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!&quot;
said Fouquet, more humiliated at the service than grateful at its success.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
you,&quot; continued D'Artagnan, addressing Aramis - &quot;you, who have become
M. Fouquet's protector and patron, can you not do something for me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Anything
in the wide world you like, my friend,&quot; replied the bishop, in his calmest
tones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;One
thing only, then, and I shall be perfectly satisfied.  How on earth did you manage to become the favorite of the king,
you who have never spoken to him more than twice in your life?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;From
a friend such as you are,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;I cannot conceal
anything.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
very good, tell me, then.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
well.  You think that I have seen the
king only twice, whilst the fact is I have seen him more than a hundred times;
only we have kept it very secret, that is all.&quot;  And without trying to remove the color which at this revelation
made D'Artagnan's face flush scarlet, Aramis turned towards M. Fouquet, who was
as much surprised as the musketeer. 
&quot;Monseigneur,&quot; he resumed, &quot;the king desires me to inform
you that he is more than ever your friend, and that your beautiful <i>fête</i>, so generously offered by you on
his behalf, has touched him to the very heart.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
thereupon he saluted M. Fouquet with so much reverence of manner, that the
latter, incapable of understanding a man whose diplomacy was of so prodigious a
character, remained incapable of uttering a single syllable, and equally
incapable of thought or movement. 
D'Artagnan fancied he perceived that these two men had something to say
to each other, and he was about to yield to that feeling of instinctive
politeness which in such a case hurries a man towards the door, when he feels
his presence is an inconvenience for others; but his eager curiosity, spurred
on by so many mysteries, counseled him to remain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
thereupon turned towards him, and said, in a quiet tone, &quot;You will not
forget, my friend, the king's order respecting those whom he intends to receive
this morning on rising.&quot;  These
words were clear enough, and the musketeer understood them; he therefore bowed
to Fouquet, and then to Aramis, - to the latter with a slight admixture of
ironical respect, - and disappeared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                No
sooner had he left, than Fouquet, whose impatience had hardly been able to wait
for that moment, darted towards the door to close it, and then returning to the
bishop, he said, &quot;My dear D'Herblay, I think it now high time you should
explain all that has passed, for, in plain and honest truth, I do not
understand anything.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
will explain all that to you,&quot; said Aramis, sitting down, and making
Fouquet sit down also.  &quot;Where
shall I begin?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;With
this first of all.  Why does the king
set me at liberty?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
ought rather to ask me what his reason was for having you arrested.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Since
my arrest, I have had time to think over it, and my idea is that it arises out
of some slight feeling of jealousy.  My <i>fête</i> put M. Colbert out of temper, and
M. Colbert discovered some cause of complaint against me; Belle-Isle, for
instance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No;
there is no question at all just now of Belle-Isle.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is it, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you remember those receipts for thirteen millions which M. de Mazarin contrived
to steal from you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
of course!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
you are pronounced a public robber.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Good
heavens!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
that is not all.  Do you also remember
that letter you wrote to La Vallière?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Alas!
yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
that proclaims you a traitor and a suborner.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why
should he have pardoned me, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
have not yet arrived at that part of our argument.  I wish you to be quite convinced of the fact itself.  Observe this well: the king knows you to be
guilty of an appropriation of public funds. 
Oh! of course <i>I</i> know that you
have done nothing of the kind; but, at all events, the king has seen the
receipts, and he can do no other than believe you are incriminated.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
beg your pardon, I do not see - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will see presently, though.  The king,
moreover, having read your love-letter to La Vallière, and the offers you there
made her, cannot retain any doubt of your intentions with regard to that young
lady; you will admit that, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Certainly.  Pray conclude.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
the fewest words.  The king, we may
henceforth assume, is your powerful, implacable, and eternal enemy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Agreed.  But am I, then, so powerful, that he has not
dared to sacrifice me, notwithstanding his hatred, with all the means which my
weakness, or my misfortunes, may have given him as a hold upon me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is clear, beyond all doubt,&quot; pursued Aramis, coldly, &quot;that the king
has quarreled with you - irreconcilably.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,
since he has absolved me - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you believe it likely?&quot; asked the bishop, with a searching look.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Without
believing in his sincerity, I believe it in the accomplished fact.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
slightly shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
why, then, should Louis XIV. have commissioned you to tell me what you have
just stated?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
king charged me with no message for you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;With
nothing!&quot; said the superintendent, stupefied.  &quot;But, that order - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
yes.  You are quite right.  There <i>is</i>
an order, certainly;&quot; and these words were pronounced by Aramis in so
strange a tone, that Fouquet could not resist starting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are concealing something from me, I see. 
What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
softly rubbed his white fingers over his chin, but said nothing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Does
the king exile me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
not act as if you were playing at the game children play at when they have to
try and guess where a thing has been hidden, and are informed, by a bell being
rung, when they are approaching near to it, or going away from it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Speak,
then.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Guess.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
alarm me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bah!
that is because you have not guessed, then.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
did the king say to you?  In the name of
our friendship, do not deceive me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
king has not said one word to me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are killing me with impatience, D'Herblay. 
Am I still superintendent?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;As
long as you like.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
what extraordinary empire have you so suddenly acquired over his majesty's
mind?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
that's the point.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
does your bidding?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
believe so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is hardly credible.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;So
any one would say.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;D'Herblay,
by our alliance, by our friendship, by everything you hold dearest in the
world, speak openly, I implore you.  By
what means have you succeeded in overcoming Louis XIV.'s prejudices, for he did
not like you, I am certain.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
king will like me <i>now</i>,&quot; said
Aramis, laying stress upon the last word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have something particular, then, between you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
secret, perhaps?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
secret.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
secret of such a nature as to change his majesty's interests?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are, indeed, a man of superior intelligence, monseigneur, and have made a
particularly accurate guess.  I have, in
fact, discovered a secret, of a nature to change the interests of the king of
France.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
said Fouquet, with the reserve of a man who does not wish to ask any more
questions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
you shall judge of it yourself,&quot; pursued Aramis; &quot;and you shall tell
me if I am mistaken with regard to the importance of this secret.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am listening, since you are good enough to unbosom yourself to me; only do not
forget that I have asked you about nothing which it may be indiscreet in you to
communicate.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
seemed, for a moment, as if he were collecting himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
not speak!&quot; said Fouquet: &quot;there is still time enough.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you remember,&quot; said the bishop, casting down his eyes, &quot;the birth of
Louis XIV.?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;As
if it were yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Have
you ever heard anything particular respecting his birth?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nothing;
except that the king was not really the son of Louis XIII.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
does not matter to us, or the kingdom either; he is the son of his father, says
the French law, whose father is recognized by law.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;True;
but it is a grave matter, when the quality of races is called into question.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
merely secondary question, after all. 
So that, in fact, you have never learned or heard anything in
particular?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is where my secret begins.  The queen,
you must know, instead of being delivered of a son, was delivered of twins.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
looked up suddenly as he replied:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
the second is dead?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will see.  These twins seemed likely to
be regarded as the pride of their mother, and the hope of France; but the weak
nature of the king, his superstitious feelings, made him apprehend a series of
conflicts between two children whose rights were equal; so he put out of the
way - he suppressed - one of the twins.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Suppressed,
do you say?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Have
patience.  Both the children grew up;
the one on the throne, whose minister you are - the other, who is my friend, in
gloom and isolation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Good
heavens!  What are you saying, Monsieur
d'Herblay?  And what is this poor prince
doing?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ask
me, rather, what has he done.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
was brought up in the country, and then thrown into a fortress which goes by
the name of the Bastile.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is
it possible?&quot; cried the surintendant, clasping his hands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
one was the most fortunate of men: the other the most unhappy and miserable of
all living beings.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Does
his mother not know this?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Anne
of Austria knows it all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
the king?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Knows
absolutely nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;So
much the better,&quot; said Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This
remark seemed to make a great impression on Aramis; he looked at Fouquet with
the most anxious expression of countenance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
beg your pardon; I interrupted you,&quot; said Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
was saying,&quot; resumed Aramis, &quot;that this poor prince was the
unhappiest of human beings, when Heaven, whose thoughts are over all His
creatures, undertook to come to his assistance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
in what way?  Tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will see.  The reigning king - I say the
reigning king - you can guess very well why?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No.  Why?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Because
<i>both</i> of them, being legitimate
princes, ought to have been kings.  Is
not that your opinion?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is, certainly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Unreservedly?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Most
unreservedly; twins are one person in two bodies.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am pleased that a legist of your learning and authority should have pronounced
such an opinion.  It is agreed, then,
that each of them possessed equal rights, is it not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Incontestably!
but, gracious heavens, what an extraordinary circumstance!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
are not at the end of it yet. - Patience.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!  I shall find 'patience' enough.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Heaven
wished to raise up for that oppressed child an avenger, or a supporter, or
vindicator, if you prefer it.  It
happened that the reigning king, the usurper - you are quite of my opinion, I
believe, that it is an act of usurpation quietly to enjoy, and selfishly to
assume the right over, an inheritance to which a man has only half a
right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
usurpation is the word.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
that case, I continue.  It was Heaven's
will that the usurper should possess, in the person of his first minister, a
man of great talent, of large and generous nature.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
well,&quot; said Fouquet, &quot;I understand you; you have relied upon me to
repair the wrong which has been done to this unhappy brother of Louis XIV.  You have thought well; I will help you.  I thank you, D'Herblay, I thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
no, it is not that at all; you have not allowed me to finish,&quot; said
Aramis, perfectly unmoved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will not say another word, then.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
Fouquet, I was observing, the minister of the reigning sovereign, was suddenly
taken into the greatest aversion, and menaced with the ruin of his fortune,
loss of liberty, loss of life even, by intrigue and personal hatred, to which
the king gave too readily an attentive ear. 
But Heaven permits (still, however, out of consideration for the unhappy
prince who had been sacrificed) that M. Fouquet should in his turn have a
devoted friend who knew this state secret, and felt that he possessed strength
and courage enough to divulge this secret, after having had the strength to
carry it locked up in his own heart for twenty years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Go
no farther,&quot; said Fouquet, full of generous feelings.  &quot;I understand you, and can guess
everything now.  You went to see the
king when the intelligence of my arrest reached you; you implored him, he
refused to listen to you; then you threatened him with that secret, threatened
to reveal it, and Louis XIV., alarmed at the risk of its betrayal, granted to
the terror of your indiscretion what he refused to your generous
intercession.  I understand, I
understand; you have the king in your power; I understand.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
understand <i>nothing</i> - as yet,&quot;
replied Aramis, &quot;and again you interrupt me.  Then, too, allow me to observe that you pay no attention to
logical reasoning, and seem to forget what you ought most to remember.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
know upon what I laid the greatest stress at the beginning of our
conversation?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
his majesty's hate, invincible hate for me; yes, but what feeling of hate could
resist the threat of such a revelation?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Such
a revelation, do you say? that is the very point where your logic fails
you.  What! do you suppose that if I had
made such a revelation to the king, I should have been alive now?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is not ten minutes ago that you were with the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
may be.  He might not have had the time
to get me killed outright, but he would have had the time to get me gagged and
thrown in a dungeon.  Come, come, show a
little consistency in your reasoning, <i>mordieu!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And by
the mere use of this word, which was so thoroughly his old musketeer's
expression, forgotten by one who never seemed to forget anything, Fouquet could
not but understand to what a pitch of exaltation the calm, impenetrable bishop
of Vannes had wrought himself.  He
shuddered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
then,&quot; replied the latter, after having mastered his feelings,
&quot;should I be the man I really am, should I be the true friend you believe me,
if I were to expose you, whom the king already hates so bitterly, to a feeling
more than ever to be dreaded in that young man?  To have robbed him, is nothing; to have addressed the woman he
loves, is not much; but to hold in your keeping both his crown and his honor,
why, he would pluck out your heart with his own hands.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have not allowed him to penetrate your secret, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
would sooner, far sooner, have swallowed at one draught all the poisons that
Mithridates drank in twenty years, in order to try and avoid death, than have
betrayed my secret to the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
have you done, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
now we are coming to the point, monseigneur. 
I think I shall not fail to excite in you a little interest.  You are listening, I hope.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
can you ask me if I am listening?  Go
on.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
walked softly all round the room, satisfied himself that they were alone, and
that all was silent, and then returned and placed himself close to the armchair
in which Fouquet was seated, awaiting with the deepest anxiety the revelation
he had to make.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
forgot to tell you,&quot; resumed Aramis, addressing himself to Fouquet, who
listened to him with the most absorbed attention - &quot;I forgot to mention a
most remarkable circumstance respecting these twins, namely, that God had
formed them so startlingly, so miraculously, like each other, that it would be
utterly impossible to distinguish the one from the other.  Their own mother would not be able to
distinguish them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is
it possible?&quot; exclaimed Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
same noble character in their features, the same carriage, the same stature,
the same voice.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
their thoughts? degree of intelligence? their knowledge of human life?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
is inequality there, I admit, monseigneur. 
Yes; for the prisoner of the Bastile is, most incontestably, superior in
every way to his brother; and if, from his prison, this unhappy victim were to
pass to the throne, France would not, from the earliest period of its history,
perhaps, have had a master more powerful in genius and nobility of character.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
buried his face in his hands, as if he were overwhelmed by the weight of this
immense secret.  Aramis approached him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
is a further inequality,&quot; he said, continuing his work of temptation,
&quot;an inequality which concerns yourself, monseigneur, between the twins,
both sons of Louis XIII., namely, the last comer does not know M.
Colbert.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
raised his head immediately - his features were pale and distorted.  The bolt had hit its mark - not his heart,
but his mind and comprehension.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
understand you,&quot; he said to Aramis; &quot;you are proposing a conspiracy
to me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Something
like it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;One
of those attempts which, as you said at the beginning of this conversation,
alters the fate of empires?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
of superintendents, too; yes, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
a word, you propose that I should agree to the substitution of the son of Louis
XIII., who is now a prisoner in the Bastile, for the son of Louis XIII., who is
at this moment asleep in the Chamber of Morpheus?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
smiled with the sinister expression of the sinister thought which was passing
through his brain.  &quot;Exactly,&quot;
he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Have
you thought,&quot; continued Fouquet, becoming animated with that strength of
talent which in a few seconds originates, and matures the conception of a plan,
and with that largeness of view which foresees all consequences, and embraces
every result at a glance - &quot;have you thought that we must assemble the
nobility, the clergy, and the third estate of the realm; that we shall have to
depose the reigning sovereign, to disturb by so frightful a scandal the tomb of
their dead father, to sacrifice the life, the honor of a woman, Anne of
Austria, the life and peace of mind and heart of another woman, Maria Theresa;
and suppose that it were all done, if we were to succeed in doing it - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
do not understand you,&quot; continued Aramis, coldly.  &quot;There is not a single syllable of
sense in all you have just said.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!&quot;
said the superintendent, surprised, &quot;a man like you refuse to view the
practical bearing of the case!  Do you
confine yourself to the childish delight of a political illusion, and neglect
the chances of its being carried into execution; in other words, the reality
itself, is it possible?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
friend,&quot; said Aramis, emphasizing the word with a kind of disdainful
familiarity, &quot;what does Heaven do in order to substitute one king for
another?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Heaven!&quot;
exclaimed Fouquet - &quot;Heaven gives directions to its agent, who seizes upon
the doomed victim, hurries him away, and seats the triumphant rival on the
empty throne.  But you forget that this
agent is called death.  Oh!  Monsieur d'Herblay, in Heaven's name, tell
me if you have had the idea - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
is no question of that, monseigneur; 
you are going beyond the object in view.  Who spoke of Louis XIV.'s death? who spoke of adopting the
example which Heaven sets in following out the strict execution of its
decrees?  No, I wish you to understand
that Heaven effects its purposes without confusion or disturbance, without exciting
comment or remark, without difficulty or exertion; and that men, inspired by
Heaven, succeed like Heaven itself, in all their undertakings, in all they
attempt, in all they do.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
mean, my <i>friend</i>,&quot; returned
Aramis, with the same intonation on the word friend that he had applied to it
the first time - &quot;I mean that if there has been any confusion, scandal,
and even effort in the substitution of the prisoner for the king, I defy you to
prove it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!&quot;
cried Fouquet, whiter than the handkerchief with which he wiped his temples,
&quot;what do you say?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Go
to the king's apartment,&quot; continued Aramis, tranquilly, &quot;and you who
know the mystery, I defy even you to perceive that the prisoner of the Bastile
is lying in his brother's bed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
the king,&quot; stammered Fouquet, seized with horror at the intelligence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
king?&quot; said Aramis, in his gentlest tone; &quot;the one who hates you, or
the one who likes you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
king - of - <i>yesterday</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
king of yesterday! be quite easy on that score; he has gone to take the place
in the Bastile which his victim occupied for so many years.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Great
God!  And who took him there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
and in the simplest way.  I carried him
away last night.  While he was descending
into midnight, the other was ascending into day.  I do not think there has been any disturbance whatever.  A flash of lightning without thunder awakens
nobody.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
uttered a thick, smothered cry, as if he had been struck by some invisible
blow, and clasping his head between his clenched hands, he murmured: &quot;You
did that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Cleverly
enough, too; what do you think of it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
dethroned the king? imprisoned him, too?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
that has been done.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
such an action was committed <i>here</i>, at
Vaux?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
here, at Vaux, in the Chamber of Morpheus. 
It would almost seem that it had been built in anticipation of such an
act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
at what time did it occur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Last
night, between twelve and one o'clock.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
made a movement as if he were on the point of springing upon Aramis; he
restrained himself.  &quot;At Vaux;
under my roof!&quot; he said, in a half-strangled voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
believe so! for it is still your house, and it is likely to continue so, since
M. Colbert cannot rob you of it now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
was under my roof, then, monsieur, that you committed this crime?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;This
crime?&quot; said Aramis, stupefied.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;This
abominable crime!&quot; pursued Fouquet, becoming more and more excited;
&quot;this crime more execrable than an assassination! this crime which
dishonors my name forever, and entails upon me the horror of posterity.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are not in your senses, monsieur,&quot; replied Aramis, in an irresolute tone
of voice; &quot;you are speaking too loudly; take care!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will call out so loudly, that the whole world shall hear me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
Fouquet, take care!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
turned round towards the prelate, whom he looked at full in the face.  &quot;You have dishonored me,&quot; he said,
&quot;in committing so foul an act of treason, so heinous a crime upon my
guest, upon one who was peacefully reposing beneath my roof.  Oh! woe, woe is me!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Woe
to the man, rather, who beneath your roof meditated the ruin of your fortune,
your life.  Do you forget that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
was my guest, my sovereign.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis rose,
his eyes literally bloodshot, his mouth trembling convulsively.  &quot;Have I a man out of his senses to deal
with?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have an honorable man to deal with.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are mad.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
man who will prevent you consummating your crime.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are mad, I say.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
man who would sooner, oh! far sooner, die; who would kill you even, rather than
allow you to complete his dishonor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
Fouquet snatched up his sword, which D'Artagnan had placed at the head of his
bed, and clenched it resolutely in his hand. 
Aramis frowned, and thrust his hand into his breast as if in search of a
weapon.  This movement did not escape
Fouquet, who, full of nobleness and pride in his magnanimity, threw his sword
to a distance from him, and approached Aramis so close as to touch his shoulder
with his disarmed hand. 
&quot;Monsieur,&quot; he said, &quot;I would sooner die here on the spot
than survive this terrible disgrace; and if you have any pity left for me, I
entreat you to take my life.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
remained silent and motionless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
do not reply?&quot; said Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
raised his head gently, and a glimmer of hope might be seen once more to
animate his eyes.  &quot;Reflect,
monseigneur,&quot; he said, &quot;upon everything we have to expect.  As the matter now stands, the king is still
alive, and his imprisonment saves your life.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,&quot;
replied Fouquet, &quot;you may have been acting on my behalf, but I will not,
do not, accept your services.  But,
first of all, I do not wish your ruin. 
You will leave this house.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
stifled the exclamation which almost escaped his broken heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am hospitable towards all who are dwellers beneath my roof,&quot; continued
Fouquet, with an air of inexpressible majesty; &quot;you will not be more
fatally lost than he whose ruin you have consummated.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will be so,&quot; said Aramis, in a hoarse, prophetic voice, &quot;you will be
so, believe me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
accept the augury, Monsieur d'Herblay; but nothing shall prevent me, nothing
shall stop me.  You will leave Vaux -
you must leave France; I give you four hours to place yourself out of the king's
reach.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Four
hours?&quot; said Aramis, scornfully and incredulously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Upon
the word of Fouquet, no one shall follow you before the expiration of that
time.  You will therefore have four
hours' advance of those whom the king may wish to dispatch after you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Four
hours!&quot; repeated Aramis, in a thick, smothered voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is more than you will need to get on board a vessel and flee to Belle-Isle,
which I give you as a place of refuge.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
murmured Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Belle-Isle
is as much mine for you, as Vaux is mine for the king.  Go, D'Herblay, go! as long as I live, not a
hair of your head shall be injured.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Thank
you,&quot; said Aramis, with a cold irony of manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Go
at once, then, and give me your hand, before we both hasten away; you to save
your life, I to save my honor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
withdrew from his breast the hand he had concealed there; it was stained with
his blood.  He had dug his nails into
his flesh, as if in punishment for having nursed so many projects, more vain,
insensate, and fleeting than the life of the man himself.  Fouquet was horror-stricken, and then his
heart smote him with pity.  He threw
open his arms as if to embrace him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
had no arms,&quot; murmured Aramis, as wild and terrible in his wrath as the
shade of Dido.  And then, without touching
Fouquet's hand, he turned his head aside, and stepped back a pace or two.  His last word was an imprecation, his last
gesture a curse, which his blood-stained hand seemed to invoke, as it sprinkled
on Fouquet's face a few drops of blood which flowed from his breast.  And both of them darted out of the room by
the secret staircase which led down to the inner courtyard.  Fouquet ordered his best horses, while
Aramis paused at the foot of the staircase which led to Porthos's
apartment.  He reflected profoundly and
for some time, while Fouquet's carriage left the courtyard at full gallop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Shall
I go alone?&quot; said Aramis to himself, &quot;or warn the prince?  Oh! fury! 
Warn the prince, and then - do what? 
Take him with me?  To carry this
accusing witness about with me everywhere? 
War, too, would follow - civil war, implacable in its nature!  And without any resource save myself - it is
impossible!  What could he do without
me?  Oh! without me he will be utterly
destroyed.  Yet who knows - let destiny
be fulfilled - condemned he was, let him remain so then!  Good or evil Spirit - gloomy and scornful
Power, whom men call the genius of humanity, thou art a power more restlessly
uncertain, more baselessly useless, than wild mountain wind!  Chance, thou term'st thyself, but thou art
nothing; thou inflamest everything with thy breath, crumblest mountains at thy
approach, and suddenly art thyself destroyed at the presence of the Cross of
dead wood behind which stand another Power invisible like thyself - whom thou
deniest, perhaps, but whose avenging hand is on thee, and hurls thee in the
dust dishonored and unnamed!  Lost! - I
am lost!  What can be done?  Flee to Belle-Isle?  Yes, and leave Porthos behind me, to talk
and relate the whole affair to every one! 
Porthos, too, who will have to suffer for what he has done.  I will not let poor Porthos suffer.  He seems like one of the members of my own
frame; and his grief or misfortune would be mine as well.  Porthos shall leave with me, and shall
follow my destiny.  It must be so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
Aramis, apprehensive of meeting any one to whom his hurried movements might
appear suspicious, ascended the staircase without being perceived.  Porthos, so recently returned from Paris,
was already in a profound sleep; his huge body forgot its fatigue, as his mind
forgot its thoughts.  Aramis entered,
light as a shadow, and placed his nervous grasp on the giant's shoulder.  &quot;Come, Porthos,&quot; he cried, &quot;come.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos
obeyed, rose from his bed, opened his eyes, even before his intelligence seemed
to be aroused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
leave immediately,&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
returned Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
shall go mounted, and faster than we have ever gone in our lives.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
repeated Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Dress
yourself, my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And he helped
the giant to dress himself, and thrust his gold and diamonds into his
pocket.  Whilst he was thus engaged, a
slight noise attracted his attention, and on looking up, he saw D'Artagnan
watching them through the half-opened door. 
Aramis started.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
the devil are you doing there in such an agitated manner?&quot; said the
musketeer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Hush!&quot;
said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
are going off on a mission of great importance,&quot; added the bishop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are very fortunate,&quot; said the musketeer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
dear me!&quot; said Porthos, &quot;I feel so wearied; I would far sooner have
been fast asleep.  But the service of
the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Have
you seen M. Fouquet?&quot; said Aramis to D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
this very minute, in a carriage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
did he say to you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Adieu;'
nothing more.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Was
that all?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
else do you think he could say?  Am I
worth anything now, since you have got into such high favor?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Listen,&quot;
said Aramis, embracing the musketeer; &quot;your good times are returning
again.  You will have no occasion to be
jealous of any one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
bah!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
predict that something will happen to you to-day which will increase your
importance more than ever.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Really?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
know that I know all the news?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
yes!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come,
Porthos, are you ready?  Let us
go.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am quite ready, Aramis.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
us embrace D'Artagnan first.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Most
certainly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
the horses?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
there is no want of them here.  Will you
have mine?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No;
Porthos has his own stud.  So adieu!
adieu!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
fugitives mounted their horses beneath the very eyes of the captain of the
musketeers, who held Porthos's stirrup for him, and gazed after them until they
were out of sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;On
any other occasion,&quot; thought the Gascon, &quot;I should say that those
gentlemen were making their escape; but in these days politics seem so changed
that such an exit is termed going on a mission.  I have no objection; let me attend to my own affairs, that is
more than enough for <i>me</i>,&quot; - and
he philosophically entered his apartments.</p>

tore along as fast as his horses could drag him.  On his way he trembled with horror at the idea of what had just
been revealed to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
must have been,&quot; he thought, &quot;the youth of those extraordinary men,
who, even as age is stealing fast upon them, are still able to conceive such
gigantic plans, and carry them through without a tremor?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At one
moment he could not resist the idea that all Aramis had just been recounting to
him was nothing more than a dream, and whether the fable itself was not the
snare; so that when Fouquet arrived at the Bastile, he might possibly find an
order of arrest, which would send him to join the dethroned king.  Strongly impressed with this idea, he gave
certain sealed orders on his route, while fresh horses were being harnessed to
his carriage.  These orders were
addressed to M. d'Artagnan and to certain others whose fidelity to the king was
far above suspicion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
this way,&quot; said Fouquet to himself, &quot;prisoner or not, I shall have
performed the duty that I owe my honor. 
The orders will not reach them until after my return, if I should return
free, and consequently they will not have been unsealed.  I shall take them back again.  If I am delayed; it will be because some
misfortune will have befallen me; and in that case assistance will be sent for
me as well as for the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Prepared
in this manner, the superintendent arrived at the Bastile; he had traveled at
the rate of five leagues and a half the hour. 
Every circumstance of delay which Aramis had escaped in his visit to the
Bastile befell Fouquet.  It was useless
giving his name, equally useless his being recognized; he could not succeed in
obtaining an entrance.  By dint of
entreaties, threats, commands, he succeeded in inducing a sentinel to speak to
one of the subalterns, who went and told the major.  As for the governor they did not even dare disturb him.  Fouquet sat in his carriage, at the outer
gate of the fortress, chafing with rage and impatience, awaiting the return of
the officers, who at last re-appeared with a sufficiently sulky air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,&quot;
said Fouquet, impatiently, &quot;what did the major say?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
monsieur,&quot; replied the soldier, &quot;the major laughed in my face.  He told me that M. Fouquet was at Vaux, and
that even were he at Paris, M. Fouquet would not get up at so early an hour as
the present.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Mordieu!</i> you are an absolute set of
fools,&quot; cried the minister, darting out of the carriage; and before the
subaltern had time to shut the gate, Fouquet sprang through it, and ran forward
in spite of the soldier, who cried out for assistance.  Fouquet gained ground, regardless of the
cries of the man, who, however, having at last come up with Fouquet, called out
to the sentinel of the second gate, &quot;Look out, look out,
sentinel!&quot;  The man crossed his
pike before the minister; but the latter, robust and active, and hurried away,
too, by his passion, wrested the pike from the soldier and struck him a violent
blow on the shoulder with it.  The subaltern,
who approached too closely, received a share of the blows as well.  Both of them uttered loud and furious cries,
at the sound of which the whole of the first body of the advanced guard poured
out of the guardhouse.  Among them there
was one, however, who recognized the superintendent, and who called,
&quot;Monseigneur, ah! monseigneur. 
Stop, stop, you fellows!&quot; 
And he effectually checked the soldiers, who were on the point of
revenging their companions.  Fouquet
desired them to open the gate, but they refused to do so without the
countersign; he desired them to inform the governor of his presence; but the
latter had already heard the disturbance at the gate.  He ran forward, followed by his major, and accompanied by a
picket of twenty men, persuaded that an attack was being made on the
Bastile.  Baisemeaux also recognized
Fouquet immediately, and dropped the sword he bravely had been brandishing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
monseigneur,&quot; he stammered, &quot;how can I excuse - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
said the superintendent, flushed with anger, and heated by his exertions,
&quot;I congratulate you.  Your watch
and ward are admirably kept.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Baisemeaux
turned pale, thinking that this remark was made ironically, and portended a
furious burst of anger.  But Fouquet had
recovered his breath, and, beckoning the sentinel and the subaltern, who were
rubbing their shoulders, towards him, he said, &quot;There are twenty pistoles
for the sentinel, and fifty for the officer. 
Pray receive my compliments, gentlemen. 
I will not fail to speak to his majesty about you.  And now, M. Baisemeaux, a word with
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And he
followed the governor to his official residence, accompanied by a murmur of
general satisfaction.  Baisemeaux was
already trembling with shame and uneasiness. 
Aramis's early visit, from that moment, seemed to possess consequences,
which a functionary such as he (Baisemeaux) was, was perfectly justified in
apprehending.  It was quite another
thing, however, when Fouquet in a sharp tone of voice, and with an imperious
look, said, &quot;You have seen M. d'Herblay this morning?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
are you not horrified at the crime of which you have made yourself an
accomplice?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,&quot;
thought Baisemeaux, &quot;good so far;&quot; and then he added, aloud,
&quot;But what crime, monseigneur, do you allude to?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
for which you can be quartered alive, monsieur - do not forget that!  But this is not a time to show anger.  Conduct me immediately to the
prisoner.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
what prisoner?&quot; said Baisemeaux, trembling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
pretend to be ignorant?  Very good - it
is the best plan for you, perhaps; for if, in fact, you were to admit your
participation in such a crime, it would be all over with you.  I wish, therefore, to seem to believe in
your assumption of ignorance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
entreat you, monseigneur - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
will do.  Lead me to the prisoner.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
Marchiali?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
is Marchiali?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
prisoner who was brought back this morning by M. d'Herblay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
is called Marchiali?&quot; said the superintendent, his conviction somewhat
shaken by Baisemeaux's cool manner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur; that is the name under which he was inscribed here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
looked steadily at Baisemeaux, as if he would read his very heart; and
perceived, with that clear-sightedness most men possess who are accustomed to
the exercise of power, that the man was speaking with perfect sincerity.  Besides, in observing his face for a few
moments, he could not believe that Aramis would have chosen such a confidant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is the prisoner,&quot; said the superintendent to him, &quot;whom M. d'Herblay
carried away the day before yesterday?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
whom he brought back this morning?&quot; added Fouquet, quickly: for he
understood immediately the mechanism of Aramis's plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Precisely,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
his name is Marchiali, you say?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
Marchiali.  If monseigneur has come here
to remove him, so much the better, for I was going to write about him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
has he done, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ever
since this morning he has annoyed me extremely.  He has had such terrible fits of passion, as almost to make me
believe that he would bring the Bastile itself down about our ears.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will soon relieve you of his possession,&quot; said Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
so much the better.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Conduct
me to his prison.&quot;<br>                &quot;Will monseigneur
give me the order?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
order?&quot;<br>                &quot;An order from the
king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Wait
until I sign you one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
will not be sufficient, monseigneur.  I
must have an order from the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
assumed an irritated expression. 
&quot;As you are so scrupulous,&quot; he said, &quot;with regard to
allowing prisoners to leave, show me the order by which this one was set at
liberty.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Baisemeaux
showed him the order to release Seldon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
good,&quot; said Fouquet; &quot;but Seldon is not Marchiali.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
Marchiali is not at liberty, monseigneur; he is here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
you said that M. d'Herblay carried him away and brought him back again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
did not say so.&quot;<br>                &quot;So surely did you
say it, that I almost seem to hear it now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
was a slip of my tongue, then, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Take
care, M. Baisemeaux, take care.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have nothing to fear, monseigneur; I am acting according to the very strictest
regulation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Do you dare to say so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I would say so in the
presence of one of the apostles.  M.
d'Herblay brought me an order to set Seldon at liberty.  Seldon is free.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I tell you that Marchiali has
left the Bastile.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You must prove that,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Let me see him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You, monseigneur, who govern
this kingdom, know very well that no one can see any of the prisoners without
an express order from the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;M. d'Herblay has entered,
however.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That remains to be proved,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;M. de Baisemeaux, once more I
warn you to pay particular attention to what you are saying.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;All the documents are there,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;M. d'Herblay is
overthrown.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Overthrown? - M.
d'Herblay!  Impossible!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You see that he has undoubtedly
influenced you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No, monseigneur; what does,
in fact, influence me, is the king's service. 
I am doing my duty.  Give me an
order from him, and you shall enter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Stay, M. le gouverneur, I
give you my word that if you allow me to see the prisoner, I will give you an
order from the king at once.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Give it to me now,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And that, if you refuse me, I
will have you and all your officers arrested on the spot.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Before you commit such an act
of violence, monseigneur, you will reflect,&quot; said Baisemeaux, who had
turned very pale, &quot;that we will only obey an order signed by the king; and
that it will be just as easy for you to obtain one to see Marchiali as to
obtain one to do me so much injury; me, too, who am perfectly innocent.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;True.  True!&quot; cried Fouquet, furiously;
&quot;perfectly true.  M. de
Baisemeaux,&quot; he added, in a sonorous voice, drawing the unhappy governor
towards him, &quot;do you know why I am so anxious to speak to the
prisoner?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No, monseigneur; and allow me
to observe that you are terrifying me out of my senses; I am trembling all over
- in fact, I feel as though I were about to faint.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You will stand a better
chance of fainting outright, Monsieur Baisemeaux, when I return here at the
head of ten thousand men and thirty pieces of cannon.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Good heavens, monseigneur,
you are losing your senses.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;When I have roused the whole
population of Paris against you and your accursed towers, and have battered
open the gates of this place, and hanged you to the topmost tree of yonder
pinnacle!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monseigneur! monseigneur! for
pity's sake!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I give you ten minutes to
make up your mind,&quot; added Fouquet, in a calm voice.  &quot;I will sit down here, in this
armchair, and wait for you; if, in ten minutes' time, you still persist, I
leave this place, and you may think me as mad as you like.  Then - you shall <i>see!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Baisemeaux stamped his foot on the
ground like a man in a state of despair, but he did not reply a single
syllable; whereupon Fouquet seized a pen and ink, and wrote:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Order for M. le Prévôt des
Marchands to assemble the municipal guard and to march upon the Bastile on the
king's immediate service.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Baisemeaux shrugged his
shoulders.  Fouquet wrote:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Order for the Duc de Bouillon
and M. le Prince de Condé to assume the command of the Swiss guards, of the king's
guards, and to march upon the Bastile on the king's immediate service.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Baisemeaux reflected.  Fouquet still wrote:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Order for every soldier,
citizen, or gentleman to seize and apprehend, wherever he may be found, le
Chevalier d'Herblay, Evêque de Vannes, and his accomplices, who are: first, M.
de Baisemeaux, governor of the Bastile, suspected of the crimes of high treason
and rebellion - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Stop, monseigneur!&quot;
cried Baisemeaux; &quot;I do not understand a single jot of the whole matter;
but so many misfortunes, even were it madness itself that had set them at their
awful work, might happen here in a couple of hours, that the king, by whom I
must be judged, will see whether I have been wrong in withdrawing the
countersign before this flood of imminent catastrophes.  Come with me to the keep, monseigneur, you
shall see Marchiali.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet darted out of the room,
followed by Baisemeaux as he wiped the perspiration from his face.  &quot;What a terrible morning!&quot; he
said; &quot;what a disgrace for <i>me!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Walk faster,&quot; replied
Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Baisemeaux made a sign to the
jailer to precede them.  He was afraid
of his companion, which the latter could not fail to perceive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;A truce to this child's
play,&quot; he said, roughly.  &quot;Let
the man remain here; take the keys yourself, and show me the way.  Not a single person, do you understand, must
hear what is going to take place here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah!&quot; said Baisemeaux,
undecided.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Again!&quot; cried M.
Fouquet.  &quot;Ah! say 'no' at once,
and I will leave the Bastile and will myself carry my own dispatches.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Baisemeaux bowed his head, took the
keys, and unaccompanied, except by the minister, ascended the staircase.  The higher they advanced up the spiral
staircase, the more clearly did certain muffled murmurs become distinct appeals
and fearful imprecations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What is that?&quot; asked
Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is your Marchiali,&quot;
said the governor; &quot;this is the way these madmen scream.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>And he accompanied that reply with
a glance more pregnant with injurious allusion, as far as Fouquet was
concerned, than politeness.  The latter
trembled; he had just recognized in one cry more terrible than any that had
preceded it, the king's voice.  He
paused on the staircase, snatching the bunch of keys from Baisemeaux, who
thought this new madman was going to dash out his brains with one of them.  &quot;Ah!&quot; he cried, &quot;M. d'Herblay
did not say a word about that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Give me the keys at
once!&quot; cried Fouquet, tearing them from his hand.  &quot;Which is the key of the door I am to
open?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>A fearful cry, followed by a
violent blow against the door, made the whole staircase resound with the echo.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Leave this place,&quot; said
Fouquet to Baisemeaux, in a threatening tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I ask nothing better,&quot;
murmured the latter, to himself. 
&quot;There will be a couple of madmen face to face, and the one will
kill the other, I am sure.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Go!&quot; repeated
Fouquet.  &quot;If you place your foot
on this staircase before I call you, remember that you shall take the place of
the meanest prisoner in the Bastile.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;This job will kill me, I am
sure it will,&quot; muttered Baisemeaux, as he withdrew with tottering steps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The prisoner's cries became more
and more terrible.  When Fouquet had
satisfied himself that Baisemeaux had reached the bottom of the staircase, he
inserted the key in the first lock.  It
was then that he heard the hoarse, choking voice of the king, crying out, in a
frenzy of rage, &quot;Help, help!  I am
the king.&quot;  The key of the second
door was not the same as the first, and Fouquet was obliged to look for it on
the bunch.  The king, however, furious
and almost mad with rage and passion, shouted at the top of his voice, &quot;It
was M. Fouquet who brought me here. 
Help me against M. Fouquet!  I am
the king!  Help the king against M.
Fouquet!&quot;  These cries filled the
minister's heart with terrible emotions. 
They were followed by a shower of blows leveled against the door with a
part of the broken chair with which the king had armed himself.  Fouquet at last succeeded in finding the
key.  The king was almost exhausted; he
could hardly articulate distinctly as he shouted, &quot;Death to Fouquet! death
to the traitor Fouquet!&quot;  The door
flew open.</p>

two men were on the point of darting towards each other when they suddenly and
abruptly stopped, as a mutual recognition took place, and each uttered a cry of
horror.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Have
you come to assassinate me, monsieur?&quot; said the king, when he recognized
Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
king in this state!&quot; murmured the minister.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Nothing
could be more terrible indeed than the appearance of the young prince at the
moment Fouquet had surprised him; his clothes were in tatters; his shirt, open
and torn to rags, was stained with sweat and with the blood which streamed from
his lacerated breast and arms.  Haggard,
ghastly pale, his hair in disheveled masses, Louis XIV. presented the most
perfect picture of despair, distress, anger and fear combined that could
possibly be united in one figure. 
Fouquet was so touched, so affected and disturbed by it, that he ran
towards him with his arms stretched out and his eyes filled with tears.  Louis held up the massive piece of wood of
which he had made such a furious use.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Sire,&quot;
said Fouquet, in a voice trembling with emotion, &quot;do you not recognize the
most faithful of your friends?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
friend - you!&quot; repeated Louis, gnashing his teeth in a manner which
betrayed his hate and desire for speedy vengeance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
most respectful of your servants,&quot; added Fouquet, throwing himself on his
knees.  The king let the rude weapon
fall from his grasp.  Fouquet approached
him, kissed his knees, and took him in his arms with inconceivable tenderness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
king, my child,&quot; he said, &quot;how you must have suffered!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Louis,
recalled to himself by the change of situation, looked at himself, and ashamed
of the disordered state of his apparel, ashamed of his conduct, and ashamed of
the air of pity and protection that was shown towards him, drew back.  Fouquet did not understand this movement; he
did not perceive that the king's feeling of pride would never forgive him for
having been a witness of such an exhibition of weakness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come,
sire,&quot; he said, &quot;you are free.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Free?&quot;
repeated the king.  &quot;Oh! you set me
at liberty, then, after having dared to lift up your hand against me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
do not believe that!&quot; exclaimed Fouquet, indignantly; &quot;you cannot
believe me to be guilty of such an act.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
rapidly, warmly even, he related the whole particulars of the intrigue, the
details of which are already known to the reader.  While the recital continued, Louis suffered the most horrible
anguish of mind; and when it was finished, the magnitude of the danger he had
run struck him far more than the importance of the secret relative to his twin
brother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
he said, suddenly to Fouquet, &quot;this double birth is a falsehood; it is
impossible - you cannot have been the dupe of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Sire!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is impossible, I tell you, that the honor, the virtue of my mother can be
suspected, and my first minister has not yet done justice on the
criminals!&quot;<br>                &quot;Reflect, sire,
before you are hurried away by anger,&quot; replied Fouquet.  &quot;The birth of your brother - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have only one brother - and that is Monsieur. 
You know it as well as myself. 
There is a plot, I tell you, beginning with the governor of the
Bastile.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Be
careful, sire, for this man has been deceived as every one else has by the
prince's likeness to yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Likeness?  Absurd!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;This
Marchiali must be singularly like your majesty, to be able to deceive every
one's eye,&quot; Fouquet persisted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ridiculous!&quot;<br>                &quot;Do not say so, sire;
those who had prepared everything in order to face and deceive your ministers,
your mother, your officers of state, the members of your family, must be quite
confident of the resemblance between you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
where are these persons, then?&quot; murmured the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;At
Vaux.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;At
Vaux! and you suffer them to remain there!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
most instant duty appeared to me to be your majesty's release.  I have accomplished that duty; and now,
whatever your majesty may command, shall be done.  I await your orders.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Louis
reflected for a few moments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Muster
all the troops in Paris,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;All
the necessary orders are given for that purpose,&quot; replied Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have given orders!&quot; exclaimed the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;For
that purpose, yes, sire; your majesty will be at the head of ten thousand men
in less than an hour.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
only reply the king made was to take hold of Fouquet's hand with such an
expression of feeling, that it was very easy to perceive how strongly he had,
until that remark, maintained his suspicions of the minister, notwithstanding
the latter's intervention.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
with these troops,&quot; he said, &quot;we shall go at once and besiege in your
house the rebels who by this time will have established and intrenched
themselves therein.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
should be surprised if that were the case,&quot; replied Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Because
their chief - the very soul of the enterprise - having been unmasked by me, the
whole plan seems to me to have miscarried.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have unmasked this false prince also?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
I have not seen him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Whom
have you seen, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
leader of the enterprise, not that unhappy young man; the latter is merely an
instrument, destined through his whole life to wretchedness, I plainly
perceive.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Most
certainly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is M. l'Abbé d'Herblay, Evêque de Vannes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Your friend?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He was my friend, sire,&quot;
replied Fouquet, nobly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;An unfortunate circumstance
for you,&quot; said the king, in a less generous tone of voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Such friendships, sire, had
nothing dishonorable in them so long as I was ignorant of the crime.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You should have foreseen
it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;If I am guilty, I place
myself in your majesty's hands.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah!  Monsieur Fouquet, it was not that I meant,&quot; returned the
king, sorry to have shown the bitterness of his thought in such a manner.  &quot;Well! 
I assure you that, notwithstanding the mask with which the villain
covered his face, I had something like a vague suspicion that he was the very
man.  But with this chief of the
enterprise there was a man of prodigious strength, the one who menaced me with
a force almost herculean; what is he?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It must be his friend the
Baron du Vallon, formerly one of the musketeers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The friend of D'Artagnan? the
friend of the Comte de la Fère? 
Ah!&quot; exclaimed the king, as he paused at the name of the latter,
&quot;we must not forget the connection that existed between the conspirators
and M. de Bragelonne.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Sire, sire, do not go too
far.  M. de la Fère is the most
honorable man in France.  Be satisfied
with those whom I deliver up to you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;With those whom you deliver
up to me, you say?  Very good, for you
will deliver up those who are guilty to me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What does your majesty
understand by that?&quot; inquired Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I understand,&quot; replied
the king, &quot;that we shall soon arrive at Vaux with a large body of troops,
that we will lay violent hands upon that nest of vipers, and that not a soul
shall escape.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Your majesty will put these
men to death!&quot; cried Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;To the very meanest of
them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Let us understand one
another, Monsieur Fouquet,&quot; said the king, haughtily.  &quot;We no longer live in times when
assassination was the only and the last resource kings held in reservation at
extremity.  No, Heaven be praised!  I have parliaments who sit and judge in my
name, and I have scaffolds on which supreme authority is carried out.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet turned pale.  &quot;I will take the liberty of observing to
your majesty, that any proceedings instituted respecting these matters would
bring down the greatest scandal upon the dignity of the throne.  The august name of Anne of Austria must
never be allowed to pass the lips of the people accompanied by a smile.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Justice must be done,
however, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Good, sire; but royal blood
must not be shed upon a scaffold.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The royal blood! you believe
that!&quot; cried the king with fury in his voice, stamping his foot on the
ground.  &quot;This double birth is an
invention; and in that invention, particularly, do I see M. d'Herblay's
crime.  It is the crime I wish to punish
rather than the violence, or the insult.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And punish it with death,
sire?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;With death; yes, monsieur, I
have said it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Sire,&quot; said the
surintendant, with firmness, as he raised his head proudly, &quot;your majesty
will take the life, if you please, of your brother Philippe of France; that
concerns you alone, and you will doubtless consult the queen-mother upon the
subject.  Whatever she may command will
be perfectly correct.  I do not wish to
mix myself up in it, not even for the honor of your crown, but I have a favor
to ask of you, and I beg to submit it to you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Speak,&quot; said the king,
in no little degree agitated by his minister's last words.  &quot;What do you require?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The pardon of M. d'Herblay
and of M. du Vallon.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;My assassins?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Two rebels, sire, that is
all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh!  I understand, then, you ask me to forgive your friends.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;My friends!&quot; said
Fouquet, deeply wounded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Your friends, certainly; but
the safety of the state requires that an exemplary punishment should be
inflicted on the guilty.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I will not permit myself to
remind your majesty that I have just restored you to liberty, and have saved
your life.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I will not allow myself to
remind your majesty that had M. d'Herblay wished to carry out his character of
an assassin, he could very easily have assassinated your majesty this morning
in the forest of Senart, and all would have been over.&quot;  The king started.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;A pistol-bullet through the
head,&quot; pursued Fouquet, &quot;and the disfigured features of Louis XIV.,
which no one could have recognized, would be M. d'Herblay's complete and entire
justification.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king turned pale and giddy at
the bare idea of the danger he had escaped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;If M. d'Herblay,&quot;
continued Fouquet, &quot;had been an assassin, he had no occasion to inform me
of his plan in order to succeed.  Freed
from the real king, it would have been impossible in all futurity to guess the
false.  And if the usurper had been
recognized by Anne of Austria, he would still have been - her son.  The usurper, as far as Monsieur d'Herblay's
conscience was concerned, was still a king of the blood of Louis XIII.  Moreover, the conspirator, in that course,
would have had security, secrecy, impunity. 
A pistol-bullet would have procured him all that.  For the sake of Heaven, sire, grant me his
forgiveness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king, instead of being touched
by the picture, so faithfully drawn in all details, of Aramis's generosity,
felt himself most painfully and cruelly humiliated.  His unconquerable pride revolted at the idea that a man had held
suspended at the end of his finger the thread of his royal life.  Every word that fell from Fouquet's lips,
and which he thought most efficacious in procuring his friend's pardon, seemed
to pour another drop of poison into the already ulcerated heart of Louis
XIV.  Nothing could bend or soften
him.  Addressing himself to Fouquet, he
said, &quot;I really don't know, monsieur, why you should solicit the pardon of
these men.  What good is there in asking
that which can be obtained without solicitation?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I do not understand you,
sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It is not difficult,
either.  Where am I now?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In the Bastile, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes; in a dungeon.  I am looked upon as a madman, am I
not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And no one is known here but
Marchiali?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well; change nothing in the
position of affairs.  Let the poor
madman rot between the slimy walls of the Bastile, and M. d'Herblay and M. du
Vallon will stand in no need of my forgiveness.  Their new king will absolve them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Your majesty does me a great
injustice, sire; and you are wrong,&quot; replied Fouquet, dryly; &quot;I am
not child enough, nor is M. d'Herblay silly enough, to have omitted to make all
these reflections; and if I had wished to make a new king, as you say, I had no
occasion to have come here to force open the gates and doors of the Bastile, to
free you from this place.  That would
show a want of even common sense.  Your
majesty's mind is disturbed by anger; otherwise you would be far from
offending, groundlessly, the very one of your servants who has rendered you the
most important service of all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Louis perceived that he had gone
too far; that the gates of the Bastile were still closed upon him, whilst, by
degrees, the floodgates were gradually being opened, behind which the
generous-hearted Fouquet had restrained his anger.  &quot;I did not say that to humiliate you, Heaven knows,
monsieur,&quot; he replied.  &quot;Only
you are addressing yourself to me in order to obtain a pardon, and I answer
according to my conscience.  And so,
judging by my conscience, the criminals we speak of are not worthy of
consideration or forgiveness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet was silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What I do is as
generous,&quot; added the king, &quot;as what you have done, for I am in your power.  I will even say it is more generous,
inasmuch as you place before me certain conditions upon which my liberty, my
life, may depend; and to reject which is to make a sacrifice of both.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I was wrong, certainly,&quot;
replied Fouquet.  &quot;Yes, - I had the
appearance of extorting a favor; I regret it, and entreat your majesty's
forgiveness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And you are forgiven, my dear
Monsieur Fouquet,&quot; said the king, with a smile, which restored the serene
expression of his features, which so many circumstances had altered since the
preceding evening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I have my own
forgiveness,&quot; replied the minister, with some degree of persistence;
&quot;but M. d'Herblay, and M. du Vallon?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;They will never obtain
theirs, as long as I live,&quot; replied the inflexible king.  &quot;Do me the kindness not to speak of it
again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Your majesty shall be
obeyed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And you will bear me no
ill-will for it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! no, sire; for I
anticipated the event.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You had 'anticipated' that I
should refuse to forgive those gentlemen?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Certainly; and all my
measures were taken in consequence.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What do you mean to
say?&quot; cried the king, surprised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;M. d'Herblay came, as may be
said, to deliver himself into my hands. 
M. d'Herblay left to me the happiness of saving my king and my
country.  I could not condemn M. d'Herblay
to death; nor could I, on the other hand, expose him to your majesty's
justifiable wrath; it would have been just the same as if I had killed him
myself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well! and what have you
done?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Sire, I gave M. d'Herblay the
best horses in my stables and four hours' start over all those your majesty
might, probably, dispatch after him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Be it so!&quot; murmured the
king.  &quot;But still, the world is
wide enough and large enough for those whom I may send to overtake your horses,
notwithstanding the 'four hours' start' which you have given to M.
d'Herblay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In giving him these four
hours, sire, I knew I was giving him his life, and he will save his life.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In what way?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;After having galloped as hard
as possible, with the four hours' start, before your musketeers, he will reach
my château of Belle-Isle, where I have given him a safe asylum.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That may be!  But you forget that you have made me a
present of Belle-Isle.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;But not for you to arrest my
friends.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You take it back again,
then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;As far as that goes - yes,
sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;My musketeers shall capture
it, and the affair will be at an end.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Neither your musketeers, nor
your whole army could take Belle-Isle,&quot; said Fouquet, coldly.  &quot;Belle-Isle is impregnable.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king became perfectly livid; a
lightning flash seemed to dart from his eyes. 
Fouquet felt that he was lost, but he as not one to shrink when the
voice of honor spoke loudly within him. 
He bore the king's wrathful gaze; the latter swallowed his rage, and
after a few moments' silence, said, &quot;Are we going to return to Vaux?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I am at your majesty's
orders,&quot; replied Fouquet, with a low bow; &quot;but I think that your
majesty can hardly dispense with changing your clothes previous to appearing
before your court.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;We shall pass by the
Louvre,&quot; said the king. 
&quot;Come.&quot;  And they left
the prison, passing before Baisemeaux, who looked completely bewildered as he
saw Marchiali once more leave; and, in his helplessness, tore out the major
portion of his few remaining hairs.  It
was perfectly true, however, that Fouquet wrote and gave him an authority for
the prisoner's release, and that the king wrote beneath it, &quot;Seen and
approved, Louis&quot;; a piece of madness that Baisemeaux, incapable of putting
two ideas together, acknowledged by giving himself a terrible blow on the forehead
with his own fist.</p>

the meantime, usurped royalty was playing out its part bravely at Vaux.  Philippe gave orders that for his <i>petit lever</i> the <i>grandes entrées</i>, already prepared to appear before the king, should
be introduced.  He determined to give
this order notwithstanding the absence of M. d'Herblay, who did not return -
our readers know the reason.  But the
prince, not believing that absence could be prolonged, wished, as all rash
spirits do, to try his valor and his fortune far from all protection and
instruction.  Another reason urged him
to this - Anne of Austria was about to appear; the guilty mother was about to
stand in the presence of her sacrificed son. 
Philippe was not willing, if he had a weakness, to render the man a
witness of it before whom he was bound thenceforth to display so much
strength.  Philippe opened his folding
doors, and several persons entered silently. 
Philippe did not stir whilst his <i>valets
de chambre</i> dressed him.  He had
watched, the evening before, all the habits of his brother, and played the king
in such a manner as to awaken no suspicion. 
He was thus completely dressed in hunting costume when he received his
visitors.  His own memory and the notes
of Aramis announced everybody to him, first of all Anne of Austria, to whom
Monsieur gave his hand, and then Madame with M. de Saint-Aignan.  He smiled at seeing these countenances, but
trembled on recognizing his mother. 
That still so noble and imposing figure, ravaged by pain, pleaded in his
heart the cause of the famous queen who had immolated a child to reasons of
state.  He found his mother still
handsome.  He knew that Louis XIV. loved
her, and he promised himself to love her likewise, and not to prove a scourge
to her old age.  He contemplated his
brother with a tenderness easily to be understood.  The latter had usurped nothing, had cast no shades athwart his
life.  A separate tree, he allowed the
stem to rise without heeding its elevation or majestic life.  Philippe promised himself to be a kind
brother to this prince, who required nothing but gold to minister to his
pleasures.  He bowed with a friendly air
to Saint-Aignan, who was all reverences and smiles, and trembling held out his
hand to Henrietta, his sister-in-law, whose beauty struck him; but he saw in
the eyes of that princess an expression of coldness which would facilitate, as
he thought, their future relations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
much more easy,&quot; thought he, &quot;it will be to be the brother of that
woman than her gallant, if she evinces towards me a coldness that my brother
could not have for her, but which is imposed upon me as a duty.&quot;  The only visit he dreaded at this moment was
that of the queen; his heart - his mind - had just been shaken by so violent a
trial, that, in spite of their firm temperament, they would not, perhaps,
support another shock.  Happily the
queen did not come.  Then commenced, on
the part of Anne of Austria, a political dissertation upon the welcome M.
Fouquet had given to the house of France. 
She mixed up hostilities with compliments addressed to the king, and
questions as to his health, with little maternal flatteries and diplomatic
artifices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
my son,&quot; said she, &quot;are you convinced with regard to M.
Fouquet?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Saint-Aignan,&quot;
said Philippe, &quot;have the goodness to go and inquire after the queen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At
these words, the first Philippe had pronounced aloud, the slight difference
that there was between his voice and that of the king was sensible to maternal
ears, and Anne of Austria looked earnestly at her son.  Saint-Aignan left the room, and Philippe
continued:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Madame,
I do not like to hear M. Fouquet ill-spoken of, you know I do not - and you
have even spoken well of him yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is true; therefore I only question you on the state of your sentiments with respect
to him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Sire,&quot;
said Henrietta, &quot;I, on my part, have always liked M. Fouquet.  He is a man of good taste, - a superior
man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
superintendent who is never sordid or niggardly,&quot; added Monsieur;
&quot;and who pays in gold all the orders I have on him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Every
one in this thinks too much of himself, and nobody for the state,&quot; said
the old queen.  &quot;M. Fouquet, it is
a fact, M. Fouquet is ruining the state.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
mother!&quot; replied Philippe, in rather a lower key, &quot;do you likewise
constitute yourself the buckler of M. Colbert?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
is that?&quot; replied the old queen, rather surprised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
in truth,&quot; replied Philippe, &quot;you speak that just as your old friend
Madame de Chevreuse would speak.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why
do you mention Madame de Chevreuse to me?&quot; said she, &quot;and what sort
of humor are you in to-day towards me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Philippe
continued: &quot;Is not Madame de Chevreuse always in league against
somebody?  Has not Madame de Chevreuse
been to pay you a visit, mother?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,
you speak to me now in such a manner that I can almost fancy I am listening to
your father.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
father did not like Madame de Chevreuse, and had good reason for not liking
her,&quot; said the prince.  &quot;For
my part, I like her no better than <i>he</i>
did, and if she thinks proper to come here as she formerly did, to sow
divisions and hatreds under the pretext of begging money - why - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!
what?&quot; said Anne of Austria, proudly, herself provoking the storm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!&quot;
replied the young man firmly, &quot;I will drive Madame de Chevreuse out of my
kingdom - and with her all who meddle with its secrets and mysteries.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He had
not calculated the effect of this terrible speech, or perhaps he wished to
judge the effect of it, like those who, suffering from a chronic pain, and
seeking to break the monotony of that suffering, touch their wound to procure a
sharper pang.  Anne of Austria was
nearly fainting; her eyes, open but meaningless, ceased to see for several
seconds; she stretched out her arms towards her other son, who supported and
embraced her without fear of irritating the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Sire,&quot;
murmured she, &quot;you are treating your mother very cruelly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
what respect, madame?&quot; replied he. 
&quot;I am only speaking of Madame de Chevreuse; does my mother prefer
Madame de Chevreuse to the security of the state and of my person?  Well, then, madame, I tell you Madame de
Chevreuse has returned to France to borrow money, and that she addressed
herself to M. Fouquet to sell him a certain secret.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
certain secret!&quot; cried Anne of Austria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Concerning
pretended robberies that monsieur le surintendant had committed, which is
false,&quot; added Philippe.  &quot;M.
Fouquet rejected her offers with indignation, preferring the esteem of the king
to complicity with such intriguers. 
Then Madame de Chevreuse sold the secret to M. Colbert, and as she is insatiable,
and was not satisfied with having extorted a hundred thousand crowns from a
servant of the state, she has taken a still bolder flight, in search of surer
sources of supply.  Is that true,
madame?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
know all, sire,&quot; said the queen, more uneasy than irritated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Now,&quot;
continued Philippe, &quot;I have good reason to dislike this fury, who comes to
my court to plan the shame of some and the ruin of others.  If Heaven has suffered certain crimes to be committed,
and has concealed them in the shadow of its clemency, I will not permit Madame
de Chevreuse to counteract the just designs of fate.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
latter part of this speech had so agitated the queen-mother, that her son had
pity on her.  He took her hand and
kissed it tenderly; she did not feel that in that kiss, given in spite of
repulsion and bitterness of the heart, there was a pardon for eight years of
suffering.  Philippe allowed the silence
of a moment to swallow the emotions that had just developed themselves.  Then, with a cheerful smile:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
will not go to-day,&quot; said he, &quot;I have a plan.&quot;  And, turning towards the door, he hoped to
see Aramis, whose absence began to alarm him. 
The queen-mother wished to leave the room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Remain
where you are, mother,&quot; said he, &quot;I wish you to make your peace with
M. Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
bear M. Fouquet no ill-will; I only dreaded his prodigalities.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
will put that to rights, and will take nothing of the superintendent but his
good qualities.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is your majesty looking for?&quot; said Henrietta, seeing the king's eyes
constantly turned towards the door, and wishing to let fly a little poisoned
arrow at his heart, supposing he was so anxiously expecting either La Vallière
or a letter from her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
sister,&quot; said the young man, who had divined her thought, thanks to that
marvelous perspicuity of which fortune was from that time about to allow him
the exercise, &quot;my sister, I am expecting a most distinguished man, a most
able counselor, whom I wish to present to you all, recommending him to your
good graces.  Ah! come in, then,
D'Artagnan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
does your majesty wish?&quot; said D'Artagnan, appearing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Where
is monsieur the bishop of Vannes, your friend?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
sire - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am waiting for him, and he does not come. 
Let him be sought for.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
remained for an instant stupefied; but soon, reflecting that Aramis had left
Vaux privately on a mission from the king, he concluded that the king wished to
preserve the secret.  &quot;Sire,&quot;
replied he, &quot;does your majesty absolutely require M. d'Herblay to be
brought to you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Absolutely
is not the word,&quot; said Philippe; &quot;I do not want him so particularly
as that; but if he can be found - &quot;<br>                &quot;I thought so,&quot;
said D'Artagnan to himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is
this M. d'Herblay the bishop of Vannes?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
madame.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
friend of M. Fouquet?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
madame; an old musketeer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Anne of
Austria blushed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;One
of the four braves who formerly performed such prodigies.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The old
queen repented of having wished to bite; she broke off the conversation, in
order to preserve the rest of her teeth. 
&quot;Whatever may be your choice, sire,&quot; said she, &quot;I have no
doubt it will be excellent.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                All
bowed in support of that sentiment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will find in him,&quot; continued Philippe, &quot;the depth and penetration of
M. de Richelieu, without the avarice of M. de Mazarin!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
prime minister, sire?&quot; said Monsieur, in a fright.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will tell you all about that, brother; but it is strange that M. d'Herblay is
not here!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He
called out:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
M. Fouquet be informed that I wish to speak to him - oh! before you, before
you; do not retire!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                M. de
Saint-Aignan returned, bringing satisfactory news of the queen, who only kept
her bed from precaution, and to have strength to carry out the king's
wishes.  Whilst everybody was seeking M.
Fouquet and Aramis, the new king quietly continued his experiments, and
everybody, family, officers, servants, had not the least suspicion of his
identity, his air, his voice, and manners were so like the king's.  On his side, Philippe, applying to all
countenances the accurate descriptions and key-notes of character supplied by
his accomplice Aramis, conducted himself so as not to give birth to a doubt in
the minds of those who surrounded him. 
Nothing from that time could disturb the usurper.  With what strange facility had Providence
just reversed the loftiest fortune of the world to substitute the lowliest in
its stead!  Philippe admired the
goodness of God with regard to himself, and seconded it with all the resources
of his admirable nature.  But he felt,
at times, something like a specter gliding between him and the rays of his new
glory.  Aramis did not appear.  The conversation had languished in the royal
family; Philippe, preoccupied, forgot to dismiss his brother and Madame
Henrietta.  The latter were astonished,
and began, by degrees, to lose all patience. 
Anne of Austria stooped towards her son's ear and addressed some words
to him in Spanish.  Philippe was
completely ignorant of that language, and grew pale at this unexpected
obstacle.  But, as if the spirit of the
imperturbable Aramis had covered him with his infallibility, instead of
appearing disconcerted, Philippe rose. 
&quot;Well! what?&quot; said Anne of Austria.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is all that noise?&quot; said Philippe, turning round towards the door of the
second staircase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And a
voice was heard saying, &quot;This way, this way!  A few steps more, sire!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
voice of M. Fouquet,&quot; said D'Artagnan, who was standing close to the
queen-mother.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
M. d'Herblay cannot be far off,&quot; added Philippe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                But he then
saw what he little thought to have beheld so near to him.  All eyes were turned towards the door at
which M. Fouquet was expected to enter; but it was not M. Fouquet who entered.  A terrible cry resounded from all corners of
the chamber, a painful cry uttered by the king and all present.  It is given to but few men, even those whose
destiny contains the strangest elements, and accidents the most wonderful, to
contemplate such a spectacle similar to that which presented itself in the
royal chamber at that moment.  The
half-closed shutters only admitted the entrance of an uncertain light passing
through thick violet velvet curtains lined with silk.  In this soft shade, the eyes were by degrees dilated, and every
one present saw others rather with imagination than with actual sight.  There could not, however, escape, in these
circumstances, one of the surrounding details; and the new object which
presented itself appeared as luminous as though it shone out in full sunlight.  So it happened with Louis XIV., when he
showed himself, pale and frowning, in the doorway of the secret stairs.  The face of Fouquet appeared behind him,
stamped with sorrow and determination. 
The queen-mother, who perceived Louis XIV., and who held the hand of
Philippe, uttered a cry of which we have spoken, as if she beheld a
phantom.  Monsieur was bewildered, and
kept turning his head in astonishment from one to the other.  Madame made a step forward, thinking she was
looking at the form of her brother-in-law reflected in a mirror.  And, in fact, the illusion was
possible.  The two princes, both pale as
death - for we renounce the hope of being able to describe the fearful state of
Philippe - trembling, clenching their hands convulsively, measured each other
with looks, and darted their glances, sharp as poniards, at each other.  Silent, panting, bending forward, they
appeared as if about to spring upon an enemy. 
The unheard-of resemblance of countenance, gesture, shape, height, even
to the resemblance of costume, produced by chance - for Louis XIV. had been to
the Louvre and put on a violet-colored dress - the perfect analogy of the two
princes, completed the consternation of Anne of Austria.  And yet she did not at once guess the truth.  There are misfortunes in life so truly
dreadful that no one will at first accept them; people rather believe in the
supernatural and the impossible.  Louis
had not reckoned on these obstacles.  He
expected that he had only to appear to be acknowledged.  A living sun, he could not endure the
suspicion of equality with any one.  He
did not admit that every torch should not become darkness at the instant he
shone out with his conquering ray.  At
the aspect of Philippe, then, he was perhaps more terrified than any one round
him, and his silence, his immobility were, this time, a concentration and a
calm which precede the violent explosions of concentrated passion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                But
Fouquet! who shall paint his emotion and stupor in presence of this living
portrait of his master!  Fouquet thought
Aramis was right, that this newly-arrived was a king as pure in his race as the
other, and that, for having repudiated all participation in this <i>coup d'état</i>, so skillfully got up by the
General of the Jesuits, he must be a mad enthusiast, unworthy of ever dipping
his hands in political grand strategy work. 
And then it was the blood of Louis XIII. which Fouquet was sacrificing
to the blood of Louis XIII.; it was to a selfish ambition he was sacrificing a
noble ambition; to the right of keeping he sacrificed the right of having.  The whole extent of his fault was revealed
to him at simple sight of the pretender. 
All that passed in the mind of Fouquet was lost upon the persons
present.  He had five minutes to focus
meditation on this point of conscience; five minutes, that is to say five ages,
during which the two kings and their family scarcely found energy to breathe
after so terrible a shock.  D'Artagnan,
leaning against the wall, in front of Fouquet, with his hand to his brow, asked
himself the cause of such a wonderful prodigy. 
He could not have said at once why he doubted, but he knew assuredly
that he had reason to doubt, and that in this meeting of the two Louis XIV.s
lay all the doubt and difficulty that during late days had rendered the conduct
of Aramis so suspicious to the musketeer. 
These ideas were, however, enveloped in a haze, a veil of mystery.  The actors in this assembly seemed to swim
in the vapors of a confused waking. 
Suddenly Louis XIV., more impatient and more accustomed to command, ran
to one of the shutters, which he opened, tearing the curtains in his
eagerness.  A flood of living light
entered the chamber, and made Philippe draw back to the alcove.  Louis seized upon this movement with
eagerness, and addressing himself to the queen:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
mother,&quot; said he, &quot;do you not acknowledge your son, since every one
here has forgotten his king!&quot;  Anne
of Austria started, and raised her arms towards Heaven, without being able to
articulate a single word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
mother,&quot; said Philippe, with a 
calm voice, &quot;do you not acknowledge your son?&quot;  And this time, in his turn, Louis drew back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As to
Anne of Austria, struck suddenly in head and heart with fell remorse, she lost
her equilibrium.  No one aiding her, for
all were petrified, she sank back in her <i>fauteuil</i>,
breathing a weak, trembling sigh.  Louis
could not endure the spectacle and the affront.  He bounded towards D'Artagnan, over whose brain a vertigo was
stealing and who staggered as he caught at the door for support.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>A moi! mousquetaire!</i>&quot; said he.  &quot;Look us in the face and say which is
the paler, he or I!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This
cry roused D'Artagnan, and stirred in his heart the fibers of obedience.  He shook his head, and, without more
hesitation, he walked straight up to Philippe, on whose shoulder he laid his
hand, saying, &quot;Monsieur, you are my prisoner!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Philippe
did not raise his eyes towards Heaven, nor stir from the spot, where he seemed
nailed to the floor, his eye intently fixed upon the king his brother.  He reproached him with a sublime silence for
all misfortunes past, all tortures to come. 
Against this language of the soul the king felt he had no power; he cast
down his eyes, dragging away precipitately his brother and sister, forgetting
his mother, sitting motionless within three paces of the son whom she left a
second time to be condemned to death. 
Philippe approached Anne of Austria, and said to her, in a soft and
nobly agitated voice:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
I were not your son, I should curse you, my mother, for having rendered me so
unhappy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
felt a shudder pass through the marrow of his bones.  He bowed respectfully to the young prince, and said as he bent,
&quot;Excuse me, monseigneur, I am but a soldier, and my oaths are his who has
just left the chamber.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Thank
you, M. d'Artagnan.  What has become of
M. d'Herblay?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
d'Herblay is in safety, monseigneur,&quot; said a voice behind them; &quot;and
no one, while I live and am free, shall cause a hair to fall from his
head.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
Fouquet!&quot; said the prince, smiling sadly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Pardon
me, monseigneur,&quot; said Fouquet, kneeling, &quot;but he who is just gone
out from hence was my guest.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Here
are,&quot; murmured Philippe, with a 
sigh, &quot;brave friends and good hearts.  They make me regret the world. 
On, M. d'Artagnan, I follow you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At the
moment the captain of the musketeers was about to leave the room with his
prisoner, Colbert appeared, and, after remitting an order from the king to
D'Artagnan, retired.  D'Artagnan read
the paper, and then crushed it in his hand with rage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is it?&quot; asked the prince.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Read,
monseigneur,&quot; replied the musketeer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Philippe
read the following words, hastily traced by the hand of the king:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
d'Artagnan will conduct the prisoner to the Île Sainte-Marguerite.  He will cover his face with an iron vizor,
which the prisoner shall never raise except at peril of his life.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is just,&quot; said Philippe, with resignation; &quot;I am ready.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Aramis
was right,&quot; said Fouquet, in a low voice, to the musketeer, &quot;this one
is every whit as much a king as the other.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;More
so!&quot; replied D'Artagnan.  &quot;He
wanted only you and me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>A</span>ramis
and Porthos, having profited by the time granted them by Fouquet, did honor to
the French cavalry by their speed. 
Porthos did not clearly understand on what kind of mission he was forced
to display so much velocity; but as he saw Aramis spurring on furiously, he,
Porthos, spurred on in the same way. 
They had soon, in this manner, placed twelve leagues between them and
Vaux; they were then obliged to change horses, and organize a sort of post
arrangement.  It was during a relay that
Porthos ventured to interrogate Aramis discreetly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Hush!&quot;
replied the latter, &quot;know only that our fortune depends on our
speed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As if
Porthos had still been the musketeer, without a sou or a <i>maille</i> of 1626, he pushed forward. 
That magic word &quot;fortune&quot; always means something in the human
ear.  It means <i>enough</i> for those who have nothing; it means <i>too much</i> for those who have enough.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
shall be made a duke!&quot; said Porthos, aloud.  He was speaking to himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is possible,&quot; replied Aramis, smiling after his own fashion, as Porthos's
horse passed him.  Aramis felt,
notwithstanding, as though his brain were on fire; the activity of the body had
not yet succeeded in subduing that of the mind.  All there is of raging passion, mental toothache or mortal
threat, raged, gnawed and grumbled in the thoughts of the unhappy prelate.  His countenance exhibited visible traces of
this rude combat.  Free on the highway
to abandon himself to every impression of the moment, Aramis did not fail to
swear at every start of his horse, at every inequality in the road.  Pale, at times inundated with boiling
sweats, then again dry and icy, he flogged his horses till the blood streamed
from their sides.  Porthos, whose
dominant fault was not sensibility, groaned at this.  Thus traveled they on for eight long hours, and then arrived at
Orléans.  It was four o'clock in the
afternoon.  Aramis, on observing this,
judged that nothing showed pursuit to be a possibility.  It would be without example that a troop
capable of taking him and Porthos should be furnished with relays sufficient to
perform forty leagues in eight hours. 
Thus, admitting pursuit, which was not at all manifest, the fugitives
were five hours in advance of their pursuers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
thought that there might be no imprudence in taking a little rest, but that to
continue would make the matter more certain. 
Twenty leagues more, performed with the same rapidity, twenty more
leagues devoured, and no one, not even D'Artagnan, could overtake the enemies
of the king.  Aramis felt obliged,
therefore, to inflict upon Porthos the pain of mounting on horseback again.  They rode on till seven o'clock in the
evening, and had only one post more between them and Blois.  But here a diabolical accident alarmed
Aramis greatly.  There were no horses at
the post.  The prelate asked himself by
what infernal machination his enemies had succeeded in depriving him of the
means of going further, - he who never recognized chance as a deity, who found
a cause for every accident, preferred believing that the refusal of the
postmaster, at such an hour, in such a country, was the consequence of an order
emanating from above: an order given with a view of stopping short the
king-maker in the midst of his flight. 
But at the moment he was about to fly into a passion, so as to procure
either a horse or an explanation, he was struck with the recollection that the
Comte de la Fère lived in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am not traveling,&quot; said he; &quot;I do not want horses for a whole
stage.  Find me two horses to go and pay
a visit to a nobleman of my acquaintance who resides near this place.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
nobleman?&quot; asked the postmaster.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
le Comte de la Fère.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!&quot;
replied the postmaster, uncovering with respect, &quot;a very worthy
nobleman.  But, whatever may be my
desire to make myself agreeable to him, I cannot furnish you with horses, for
all mine are engaged by M. le Duc de Beaufort.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Indeed!&quot;
said Aramis, much disappointed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Only,&quot;
continued the postmaster, &quot;if you will put up with a little carriage I
have, I will harness an old blind horse who has still his legs left, and
peradventure will draw you to the house of M. le Comte de la Fère.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is worth a louis,&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
monsieur, such a ride is worth no more than a crown; that is what M. Grimaud,
the comte's intendant, always pays me when he makes use of that carriage; and I
should not wish the Comte de la Fère to have to reproach me with having imposed
on one of his friends.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;As
you please,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;particularly as regards disobliging the
Comte de la Fère; only I think I have a right to give you a louis for your
idea.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
doubtless,&quot; replied the postmaster with delight.  And he himself harnessed the ancient horse to the creaking
carriage.  In the meantime Porthos was
curious to behold.  He imagined he had
discovered a clew to the secret, and he felt pleased, because a visit to Athos,
in the first place, promised him much satisfaction, and, in the next, gave him
the hope of finding at the same time a good bed and good supper.  The master, having got the carriage ready,
ordered one of his men to drive the strangers to La Fère.  Porthos took his seat by the side of Aramis,
whispering in his ear, &quot;I understand.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Aha!&quot;
said Aramis, &quot;and what do you understand, my friend?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
are going, on the part of the king, to make some great proposal to Athos.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Pooh!&quot;
said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
need tell me nothing about it,&quot; added the worthy Porthos, endeavoring to
reseat himself so as to avoid the jolting, &quot;you need tell me nothing, I
shall guess.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!
do, my friend; guess away.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                They
arrived at Athos's dwelling about nine o'clock in the evening, favored by a
splendid moon.  This cheerful light
rejoiced Porthos beyond expression; but Aramis appeared annoyed by it in an
equal degree.  He could not help showing
something of this to Porthos, who replied - &quot;Ay! ay!  I guess how it is! the mission is a secret
one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                These
were his last words in the carriage.  The
driver interrupted him by saying, &quot;Gentlemen, we have arrived.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos
and his companion alighted before the gate of the little château, where we are
about to meet again our old acquaintances Athos and Bragelonne, the latter of
whom had disappeared since the discovery of the infidelity of La Vallière.  If there be one saying truer than another,
it is this: great griefs contain within themselves the germ of
consolation.  This painful wound,
inflicted upon Raoul, had drawn him nearer to his father again; and God knows
how sweet were the consolations which flowed from the eloquent mouth and
generous heart of Athos.  The wound was
not cicatrized, but Athos, by dint of conversing with his son and mixing a
little more of his life with that of the young man, had brought him to
understand that this pang of a first infidelity is necessary to every human
existence; and that no one has loved without encountering it.  Raoul listened, again and again, but never
understood.  Nothing replaces in the
deeply afflicted heart the remembrance and thought of the beloved object.  Raoul then replied to the reasoning of his
father:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,
all that you tell me is true; I believe that no one has suffered in the
affections of the heart so much as you have; but you are a man too great by
reason of intelligence, and too severely tried by adverse fortune not to allow
for the weakness of the soldier who suffers for the first time.  I am paying a tribute that will not be paid
a second time; permit me to plunge myself so deeply in my grief that I may
forget myself in it, that I may drown even my reason in it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Raoul!  Raoul!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Listen,
monsieur.  Never shall I accustom myself
to the idea that Louise, the chastest and most innocent of women, has been able
to so basely deceive a man so honest and so true a lover as myself.  Never can I persuade myself that I see that
sweet and noble mask change into a hypocritical lascivious face.  Louise lost!  Louise infamous!  Ah!
monseigneur, that idea is much more cruel to me than Raoul abandoned - Raoul
unhappy!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Athos
then employed the heroic remedy.  He
defended Louise against Raoul, and justified her perfidy by her love.  &quot;A woman who would have yielded to a
king because he is a king,&quot; said he, &quot;would deserve to be styled
infamous; but Louise loves Louis. 
Young, both, they have forgotten, he his rank, she her vows.  Love absolves everything, Raoul.  The two young people love each other with
sincerity.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
when he had dealt this severe poniard-thrust, Athos, with a sigh, saw Raoul
bound away beneath the rankling wound, and fly to the thickest recesses of the
wood, or the solitude of his chamber, whence, an hour after, he would return,
pale, trembling, but subdued.  Then,
coming up to Athos with a smile, he would kiss his hand, like the dog who,
having been beaten, caresses a respected master, to redeem his fault.  Raoul redeemed nothing but his weakness, and
only confessed his grief.  Thus passed
away the days that followed that scene in which Athos had so violently shaken
the indomitable pride of the king. 
Never, when conversing with his son, did he make any allusion to that
scene; never did he give him the details of that vigorous lecture, which might,
perhaps, have consoled the young man, by showing him his rival humbled.  Athos did not wish that the offended lover
should forget the respect due to his king. 
And when Bragelonne, ardent, angry, and melancholy, spoke with contempt
of royal words, of the equivocal faith which certain madmen draw from promises
that emanate from thrones, when, passing over two centuries, with that rapidity
of a bird that traverses a narrow strait to go from one continent to the other,
Raoul ventured to predict the time in which kings would be esteemed as less
than other men, Athos said to him, in his serene, persuasive voice, &quot;You
are right, Raoul; all that you say will happen; kings will lose their
privileges, as stars which have survived their æons lose their splendor.  But when that moment comes, Raoul, we shall
be dead.  And remember well what I say
to you.  In this world, all, men, women,
and kings, must live for the present. 
We can only live for the future for God.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This
was the manner in which Athos and Raoul were, as usual, conversing, and walking
backwards and forwards in the long alley of limes in the park, when the bell
which served to announce to the comte either the hour of dinner or the arrival
of a visitor, was rung; and, without attaching any importance to it, he turned
towards the house with his son; and at the end of the alley they found
themselves in the presence of Aramis and Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>The Last Adieux.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>R</span>aoul
uttered a cry, and affectionately embraced Porthos.  Aramis and Athos embraced like old men; and this embrace itself
being a question for Aramis, he immediately said, &quot;My friend, we have not
long to remain with you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
said the comte.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Only
time to tell you of my good fortune,&quot; interrupted Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
said Raoul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Athos
looked silently at Aramis, whose somber air had already appeared to him very
little in harmony with the good news Porthos hinted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is the good fortune that has happened to you? 
Let us hear it,&quot; said Raoul, with a smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
king has made me a duke,&quot; said the worthy Porthos, with an air of mystery,
in the ear of the young man, &quot;a duke by <i>brevet</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                But the
<i>asides</i> of Porthos were always loud
enough to be heard by everybody.  His
murmurs were in the diapason of ordinary roaring.  Athos heard him, and uttered an exclamation which made Aramis
start.  The latter took Athos by the
arm, and, after having asked Porthos's permission to say a word to his friend
in private, &quot;My dear Athos,&quot; he began, &quot;you see me overwhelmed
with grief and trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;With
grief and trouble, my dear friend?&quot; cried the comte; &quot;oh, what?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
two words.  I have conspired against the
king; that conspiracy has failed, and, at this moment, I am doubtless
pursued.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are pursued! - a conspiracy!  Eh! my
friend, what do you tell me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
saddest truth.  I am entirely
ruined.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
but Porthos - this title of duke - what does all that mean?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is the subject of my severest pain; that is the deepest of my wounds.  I have, believing in infallible success,
drawn Porthos into my conspiracy.  He
threw himself into it, as you know he would do, with all his strength, without
knowing what he was about; and now he is as much compromised as myself - as
completely ruined as I am.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Good
God!&quot;  And Athos turned towards
Porthos, who was smiling complacently.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
must make you acquainted with the whole. 
Listen to me,&quot; continued Aramis; and he related the history as we
know it.  Athos, during the recital,
several times felt the sweat break from his forehead.  &quot;It was a great idea,&quot; said he, &quot;but a great
error.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;For
which I am punished, Athos.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Therefore,
I will not tell you my entire thought.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Tell
it, nevertheless.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is a crime.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
capital crime; I know it is.  <i>Lése majesté</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Porthos!
poor Porthos!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
would you advise me to do?  Success, as
I have told you, was certain.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
Fouquet is an honest man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
I a fool for having so ill-judged him,&quot; said Aramis.  &quot;Oh, the wisdom of man!  Oh, millstone that grinds the world! and
which is one day stopped by a grain of sand which has fallen, no one knows how,
between its wheels.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Say
by a diamond, Aramis.  But the thing is
done.  How do you think of acting?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am taking away Porthos.  The king will
never believe that that worthy man has acted innocently.  He never can believe that Porthos has
thought he was serving the king, whilst acting as he has done.  His head would pay my fault.  It shall not, must not, be so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are taking him away, whither?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
Belle-Isle, at first.  That is an
impregnable place of refuge.  Then, I
have the sea, and a vessel to pass over into England, where I have many
relations.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You?
in England?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
or else in Spain, where I have still more.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,
our excellent Porthos! you ruin him, for the king will confiscate all his
property.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;All
is provided for.  I know how, when once
in Spain, to reconcile myself with Louis XIV., and restore Porthos to
favor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have credit, seemingly, Aramis!&quot; said Athos, with a discreet air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Much;
and at the service of my friends.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                These
words were accompanied by a warm pressure of the hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Thank
you,&quot; replied the comte.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
while we are on this head,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;you also are a malcontent;
you also, Raoul, have griefs to lay to the king.  Follow our example; pass over into Belle-Isle.  Then we shall see, I guarantee upon my
honor, that in a month there will be war between France and Spain on the
subject of this son of Louis XIII., who is an Infante likewise, and whom France
detains inhumanly.  Now, as Louis XIV.
would have no inclination for a war on that subject, I will answer for an
arrangement, the result of which must bring greatness to Porthos and to me, and
a duchy in France to you, who are already a grandee of Spain.  Will you join us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No;
for my part I prefer having something to reproach the king with; it is a pride
natural to my race to pretend to a superiority over royal races.  Doing what you propose, I should become the
obliged of the king; I should certainly be the gainer on that ground, but I
should be a loser in my conscience. - No, thank you!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
give me two things, Athos, - your absolution.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!  I give it you if you really wished to avenge
the weak and oppressed against the oppressor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is sufficient for me,&quot; said Aramis, with a  blush which was lost in the obscurity of the night.  &quot;And now, give me your two best horses
to gain the second post, as I have been refused any under the pretext of the
Duc de Beaufort being traveling in this country.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
shall have the two best horses, Aramis; and again I recommend poor Porthos
strongly to your care.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!  I have no fear on that score.  One word more: do you think I am maneuvering
for him as I ought?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
evil being committed, yes; for the king would not pardon him, and you have,
whatever may be said, always a supporter in M. Fouquet, who will not abandon
you, he being himself compromised, notwithstanding his heroic action.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are right.  And that is why, instead of
gaining the sea at once, which would proclaim my fear and guilt, that is why I
remain upon French ground.  But
Belle-Isle will be for me whatever ground I wish it to be, English, Spanish, or
Roman; all will depend, with me, on the standard I shall think proper to
unfurl.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
was I who fortified Belle-Isle; and, so long as I defend it, nobody can take
Belle-Isle from me.  And then, as you
have said just now, M. Fouquet is there. 
Belle-Isle will not be attacked without the signature of M.
Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is true.  Nevertheless, be prudent.  The king is both cunning and
strong.&quot;  Aramis smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
again recommend Porthos to you,&quot; repeated the count, with a sort of cold
persistence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Whatever
becomes of me, count,&quot; replied Aramis, in the same tone, &quot;our brother
Porthos will fare as I do - or <i>better</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Athos
bowed whilst pressing the hand of Aramis, and turned to embrace Porthos with
emotion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
was born lucky, was I not?&quot; murmured the latter, transported with
happiness, as he folded his cloak round him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come,
my dear friend,&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Raoul
had gone out to give orders for the saddling of the horses.  The group was already divided.  Athos saw his two friends on the point of
departure, and something like a mist passed before his eyes and weighed upon
his heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is strange,&quot; thought he, &quot;whence comes the inclination I feel to
embrace Porthos once more?&quot;  At
that moment Porthos turned round, and he came towards his old friend with open
arms.  This last endearment was tender
as in youth, as in times when hearts were warm - life happy.  And then Porthos mounted his horse.  Aramis came back once more to throw his arms
round the neck of Athos.  The latter
watched them along the high-road, elongated by the shade, in their white
cloaks.  Like phantoms they seemed to
enlarge on their departure from the earth, and it was not in the mist, but in
the declivity of the ground that they disappeared.  At the end of the perspective, both seemed to have given a spring
with their feet, which made them vanish as if evaporated into cloud-land.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Then
Athos, with a very heavy heart, returned towards the house, saying to
Bragelonne, &quot;Raoul, I dont know what it is that has just told me that I
have seen those two for the last time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
does not astonish me, monsieur, that you should have such a thought,&quot;
replied the young man, &quot;for I have at this moment the same, and think also
that I shall never see Messieurs du Vallon and d'Herblay again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
you,&quot; replied the count, &quot;you speak like a man rendered sad by a
different cause; you see everything in black; you are young, and if you chance
never to see those old friends again, it will because they no longer exist in
the world in which you have yet many years to pass.  But I - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Raoul
shook his head sadly, and leaned upon the shoulder of the count, without either
of them finding another word in their hearts, which were ready to overflow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                All at
once a noise of horses and voices, from the extremity of the road to Blois,
attracted their attention that way. 
Flambeaux-bearers shook their torches merrily among the trees of their
route, and turned round, from time to time, to avoid distancing the horsemen who
followed them.  These flames, this
noise, this dust of a dozen richly caparisoned horses, formed a strange
contrast in the middle of the night with the melancholy and almost funereal
disappearance of the two shadows of Aramis and Porthos.  Athos went towards the house; but he had
hardly reached the parterre, when the entrance gate appeared in a blaze; all
the flambeaux stopped and appeared to enflame the road.  A cry was heard of &quot;M. le Duc de
Beaufort&quot; - and Athos sprang towards the door of his house.  But the duke had already alighted from his
horse, and was looking around him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am here, monseigneur,&quot; said Athos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
good evening, dear count,&quot; said the prince, with that frank cordiality
which won him so many hearts.  &quot;Is
it too late for a friend?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
my dear prince, come in!&quot; said the count.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And, M.
de Beaufort leaning on the arm of Athos, they entered the house, followed by
Raoul, who walked respectfully and modestly among the officers of the prince,
with several of whom he was acquainted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is
that the young man I have heard M. le Prince speak so highly of?&quot; asked M.

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Remain,

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Ma foi!</i> he is tall and handsome!&quot;
continued the duke.  &quot;Will you give
him to me, monseigneur, if I ask him of you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
am I to understand you, monseigneur?&quot; said Athos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
I call upon you to bid you farewell.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Farewell!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
in good truth.  Have you no idea of what
I am about to become?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
I suppose, what you have always been, monseigneur, - a valiant prince, and an
excellent gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am going to become an African prince, - a Bedouin gentleman.  The king is sending me to make conquests
among the Arabs.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is this you tell me, monseigneur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Strange,
is it not?  I, the Parisian <i>par essence</i>, I who have reigned in the
faubourgs, and have been called King of the Halles, - I am going to pass from
the Place Maubert to the minarets of Gigelli; from a Frondeur I am becoming an
adventurer!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
monseigneur, if you did not yourself tell me that - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
would not be credible, would it? 
Believe me, nevertheless, and we have but to bid each other
farewell.  This is what comes of getting
into favor again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Into
favor?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes.  You smile. 
Ah, my dear count, do you know why I have accepted this enterprise, can
you guess?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Because
your highness loves glory above - everything.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
no; there is no glory in firing muskets at savages.  I see no glory in that, for my part, and it is more probable that
I shall there meet with something else. 
But I have wished, and still wish earnestly, my dear count, that my life
should have that last <i>facet</i>, after
all the whimsical exhibitions I have seen myself make during fifty years.  For, in short, you must admit that it is
sufficiently strange to be born the grandson of a king, to have made war
against kings, to have been reckoned among the powers of the age, to have
maintained my rank, to feel Henry IV. within me, to be great admiral of France
- and then to go and get killed at Gigelli, among all those Turks, Saracens,
and Moors.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur,
you harp with strange persistence on that theme,&quot; said Athos, in an
agitated voice.  &quot;How can you
suppose that so brilliant a destiny will be extinguished in that remote and
miserable scene?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
can you believe, upright and simple as you are, that if I go into Africa for
this ridiculous motive, I will not endeavor to come out of it without
ridicule?  Shall I not give the world
cause to speak of me?  And to be spoken
of, nowadays, when there are Monsieur le Prince, M. de Turenne, and many
others, my contemporaries, I, admiral of France, grandson of Henry IV., king of
Paris, have I anything left but to get myself killed?  <i>Cordieu!</i>  I will be talked of, I tell you; I shall be
killed whether or not; if no there, somewhere else.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
monseigneur, this is mere exaggeration; and hitherto you have shown nothing
exaggerated save in bravery.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Peste!</i> my dear friend, there is bravery
in facing scurvy, dysentery, locusts, poisoned arrows, as my ancestor St. Louis
did.  Do you know those fellows still
use poisoned arrows?  And then, you know
me of old, I fancy, and you know that when I once make up my mind to a thing, I
perform it in grim earnest.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
you made up your mind to escape from Vincennes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ay,
but you aided me in that, my master; and, <i>à
propos</i>, I turn this way and that, without seeing my old friend, M.
Vaugrimaud.  How is he?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
Vaugrimaud is still your highness's most respectful servant,&quot; said Athos,
smiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have a hundred pistoles here for him, which I bring as a legacy.  My will is made, count.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
monseigneur! monseigneur!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
you may understand that if Grimaud's name were to appear in my will -
&quot;  The duke began to laugh; then
addressing Raoul, who, from the commencement of this conversation, had sunk
into a profound reverie, &quot;Young man,&quot; said he, &quot;I know there is
to be found here a certain De Vouvray wine, and I believe - &quot;  Raoul left the room precipitately to order
the wine.  In the meantime M. de
Beaufort took the hand of Athos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
do you mean to do with him?&quot; asked he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nothing
at present, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
yes, I know; since the passion of the king for La Vallière.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is all true, then, is it?  I think I
know her, that little La Vallière.  She
is not particularly handsome, if I remember right?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
monseigneur,&quot; said Athos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you know whom she reminds me of?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Does
she remind your highness of any one?&quot;<br>                &quot;She reminds me of a
very agreeable girl, whose mother lived in the Halles.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
ah!&quot; said Athos, smiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
the good old times,&quot; added M. de Beaufort.  &quot;Yes, La Vallière reminds me of that girl.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
had a son, had she not?&quot; <b><sup>3</sup></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
believe she had,&quot; replied the duke, with careless <i>naïveté</i> and a complaisant forgetfulness, of which no words could
translate the tone and the vocal expression. 
&quot;Now, here is poor Raoul, who is your son, I believe.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
he is my son, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
the poor lad has been cut out by the king, and he frets.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Still
better, monseigneur, he abstains.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are going to let the boy rust in idleness; it is a mistake.  Come, give him to me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
wish is to keep him at home, monseigneur. 
I have no longer anything in the world but him, and as long as he likes
to remain - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
well,&quot; replied the duke.  &quot;I
could, nevertheless, have soon put matters to rights again.  I assure you, I think he has in him the
stuff of which maréchals of France are made; I have seen more than one produced
from less likely rough material.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is very possible, monseigneur; but it is the king who makes maréchals of
France, and Raoul will never accept anything of the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Raoul
interrupted this conversation by his return. 
He preceded Grimaud, whose still steady hands carried the <i>plateau</i> with one glass and a bottle of
the duke's favorite wine.  On seeing his
old <i>protégé</i>, the duke uttered an
exclamation of pleasure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Grimaud!  Good evening, Grimaud!&quot; said he;
&quot;how goes it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
servant bowed profoundly, as much gratified as his noble interlocutor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Two
old friends!&quot; said the duke, shaking honest Grimaud's shoulder after a
vigorous fashion; which was followed by another still more profound and
delighted bow from Grimaud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
what is this, count, only one glass?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
should not think of drinking with your highness, unless your highness permitted
me,&quot; replied Athos, with noble humility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Cordieu!</i> you were right to bring only
one glass, we will both drink out of it, like two brothers in arms.  Begin, count.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
me the honor,&quot; said Athos, gently putting back the glass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are a charming friend,&quot; replied the Duc de Beaufort, who drank, and passed
the goblet to his companion.  &quot;But
that is not all,&quot; continued he, &quot;I am still thirsty, and I wish to do
honor to this handsome young man who stands here.  I carry good luck with me, vicomte,&quot; said he to Raoul;
&quot;wish for something while drinking out of my glass, and may the black
plague grab me if what you wish does not come to pass!&quot;  He held the goblet to Raoul, who hastily
moistened his lips, and replied with the same promptitude:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have wished for something, monseigneur.&quot; 
His eyes sparkled with a gloomy fire, and the blood mounted to his
cheeks; he terrified Athos, if only with his smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
what have you wished for?&quot; replied the duke, sinking back into his <i>fauteuil</i>, whilst with one hand he
returned the bottle to Grimaud, and with the other gave him a purse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Will
you promise me, monseigneur, to grant me what I wish for?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Pardieu!</i>  That is agreed upon.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
wished, monsieur le duc, to go with you to Gigelli.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Athos became pale, and was unable
to conceal his agitation.  The duke
looked at his friend, as if desirous to assist him to parry this unexpected
blow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is difficult, my dear
vicomte, very difficult,&quot; added he, in a lower tone of voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Pardon me, monseigneur, I
have been indiscreet,&quot; replied Raoul, in a firm voice; &quot;but as you
yourself invited me to wish - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;To wish to leave me?&quot;
said Athos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! monsieur - can you
imagine - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well, <i>mordieu!</i>&quot; cried the duke, &quot;the young vicomte is
right!  What can he do here?  He will go moldy with grief.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Raoul blushed, and the excitable
prince continued: &quot;War is a distraction: we gain everything by it; we can
only lose one thing by it - life - then so much the worse!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is to say, memory,&quot;
said Raoul, eagerly; &quot;and that is to say, so much the better!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>He repented of having spoken so
warmly when he saw Athos rise and open the window; which was, doubtless, to conceal
his emotion.  Raoul sprang towards the
comte, but the latter had already overcome his emotion, and turned to the
lights with a serene and impassible countenance.  &quot;Well, come,&quot; said the duke, &quot;let us see!  Shall he go, or shall he not?  If he goes, comte, he shall be my
aide-de-camp, my son.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monseigneur!&quot; cried
Raoul, bending his knee.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monseigneur!&quot; cried
Athos, taking the hand of the duke; &quot;Raoul shall do just as he
likes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! no, monsieur, just as you
like,&quot; interrupted the young man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;<i>Par la corbleu!</i>&quot; said the prince in his turn, &quot;it is
neither the comte nor the vicomte that shall have his way, it is I.  I will take him away.  The marine offers a superb fortune, my
friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Raoul smiled again so sadly, that
this time Athos felt his heart penetrated by it, and replied to him by a severe
look.  Raoul comprehended it all; he
recovered his calmness, and was so guarded, that not another word escaped
him.  The duke at length rose, on
observing the advanced hour, and said, with animation, &quot;I am in great
haste, but if I am told I have lost time in talking with a friend, I will reply
I have gained - on the balance - a most excellent recruit.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Pardon me, monsieur le
duc,&quot; interrupted Raoul, &quot;do not tell the king so, for it is not the
king I wish to serve.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Eh! my friend, whom, then,
will you serve?  The times are past when
you might have said, 'I belong to M. de Beaufort.'  No, nowadays, we all belong to the king, great or small.  Therefore, if you serve on board my vessels,
there can be nothing equivocal about it, my dear vicomte; it will be the king
you will serve.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Athos waited with a kind of
impatient joy for the reply about to be made to this embarrassing question by
Raoul, the intractable enemy of the king, his rival.  The father hoped that the obstacle would overcome the
desire.  He was thankful to M. de
Beaufort, whose lightness or generous reflection had thrown an impediment in
the way of the departure of a son, now his only joy.  But Raoul, still firm and tranquil, replied: &quot;Monsieur le
duc, the objection you make I have already considered in my mind.  I will serve on board your vessels, because
you do me the honor to take me with you; but I shall there serve a more
powerful master than the king: I shall serve God!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;God! how so?&quot; said the
duke and Athos together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;My intention is to make
profession, and become a knight of Malta,&quot; added Bragelonne, letting fall,
one by one, words more icy than the drops which fall from the bare trees after
the tempests of winter. <b><sup>4</sup></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Under this blow Athos staggered and
the prince himself was moved.  Grimaud
uttered a heavy groan, and let fall the bottle, which was broken without
anybody paying attention.  M. de
Beaufort looked the young man in the face, and read plainly, though his eyes
were cast down, the fire of resolution before which everything must give
way.  As to Athos, he was too well
acquainted with that tender, but inflexible soul; he could not hope to make it
deviate from the fatal road it had just chosen.  He could only press the hand the duke held out to him.  &quot;Comte, I shall set off in two days for
Toulon,&quot; said M. de Beaufort. 
&quot;Will you meet me at Paris, in order that I may know your
determination?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I will have the honor of
thanking you there, <i>mon prince</i>, for
all your kindness,&quot; replied the comte.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And be sure to bring the
vicomte with you, whether he follows me or does not follow me,&quot; added the
duke; &quot;he has my word, and I only ask yours.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Having thrown a little balm upon
the wound of the paternal heart, he pulled the ear of Grimaud, whose eyes
sparkled more than usual, and regained his escort in the parterre.  The horses, rested and refreshed, set off
with spirit through the lovely night, and soon placed a considerable distance
between their master and the château.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Athos and Bragelonne were again
face to face.  Eleven o'clock was
striking.  The father and son preserved
a profound silence towards each other, where an intelligent observer would have
expected cries and tears.  But these two
men were of such a nature that all emotion following their final resolutions
plunged itself so deep into their hearts that it was lost forever.  They passed, then, silently and almost
breathlessly, the hour that preceded midnight. 
The clock, by striking, alone pointed out to them how many minutes had
lasted the painful journey made by their souls in the immensity of their
remembrances of the past and fear of the future.  Athos rose first, saying, &quot;it is late, then.  Till to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Raoul rose, and in his turn
embraced his father.  The latter held
him clasped to his breast, and said, in a tremulous voice, &quot;In two days,
you will have left me, my son - left me forever, Raoul!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; replied the
young man, &quot;I had formed a determination, that of piercing my heart with
my sword; but you would have thought that cowardly.  I have renounced that determination, and <i>therefore</i> we must part.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You leave me desolate by
going, Raoul.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Listen to me again, monsieur,
I implore you.  If I do not go, I shall
die here of grief and love.  I know how
long a time I have to live thus.  Send me
away quickly, monsieur, or you will see me basely die before your eyes - in
your house - this is stronger than my will - stronger than my strength - you
may plainly see that within one month I have lived thirty years, and that I
approach the end of my life.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Then,&quot; said Athos,
coldly, &quot;you go with the intention of getting killed in Africa?  Oh, tell me! do not lie!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Raoul grew deadly pale, and
remained silent for two seconds, which were to his father two hours of
agony.  Then, all at once:
&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said he, &quot;I have promised to devote myself to
God.  In exchange for the sacrifice I
make of my youth and liberty, I will only ask of Him one thing, and that is, to
preserve me for you, because you are the only tie which attaches me to this
world.  God alone can give me the
strength not to forget that I owe you everything, and that nothing ought to
stand in my esteem before you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Athos embraced his son tenderly,
and said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You have just replied to me on
the word of honor of an honest man; in two days we shall be with M. de Beaufort
at Paris, and you will then do what will be proper for you to do.  You are free, Raoul; adieu.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>And he slowly gained his
bedroom.  Raoul went down into the
garden, and passed the night in the alley of limes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Chapter XXVIII:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Preparations for

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>A</span>thos
lost no more time in combating this immutable resolution.  He gave all his attention to preparing,
during the two days the duke had granted him, the proper appointments for
Raoul.  This labor chiefly concerned
Grimaud, who immediately applied himself to it with the good-will and
intelligence we know he possessed. 
Athos gave this worthy servant orders to take the route to Paris when
the equipments should be ready; and, not to expose himself to the danger of
keeping the duke waiting, or delaying Raoul, so that the duke should perceive
his absence, he himself, the day after the visit of M. de Beaufort, set off for
Paris with his son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                For the
poor young man it was an emotion easily to be understood, thus to return to
Paris amongst all the people who had known and loved him.  Every face recalled a pang to him who had
suffered so much; to him who had loved so much, some circumstance of his
unhappy love.  Raoul, on approaching Paris,
felt as if he were dying.  Once in
Paris, he really existed no longer. 
When he reached Guiche's residence, he was informed that Guiche was with
Monsieur.  Raoul took the road to the
Luxembourg, and when arrived, without suspecting that he was going to the place
where La Vallière had lived, he heard so much music and respired so many
perfumes, he heard so much joyous laughter, and saw so many dancing shadows,
that if it had not been for a charitable woman, who perceived him so dejected
and pale beneath a doorway, he would have remained there a few minutes, and
then would have gone away, never to return. 
But, as we have said, in the first ante-chamber he had stopped, solely
for the sake of not mixing himself with all those happy beings he felt were moving
around him in the adjacent salons.  And
as one of Monsieur's servants, recognizing him, had asked him if he wished to
see Monsieur or Madame, Raoul had scarcely answered him, but had sunk down upon
a bench near the velvet doorway, looking at a clock, which had stopped for
nearly an hour.  The servant had passed
on, and another, better acquainted with him, had come up, and interrogated
Raoul whether he should inform M. de Guiche of his being there.  This name did not even arouse the
recollections of Raoul.  The persistent
servant went on to relate that De Guiche had just invented a new game of
lottery, and was teaching it to the ladies. 
Raoul, opening his large eyes, like the absent man in Theophrastus, made
no answer, but his sadness increased two shades.  With his head hanging down, his limbs relaxed, his mouth half
open for the escape of his sighs, Raoul remained, thus forgotten, in the
ante-chamber, when all at once a lady's robe passed, rubbing against the doors
of a side salon, which opened on the gallery. 
A lady, young, pretty, and gay, scolding an officer of the household,
entered by that way, and expressed herself with much vivacity.  The officer replied in calm but firm
sentences; it was rather a little love pet than a quarrel of courtiers, and was
terminated by a kiss on the fingers of the lady.  Suddenly, on perceiving Raoul, the lady became silent, and
pushing away the officer:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Make
your escape, Malicorne,&quot; said she; &quot;I did not think there was any one
here.  I shall curse you, if they have either
heard or seen us!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Malicorne
hastened away.  The young lady advanced
behind Raoul, and stretching her joyous face over him as he lay:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
is a gallant man,&quot; said she, &quot;and no doubt - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                She
here interrupted herself by uttering a cry. 
&quot;Raoul!&quot; said she, blushing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Mademoiselle
de Montalais!&quot; said Raoul, paler than death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He rose
unsteadily, and tried to make his way across the slippery mosaic of the floor;
but she had comprehended that savage and cruel grief; she felt that in the
flight of Raoul there was an accusation of herself.  A woman, ever vigilant, she did not think she ought to let the
opportunity slip of making good her justification; but Raoul, though stopped by
her in the middle of the gallery, did not seem disposed to surrender without a
combat.  He took it up in a tone so cold
and embarrassed, that if they had been thus surprised, the whole court would
have no doubt about the proceedings of Mademoiselle de Montalais.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
monsieur,&quot; said she with disdain, &quot;what you are doing is very
unworthy of a gentleman.  My heart
inclines me to speak to you; you compromise me by a reception almost uncivil;
you are wrong, monsieur; and you confound your friends with enemies.  Farewell!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Raoul
had sworn never to speak of Louise, never even to look at those who might have
seen Louise; he was going into another world, that he might never meet with
anything Louise had seen, or even touched. 
But after the first shock of his pride, after having had a glimpse of
Montalais, the companion of Louise - Montalais, who reminded him of the turret
of Blois and the joys of youth - all his reason faded away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Pardon
me, mademoiselle; it enters not, it cannot enter into my thoughts to be
uncivil.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you wish to speak to me?&quot; said she, with the smile of former days.  &quot;Well! come somewhere else; for we may
be surprised.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!'
said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                She
looked at the clock, doubtingly, then, having reflected:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
my apartment,&quot; said she, &quot;we shall have an hour to
ourselves.&quot;  And taking her course,
lighter than a fairy, she ran up to her chamber, followed by Raoul.  Shutting the door, and placing in the hands
of her <i>camériste</i> the mantle she had
held upon her arm:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
were seeking M. de Guiche, were you not?&quot; said she to Raoul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
mademoiselle.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will go and ask him to come up here, presently, after I have spoken to
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
so, mademoiselle.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Are
you angry with me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Raoul
looked at her for a moment, then, casting down his eyes, &quot;Yes,&quot; said
he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
think I was concerned in the plot which brought about the rupture, do you
not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Rupture!&quot;
said he, with bitterness.  &quot;Oh!
mademoiselle, there can be no rupture where there has been no love.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are in error,&quot; replied Montalais; &quot;Louise did love you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Raoul
started.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Not
with love, I know; but she liked you, and you ought to have married her before
you set out for London.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Raoul
broke into a sinister laugh, which made Montalais shudder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
tell me that very much at your ease, mademoiselle.  Do people marry whom they like? 
You forget that the king then kept for himself as his mistress her of
whom we are speaking.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Listen,&quot;
said the young woman, pressing the hands of Raoul in her own, &quot;you were
wrong in every way; a man of your age ought never to leave a woman of hers
alone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
is no longer any faith in the world, then,&quot; said Raoul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
vicomte,&quot; said Montalais, quietly. 
&quot;Nevertheless, let me tell you that, if, instead of loving Louise
coldly and philosophically, you had endeavored to awaken her to love - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Enough,
I pray you, mademoiselle,&quot; said Raoul. 
&quot;I feel as though you are all, of both sexes, of a different age
from me.  You can laugh, and you can
banter agreeably.  I, mademoiselle, I
loved Mademoiselle de - &quot;  Raoul
could not pronounce her name, - &quot;I loved her well!  I put my faith in her - now I am quits by
loving her no longer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
vicomte!&quot; said Montalais, pointing to his reflection in a looking-glass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
know what you mean, mademoiselle; I am much altered, am I not?  Well!  Do you know why?  Because
my face is the mirror of my heart, the outer surface changed to match the mind
within.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are consoled, then?&quot; said Montalais, sharply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
I shall never be consoled.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
don't understand you, M. de Bragelonne.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
care but little for that.  I do not
quite understand myself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have not even tried to speak to Louise?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who!  I?&quot; exclaimed the young man, with eyes
flashing fire; &quot;I! - Why do you not advise me to marry her?  Perhaps the king would consent now.&quot;  And he rose from his chair full of anger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
see,&quot; said Montalais, &quot;that you are not cured, and that Louise has
one enemy the more.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;One
enemy the more!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
favorites are but little beloved at the court of France.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
while she has her lover to protect her, is not that enough?  She has chosen him of such a quality that
her enemies cannot prevail against her.&quot; 
But, stopping all at once, &quot;And then she has you for a friend,
mademoiselle,&quot; added he, with a shade of irony which did not glide off the
cuirass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who!  I? - Oh, no!  I am no longer one of those whom Mademoiselle de la Vallière
condescends to look upon; but - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This <i>but</i>, so big with menace and with storm;
this <i>but</i>, which made the heart of Raoul
beat, such griefs did it presage for her whom lately he loved so dearly; this
terrible <i>but</i>, so significant in a
woman like Montalais, was interrupted by a moderately loud noise heard by the
speakers proceeding from the alcove behind the wainscoting.  Montalais turned to listen, and Raoul was
already rising, when a lady entered the room quietly by the secret door, which
she closed after her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Madame!&quot;
exclaimed Raoul, on recognizing the sister-in-law of the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Stupid
wretch!&quot; murmured Montalais, throwing herself, but too late, before the
princess, &quot;I have been mistaken in an hour!&quot;  She had, however, time to warn the princess,
who was walking towards Raoul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
de Bragelonne, Madame,&quot; and at these words the princess drew back,
uttering a cry in her turn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
royal highness,&quot; said Montalais, with volubility, &quot;is kind enough to
think of this lottery, and - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
princess began to lose countenance. 
Raoul hastened his departure, without divining all, but he felt that he
was in the way.  Madame was preparing a
word of transition to recover herself, when a closet opened in front of the
alcove, and M. de Guiche issued, all radiant, also from that closet.  The palest of the four, we must admit, was
still Raoul.  The princess, however, was
near fainting, and was obliged to lean upon the foot of the bed for
support.  No one ventured to support
her.  This scene occupied several
minutes of terrible suspense.  But Raoul
broke it.  He went up to the count,
whose inexpressible emotion made his knees tremble, and taking his hand,
&quot;Dear count,&quot; said he, &quot;tell Madame I am too unhappy not to
merit pardon; tell her also that I have loved in the course of my life, and
that the horror of the treachery that has been practiced on me renders me
inexorable towards all other treachery that may be committed around me.  This is why, mademoiselle,&quot; said he,
smiling to Montalais, &quot;I never would divulge the secret of the visits of
my friend to your apartment.  Obtain
from Madame - from Madame, who is so clement and so generous, - obtain her
pardon for you whom she has just surprised also.  You are both free, love each other, be happy!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
princess felt for a moment a despair that cannot be described; it was repugnant
to her, notwithstanding the exquisite delicacy which Raoul had exhibited, to
feel herself at the mercy of one who had discovered such an indiscretion.  It was equally repugnant to her to accept
the evasion offered by this delicate deception.  Agitated, nervous, she struggled against the double stings of these
two troubles.  Raoul comprehended her
position, and came once more to her aid. 
Bending his knee before her: &quot;Madame!&quot; said he, in a low
voice, &quot;in two days I shall be far from Paris; in a fortnight I shall be
far from France, where I shall never be seen again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Are
you going away, then?&quot; said she, with great delight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;With
M. de Beaufort.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Into
Africa!&quot; cried De Guiche, in his turn. 
&quot;You, Raoul - oh! my friend - into Africa, where everybody
dies!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
forgetting everything, forgetting that that forgetfulness itself compromised
the princess more eloquently than his presence, &quot;Ingrate!&quot; said he,
&quot;and you have not even consulted me!&quot;  And he embraced him; during which time Montalais had led away
Madame, and disappeared herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Raoul
passed his hand over his brow, and said, with a smile, &quot;I have been
dreaming!&quot;  Then warmly to Guiche,
who by degrees absorbed him, &quot;My friend,&quot; said he, &quot;I conceal
nothing from you, who are the elected of my heart.  I am going to seek death in yonder country; your secret will not
remain in my breast more than a year.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
Raoul! a man!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you know what is my thought, count? 
This is it - I shall live more vividly, being buried beneath the earth,
than I have lived for this month past. 
We are Christians, my friend, and if such sufferings were to continue, I
would not be answerable for the safety of my soul.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                De
Guiche was anxious to raise objections.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Not
one word more on my account,&quot; said Raoul; &quot;but advice to you, dear
friend; what I am going to say to you is of much greater importance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Without
doubt you risk much more than I do, because you love.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is a joy so sweet to me to be able to speak to you thus!  Well, then, De Guiche, beware of
Montalais.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!
of that kind friend?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;She
was the friend of - her you know of. 
She ruined her by pride.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are mistaken.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
now, when she has ruined her, she would ravish from her the only thing that
renders that woman excusable in my eyes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Her
love.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
do you mean by that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
mean that there is a plot formed against her who is the mistress of the king -
a plot formed in the very house of Madame.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Can
you think so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am certain of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;By
Montalais?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Take
her as the least dangerous of the enemies I dread for - the other!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Explain
yourself clearly, my friend; and if I can understand you - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
two words.  Madame has been long jealous
of the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
know she has - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
fear nothing - you are beloved - you are beloved, count; do you feel the value
of these three words?  They signify that
you can raise your head, that you can sleep tranquilly, that you can thank God
every minute of you life.  You are
beloved; that signifies that you may hear everything, even the counsel of a
friend who wishes to preserve your happiness. 
You are beloved, De Guiche, you are beloved!  You do not endure those atrocious nights, those nights without
end, which, with arid eye and fainting heart, others pass through who are
destined to die.  You will live long, if
you act like the miser who, bit by bit, crumb by crumb, collects and heaps up
diamonds and gold.  You are beloved! -
allow me to tell you what you must do that you may be beloved forever.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                De
Guiche contemplated for some time this unfortunate young man, half mad with
despair, till there passed through his heart something like remorse at his own
happiness.  Raoul suppressed his
feverish excitement, to assume the voice and countenance of an impassible man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;They
will make her, whose name I should wish still to be able to pronounce - they
will make her suffer.  Swear to me that
you will not second them in anything - but that you will defend her when
possible, as I would have done myself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
swear I will,&quot; replied De Guiche.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And,&quot;
continued Raoul, &quot;some day, when you shall have rendered her a great
service - some day when she shall thank you, promise me to say these words to
her - 'I have done you this kindness, madame, at the warm request of M. de
Bragelonne, whom you so deeply injured.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I swear I will,&quot;
murmured De Guiche.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                 &quot;That is all.  Adieu!  I set out
to-morrow, or the day after, for Toulon. 
If you have a few hours to spare, give them to me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;All!
all!&quot; cried the young man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Thank
you!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
what are you going to do now?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am going to meet M. le comte at Planchet's residence, where we hope to find M.
d'Artagnan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
d'Artagnan?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
I wish to embrace him before my departure. 
He is a brave man, who loves me dearly. 
Farewell, my friend; you are expected, no doubt; you will find me, when
you wish, at the lodgings of the comte. 
Farewell!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The two
young men embraced.  Those who chanced
to see them both thus, would not have hesitated to say, pointing to Raoul,
&quot;That is the happy man!&quot;</p>

during the visit made to the Luxembourg by Raoul, had gone to Planchet's
residence to inquire after D'Artagnan. 
The comte, on arriving at the Rue des Lombards, found the shop of the
grocer in great confusion; but it was not the encumberment of a lucky sale, or
that of an arrival of goods.  Planchet
was not enthroned, as usual, on sacks and barrels.  No.  A young man with a
pen behind his ear, and another with an account-book in his hand, were setting
down a number of figures, whilst a third counted and weighed.  An inventory was being taken.  Athos, who had no knowledge of commercial
matters, felt himself a little embarrassed by material obstacles and the
majesty of those who were thus employed. 
He saw several customers sent away, and asked himself whether he, who
came to buy nothing, would not be more properly deemed importunate.  He therefore asked very politely if he could
see M. Planchet.  The reply, quite
carelessly given, was that M. Planchet was packing his trunks.  These words surprised Athos.  &quot;What! his trunks?&quot; said he;
&quot;is M. Planchet going away?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monsieur, directly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then,
if you please, inform him that M. le Comte de la Fère desires to speak to him
for a moment.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At the
mention of the comte's name, one of the young men, no doubt accustomed to hear
it pronounced with respect, immediately went to inform Planchet.  It was at this moment that Raoul, after his
painful scene with Montalais and De Guiche, arrived at the grocer's house.  Planchet left his job directly he received
the comte's message.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
monsieur le comte!&quot; exclaimed he, &quot;how glad I am to see you!  What good star brings you here?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
dear Planchet,&quot; said Athos, pressing the hand of his son, whose sad look
he silently observed, - &quot;we are come to learn of you - But in what
confusion do I find you!  You are as
white as a miller; where have you been rummaging?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah,
<i>diable!</i> take care, monsieur; don't
come near me till I have well shaken myself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
for?  Flour or dust only whiten.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
no; what you see on my arms is arsenic.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Arsenic?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
I am taking my precautions against rats.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ay,
I suppose in an establishment like this, rats play a conspicuous part.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is not with this establishment I concern myself, monsieur le comte.  The rats have robbed me of more here than
they will ever rob me of again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
you may have observed, monsieur, my inventory is being taken.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Are
you leaving trade, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh!
<i>mon Dieu!</i> yes.  I have disposed of my business to one of my
young men.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bah!
you are rich, then, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,
I have taken a dislike to the city; I don't know whether it is because I am
growing old, and as M. d'Artagnan one day said, when we grow old we more often
think of the adventures of our youth; but for some time past I have felt myself
attracted towards the country and gardening. 
I was a countryman formerly.&quot; 
And Planchet marked this confession with a rather pretentious laugh for
a man making profession of humility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Athos
made a gesture of approval, and then added: &quot;You are going to buy an
estate, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have bought one, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
that is still better.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
little house at Fontainebleau, with something like twenty acres of land round
it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
well, Planchet!  Accept my compliments
on your acquisition.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,
monsieur, we are not comfortable here; the cursed dust makes you cough.  <i>Corbleu!</i>  I do not wish to poison the most worthy
gentleman in the kingdom.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Athos
did not smile at this little pleasantry which Planchet had aimed at him, in
order to try his strength in mundane facetiousness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,&quot;
said Athos, &quot;let us have a little talk by ourselves - in your own room,
for example.  You have a room, have you not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Certainly,
monsieur le comte.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Upstairs,
perhaps?&quot;  And Athos, seeing
Planchet a little embarrassed, wished to relieve him by going first.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is - but - &quot; said Planchet, hesitating.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Athos
was mistaken in the cause of this hesitation, and, attributing it to a fear the
grocer might have of offering humble hospitality, &quot;Never mind, never
mind,&quot; said he, still going up, &quot;the dwelling of a tradesman in this
quarter is not expected to be a palace. 
Come on.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Raoul
nimbly preceded him, and entered first. 
Two cries were heard simultaneously - we may say three.  One of these cries dominated the others; it
emanated from a woman.  Another
proceeded from the mouth of Raoul; it was an exclamation of surprise.  He had no sooner uttered it than he shut the
door sharply.  The third was from
fright; it came from Planchet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
ask your pardon!&quot; added he; &quot;madame is dressing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Raoul
had, no doubt, seen that what Planchet said was true, for he turned round to go
downstairs again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Madame
- &quot; said Athos.  &quot;Oh! pardon
me, Planchet, I did not know that you had upstairs - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is Trüchen,&quot; added Planchet, blushing a little.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is whoever you please, my good Planchet; but pardon my rudeness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
no; go up now, gentlemen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
will do no such thing,&quot; said Athos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
madame, having notice, has had time - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
Planchet; farewell!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh,
gentlemen! you would not disoblige me by thus standing on the staircase, or by
going away without having sat down.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
we had known you had a lady upstairs,&quot; replied Athos, with his customary
coolness, &quot;we would have asked permission to pay our respects to
her.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Planchet
was so disconcerted by this little extravagance, that he forced the passage,
and himself opened the door to admit the comte and his son.  Trüchen was quite dressed: in the costume of
the shopkeeper's wife, rich yet coquettish; German eyes attacking French
eyes.  She left the apartment after two
courtesies, and went down into the shop - but not without having listened at
the door, to know what Planchet's gentlemen visitors would say of her.  Athos suspected that, and therefore turned
the conversation accordingly.  Planchet,
on his part, was burning to give explanations, which Athos avoided.  But, as certain tenacities are stronger than
others, Athos was forced to hear Planchet recite his idyls of felicity,
translated into a language more chaste than that of Longus.  So Planchet related how Trüchen had charmed
the years of his advancing age, and brought good luck to his business, as Ruth
did to Boaz.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
want nothing now, then, but heirs to your property.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
I had one he would have three hundred thousand livres,&quot; said Planchet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Humph!
you must have one, then,&quot; said Athos, phlegmatically, &quot;if only to
prevent your little fortune being lost.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This word
<i>little fortune</i> placed Planchet in his
rank, like the voice of the sergeant when Planchet was but a <i>piqueur</i> in the regiment of Piedmont, in
which Rochefort had placed him.  Athos
perceived that the grocer would marry Trüchen, and, in spite of fate, establish
a family.  This appeared the more
evident to him when he learned that the young man to whom Planchet was selling
the business was her cousin.  Having
heard all that was necessary of the happy prospects of the retiring grocer,
&quot;What is M. d'Artagnan about?&quot; said he; &quot;he is not at the
Louvre.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
monsieur le comte, Monsieur d'Artagnan has disappeared.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Disappeared!&quot;
said Athos, in surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
monsieur, we know what that means.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
<i>I</i> do not know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Whenever
M. d'Artagnan disappears it is always for some mission or some great
affair.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Has
he said anything to you about it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Never.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
were acquainted with his departure for England formerly, were you not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;On
account of the speculation.&quot; said Planchet, heedlessly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
speculation!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
mean - &quot; interrupted Planchet, quite confused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
well; neither your affairs nor those of your master are in question; the
interest we take in him alone has induced me to apply to you.  Since the captain of the musketeers is not
here, and as we cannot learn from you where we are likely to find M.
d'Artagnan, we will take our leave of you. 
<i>Au revoir</i>, Planchet, <i>au revoir</i>.  Let us be gone, Raoul.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
le comte, I wish I were able to tell you - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
not at all; I am not the man to reproach a servant with discretion.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This
word &quot;servant&quot; struck rudely on the ears of the <i>demi-millionnaire</i> Planchet, but natural respect and <i>bonhomie</i> prevailed over pride.  &quot;There is nothing indiscreet in telling
you, monsieur le comte, M. d'Artagnan came here the other day - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Aha?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
remained several hours consulting a geographical chart.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are right, then, my friend; say no more about it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
the chart is there as a proof,&quot; added Planchet, who went to fetch from the
neighboring wall, where it was suspended by a twist, forming a triangle with
the bar of the window to which it was fastened, the plan consulted by the
captain on his last visit to Planchet. 
This plan, which he brought to the comte, was a map of France, upon
which the practiced eye of that gentleman discovered an itinerary, marked out
with small pins; wherever a pin was missing, a hole denoted its having been
there.  Athos, by following with his eye
the pins and holes, saw that D'Artagnan had taken the direction of the south,
and gone as far as the Mediterranean, towards Toulon.  It was near Cannes that the marks and the punctured places
ceased.  The Comte de la Fère puzzled
his brains for some time, to divine what the musketeer could be going to do at
Cannes, and what motive could have led him to examine the banks of the
Var.  The reflections of Athos suggested
nothing.  His accustomed perspicacity
was at fault.  Raoul's researches were
not more successful than his father's.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Never
mind,&quot; said the young man to the comte, who silently, and with his finger,
had made him understand the route of D'Artagnan; &quot;we must confess that
there is a Providence always occupied in connecting our destiny with that of M.
d'Artagnan.  There he is on the coast of
Cannes, and you, monsieur, will, at least, conduct me as far as Toulon.  Be assured that we shall meet with him more
easily upon our route than on this map.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Then,
taking leave of Planchet, who was scolding his shopmen, even the cousin of
Trüchen, his successor, the gentlemen set out to pay a visit to M. de
Beaufort.  On leaving the grocer's shop,
they saw a coach, the future depository of the charms of Mademoiselle Trüchen
and Planchet's bags of crowns.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Every
one journeys towards happiness by the route he chooses,&quot; said Raoul, in a
melancholy tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Road
to Fontainebleau!&quot; cried Planchet to his coachman.</p>

have talked of D'Artagnan with Planchet, to have seen Planchet quit Paris to
bury himself in his country retreat, had been for Athos and his son like a last
farewell to the noise of the capital - to their life of former days.  What, in fact, did these men leave behind
them - one of whom had exhausted the past age in glory, and the other, the
present age in misfortune?  Evidently
neither of them had anything to ask of his contemporaries.  They had only to pay a visit to M. de
Beaufort, and arrange with him the particulars of departure.  The duke was lodged magnificently in
Paris.  He had one of those superb
establishments pertaining to great fortunes, the like of which certain old men
remembered to have seen in all their glory in the times of wasteful liberality
of Henry III.'s reign.  Then, really,
several great nobles were richer than the king.  They knew it, used it, and never deprived themselves of the
pleasure of humiliating his royal majesty when they had an opportunity.  It was this egotistical aristocracy
Richelieu had constrained to contribute, with its blood, its purse, and its
duties, to what was from his time styled the king's service.  From Louis XI. - that terrible mower-down of
the great - to Richelieu, how many families had raised their heads!  How many, from Richelieu to Louis XIV., had
bowed their heads, never to raise them again! 
But M. de Beaufort was born a prince, and of a blood which is not shed
upon scaffolds, unless by the decree of peoples, - a prince who had kept up a
grand style of living.  How did he
maintain his horses, his people, and his table?  Nobody knew; himself less than others.  Only there were then privileges for the sons of kings, to whom
nobody refused to become a creditor, whether from respect or the persuasion
that they would some day be paid.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Athos
and Raoul found the mansion of the duke in as much confusion as that of
Planchet.  The duke, likewise, was
making his inventory; that is to say, he was distributing to his friends
everything of value he had in his house. 
Owing nearly two millions - an enormous amount in those days - M. de
Beaufort had calculated that he could not set out for Africa without a good
round sum, and, in order to find that sum, he was distributing to his old
creditors plate, arms, jewels, and furniture, which was more magnificent in
selling it, and brought him back double. 
In fact, how could a man to whom ten thousand livres were owing, refuse
to carry away a present worth six thousand, enhanced in estimation from having
belonged to a descendant of Henry IV.? 
And how, after having carried away that present, could he refuse ten
thousand livres more to this generous noble? 
This, then, was what had happened. 
The duke had no longer a dwelling-house - that had become useless to an
admiral whose place of residence is his ship; he had no longer need of
superfluous arms, when he was placed amidst his cannons; no more jewels, which
the sea might rob him of; but he had three or four hundred thousand crowns
fresh in his coffers.  And throughout
the house there was a joyous movement of people who believed they were
plundering monseigneur.  The prince had,
in a supreme degree, the art of making happy the creditors most to be
pitied.  Every distressed man, every
empty purse, found in him patience and sympathy for his position.  To some he said, &quot;I wish I had what <i>you </i>have; I would give it
you.&quot;  And to others, &quot;I have
but this silver ewer; it is worth at least five hundred livres, - take
it.&quot;  The effect of which was - so
truly is courtesy a current payment - that the prince constantly found means to
renew his creditors.  This time he used
no ceremony; it might be called a general pillage.  He gave up everything. 
The Oriental fable of the poor Arab who carried away from the pillage of
palace a kettle at the bottom of which was concealed a bag of gold, and whom
everybody allowed to pass without jealousy, - this fable had become a truth in
the prince's mansion.  Many contractors
paid themselves upon the offices of the duke. 
Thus, the provision department, who plundered the clothes-presses and
the harness-rooms, attached very little value to things which tailors and
saddlers set great store by.  Anxious to
carry home to their wives presents given them by monseigneur, many were seen
bounding joyously along, under the weight of earthen jars and bottles,
gloriously stamped with the arms of the prince.  M. de Beaufort finished by giving away his horses and the hay
from his lofts.  He made more than
thirty happy with kitchen utensils; and thirty more with the contents of his
cellar.  Still further; all these people
went away with the conviction that M. de Beaufort only acted in this manner to
prepare for a new fortune concealed beneath the Arabs' tents.  They repeated to each other, while pillaging
his hotel, that he was sent to Gigelli by the king to reconstruct his lost fortunes;
that the treasures of Africa would be equally divided between the admiral and
the king of France; that these treasures consisted in mines of diamonds, or
other fabulous stones; the gold and silver mines of Mount Atlas did not even
obtain the honor of being named.  In
addition to the mines to be worked - which could not be begun till after the
campaign - there would be the booty made by the army.  M. de Beaufort would lay his hands on all the riches pirates had
robbed Christendom of since the battle of Lepanto.  The number of millions from these sources defied
calculation.  Why, then, should he, who
was going in quest of such treasure, set any store by the poor utensils of his
past life?  And reciprocally, why should
they spare the property of him who spared it so little himself?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Such
was the position of affairs.  Athos,
with his piercing practiced glance, saw what was going on at once.  He found the admiral of France a little
exalted, for he was rising from a table of fifty covers, at which the guests
had drunk long and deeply to the prosperity of the expedition; at the
conclusion of which repast, the remains, with the dessert, had been given to
the servants, and the empty dishes and plates to the curious.  The prince was intoxicated with his ruin and
his popularity at one and the same time.  He had drunk his old wine to the health of his wine of the
future.  When he saw Athos and Raoul:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
is my aide-de-camp being brought to me!&quot; he cried.  &quot;Come hither, comte; come hither,
vicomte.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Athos
tried to find a passage through the heaps of linen and plate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
step over, step over!&quot; said the duke, offering a full glass to Athos.  The latter drank it; Raoul scarcely
moistened his lips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Here
is your commission,&quot; said the prince to Raoul.  &quot;I had prepared it, reckoning upon you.  You will go before me as far as
Antibes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Here
is the order.&quot;  And De Beaufort
gave Raoul the order.  &quot;Do you know
anything of the sea?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur; I have traveled with M. le Prince.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is well.  All these barges and lighters
must be in attendance to form an escort and carry my provisions.  The army must be prepared to embark in a
fortnight at the very latest.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
shall be done, monseigneur.&quot;<br>                &quot;The present order
gives you the right to visit and search all the isles along the coast; you will
there make the enrolments and levies you may want for me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monsieur le duc.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
you are an active man, and will work freely, you will spend much money.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
hope not, monseigneur.&quot;<br>                &quot;But I am sure you
will.  My intendant has prepared the
orders of a thousand livres, drawn upon the cities of the south; he will give
you a hundred of them.  Now, dear
vicomte, be gone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Athos
interrupted the prince.  &quot;Keep your
money, monseigneur; war is to be waged among the Arabs with gold as well as lead.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
wish to try the contrary,&quot; replied the duke; &quot;and then you are
acquainted with my ideas upon the expedition - plenty of noise, plenty of fire,
and, if so it must be, I shall disappear in the smoke.&quot;  Having spoken thus, M. de Beaufort began to
laugh; but his mirth was not reciprocated by Athos and Raoul.  He perceived this at once.  &quot;Ah,&quot; said he, with the courteous
egotism of his rank and age, &quot;you are such people as a man should not see
after dinner; you are cold, stiff, and dry when I am all fire, suppleness, and
wine.  No, devil take me!  I should always see you fasting, vicomte,
and you, comte, if you wear such a face as that, you shall see me no
more.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He said
this, pressing the hand of Athos, who replied with a smile, &quot;Monseigneur,
do not talk so grandly because you happen to have plenty of money.  I predict that within a month you will be
dry, stiff, and cold, in presence of your strong-box, and that then, having
Raoul at your elbow, fasting, you will be surprised to see him gay, animated, and
generous, because he will have some new crowns to offer you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;God
grant it may be so!&quot; cried the delighted duke.  &quot;Comte, stay with me!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
I shall go with Raoul; the mission with which you charge him is a troublesome
and difficult one.  Alone it would be
too much for him to execute.  You do not
observe, monseigneur, you have given him command of the first order.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bah!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;And in your naval
arrangements, too.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That may be true.  But one finds that such fine young fellows as
your son generally do all that is required of them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monseigneur, I believe you
will find nowhere so much zeal and intelligence, so much real bravery, as in
Raoul; but if he failed to arrange your embarkation, you would only meet the
fate that you deserve.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Humph! you are scolding me,
then.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monseigneur, to provision a
fleet, to assemble a flotilla, to enroll your maritime force, would take an
admiral a year.  Raoul is a cavalry
officer, and you allow him a fortnight!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I tell you he will do
it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He may; but I will go and
help him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;To be sure you will; I
reckoned upon you, and still further believe that when we are once at Toulon
you will not let him depart alone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Athos, shaking
his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Patience! patience!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monseigneur, permit us to take
our leave.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Begone, then, and may my good
luck attend you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Adieu! monseigneur; and may
your own good luck attend you likewise.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Here is an expedition
admirably commenced!&quot; said Athos to his son.  &quot;No provisions - no store flotilla!  What can be done, thus?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Humph!&quot; murmured Raoul;
&quot;if all are going to do as I am, provisions will not be wanted.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; replied
Athos, sternly, &quot;do not be unjust and senseless in your egotism, or your
grief, whichever you please to call it. 
If you set out for this war solely with the intention of getting killed
therein, you stand in need of nobody, and it was scarcely worth while to
recommend you to M. de Beaufort.  But
when you have been introduced to the prime commandant - when you have accepted
the responsibility of a post in his army, the question is no longer about <i>you</i>, but about all those poor soldiers,
who, as well as you, have hearts and bodies, who will weep for their country
and endure all the necessities of their condition.  Remember, Raoul, that officers are ministers as useful to the
world as priests, and that they ought to have more charity.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur, I know it and have
practiced it; I would have continued to do so still, but - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You forget also that you are
of a country that is proud of its military glory; go and die if you like, but
do not die without honor and without advantage to France.  Cheer up, Raoul! do not let my words grieve
you; I love you, and wish to see you perfect.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I love your reproaches,
monsieur,&quot; said the young man, mildly; &quot;they alone may cure me,
because they prove to me that some one loves me still.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And now, Raoul, let us be
off; the weather is so fine, the heavens so clear, those heavens which we
always find above our heads, which you will see more clear still at Gigelli, and
which will speak to you of me there, as they speak to me here of God.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The two gentlemen, after having
agreed on this point, talked over the wild freaks of the duke, convinced that
France would be served in a very incomplete manner, as regarded both spirit and
practice, in the ensuing expedition; and having summed up the ducal policy
under the one word vanity, they set forward, in obedience rather to their will
than destiny.  The sacrifice was half
accomplished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he
journey passed off pretty well.  Athos
and his son traversed France at the rate of fifteen leagues per day; sometimes
more, sometimes less, according to the intensity of Raoul's grief.  It took them a fortnight to reach Toulon,
and they lost all traces of D'Artagnan at Antibes.  They were forced to believe that the captain of the musketeers
was desirous of preserving an incognito on his route, for Athos derived from
his inquiries an assurance that such a cavalier as he described had exchanged
his horse for a well-closed carriage on quitting Avignon.  Raoul was much affected at not meeting with
D'Artagnan.  His affectionate heart
longed to take a farewell and received consolation from that heart of
steel.  Athos knew from experience that
D'Artagnan became impenetrable when engaged in any serious affair, whether on
his own account or on the service of the king. 
He even feared to offend his friend, or thwart him by too pressing
inquiries.  And yet when Raoul commenced
his labor of classing the flotilla, and got together the <i>chalands</i> and lighters to send them to Toulon, one of the fishermen
told the comte that his boat had been laid up to refit since a trip he had made
on account of a gentleman who was in great haste to embark.  Athos, believing that this man was telling a
falsehood in order to be left at liberty to fish, and so gain more money when
all his companions were gone, insisted upon having the details.  The fisherman informed him that six days
previously, a man had come in the night to hire his boat, for the purpose of
visiting the island of St. Honnorat. 
The price was agreed upon, but the gentleman had arrived with an immense
carriage case, which he insisted upon embarking, in spite of the many
difficulties that opposed the operation. 
The fisherman wished to retract. 
He had even threatened, but his threats had procured him nothing but a
shower of blows from the gentleman's cane, which fell upon his shoulders sharp
and long.  Swearing and grumbling, he
had recourse to the syndic of his brotherhood at Antibes, who administer
justice among themselves and protect each other; but the gentleman had
exhibited a certain paper, at sight of which the syndic, bowing to the very
ground, enjoined obedience from the fisherman, and abused him for having been
refractory.  They then departed with the
freight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
all this does not tell us,&quot; said Athos, &quot;how you injured your
boat.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;This
is the way.  I was steering towards St.
Honnorat as the gentleman desired me; but he changed his mind, and pretended
that I could not pass to the south of the abbey.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
why not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Because,
monsieur, there is in front of the square tower of the Benedictines, towards
the southern point, the bank of the <i>Moines</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
rock?&quot; asked Athos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Level
with the water, but below water; a dangerous passage, yet one I have cleared a
thousand times; the gentleman required me to land him at
Sainte-Marguerite's.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
monsieur!&quot; cried the fisherman, with his <i>Provençal</i> accent, &quot;a man is a sailor, or he is not; he knows
his course, or he is nothing but a fresh-water lubber.  I was obstinate, and wished to try the
channel.  The gentleman took me by the
collar, and told me quietly he would strangle me.  My mate armed himself with a hatchet, and so did I.  We had the affront of the night before to
pay him out for.  But the gentleman drew
his sword, and used it in such an astonishingly rapid manner, that we neither
of us could get near him.  I was about
to hurl my hatchet at his head, and I had a right to do so, hadn't I, monsieur?
for a sailor aboard is master, as a citizen is in his chamber; I was going,
then, in self-defense, to cut the gentleman in two, when, all at once - believe
me or not, monsieur - the great carriage case opened of itself, I don't know
how, and there came out of it a sort of a phantom, his head covered with a
black helmet and a black mask, something terrible to look upon, which came
towards me threatening with its fist.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
that was - &quot; said Athos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
was the devil, monsieur; for the gentleman, with great glee, cried out, on
seeing him: 'Ah! thank you, monseigneur!'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
most strange story!&quot; murmured the comte, looking at Raoul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
what did you do?&quot; asked the latter of the fisherman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
must know, monsieur, that two poor men, such as we are, could be no match for
two gentlemen; but when one of them turned out to be the devil, we had no
earthly chance!  My companion and I did
not stop to consult one another; we made but one jump into the sea, for we were
within seven or eight hundred feet of the shore.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
and then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
and then, monseigneur, as there was a little wind from the southwest, the boat
drifted into the sands of Sainte-Marguerite's.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
- but the travelers?&quot;<br>                &quot;Bah! you need not be
uneasy about them!  It was pretty plain
that one was the devil, and protected the other; for when we recovered the
boat, after she got afloat again, instead of finding these two creatures
injured by the shock, we found nothing, not even the carriage or the
case.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
strange! very strange!&quot; repeated the comte.  &quot;But after that, what did you do, my friend?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
made my complaint to the governor of Sainte-Marguerite's, who brought my finger
under my nose by telling me if I plagued him with such silly stories he would
have me flogged.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!
did the governor himself say so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monsieur; and yet my boat was injured, seriously injured, for the prow is left
upon the point of Sainte-Marguerite's, and the carpenter asks a hundred and
twenty livres to repair it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
well,&quot; replied Raoul; &quot;you will be exempted from the service.  Go.&quot;<br>                &quot;We will go to
Sainte-Marguerite's, shall we?&quot; said the comte to Bragelonne, as the man
walked away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monsieur, for there is something to be cleared up; that man does not seem to me
to have told the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nor
to me either, Raoul.  The story of the
masked man and the carriage having disappeared, may be told to conceal some
violence these fellows have committed upon their passengers in the open sea, to
punish him for his persistence in embarking.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
formed the same suspicion; the carriage was more likely to contain property
than a man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
shall see to that, Raoul.  The gentleman
very much resembles D'Artagnan; I recognize his methods of proceeding.  Alas! we are no longer the young invincibles
of former days.  Who knows whether the
hatchet or the iron bar of this miserable coaster has not succeeded in doing
that which the best blades of Europe, balls, and bullets have not been able to
do in forty years?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                That
same day they set out for Sainte-Marguerite's, on board a <i>chasse-marée</i> come from Toulon under orders.  The impression they experienced on landing
was a singularly pleasing one.  The
island seemed loaded with flowers and fruits. 
In its cultivated part it served as a garden for the governor.  Orange, pomegranate, and fig trees bent
beneath the weight of their golden or purple fruits.  All round this garden, in the uncultivated parts, red partridges
ran about in conveys among the brambles and tufts of junipers, and at every step
of the comte and Raoul a terrified rabbit quitted his thyme and heath to
scuttle away to the burrow.  In fact,
this fortunate isle was uninhabited. 
Flat, offering nothing but a tiny bay for the convenience of embarkation,
and under the protection of the governor, who went shares with them, smugglers
made use of it as a provisional <i>entrepôt</i>,
at the expense of not killing the game or devastating the garden.  With this compromise, the governor was in a
situation to be satisfied with a garrison of eight men to guard his fortress,
in which twelve cannons accumulated coats of moldy green.  The governor was a sort of happy farmer,
harvesting wines, figs, oil, and oranges, preserving his citrons and <i>cédrates</i> in the sun of his
casemates.  The fortress, encircled by a
deep ditch, its only guardian, arose like three heads upon turrets connected
with each other by terraces covered with moss.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Athos
and Raoul wandered for some time round the fences of the garden without finding
any one to introduce them to the governor. 
They ended by making their own way into the garden.  It was at the hottest time of the day.  Each living thing sought its shelter under
grass or stone.  The heavens spread their
fiery veils as if to stifle all noises, to envelop all existences; the rabbit
under the broom, the fly under the leaf, slept as the wave did beneath the
heavens.  Athos saw nothing living but a
soldier, upon the terrace beneath the second and third court, who was carrying
a basket of provisions on his head. 
This man returned almost immediately without his basket, and disappeared
in the shade of his sentry-box.  Athos
supposed he must have been carrying dinner to some one, and, after having done
so, returned to dine himself.  All at
once they heard some one call out, and raising their heads, perceived in the
frame of the bars of the window something of a white color, like a hand that
was waved backwards and forwards - something shining, like a polished weapon
struck by the rays of the sun.  And
before they were able to ascertain what it was, a luminous train, accompanied
by a hissing sound in the air, called their attention from the donjon to the
ground.  A second dull noise was heard
from the ditch, and Raoul ran to pick up a silver plate which was rolling along
the dry sand.  The hand that had thrown
this plate made a sign to the two gentlemen, and then disappeared.  Athos and Raoul, approaching each other,
commenced an attentive examination of the dusty plate, and they discovered, in
characters traced upon the bottom of it with the point of a knife, this
inscription:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>I am the brother of the king of France - a
prisoner to-day - a madman to-morrow. 
French gentlemen and Christians, pray to God for the soul and the reason
of the son of your old rulers</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The plate
fell from the hands of Athos whilst Raoul was endeavoring to make out the
meaning of these dismal words.  At the
same moment they heard a cry from the top of the donjon.  Quick as lightning Raoul bent down his head,
and forced down that of his father likewise. 
A musket-barrel glittered from the crest of the wall.  A white smoke floated like a plume from the
mouth of the musket, and a ball was flattened against a stone within six inches
of the two gentlemen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Cordieu!</i>&quot; cried Athos.  &quot;What, are people assassinated
here?  Come down, cowards as you
are!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
come down!&quot; cried Raoul, furiously shaking his fist at the castle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                One of
the assailants - he who was about to fire - replied to these cries by an
exclamation of surprise; and, as his companion, who wished to continue the
attack, had re-seized his loaded musket, he who had cried out threw up the
weapon, and the ball flew into the air. 
Athos and Raoul, seeing them disappear from the platform, expected they would
come down to them, and waited with a firm demeanor.  Five minutes had not elapsed, when a stroke upon a drum called
the eight soldiers of the garrison to arms, and they showed themselves on the
other side of the ditch with their muskets in hand.  At the head of these men was an officer, whom Athos and Raoul
recognized as the one who had fired the first musket.  The man ordered the soldiers to &quot;make ready.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
are going to be shot!&quot; cried Raoul; &quot;but, sword in hand, at least,
let us leap the ditch!  We shall kill at
least two of these scoundrels, when their muskets are empty.&quot;  And, suiting the action to the word, Raoul
was springing forward, followed by Athos, when a well-known voice resounded
behind them, &quot;Athos!  Raoul!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;D'Artagnan!&quot;
replied the two gentlemen.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Recover
arms!  <i>Mordioux!</i>&quot; cried the captain to the soldiers.  &quot;I was sure I could not be
mistaken!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is the meaning of this?&quot; asked Athos. 
&quot;What! were we to be shot without warning?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
was I who was going to shoot you, and if the governor missed you, I should not
have missed you, my dear friends.  How
fortunate it is that I am accustomed to take a long aim, instead of firing at
the instant I raise my weapon!  I
thought I recognized you.  Ah! my dear
friends, how fortunate!&quot;  And
D'Artagnan wiped his brow, for he had run fast, and emotion with him was not
feigned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How!&quot;
said Athos.  &quot;And is the gentleman
who fired at us the governor of the fortress?&quot;<br>                &quot;In person.&quot;<br>                &quot;And why did he fire
at us?  What have we done to him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Pardieu!</i>  You received what the prisoner threw to you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is true.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
plate - the prisoner has written something on it, has he not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Good
heavens!  I was afraid he had.&quot;<br>                And D'Artagnan, with all
the marks of mortal disquietude, seized the plate, to read the
inscription.  When he had read it, a
fearful pallor spread across his countenance. 
&quot;Oh! good heavens!&quot; repeated he.  &quot;Silence! - Here is the governor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
what will he do to us?  Is it our
fault?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is true, then?&quot; said Athos, in a subdued voice.  &quot;It is true?&quot;<br>                &quot;Silence!  I tell you - silence!  If he only believes you can read; if he only
suspects you have understood; I love you, my dear friends, I would willingly be
killed for you, but - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
- &quot; said Athos and Raoul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
I could not save you from perpetual imprisonment if I saved you from
death.  Silence, then!  Silence again!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
governor came up, having crossed the ditch upon a plank bridge.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!&quot;
said he to D'Artagnan, &quot;what stops us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are Spaniards - you do not understand a word of French,&quot; said the captain,
eagerly, to his friends in a low voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!&quot;
replied he, addressing the governor, &quot;I was right; these gentlemen are two
Spanish captains with whom I was acquainted at Ypres, last year; they don't
know a word of French.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
said the governor, sharply.  &quot;And
yet they were trying to read the inscription on the plate.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
took it out of his hands, effacing the characters with the point of his sword.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How!&quot;
cried the governor, &quot;what are you doing? 
I cannot read them now!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is a state secret,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, bluntly; &quot;and as you know
that, according to the king's orders, it is under the penalty of death any one
should penetrate it, I will, if you like, allow you to read it, and have you
shot immediately afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                During
this apostrophe - half serious, half ironical - Athos and Raoul preserved the
coolest, most unconcerned silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,
is it possible,&quot; said the governor, &quot;that these gentlemen do not
comprehend at least some words?&quot;<br>                &quot;Suppose they
do!  If they do understand a few spoken
words, it does not follow that they should understand what is written.  They cannot even read Spanish.  A noble Spaniard, remember, ought never to
know how to read.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
governor was obliged to be satisfied with these explanations, but he was still
tenacious.  &quot;Invite these gentlemen
to come to the fortress,&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
I will willingly do.  I was about to
propose it to you.&quot;  The fact is,
the captain had quite another idea, and would have wished his friends a hundred
leagues off.  But he was obliged to make
the best of it.  He addressed the two
gentlemen in Spanish, giving them a polite invitation, which they accepted.  They all turned towards the entrance of the
fort, and, the incident being at an end, the eight soldiers returned to their
delightful leisure, for a moment disturbed by this unexpected adventure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span

they had entered the fort, and whilst the governor was making some preparations
for the reception of his guests, &quot;Come,&quot; said Athos, &quot;let us
have a word of explanation whilst we are alone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is simply this,&quot; replied the musketeer. 
&quot;I have conducted hither a prisoner, who the king commands shall
not be seen.  You came here, he has
thrown something to you through the lattice of his window; I was at dinner with
the governor, I saw the object thrown, and I saw Raoul pick it up.  It does not take long to understand
this.  I understood it, and I thought
you in intelligence with my prisoner. 
And then - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
then - you commanded us to be shot.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Ma foi!</i> 
I admit it; but, if I was the first to seize a musket, fortunately, I
was the last to take aim at you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
you had killed me, D'Artagnan, I should have had the good fortune to die for
the royal house of France, and it would be an honor to die by your hand - you,
its noblest and most loyal defender.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
the devil, Athos, do you mean by the royal house?&quot; stammered
D'Artagnan.  &quot;You don't mean that
you, a well-informed and sensible man, can place any faith in the nonsense
written by an idiot?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
do believe in it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;With
so much the more reason, my dear chevalier, from your having orders to kill all
those who do believe in it,&quot; said Raoul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is because,&quot; replied the captain of the musketeers - &quot;because every
calumny, however absurd it may be, has the almost certain chance of becoming
popular.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
D'Artagnan,&quot; replied Athos, promptly; &quot;but because the king is not
willing that the secret of his family should transpire among the people, and
cover with shame the executioners of the son of Louis XIII.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
not talk in such a childish manner, Athos, or I shall begin to think you have
lost your senses.  Besides, explain to
me how it is possible Louis XIII. should have a son in the Isle of
Sainte-Marguerite.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
son whom you have brought hither masked, in a fishing-boat,&quot; said
Athos.  &quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
was brought to a pause.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!&quot;
said he; &quot;whence do you know that a fishing-boat - ?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Brought
you to Sainte-Marguerite's with the carriage containing the prisoner - with a
prisoner whom you styled monseigneur. 
Oh!  I am acquainted with all
that,&quot; resumed the comte. 
D'Artagnan bit his mustache.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
it were true,&quot; said he, &quot;that I had brought hither in a boat and with
a carriage a masked prisoner, nothing proves that this prisoner must be a
prince - a prince of the house of France.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ask
Aramis such riddles,&quot; replied Athos, coolly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Aramis,&quot;
cried the musketeer, quite at a stand. 
&quot;Have you seen Aramis?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;After
his discomfiture at Vaux, yes; I have seen Aramis, a fugitive, pursued,
bewildered, ruined; and Aramis has told me enough to make me believe in the
complaints this unfortunate young prince cut upon the bottom of the
plate.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan's
head sunk on his breast in some confusion. 
&quot;This is the way,&quot; said he, &quot;in which God turns to
nothing that which men call wisdom!  A
fine secret must that be of which twelve or fifteen persons hold the tattered
fragments!  Athos, cursed be the chance
which has brought you face to face with me in this affair! for now - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,&quot;
said Athos, with his customary mild severity, &quot;is your secret lost because
I know it?  Consult your memory, my
friend.  Have I not borne secrets
heavier than this?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have never borne one so dangerous,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, in a tone of
sadness.  &quot;I have something like a
sinister idea that all who are concerned with this secret will die, and die
unhappily.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
will of God be done!&quot; said Athos, &quot;but here is your governor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
and his friends immediately resumed their parts.  The governor, suspicious and hard, behaved towards D'Artagnan
with a politeness almost amounting to obsequiousness.  With respect to the travelers, he contented himself with offering
good cheer, and never taking his eye from them.  Athos and Raoul observed that he often tried to embarrass them by
sudden attacks, or to catch them off their guard; but neither the one nor the
other gave him the least advantage. 
What D'Artagnan had said was probable, if the governor did not believe
it to be quite true.  They rose from the
table to repose awhile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is this man's name?  I don't like the
looks of him,&quot; said Athos to D'Artagnan in Spanish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;De
Saint-Mars,&quot; replied the captain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
is, then, I suppose, the prince's jailer?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh!
how can I tell?  I may be kept at Sainte-Marguerite
forever.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
no, not you!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
friend, I am in the situation of a man who finds a treasure in the midst of a
desert.  He would like to carry it away,
but he cannot; he would like to leave it, but he dares not.  The king will not dare to recall me, for no
one else would serve him as faithfully as I do; he regrets not having me near
him, from being aware that no one would be of so much service near his person
as myself.  But it will happen as it may
please God.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,&quot;
observed Raoul, &quot;your not being certain proves that your situation here is
provisional, and you will return to Paris?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ask
these gentlemen,&quot; interrupted the governor, &quot;what was their purpose
in coming to Saint-Marguerite?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;They
came from learning there was a convent of Benedictines at Sainte-Honnorat which
is considered curious; and from being told there was excellent shooting in the
island.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is quite at their service, as well as yours,&quot; replied Saint-Mars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
politely thanked him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;When
will they depart?&quot; added the governor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To-morrow,&quot;
replied D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                M. de
Saint-Mars went to make his rounds, and left D'Artagnan alone with the
pretended Spaniards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!&quot;
exclaimed the musketeer, &quot;here is a life and a society that suits me very
little.  I command this man, and he
bores me, <i>mordioux!</i>  Come, let us have a shot or two at the
rabbits; the walk will be beautiful, and not fatiguing.  The whole island is but a league and a half
in length, with the breadth of a league; a real park.  Let us try to amuse ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;As
you please, D'Artagnan; not for the sake of amusing ourselves, but to gain an
opportunity for talking freely.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
made a sign to a soldier, who brought the gentlemen some guns, and then
returned to the fort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
now,&quot; said the musketeer, &quot;answer me the question put to you by that
black-looking Saint-Mars: what did you come to do at the Lerin Isles?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
bid you farewell.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bid
me farewell!  What do you mean by
that?  Is Raoul going anywhere?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
I will lay a wager it is with M. de Beaufort.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;With
M. de Beaufort it is, my dear friend. 
You always guess correctly.&quot;<br>                &quot;From habit.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Whilst
the two friends were commencing their conversation, Raoul, with his head
hanging down and his heart oppressed, seated himself on a mossy rock, his gun
across his knees, looking at the sea - looking at the heavens, and listening to
the voice of his soul; he allowed the sportsmen to attain a considerable
distance from him.  D'Artagnan remarked
his absence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
has not recovered the blow?&quot; said he to Athos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
is struck to death.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
your fears exaggerate, I hope.  Raoul is
of a tempered nature.  Around all hearts
as noble as his, there is a second envelope that forms a cuirass.  The first bleeds, the second resists.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,&quot;
replied Athos, &quot;Raoul will die of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Mordioux!</i>&quot; said D'Artagnan, in a
melancholy tone.  And he did not add a
word to this exclamation.  Then, a
minute after, &quot;Why do you let him go?&quot;<br>                &quot;Because he insists
on going.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
why do you not go with him?&quot;<br>                &quot;Because I could not
bear to see him die.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
looked his friend earnestly in the face. 
&quot;You know one thing,&quot; continued the comte, leaning upon the
arm of the captain; &quot;you know that in the course of my life I have been
afraid of but few things.  Well!  I have an incessant gnawing, insurmountable
fear that an hour will come in which I shall hold the dead body of that boy in
my arms.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!&quot;
murmured D'Artagnan; &quot;oh!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
will die, I know, I have a perfect conviction of that; but I would not see him
die.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
is this, Athos? you come and place yourself in the presence of the bravest man,
you say you have ever seen, of your own D'Artagnan, of that man without an
equal, as you formerly called him, and you come and tell him, with your arms
folded, that you are afraid of witnessing the death of your son, you who have
seen all that can be seen in this world! 
Why have you this fear, Athos? 
Man upon this earth must expect everything, and ought to face
everything.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Listen
to me, my friend.  After having worn
myself out upon this earth of which you speak, I have preserved but two
religions: that of life, friendship, my duty as a father - that of eternity,
love, and respect for God.  Now, I have
within me the revelation that if God should decree that my friend or my son
should render up his last sigh in my presence - oh! no, I cannot even tell you,
D'Artagnan!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Speak,
speak, tell me!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am strong against everything, except against the death of those I love.  For that only there is no remedy.  He who dies, gains; he who sees others die,
loses.  No, this is it - to know that I
should no more meet on earth him whom I now behold with joy; to know that there
would nowhere be a  D'Artagnan any more,
nowhere again be a Raoul, oh!  I am old,
look you, I have no longer courage; I pray God to spare me in my weakness; but
if he struck me so plainly and in that fashion, I should curse him.  A Christian gentleman ought not to curse his
God, D'Artagnan; it is enough to once have cursed a king!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Humph!&quot;
sighed D'Artagnan, a little confused by this violent tempest of grief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
me speak to him, Athos.  Who
knows?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Try,
if you please, but I am convinced you will not succeed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will not attempt to console him.  I will
serve him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Doubtless,
I will.  Do you think this would be the
first time a woman had repented of an infidelity?  I will go to him, I tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Athos
shook his head, and continued his walk alone, D'Artagnan, cutting across the
brambles, rejoined Raoul and held out his hand to him.  &quot;Well, Raoul!  You have something to say to me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have a kindness to ask of you,&quot; replied Bragelonne.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ask
it, then.&quot;<br>                &quot;You will some day
return to France?&quot;<br>                &quot;I hope so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ought
I to write to Mademoiselle de la Vallière?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
you must not.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
I have many things to say to her.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Go
and say them to her, then.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Never!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Pray,
what virtue do you attribute to a letter, which your speech might not
possess?&quot;<br>                &quot;Perhaps you are
right.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;She
loves the king,&quot; said D'Artagnan, bluntly; &quot;and she is an honest
girl.&quot;  Raoul started.  &quot;And you, you whom she abandons, she,
perhaps, loves better than she does the king, but after another fashion.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;D'Artagnan,
do you believe she loves the king?&quot;<br>                &quot;To idolatry.  Her heart is inaccessible to any other
feeling.  You might continue to live
near her, and would be her best friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
exclaimed Raoul, with a passionate burst of repugnance at such a hideous hope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Will
you do so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
would be base.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is a very absurd word, which would lead me to think slightly of your understanding.  Please to understand, Raoul, that it is
never base to do that which is imposed upon us by a superior force.  If your heart says to you, 'Go there, or
die,' why go, Raoul.  Was she base or
brave, she whom you loved, in preferring the king to you, the king whom her
heart commanded her imperiously to prefer to you?  No, she was the bravest of women.  Do, then, as she has done. 
Oblige yourself.  Do you know one
thing of which I am sure, Raoul?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
that by seeing her closely with the eyes of a jealous man - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!
you would cease to love her.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
I am decided, my dear D'Artagnan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
set off to see her again?&quot;<br>                &quot;No; to set off that
I may <i>never</i> see her again.  I wish to love her forever.&quot;<br>                &quot;Ha!  I must confess,&quot; replied the musketeer,
&quot;that is a conclusion which I was far from expecting.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;This
is what I wish, my friend.  You will see
her again, and you will give her a letter which, if you think proper, will
explain to her, as to yourself, what is passing in my heart.  Read it; I drew it up last night.  Something told me I should see you
to-day.&quot;  He held the letter out,
and D'Artagnan read:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;MADEMOISELLE,
- You are not wrong in my eyes in not loving me.  You have only been guilty of one fault towards me, that of having
left me to believe you loved me.  This
error will cost me my life.  I pardon
you, but I cannot pardon myself.  It is
said that happy lovers are deaf to the sorrows of rejected lovers.  It will not be so with you, who did not love
me, save with anxiety.  I am sure that
if I had persisted in endeavoring to change that friendship into love, you
would have yielded out of a fear of bringing about my death, or lessening the
esteem I had for you.  It is much more
delightful to me to die, knowing that <i>you</i>
are free and satisfied.  How much, then,
will you love me, when you will no longer fear either my presence or
reproaches?  You will love me, because,
however charming a new love may appear to you, God has not made me in anything
inferior to him you have chosen, and because my devotedness, my sacrifice, and
my painful end will assure me, in your eyes, a certain superiority over
him.  I have allowed to escape, in the
candid credulity of my heart, the treasure I possessed.  Many people tell me that you loved me enough
to lead me to hope you would have loved me much.  That idea takes from my mind all bitterness, and leads me only to
blame myself.  You will accept this last
farewell, and you will bless me for having taken refuge in the inviolable
asylum where hatred is extinguished, and where all love endures forever.  Adieu, mademoiselle.  If your happiness could be purchased by the
last drop of my blood, I would shed that drop. 
I willingly make the sacrifice of it to my misery!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>&quot;RAOUL, VICOTME DE
BRAGELONNE.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
letter reads very well,&quot; said the captain.  &quot;I have only one fault to find with it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Tell
me what that is!&quot; said Raoul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
it is that it tells everything, except the thing which exhales, like a mortal
poison from your eyes and from your heart; except the senseless love which
still consumes you.&quot;  Raoul grew
paler, but remained silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why
did you not write simply these words:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'MADEMOISELLE,
- Instead of cursing you, I love you and I die.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is true,&quot; exclaimed Raoul, with a sinister kind of joy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
tearing the letter he had just taken back, he wrote the following words upon a
leaf of his tablets:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
procure the happiness of once more telling you I love you, I commit the
baseness of writing to you; and to punish myself for that baseness, I
die.&quot;  And he signed it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will give her these tablets, captain, will you not?&quot;<br>                &quot;When?&quot; asked
the latter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;On
the day,&quot; said Bragelonne, pointing to the last sentence, &quot;on the day
when you can place a date under these words.&quot;  And he sprang away quickly to join Athos, who was returning with
slow steps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As they
re-entered the fort, the sea rose with that rapid, gusty vehemence which
characterizes the Mediterranean; the ill-humor of the element became a
tempest.  Something shapeless, and
tossed about violently by the waves, appeared just off the coast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is that?&quot; said Athos, - &quot;a wrecked boat?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
it is not a boat,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Pardon
me,&quot; said Raoul, &quot;there is a bark gaining the port rapidly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
there is a bark in the creek, which is prudently seeking shelter here; but that
which Athos points to in the sand is not a boat at all - it has run
aground.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
yes, I see it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is the carriage, which I threw into the sea after landing the prisoner.&quot;<br>                &quot;Well!&quot; said
Athos, &quot;if you take my advice, D'Artagnan, you will burn that carriage, in
order that no vestige of it may remain, without which the fishermen of Antibes,
who have believed they had to do with the devil, will endeavor to prove that
your prisoner was but a man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
advice is good, Athos, and I will this night have it carried out, or rather, I
will carry it out myself; but let us go in, for the rain falls heavily, and the
lightning is terrific.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As they
were passing over the ramparts to a gallery of which D'Artagnan had the key,
they saw M. de Saint-Mars directing his steps towards the chamber inhabited by
the prisoner.  Upon a sign from
D'Artagnan, they concealed themselves in an angle of the staircase.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is it?&quot; said Athos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will see.  Look.  The prisoner is returning from chapel.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
they saw, by the red flashes of lightning against the violet fog which the wind
stamped upon the bank-ward sky, they saw pass gravely, at six paces behind the
governor, a man clothed in black and masked by a vizor of polished steel,
soldered to a helmet of the same nature, which altogether enveloped the whole
of his head.  The fire of the heavens
cast red reflections on the polished surface, and these reflections, flying off
capriciously, seemed to be angry looks launched by the unfortunate, instead of
imprecations.  In the middle of the
gallery, the prisoner stopped for a moment, to contemplate the infinite
horizon, to respire the sulphurous perfumes of the tempest, to drink in
thirstily the hot rain, and to breathe a sigh resembling a smothered groan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come
on, monsieur,&quot; said Saint-Mars, sharply, to the prisoner, for he already
became uneasy at seeing him look so long beyond the walls.  &quot;Monsieur, come on!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Say
monseigneur!&quot; cried Athos, from his corner, with a voice so solemn and
terrible, that the governor trembled from head to foot.  Athos insisted upon respect being paid to
fallen majesty.  The prisoner turned
round.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
spoke?&quot; asked Saint-Mars.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
was I,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, showing himself promptly.  &quot;You know that is the order.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Call
me neither monsieur nor monseigneur,&quot; said the prisoner in his turn, in a
voice that penetrated to the very soul of Raoul; &quot;call me
ACCURSED!&quot;  He passed on, and the
iron door croaked after him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
goes a truly unfortunate man!&quot; murmured the musketeer in a hollow whisper,
pointing out to Raoul the chamber inhabited by the prince.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span

had D'Artagnan re-entered his apartment with his two friends, when one of the soldiers
of the fort came to inform him that the governor was seeking him.  The bark which Raoul had perceived at sea,
and which appeared so eager to gain the port, came to Sainte-Marguerite with an
important dispatch for the captain of the musketeers.  On opening it, D'Artagnan recognized the writing of the king:
&quot;I should think,&quot; said Louis XIV., &quot;you will have completed the
execution of my orders, Monsieur d'Artagnan; return, then, immediately to
Paris, and join me at the Louvre.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
is the end of my exile!&quot; cried the musketeer with joy; &quot;God be
praised, I am no longer a jailer!&quot; 
And he showed the letter to Athos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;So,
then, you must leave us?&quot; replied the latter, in a melancholy tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
but to meet again, dear friend, seeing that Raoul is old enough now to go alone
with M. de Beaufort, and will prefer his father going back in company with M.
d'Artagnan, to forcing him to travel two hundred leagues solitarily to reach
home at La Fère; will you not, Raoul?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Certainly,&quot;
stammered the latter, with an expression of tender regret.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
no, my friend,&quot; interrupted Athos, &quot;I will never quit Raoul till the
day his vessel disappears on the horizon. 
As long as he remains in France he shall not be separated from me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;As
you please, dear friend; but we will, at least, leave Sainte-Marguerite
together; take advantage of the bark that will convey me back to Antibes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;With
all my heart; we cannot too soon be at a distance from this fort, and from the
spectacle that shocked us so just now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
three friends quitted the little isle, after paying their respects to the
governor, and by the last flashes of the departing tempest they took their
farewell of the white walls of the fort. 
D'Artagnan parted from his friend that same night, after having seen
fire set to the carriage upon the shore by the orders of Saint-Mars, according
to the advice the captain had given him. 
Before getting on horseback, and after leaving the arms of Athos: &quot;My
friends,&quot; said he, &quot;you bear too much resemblance to two soldiers who
are abandoning their post.  Something
warns me that Raoul will require being supported by you in his rank.  Will you allow me to ask permission to go
over into Africa with a hundred good muskets? 
The king will not refuse me, and I will take you with me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
d'Artagnan,&quot; replied Raoul, pressing his hand with emotion, &quot;thanks
for that offer, which would give us more than we wish, either monsieur le comte
or I.  I, who am young, stand in need of
labor of mind and fatigue of body; monsieur le comte wants the profoundest
repose.  You are his best friend.  I recommend him to your care.  In watching over him, you are holding both
our souls in your hands.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
must go; my horse is all in a fret,&quot; said D'Artagnan, with whom the most
manifest sign of a lively emotion was the change of ideas in conversation.  &quot;Come, comte, how many days longer has
Raoul to stay here?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Three
days at most.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
how long will it take you to reach home?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
a considerable time,&quot; replied Athos.  &quot;I shall not like the idea of being separated too quickly
from Raoul.  Time will travel too fast
of itself to require me to aid it by distance. 
I shall only make half-stages.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
why so, my friend?  Nothing is more dull
than traveling slowly; and hostelry life does not become a man like you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
friend, I came hither on post-horses; but I wish to purchase two animals of a
superior kind.  Now, to take them home
fresh, it would not be prudent to make them travel more than seven or eight
leagues a day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Where
is Grimaud?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
arrived yesterday morning with Raoul's appointments; and I have left him to
sleep.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is, never to come back again,&quot; D'Artagnan suffered to escape him.  &quot;Till we meet again, then, dear Athos -
and if you are diligent, I shall embrace you the sooner.&quot;  So saying, he put his foot in the stirrup,
which Raoul held.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Farewell!&quot;
said the young man, embracing him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Farewell!&quot;
said D'Artagnan, as he got into his saddle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                His
horse made a movement which divided the cavalier from his friends.  This scene had taken place in front of the
house chosen by Athos, near the gates of Antibes, whither D'Artagnan, after his
supper, had ordered his horses to be brought. 
The road began to branch off there, white and undulating in the vapors
of the night.  The horse eagerly
respired the salt, sharp perfume of the marshes.  D'Artagnan put him to a trot; and Athos and Raoul sadly turned
towards the house.  All at once they
heard the rapid approach of a horse's steps, and first believed  it to be one of those singular repercussions
which deceive the ear at every turn in a road. 
But it was really the return of the horseman.  They uttered a cry of joyous surprise; and the captain, springing
to the ground like a young man, seized within his arms the two beloved heads of
Athos and Raoul.  He held them long
embraced thus, without speaking a word, or suffering the sigh which was
bursting his breast to escape him. 
Then, as rapidly as he had come back, he set off again, with a sharp
application of his spurs to the sides of his fiery horse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Alas!&quot;
said the comte, in a low voice, &quot;alas! alas!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;An
evil omen!&quot; on his side, said D'Artagnan to himself, making up for lost
time.  &quot;I could not smile upon
them.  An evil omen!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
next day Grimaud was on foot again.  The
service commanded by M. de Beaufort was happily accomplished.  The flotilla, sent to Toulon by the
exertions of Raoul, had set out, dragging after it in little nutshells, almost
invisible, the wives and friends of the fishermen and smugglers put in
requisition for the service of the fleet. 
The time, so short, which remained for father and son to live together,
appeared to go by with double rapidity, like some swift stream that flows
towards eternity.  Athos and Raoul
returned to Toulon, which began to be filled with the noise of carriages, with
the noise of arms, the noise of neighing horses.  The trumpeters sounded their spirited marches; the drummers
signalized their strength; the streets were overflowing with soldiers,
servants, and tradespeople.  The Duc de
Beaufort was everywhere, superintending the embarkation with the zeal and
interest of a good captain.  He
encouraged the humblest of his companions; he scolded his lieutenants, even
those of the highest rank.  Artillery,
provisions, baggage, he insisted upon seeing all himself.  He examined the equipment of every soldier;
assured himself of the health and soundness of every horse.  It was plain that, light, boastful,
egotistical, in his hotel, the gentleman became the soldier again - the high noble,
a captain - in face of the responsibility he had accepted.  And yet, it must be admitted that, whatever
was the care with which he presided over the preparations for departure, it was
easy to perceive careless precipitation, and the absence of all the precaution
that make the French solider the first soldier in the world, because, in that
world, he is the one most abandoned to his own physical and moral
resources.  All things having satisfied,
or appearing to have satisfied, the admiral, he paid his compliments to Raoul,
and gave the last orders for sailing, which was ordered the next morning at
daybreak.  He invited the comte had his
son to dine with him; but they, under a pretext of service, kept themselves apart.  Gaining their hostelry, situated under the
trees of the great Place, they took their repast in haste, and Athos led Raoul
to the rocks which dominate the city, vast gray mountains, whence the view is
infinite and embraces a liquid horizon which appears, so remote is it, on a
level with the rocks themselves.  The
night was fine, as it always is in these happy climes.  The moon, rising behind the rocks, unrolled
a silver sheet on the cerulean carpet of the sea.  In the roadsteads maneuvered silently the vessels which had just
taken their rank to facilitate the embarkation.  The sea, loaded with phosphoric light, opened beneath the hulls
of the barks that transported the baggage and munitions; every dip of the prow
plowed up this gulf of white flames; from every oar dropped liquid
diamonds.  The sailors, rejoicing in the
largesses of the admiral, were heard murmuring their slow and artless
songs.  Sometimes the grinding of the
chains was mixed with the dull noise of shot falling into the holds.  Such harmonies, such a spectacle, oppress
the heart like fear, and dilate it like hope. 
All this life speaks of death. 
Athos had seated himself with his son, upon the moss, among the brambles
of the promontory.  Around their heads
passed and repassed large bats, carried along by the fearful whirl of their
blind chase.  The feet of Raoul were
over the edge of the cliff, bathed in that void which is peopled by vertigo,
and provokes to self-annihilation.  When
the moon had risen to its fullest height, caressing with light the neighboring
peaks, when the watery mirror was illumined in its full extent, and the little
red fires had made their openings in the black masses of every ship, Athos,
collecting all his ideas and all his courage, said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;God
has made all these things that we see, Raoul; He has made us also, - poor atoms
mixed up with this monstrous universe. 
We shine like those fires and those stars; we sigh like those waves; we
suffer like those great ships, which are worn out in plowing the waves, in
obeying the wind that urges them towards an end, as the breath of God blows us
towards a port.  Everything likes to
live, Raoul; and everything seems beautiful to living things.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
said Raoul, &quot;we have before us a beautiful spectacle!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
good D'Artagnan is!&quot; interrupted Athos, suddenly, &quot;and what a rare
good fortune it is to be supported during a whole life by such a friend as he
is!  That is what you have missed,
Raoul.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
friend!&quot; cried Raoul, &quot;I have wanted a friend!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
de Guiche is an agreeable companion,&quot; resumed the comte, coldly, &quot;but
I believe, in the times in which you live, men are more engaged in their own
interests and their own pleasures than they were in ours.  You have sought a secluded life; that is a
great happiness, but you have lost your strength thereby.  We four, more weaned from those delicate
abstractions that constitute your joy, furnished much more resistance when
misfortune presented itself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have not interrupted you, monsieur, to tell you that I had a friend, and that
that friend is M. de Guiche.  <i>Certes</i>, he is good and generous, and
moreover he loves me.  But I have lived
under the guardianship of another friendship, monsieur, as precious and as
strong as that of which you speak, since it is yours.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have not been a friend for you, Raoul,&quot; said Athos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh!
monsieur, and in what respect not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Because
I have given you reason to think that life has but one face, because, sad and
severe, alas!  I have always cut off for
you, without, God knows, wishing to do so, the joyous buds that spring
incessantly from the fair tree of youth; so that at this moment I repent of not
having made of you a more expansive, dissipated, animated man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
know why you say that, monsieur.  No, it
is not you who have made me what I am; it was love, which took me at the time
when children only have inclinations; it is the constancy natural to my
character, which with other creatures is but habit.  I believed that I should always be as I was; I thought God had
cast me in a path quite clear, quite straight, bordered with fruits and flowers.  I had ever watching over me your vigilance
and strength.  I believed myself to be
vigilant and strong.  Nothing prepared
me; I fell once, and that once deprived me of courage for the whole of my
life.  It is quite true that I wrecked
myself.  Oh, no, monsieur! you are
nothing in my past but happiness - in my future but hope!  No, I have no reproach to make against life
such as you made it for me; I bless you, and I love you ardently.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
dear Raoul, your words do me good.  They
prove to me that you will act a little for me in the time to come.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
shall only act for you, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Raoul,
what I have never hitherto done with respect to you, I will henceforward
do.  I will be your friend, not your
father.  We will live in expanding
ourselves, instead of living and holding ourselves prisoners, when you come
back.  And that will be soon, will it
not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Certainly,
monsieur, for such an expedition cannot last long.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Soon,
then, Raoul, soon, instead of living moderately on my income, I will give you
the capital of my estates.  It will
suffice for launching you into the world till my death; and you will give me, I
hope, before that time, the consolation of not seeing my race extinct.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will do all you may command,&quot; said Raoul, much agitated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is not necessary, Raoul, that your duty as aide-de-camp should lead you into
too hazardous enterprises.  You have
gone through your ordeal; you are known to be a true man under fire.  Remember that war with Arabs is a war of
snares, ambuscades, and assassinations.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;So
it is said, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
is never much glory in falling in an ambuscade.  It is a death which always implies a little rashness or want of
foresight.  Often, indeed, he who falls
in one meets with but little pity.  Those
who are not pitied, Raoul, have died to little purpose.  Still further, the conqueror laughs, and we
Frenchmen ought not to allow stupid infidels to triumph over our faults.  Do you clearly understand what I am saying
to you, Raoul?  God forbid I should
encourage you to avoid encounters.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am naturally prudent, monsieur, and I have very good fortune,&quot; said Raoul,
with a  smile which chilled the heart of
his poor father; &quot;for,&quot; the young man hastened to add, &quot;in
twenty combats through which I have been, I have only received one
scratch.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
is in addition,&quot; said Athos, &quot;the climate to be dreaded: that is an
ugly end, to die of fever!  King
Saint-Louis prayed God to send him an arrow or the plague, rather than the
fever.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
monsieur! with sobriety, with reasonable exercise - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have already obtained from M. de Beaufort a promise that his dispatches shall
be sent off every fortnight to France. 
You, as his aide-de-camp, will be charged with expediting them, and will
be sure not to forget me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
monsieur,&quot; said Raoul, almost choked with emotion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Besides,
Raoul, as you are a good Christian, and I am one also, we ought to reckon upon
a more special protection of God and His guardian angels.  Promise me that if anything evil should
happen to you, on any occasion, you will think of me at once.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;First
and at once!  Oh! yes, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
will call upon me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Instantly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
dream of me sometimes, do you not, Raoul?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Every
night, monsieur.  During my early youth
I saw you in my dreams, calm and mild, with one hand stretched out over my
head, and that it was which made me sleep so soundly - <i>formerly.</i>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
love each other too dearly,&quot; said the comte, &quot;that from this moment,
in which we separate, a portion of both our souls should not travel with one
and the other of us, and should not dwell wherever we may dwell.  Whenever you may be sad, Raoul, I feel that
my heart will be dissolved in sadness; and when you smile on thinking of me, be
assured you will send me, from however remote a distance, a vital scintillation
of your joy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will not promise you to be joyous,&quot; replied the young man; &quot;but you
may be certain that I will never pass an hour without thinking of you, not one
hour, I swear, unless I shall be dead.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Athos
could contain himself no longer; he threw his arm round the neck of his son,
and held him embraced with all the power of his heart.  The moon began to be now eclipsed by
twilight; a golden band surrounded the horizon, announcing the approach of the
day.  Athos threw his cloak over the
shoulders of Raoul, and led him back to the city, where burdens and porters
were already in motion, like a vast ant-hill. 
At the extremity of the plateau which Athos and Bragelonne were
quitting, they saw a dark shadow moving uneasily backwards and forwards, as if
in indecision or ashamed to be seen.  It
was Grimaud, who in his anxiety had tracked his master, and was there awaiting
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
my good Grimaud,&quot; cried Raoul, &quot;what do you want?  You are come to tell us it is time to be
gone, have you not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Alone?&quot;
said Grimaud, addressing Athos and pointing to Raoul in a tone of reproach,
which showed to what an extent the old man was troubled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
you are right!&quot; cried the comte. 
&quot;No, Raoul shall not go alone; no, he shall not be left alone in a
strange land without some friendly hand to support him, some friendly heart to
recall to him all he loved!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I?&quot;
said Grimaud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You,
yes, you!&quot; cried Raoul, touched to the inmost heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Alas!&quot;
said Athos, &quot;you are very old, my good Grimaud.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;So
much the better,&quot; replied the latter, with an inexpressible depth of
feeling and intelligence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
the embarkation is begun,&quot; said Raoul, &quot;and you are not
prepared.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,&quot;
said Grimaud, showing the keys of his trunks, mixed with those of his young
master.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,&quot;
again objected Raoul, &quot;you cannot leave monsieur le comte thus alone;
monsieur le comte, whom you have never quitted?&quot;<br>                Grimaud turned his diamond
eyes upon Athos and Raoul, as if to measure the strength of both.  The comte uttered not a word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
le comte prefers my going,&quot; said Grimaud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
do,&quot; said Athos, by an inclination of the head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At that
moment the drums suddenly rolled, and the clarions filled the air with their
inspiring notes.  The regiments destined
for the expedition began to debouch from the city.  They advanced to the number of five, each composed of forty
companies.  Royals marched first,
distinguished by their white uniform, faced with blue.  The <i>ordonnance</i>
colors, quartered cross-wise, violet and dead leaf, with a sprinkling of golden
<i>fleurs-de-lis</i>, left the white-colored
flag, with its <i>fleur-de-lised</i> cross,
to dominate the whole.  Musketeers at
the wings, with their forked sticks and their muskets on their shoulders;
pikemen in the center, with their lances, fourteen feet in length, marched
gayly towards the transports, which carried them in detail to the ships.  The regiments of Picardy, Navarre, Normandy,
and Royal Vaisseau, followed after.  M.
de Beaufort had known well how to select his troops.  He himself was seen closing the march with his staff - it would
take a full hour before he could reach the sea.  Raoul with Athos turned his steps slowly towards the beach, in
order to take his place when the prince embarked.  Grimaud, boiling with the ardor of a young man, superintended the
embarkation of Raoul's baggage in the admiral's vessel.  Athos, with his arm passed through that of
the son he was about to lose, absorbed in melancholy meditation, was deaf to
every noise around him.  An officer came
quickly towards them to inform Raoul that M. de Beaufort was anxious to have
him by his side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Have
the kindness to tell the prince,&quot; said Raoul, &quot;that I request he will
allow me this hour to enjoy the company of my father.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
no,&quot; said Athos, &quot;an aide-de-camp ought not thus to quit his
general.  Please to tell the prince,
monsieur, that the vicomte will join him immediately.&quot;  The officer set off at a gallop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Whether
we part here or part there,&quot; added the comte, &quot;it is no less a
separation.&quot;  He carefully brushed
the dust from his son's coat, and passed his hand over his hair as they walked
along.  &quot;But, Raoul,&quot; said he,
&quot;you want money.  M. de Beaufort's
train will be splendid, and I am certain it will be agreeable to you to
purchase horses and arms, which are very dear things in Africa.  Now, as you are not actually in the service
of the king or M. de Beaufort, and are simply a volunteer, you must not reckon
upon either pay or largesse.  But I
should not like you to want for anything at Gigelli.  Here are two hundred pistoles; if you would please me, Raoul,
spend them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Raoul
pressed the hand of his father, and, at the turning of a street, they saw M. de
Beaufort, mounted on a magnificent white <i>genet</i>,
which responded by graceful curvets to the applause of the women of the
city.  The duke called Raoul, and held
out his hand to the comte.  He spoke to
him for some time, with such a kindly expression that the heart of the poor
father even felt a little comforted.  It
was, however, evident to both father and son that their walk amounted to
nothing less than a punishment.  There
was a terrible moment - that at which, on quitting the sands of the shore, the
soldiers and sailors exchanged the last kisses with their families and friends;
a supreme moment, in which, notwithstanding the clearness of the heavens, the
warmth of the sun, of the perfumes of the air, and the rich life that was
circulating in their veins, everything appeared black, everything bitter,
everything created doubts of Providence, nay, at the most, of God.  It was customary for the admiral and his
suite to embark last; the cannon waited to announce, with its formidable voice,
that the leader had placed his foot on board his vessel.  Athos, forgetful of both the admiral and the
fleet, and of his own dignity as a strong man, opened his arms to his son, and
pressed him convulsively to his heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Accompany
us on board,&quot; said the duke, very much affected; &quot;you will gain a
good half-hour.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,&quot;
said Athos, &quot;my farewell has been spoken, I do not wish to voice a second.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then,
vicomte, embark - embark quickly!&quot; added the prince, wishing to spare the
tears of these two men, whose hearts were bursting.  And paternally, tenderly, very much as Porthos might have done,
he took Raoul in his arms and placed him in the boat, the oars of which, at a
signal, immediately were dipped in the waves. 
He himself, forgetful of ceremony, jumped into his boat, and pushed it
off with a vigorous foot.  &quot;Adieu!&quot;
cried Raoul.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Athos
replied only by a sign, but he felt something burning on his hand: it was the
respectful kiss of Grimaud - the last farewell of the faithful dog.  This kiss given, Grimaud jumped from the
step of the mole upon the stem of a two-oared yawl, which had just been taken
in tow by a <i>chaland</i> served by twelve
galley-oars.  Athos seated himself on
the mole, stunned, deaf, abandoned. 
Every instant took from him one of the features, one of the shades of
the pale face of his son.  With his arms
hanging down, his eyes fixed, his mouth open, he remained confounded with Raoul
- in one same look, in one same thought, in one same stupor.  The sea, by degrees, carried away boats and
faces to that distance at which men become nothing but points, - loves, nothing
but remembrances.  Athos saw his son
ascend the ladder of the admiral's ship, he saw him lean upon the rail of the
deck, and place himself in such a manner as to be always an object in the eye
of his father.  In vain the cannon
thundered, in vain from the ship sounded the long and lordly tumult, responded
to by immense acclamations from the shore; in vain did the noise deafen the ear
of the father, the smoke obscured the cherished object of his aspirations.  Raoul appeared to him to the last moment;
and the imperceptible atom, passing from black to pale, from pale to white, from
white to nothing, disappeared for Athos - disappeared very long after, to all
the eyes of the spectators, had disappeared both gallant ships and swelling
sails.  Towards midday, when the sun
devoured space, and scarcely the tops of the masts dominated the incandescent
limit of the sea, Athos perceived a soft aerial shadow rise, and vanish as soon
as seen.  This was the smoke of a
cannon, which M. de Beaufort ordered to be fired as a last salute to the coast
of France.  The point was buried in its
turn beneath the sky, and Athos returned with slow and painful step to his
deserted hostelry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>D</span>'Artagnan
had not been able to hide his feelings from his friends so much as he would
have wished.  The stoical soldier, the
impassive man-at-arms, overcome by fear and sad presentiments, had yielded, for
a few moments, to human weakness.  When,
therefore, he had silenced his heart and calmed the agitation of his nerves,
turning towards his lackey, a silent servant, always listening, in order to
obey the more promptly:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Rabaud,&quot;
said he, &quot;mind, we must travel thirty leagues a day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;At
your pleasure, captain,&quot; replied Rabaud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
from that moment, D'Artagnan, accommodating his action to the pace of the
horse, like a true centaur, gave up his thoughts to nothing - that is to say,
to everything.  He asked himself why the
king had sent for him back; why the Iron Mask had thrown the silver plate at
the feet of Raoul.  As to the first
subject, the reply was negative; he knew right well that the king's calling him
was from necessity.  He still further
knew that Louis XIV. must experience an imperious desire for a private
conversation with one whom the possession of such a secret placed on a level
with the highest powers of the kingdom. 
But as to saying exactly what the king's wish was, D'Artagnan found
himself completely at a loss.  The
musketeer had no doubts, either, upon the reason which had urged the
unfortunate Philippe to reveal his character and birth.  Philippe, buried forever beneath a mask of
steel, exiled to a country where the men seemed little more than slaves of the
elements; Philippe, deprived even of the society of D'Artagnan, who had loaded
him with honors and delicate attentions, had nothing more to see than odious
specters in this world, and, despair beginning to devour him, he poured himself
forth in complaints, in the belief that his revelations would raise up some
avenger for him.  The manner in which
the musketeer had been near killing his two best friends, the destiny which had
so strangely brought Athos to participate in the great state secret, the
farewell of Raoul, the obscurity of the future which threatened to end in a
melancholy death; all this threw D'Artagnan incessantly back on lamentable
predictions and forebodings, which the rapidity of his pace did not dissipate,
as it used formerly to do.  D'Artagnan
passed from these considerations to the remembrance of the proscribed Porthos
and Aramis.  He saw them both,
fugitives, tracked, ruined - laborious architects of fortunes they had lost;
and as the king called for his man of execution in hours of vengeance and
malice, D'Artagnan trembled at the very idea of receiving some commission that
would make his very soul bleed. 
Sometimes, ascending hills, when the winded horse breathed hard from his
red nostrils, and heaved his flanks, the captain, left to more freedom of
thought, reflected on the prodigious genius of Aramis, a genius of acumen and
intrigue, a match to which the Fronde and the civil war had produced but twice.
 Soldier, priest, diplomatist; gallant,
avaricious, cunning; Aramis had never taken the good things of this life except
as stepping-stones to rise to giddier ends. 
Generous in spirit, if not lofty in heart, he never did ill but for the
sake of shining even yet more brilliantly. 
Towards the end of his career, at the moment of reaching the goal, like
the patrician Fuscus, he had made a false step upon a plank, and had fallen
into the sea.  But Porthos, good,
harmless Porthos!  To see Porthos
hungry, to see Mousqueton without gold lace, imprisoned, perhaps; to see
Pierrefonds, Bracieux, razed to the very stones, dishonored even to the timber,
- these were so many poignant griefs for D'Artagnan, and every time that one of
these griefs struck him, he bounded like a horse at the sting of a gadfly
beneath the vaults of foliage where he has sought shady shelter from the
burning sun.  Never was the man of
spirit subjected to <i>ennui</i>, if his
body was exposed to fatigue; never did the man of healthy body fail to find life
light, if he had something to engage his mind. 
D'Artagnan, riding fast, thinking as constantly, alighted from his horse
in Pairs, fresh and tender in his muscles as the athlete preparing for the
gymnasium.  The king did not expect him
so soon, and had just departed for the chase towards Meudon.  D'Artagnan, instead of riding after the
king, as he would formerly have done, took off his boots, had a bath, and
waited till his majesty should return dusty and tired.  He occupied the interval of five hours in
taking, as people say, the air of the house, and in arming himself against all
ill chances.  He learned that the king,
during the last fortnight, had been gloomy; that the queen-mother was ill and
much depressed; that Monsieur, the king's brother, was exhibiting a devotional
turn; that Madame had the vapors; and that M. de Guiche was gone to one of his
estates.  He learned that M. Colbert was
radiant; that M. Fouquet consulted a fresh physician every day, who still did
not cure him, and that his principal complaint was one which physicians do not
usually cure, unless they are political physicians.  The king, D'Artagnan was told, behaved in the kindest manner to
M. Fouquet, and did not allow him to be ever out of his sight; but the
surintendant, touched to the heart, like one of those fine trees a worm has
punctured, was declining daily, in spite of the royal smile, that sun of court
trees.  D'Artagnan learned that
Mademoiselle de la Vallière had become indispensable to the king; that the
king, during his sporting excursions, if he did not take her with him, wrote to
her frequently, no longer verses, but, which was much worse, prose, and that
whole pages at a time.  Thus, as the
political Pleiad of the day said, the <i>first
king in the world</i> was seen descending from his horse <i>with an ardor beyond compare</i>, and on the crown of his hat scrawling
bombastic phrases, which M. de Saint-Aignan, aide-de-camp in perpetuity,
carried to La Vallière at the risk of foundering his horses.  During this time, deer and pheasants were
left to the free enjoyment of their nature, hunted so lazily that, it was said,
the art of venery ran great risk of degenerating at the court of France.  D'Artagnan then thought of the wishes of
poor Raoul, of that desponding letter destined for a woman who passed her life
in hoping, and as D'Artagnan loved to philosophize a little occasionally, he
resolved to profit by the absence of the king to have a minute's talk with
Mademoiselle de la Vallière.  This was a
very easy affair; while the king was hunting, Louise was walking with some
other ladies in one of the galleries of the Palais Royal, exactly where the
captain of the musketeers had some guards to inspect.  D'Artagnan did not doubt that, if he could but open the
conversation on Raoul, Louise might give him grounds for writing a consolatory
letter to the poor exile; and hope, or at least consolation for Raoul, in the
state of heart in which he had left him, was the sun, was life to two men, who
were very dear to our captain.  He
directed his course, therefore, to the spot where he knew he should find
Mademoiselle de la Vallière.  D'Artagnan
found La Vallière the center of the circle. 
In her apparent solitude, the king's favorite received, like a queen,
more, perhaps, than the queen, a homage of which Madame had been so proud, when
all the king's looks were directed to her and commanded the looks of the
courtiers.  D'Artagnan, although no
squire of dames, received, nevertheless, civilities and attentions from the
ladies; he was polite, as a brave man always is, and his terrible reputation
had conciliated as much friendship among the men as admiration among the
women.  On seeing him enter, therefore,
they immediately accosted him; and, as is not unfrequently the case with fair
ladies, opened the attack by questions. 
&quot;Where <i>had</i> he been?  What <i>had</i>
become of him so long?  Why had they not
seen him as usual make his fine horse curvet in such beautiful style, to the
delight and astonishment of the curious from the king's balcony?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He
replied that he had just come from the land of oranges.  This set all the ladies laughing.  Those were times in which everybody
traveled, but in which, notwithstanding, a journey of a hundred leagues was a
problem often solved by death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;From
the land of oranges?&quot; cried Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente.  &quot;From Spain?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh!
eh!&quot; said the musketeer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;From
Malta?&quot; echoed Montalais.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Ma foi!</i> 
You are coming very near, ladies.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is
it an island?&quot; asked La Vallière.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Mademoiselle,&quot;
said D'Artagnan; &quot;I will not give you the trouble of seeking any further;
I come from the country where M. de Beaufort is, at this moment, embarking for
Algiers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Have
you seen the army?&quot; asked several warlike fair ones.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;As
plainly as I see you,&quot; replied D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;And the fleet?&quot;<br>
&quot;Yes, I saw everything.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Have we any of us any friends
there?&quot; said Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, coldly, but in a manner to
attract attention to a question that was not without its calculated aim.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Why,&quot; replied
D'Artagnan, &quot;yes; there were M. de la Guillotière, M. de Manchy, M. de
Bragelonne - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>La Vallière became pale.  &quot;M. de Bragelonne!&quot; cried the
perfidious Athenaïs.  &quot;Eh, what! -
is he gone to the wars? - he!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Montalais trod on her toe, but all
in vain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Do you know what my opinion is?&quot;
continued she, addressing D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No, mademoiselle; but I
should like very much to know it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;My opinion is, then, that all
the men who go to this war are desperate, desponding men, whom love has treated
ill; and who go to try if they cannot find jet-complexioned women more kind
than fair ones have been.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Some of the ladies laughed; La
Vallière was evidently confused; Montalais coughed loud enough to waken the
dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Mademoiselle,&quot;
interrupted D'Artagnan, &quot;you are in error when you speak of black women at
Gigelli; the women there have not jet faces; it is true they are not white -
they are yellow.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yellow!&quot; exclaimed the
bevy of fair beauties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Eh! do not disparage it.  I have never seen a finer color to match
with black eyes and a coral mouth.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;So much the better for M. de
Bragelonne,&quot; said Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, with persistent
malice.  &quot;He will make amends for
his loss.  Poor fellow!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>A profound silence followed these
words; and D'Artagnan had time to observe and reflect that women - mild doves -
treat each other more cruelly than tigers. 
But making La Vallière pale did not satisfy Athenaïs; she determined to
make her blush likewise.  Resuming the
conversation without pause, &quot;Do you know, Louise,&quot; said she,
&quot;that there is a great sin on your conscience?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What sin, mademoiselle?&quot;
stammered the unfortunate girl, looking round her for support, without finding
it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Eh! - why,&quot; continued
Athenaïs, &quot;the poor young man was affianced to you; he loved you; you cast
him off.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well, that is a right which
every honest woman has,&quot; said Montalais, in an affected tone.  &quot;When we know we cannot constitute the
happiness of a man, it is much better to cast him off.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Cast him off! or refuse him!
- that's all very well,&quot; said Athenaïs, &quot;but that is not the sin
Mademoiselle de la Vallière has to reproach herself with.  The actual sin is sending poor Bragelonne to
the wars; and to wars in which death is so very likely to be met with.&quot;  Louise pressed her hand over her icy
brow.  &quot;And if he dies,&quot;
continued her pitiless tormentor, &quot;you will have killed him.  That is the sin.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Louise, half-dead, caught at the
arm of the captain of the musketeers, whose face betrayed unusual emotion.  &quot;You wished to speak with me, Monsieur
d'Artagnan,&quot; said she, in a voice broken by anger and pain.  &quot;What had you to say to me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan made several steps along
the gallery, holding Louise on his arm; then, when they were far enough removed
from the others - &quot;What I had to say to you, mademoiselle,&quot; replied
he, &quot;Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente has just expressed; roughly and
unkindly, it is true but still in its entirety.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>She uttered a faint cry; pierced to
the heart by this new wound, she went her way, like one of those poor birds
which, struck unto death, seek the shade of the thicket in which to die.  She disappeared at one door, at the moment
the king was entering by another.  The
first glance of the king was directed towards the empty seat of his
mistress.  Not perceiving La Vallière, a
frown came over his brow; but as soon as he saw D'Artagnan, who bowed to him -
&quot;Ah! monsieur!&quot; cried he, &quot;you <i>have</i> been diligent!  I am
much pleased with you.&quot;  This was
the superlative expression of royal satisfaction.  Many men would have been ready to lay down their lives for such a
speech from the king.  The maids of
honor and the courtiers, who had formed a respectful circle round the king on
his entrance, drew back, on observing he wished to speak privately with his
captain of the musketeers.  The king led
the way out of the gallery, after having again, with his eyes, sought
everywhere for La Vallière, whose absence he could not account for.  The moment they were out of the reach of
curious ears, &quot;Well!  Monsieur
d'Artagnan,&quot; said he, &quot;the prisoner?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Is in his prison, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What did he say on the
road?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Nothing, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What did he do?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;There was a moment at which
the fisherman - who took me in his boat to Sainte-Marguerite - revolted, and
did his best to kill me.  The - the
prisoner defended me instead of attempting to fly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king became pale.  &quot;Enough!&quot; said he; and D'Artagnan
bowed.  Louis walked about his cabinet
with hasty steps.  &quot;Were you at
Antibes,&quot; said he, &quot;when Monsieur de Beaufort came there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No, sire; I was setting off
when monsieur le duc arrived.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah!&quot; which was followed
by a fresh silence.  &quot;Whom did you
see there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;A great many persons,&quot;
said D'Artagnan, coolly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king perceived he was unwilling
to speak.  &quot;I have sent for you,
monsieur le capitaine, to desire you to go and prepare my lodgings at Nantes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;At Nantes!&quot; cried
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In Bretagne.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, sire, it is in
Bretagne.  Will you majesty make so long
a journey as to Nantes?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The States are assembled
there,&quot; replied the king.  &quot;I
have two demands to make of them: I wish to be there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;When shall I set out?&quot;
said the captain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;This evening - to-morrow -
to-morrow evening; for you must stand in need of rest.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I have rested, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is well.  Then between this and to-morrow evening,
when you please.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan bowed as if to take his
leave; but, perceiving the king very much embarrassed, &quot;Will you
majesty,&quot; said he, stepping two paces forward, &quot;take the court with
you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Certainly I shall.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Then you majesty will,
doubtless, want the musketeers?&quot; 
And the eye of the king sank beneath the penetrating glance of the
captain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Take a brigade of them,&quot;
replied Louis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Is that all?  Has your majesty no other orders to give
me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No - ah - yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I am all attention,
sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;At the castle of Nantes,
which I hear is very ill arranged, you will adopt the practice of placing
musketeers at the door of each of the principal dignitaries I shall take with
me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Of the principal?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;For instance, at the door of
M. de Lyonne?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And that of M.
Letellier?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Of M. de Brienne?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And of monsieur le
surintendant?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Without doubt.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Very well, sire.  By to-morrow I shall have set out.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh, yes; but one more word,
Monsieur d'Artagnan.  At Nantes you will
meet with M. le Duc de Gesvres, captain of the guards.  Be sure that your musketeers are placed
before his guards arrive.  Precedence
always belongs to the first comer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And if M. de Gesvres should
question you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Question me, sire!  Is it likely that M. de Gesvres should
question me?&quot;  And the musketeer,
turning cavalierly on his heel, disappeared. 
&quot;To Nantes!&quot; said he to himself, as he descended from the
stairs.  &quot;Why did he not dare to
say, from thence to Belle-Isle?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>As he reached the great gates, one
of M. Brienne's clerks came running after him, exclaiming, &quot;Monsieur
d'Artagnan!  I beg your pardon - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What is the matter, Monsieur
Ariste?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The king has desired me to
give you this order.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Upon your cash-box?&quot;
asked the musketeer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No, monsieur; on that of M.
Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan was surprised, but he
took the order, which was in the king's own writing, and was for two hundred
pistoles.  &quot;What!&quot; thought he,
after having politely thanked M. Brienne's clerk, &quot;M. Fouquet is to pay
for the journey, then!  <i>Mordioux!</i> that is a bit of pure Louis
XI.  Why was not this order on the chest
of M. Colbert?  He would have paid it
with such joy.&quot;  And D'Artagnan,
faithful to his principle of never letting an order at sight get cold, went
straight to the house of M. Fouquet, to receive his two hundred pistoles. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>The Last Supper.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he
superintendent had no doubt received advice of the approaching departure, for
he was giving a farewell dinner to his friends.  From the bottom to the top of the house, the hurry of the
servants bearing dishes, and the diligence of the <i>registres</i>, denoted an approaching change in offices and
kitchen.  D'Artagnan, with his order in
his hand, presented himself at the offices, when he was told it was too late to
pay cash, the chest was closed.  He only
replied: &quot;On the king's service.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
clerk, a little put out by the serious air of the captain, replied, that
&quot;that was a very respectable reason, but that the customs of the house
were respectable likewise; and that, in consequence, he begged the bearer to
call again next day.&quot;  D'Artagnan
asked if he could not see M. Fouquet. 
The clerk replied that M. le surintendant did not interfere with such
details, and rudely closed the outer door in the captain's face.  But the latter had foreseen this stroke, and
placed his boot between the door and the door-case, so that the lock did not
catch, and the clerk was still nose to nose with his interlocutor.  This made him change his tone, and say, with
terrified politeness, &quot;If monsieur wishes to speak to M. le surintendant,
he must go to the ante-chambers; these are the offices, where monseigneur never
comes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
very well!  Where are they?&quot;
replied D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;On
the other side of the court,&quot; said the clerk, delighted to be free.  D'Artagnan crossed the court, and fell in
with a crowd of servants.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur
sees nobody at this hour,&quot; he was answered by a fellow carrying a vermeil
dish, in which were three pheasants and twelve quails.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Tell
him,&quot; said the captain, laying hold of the servant by the end of his dish,
&quot;that I am M. d'Artagnan, captain of his majesty's musketeers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
fellow uttered a cry of surprise, and disappeared; D'Artagnan following him
slowly.  He arrived just in time to meet
M. Pélisson in the ante-chamber: the latter, a little pale, came hastily out of
the dining-room to learn what was the matter. 
D'Artagnan smiled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
is nothing unpleasant, Monsieur Pélisson; only a little order to receive the
money for.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
said Fouquet's friend, breathing more freely; and he took the captain by the
hand, and, dragging him behind him, led him into the dining-room, where a
number of friends surrounded the surintendant, placed in the center, and buried
in the cushions of a <i>fauteuil</i>.  There were assembled all the Epicureans who
so lately at Vaux had done the honors of the mansion of wit and money in aid of
M. Fouquet.  Joyous friends, for the
most part faithful, they had not fled their protector at the approach of the
storm, and, in spite of the threatening heavens, in spite of the trembling
earth, they remained there, smiling, cheerful, as devoted in misfortune as they
had been in prosperity.  On the left of
the surintendant sat Madame de Bellière; on his right was Madame Fouquet; as if
braving the laws of the world, and putting all vulgar reasons of propriety to
silence, the two protecting angels of this man united to offer, at the moment
of the crisis, the support of their twined arms.  Madame de Bellière was pale, trembling, and full of respectful
attentions for madame la surintendante, who, with one hand on her husband's,
was looking anxiously towards the door by which Pélisson had gone out to bring
D'Artagnan.  The captain entered at
first full of courtesy, and afterwards of admiration, when, with his infallible
glance, he had divined as well as taken in the expression of every face.  Fouquet raised himself up in his chair.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Pardon
me, Monsieur d'Artagnan,&quot; said he, &quot;if I did not myself receive you
when coming in the king's name.&quot; 
And he pronounced the last words with a sort of melancholy firmness, which
filled the hearts of all his friends with terror.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur,&quot;
replied D'Artagnan, &quot;I only come to you in the king's name to demand
payment of an order for two hundred pistoles.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
clouds passed from every brow but that of Fouquet, which still remained
overcast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
then,&quot; said he, &quot;perhaps you also are setting out for Nantes?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
do not know whither I am setting out, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,&quot;
said Madame Fouquet, recovered from her fright, &quot;you are not going so
soon, monsieur le capitaine, as not to do us the honor to take a seat with
us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Madame,
I should esteem that a great honor done me, but I am so pressed for time, that,
you see, I have been obliged to permit myself to interrupt your repast to
procure payment of my note.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
reply to which shall be gold,&quot; said Fouquet, making a sign to his
intendant, who went out with the order D'Artagnan handed him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!&quot;
said the latter, &quot;I was not uneasy about the payment; the house is
good.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                A
painful smile passed over the pale features of Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Are
you in pain?&quot; asked Madame de Bellière.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you feel your attack coming on?&quot; asked Madame Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Neither,
thank you both,&quot; said Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
attack?&quot; said D'Artagnan, in his turn; &quot;are you unwell,
monseigneur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have a tertian fever, which seized me after the <i>fête</i> at Vaux.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Caught
cold in the grottos, at night, perhaps?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
no; nothing but agitation, that was all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
too much heart you displayed in your reception of the king,&quot; said La
Fontaine, quietly, without suspicion that he was uttering a sacrilege.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
cannot devote too much heart to the reception of our king,&quot; said Fouquet,
mildly, to his poet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
meant to say the too great ardor,&quot; interrupted D'Artagnan, with perfect
frankness and much amenity.  &quot;The
fact is, monseigneur, that hospitality was never practiced as at Vaux.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Madame
Fouquet permitted her countenance to show clearly that if Fouquet had conducted
himself well towards the king, the king had hardly done the like to the
minister.  But D'Artagnan knew the terrible
secret.  He alone with Fouquet knew it;
those two men had not, the one the courage to complain, the other the right to
accuse.  The captain, to whom the two
hundred pistoles were brought, was about to take his leave, when Fouquet,
rising, took a glass of wine, and ordered one to be given to D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
said he, &quot;to the health of the king, <i>whatever
may happen</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
to your health, monseigneur, <i>whatever may
happen</i>,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He
bowed, with these words of evil omen, to all the company, who rose as soon as
they heard the sound of his spurs and boots at the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I,
for a moment, thought it was I and not my money he wanted,&quot; said Fouquet,
endeavoring to laugh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You!&quot;
cried his friends; &quot;and what for, in the name of Heaven!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
do not deceive yourselves, my dear brothers in Epicurus,&quot; said the
superintendent; &quot;I do not wish to make a comparison between the most
humble sinner on the earth, and the God we adore, but remember, he gave one day
to his friends a repast which is called the Last Supper, and which was nothing
but a farewell dinner, like that which we are making at this moment.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                A
painful cry of denial arose from all parts of the table.  &quot;Shut the doors,&quot; said Fouquet,
and the servants disappeared.  &quot;My
friends,&quot; continued Fouquet, lowering his voice, &quot;what was I
formerly?  What am I now?  Consult among yourselves and reply.  A man like me sinks when he does not
continue to rise.  What shall we say,
then, when he really sinks?  I have no
more money, no more credit; I have no longer anything but powerful enemies, and
powerless friends.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Quick!&quot;
cried Pélisson.  &quot;Since you explain
yourself with such frankness, it is our duty to be frank, likewise.  Yes, you are ruined - yes, you are hastening
to your ruin - stop.  And, in the first
place, what money have we left?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Seven
hundred thousand livres,&quot; said the intendant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bread,&quot;
murmured Madame Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Relays,&quot;
said Pélisson, &quot;relays, and fly!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Whither?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
Switzerland - to Savoy - but fly!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
monseigneur flies,&quot; said Madame Bellière, &quot;it will be said that he
was guilty - was afraid.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;More
than that, it will be said that I have carried away twenty millions with
me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
will draw up memoirs to justify you,&quot; said La Fontaine.  &quot;Fly!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will remain,&quot; said Fouquet. 
&quot;And, besides, does not everything serve me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have Belle-Isle,&quot; cried the Abbé Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
I am naturally going there, when going to Nantes,&quot; replied the
superintendent.  &quot;Patience, then,
patience!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Before
arriving at Nantes, what a distance!&quot; said Madame Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
I know that well,&quot; replied Fouquet. 
&quot;But what is to be done there? 
The king summons me to the States. 
I know well it is for the purpose of ruining me; but to refuse to go
would be to evince uneasiness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
I have discovered the means of reconciling everything,&quot; cried
Pélisson.  &quot;You are going to set
out for Nantes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
looked at him with an air of surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
with friends; but in your own carriage as far as Orléans; in your own barge as
far as Nantes; always ready to defend yourself, if you are attacked; to escape,
if you are threatened.  In fact, you
will carry your money against all chances; and, whilst flying, you will only
have obeyed the king; then, reaching the sea, when you like, you will embark
for Belle-Isle, and from Belle-Isle you will shoot out wherever it may please
you, like the eagle that leaps into space when it has been driven from its
eyrie.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                A
general assent followed Pélisson's words. 
&quot;Yes, do so,&quot; said Madame Fouquet to her husband.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
so,&quot; said Madame de Bellière.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
it! do it!&quot; cried all his friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will do so,&quot; replied Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;This
very evening?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
an hour?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Instantly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;With
seven hundred thousand livres you can lay the foundation of another fortune,&quot;
said the Abbé Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is there to prevent our arming corsairs at Belle-Isle?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And,
if necessary, we will go and discover a new world,&quot; added La Fontaine,
intoxicated with fresh projects and enthusiasm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                A knock
at the door interrupted this concert of joy and hope.  &quot;A courier from the king,&quot; said the master of the
ceremonies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                A
profound silence immediately ensued, as if the message brought by this courier
was nothing but a reply to all the projects given birth to a moment
before.  Every one waited to see what
the master would do.  His brow was
streaming with perspiration, and he was really suffering from his fever at that
instant.  He passed into his cabinet, to
receive the king's message.  There
prevailed, as we have said, such a silence in the chambers, and throughout the
attendance, that from the dining-room could be heard the voice of Fouquet,
saying, &quot;That is well, monsieur.&quot; 
This voice was, however, broken by fatigue, and trembled with emotion.  An instant after, Fouquet called Gourville,
who crossed the gallery amidst the universal expectation.  At length, he himself re-appeared among his
guests; but it was no longer the same pale, spiritless countenance they had
beheld when he left them; from pale he had become livid; and from spiritless,
annihilated.  A breathing, living
specter, he advanced with his arms stretched out, his mouth parched, like a
shade that comes to salute the friends of former days.  On seeing him thus, every one cried out, and
every one rushed towards Fouquet.  The
latter, looking at Pélisson, leaned upon his wife, and pressed the icy hand of
the Marquise de Bellière.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,&quot;
said he, in a voice which had nothing human in it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
has happened, my God!&quot; said some one to him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
opened his right hand, which was clenched, but glistening with perspiration,
and displayed a paper, upon which Pélisson cast a terrified glance.  He read the following lines, written by the
king's hand:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'DEAR
AND WELL-BELOVED MONSIEUR FOUQUET, - Give us, upon that which you have left of
ours, the sum of seven hundred thousand livres, of which we stand in need to
prepare for our departure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'And,
as we know your health is not good, we pray God to restore you, and to have you
in His holy keeping.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>&quot;'LOUIS.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'The
present letter is to serve as a receipt.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                A
murmur of terror circulated through the apartment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,&quot;
cried Pélisson, in his turn, &quot;you have received that letter?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Received
it, yes!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
will you do, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nothing,
since I have received it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
- &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
I have received it, Pélisson, I have paid it,&quot; said the surintendant, with
a simplicity that went to the heart of all present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have paid it!&quot; cried Madame Fouquet. 
&quot;Then we are ruined!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come,
no useless words,&quot; interrupted Pélisson. 
&quot;Next to money, life. 
Monseigneur, to horse! to horse!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What,
leave us!&quot; at once cried both the women, wild with grief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh!
monseigneur, in saving yourself, you save us all.  To horse!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
he cannot hold himself on.  Look at
him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
if he takes time to reflect - &quot; said the intrepid Pélisson.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
is right,&quot; murmured Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur!  Monseigneur!&quot; cried Gourville, rushing
up the stairs, four steps at once. 
&quot;Monseigneur!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!
what?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
escorted, as you desired, the king's courier with the money.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!
when I arrived at the Palais Royal, I saw - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Take
breath, my poor friend, take breath; you are suffocating.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
did you see?&quot; cried the impatient friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
saw the musketeers mounting on horseback,&quot; said Gourville.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There,
then!&quot; cried every voice at once; &quot;there, then! is there an instant
to be lost?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Madame
Fouquet rushed downstairs, calling for her horses; Madame de Bellière flew
after her, catching her in her arms, and saying: &quot;Madame, in the name of
his safety, do not betray anything, do not manifest alarm.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Pélisson
ran to have the horses put to the carriages. 
And, in the meantime, Gourville gathered in his hat all that the weeping
friends were able to throw into it of gold and silver - the last offering, the
pious alms made to misery by poverty. 
The surintendant, dragged along by some, carried by others, was shut up
in his carriage.  Gourville took the
reins, and mounted the box.  Pélisson
supported Madame Fouquet, who had fainted. 
Madame de Bellière had more strength, and was well paid for it; she
received Fouquet's last kiss.  Pélisson
easily explained this precipitate departure by saying that an order from the
king had summoned the minister to Nantes.</p>

Gourville had seen, the king's musketeers were mounting and following their
captain.  The latter, who did not like
to be confined in his proceedings, left his brigade under the orders of a
lieutenant, and set off on post horses, recommending his men to use all
diligence.  However rapidly they might
travel, they could not arrive before him. 
He had time, in passing along the Rue des Petits-Champs, to see
something which afforded him plenty of food for thought and conjecture.  He saw M. Colbert coming out from his house
to get into his carriage, which was stationed before the door.  In this carriage D'Artagnan perceived the
hoods of two women, and being rather curious, he wished to know the names of
the ladies hid beneath these hoods.  To
get a glimpse at them, for they kept themselves closely covered up, he urged
his horse so near the carriage, that he drove him against the step with such
force as to shake everything containing and contained.  The terrified women uttered, the one a faint
cry, by which D'Artagnan recognized a young woman, the other an imprecation, in
which he recognized the vigor and <i>àplomb</i>
that half a century bestows.  The hoods
were thrown back: one of the women was Madame Vanel, the other the Duchesse de
Chevreuse.  D'Artagnan's eyes were
quicker than those of the ladies; he had seen and known them, whilst they did
not recognize him; and as they laughed at their fright, pressing each other's
hands, -</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Humph!&quot;
said D'Artagnan, &quot;the old duchesse is no more inaccessible to friendship than
formerly.  <i>She</i> paying her court to the mistress of M. Colbert!  Poor M. Fouquet! that presages you nothing
good!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He rode
on.  M. Colbert got into his carriage
and the distinguished trio commenced a sufficiently slow pilgrimage toward the
wood of Vincennes.  Madame de Chevreuse
set down Madame Vanel at her husband's house, and, left alone with M. Colbert,
chatted upon affairs whilst continuing her ride.  She had an inexhaustible fund of conversation, that dear
duchesse, and as she always talked for the ill of others, though ever with a
view to her own good, her conversation amused her interlocutor, and did not
fail to leave a favorable impression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                She
taught Colbert, who, poor man! was ignorant of the fact, how great a minister
he was, and how Fouquet would soon become a cipher.  She promised to rally around him, when he should become
surintendant, all the old nobility of the kingdom, and questioned him as to the
preponderance it would be proper to allow La Vallière.  She praised him, she blamed him, she
bewildered him.  She showed him the
secret of so many secrets that, for a moment, Colbert thought he was doing
business with the devil.  She proved to
him that she held in her hand the Colbert of to-day, as she had held the
Fouquet of yesterday; and as he asked her very simply the reason of her hatred
for the surintendant: &quot;Why do you yourself hate him?&quot; said she.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Madame,
in politics,&quot; replied he, &quot;the differences of system oft bring about
dissentions between men.  M. Fouquet
always appeared to me to practice a system opposed to the true interests of the
king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                She
interrupted him. - &quot;I will say no more to you about M. Fouquet.  The journey the king is about to take to
Nantes will give a good account of him. 
M. Fouquet, for me, is a man gone by - and for you also.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Colbert
made no reply.  &quot;On his return from
Nantes,&quot; continued the duchesse, &quot;the king, who is only anxious for a
pretext, will find that the States have not behaved well - that they have made
too few sacrifices.  The States will say
that the imposts are too heavy, and that the surintendant has ruined them.  The king will lay all the blame on M.
Fouquet, and then - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
then?&quot; said Colbert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
he will be disgraced.  Is not that your
opinion?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Colbert
darted a glance at the duchesse, which plainly said: &quot;If M. Fouquet be
only disgraced, you will not be the cause of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
place, M. Colbert,&quot; the duchesse hastened to say, &quot;must be a high
place.  Do you perceive any one between
the king and yourself, after the fall of M. Fouquet?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
do not understand,&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
<i>will</i> understand.  To what does your ambition aspire?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have none.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
was useless, then, to overthrow the superintendent, Monsieur Colbert.  It was idle.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
had the honor to tell you, madame - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
yes, I know, all about the interest of the king - but, if you please, we will
speak of your own.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Mine!
that is to say, the affairs of his majesty.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
short, are you, or are you not endeavoring to ruin M. Fouquet?  Answer without evasion.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Madame,
I ruin nobody.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am endeavoring to comprehend, then, why you purchased from me the letters of M.
Mazarin concerning M. Fouquet.  Neither
can I conceive why you have laid those letters before the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Colbert,
half stupefied, looked at the duchesse with an air of constraint.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Madame,&quot;
said he, &quot;I can less easily conceive how you, who received the money, can
reproach me on that head - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is,&quot; said the old duchesse, &quot;because we must will that which we wish
for, unless we are not able to obtain what we wish.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Will!</i>&quot; said Colbert, quite
confounded by such coarse logic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are not able, <i>hein!</i>  Speak.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am not able, I allow, to destroy certain influences near the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
fight in favor of M. Fouquet?  What are
they?  Stop, let me help you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do,
madame.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;La
Vallière?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
very little influence; no knowledge of business, and small means.  M. Fouquet has paid his court to her.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
defend him would be to accuse herself, would it not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
think it would.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
is still another influence, what do you say to that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is
it considerable?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;The queen-mother,
perhaps?&quot;<br>
&quot;Her majesty,  the queen-mother,
has a weakness for M. Fouquet very prejudicial to her son.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Never believe that,&quot;
said the old duchesse, smiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Oh!&quot; said Colbert, with incredulity,
&quot;I have often experienced it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Formerly?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Very recently, madame, at
Vaux.  It was she who prevented the king
from having M. Fouquet arrested.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;People do not forever
entertain the same opinions, my dear monsieur. 
That which the queen may have wished recently, she would not wish,
perhaps, to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And why not?&quot; said
Colbert, astonished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! the reason is of very
little consequence.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;On the contrary, I think it
is of great consequence; for, if I were certain of not displeasing her majesty,
the queen-mother, my scruples would be all removed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well! have you never heard
talk of a certain secret?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;A secret?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Call it what you like.  In short, the queen-mother has conceived a
bitter hatred for all those who have participated, in one fashion or another,
in the discovery of this secret, and M. Fouquet I believe is one of
these.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Then,&quot; said Colbert,
&quot;we may be sure of the assent of the queen-mother?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I have just left her majesty,
and she assures me so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;So be it, then, madame.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;But there is something
further; do you happen to know a man who was the intimate friend of M. Fouquet,
M. d'Herblay, a bishop, I believe?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Bishop of Vannes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well! this M. d'Herblay, who
also knew the secret, the queen-mother is pursuing with the utmost rancor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Indeed!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;So hotly pursued, that if he
were dead, she would not be satisfied with anything less than his head, to
satisfy her he would never speak again.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And is that the desire of the
queen-mother?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;An order is given for
it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;This Monsieur d'Herblay shall
be sought for, madame.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! it is well known where he
is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert looked at the duchesse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Say where, madame.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He is at
Belle-Île-en-Mer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;At the residence of M.
Fouquet?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;At the residence of M.
Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He shall be taken.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>It was now the duchesse's turn to
smile.  &quot;Do not fancy the capture
so easy,&quot; said she; &quot;do not promise it so lightly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Why not, madame?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Because M. d'Herblay is not
one of those people who can be taken when and where you please.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He is a rebel, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh!  Monsieur Colbert, we have passed all our lives in making rebels,
and yet you see plainly, that so far from being taken, we take others.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert fixed upon the old duchesse
one of those fierce looks of which no words can convey the expression,
accompanied by a firmness not altogether wanting in grandeur.  &quot;The times are gone,&quot; said he,
&quot;in which subjects gained duchies by making war against the king of
France.  If M. d'Herblay conspires, he
will perish on the scaffold.  That will
give, or will not give, pleasure to his enemies, - a matter, by the way, of
little importance to <i>us</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>And this <i>us</i>, a strange word in the mouth of Colbert, made the duchesse
thoughtful for a moment.  She caught
herself reckoning inwardly with this man - Colbert had regained his superiority
in the conversation, and he meant to keep it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You ask me, madame,&quot; he
said, &quot;to have this M. d'Herblay arrested?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I? - I ask you nothing of the
kind!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I thought you did,
madame.  But as I have been mistaken, we
will leave him alone; the king has said nothing about him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The duchesse bit her nails.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Besides,&quot; continued
Colbert, &quot;what a poor capture would this bishop be!  A bishop game for a king!  Oh! no, no; I will not even take the
slightest notice of him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The hatred of the duchesse now discovered
itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Game for a woman!&quot; said
she.  &quot;Is not the queen a
woman?  If she wishes M. d'Herblay
arrested, she has her reasons.  Besides,
is not M. d'Herblay the friend of him who is doomed to fall?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! never mind that,&quot;
said Colbert.  &quot;This man shall be
spared, if he is not the enemy of the king. 
Is that displeasing to you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I say nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes - you wish to see him in
prison, in the Bastile, for instance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I believe a secret better
concealed behind the walls of the Bastile than behind those of
Belle-Isle.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I will speak to the king
about it; he will clear up the point.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And whilst waiting for that
enlightenment, Monsieur l'Evêque de Vannes will have escaped.  I would do so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Escaped! he! and whither
should he escape?  Europe is ours, in
will, if not in fact.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He will always find an
asylum, monsieur.  It is evident you
know nothing of the man you have to do with. 
You do not know D'Herblay; you do not know Aramis.  He was one of those four musketeers who,
under the late king, made Cardinal de Richelieu tremble, and who, during the
regency, gave so much trouble to Monseigneur Mazarin.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;But, madame, what can he do,
unless he has a kingdom to back him?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He has one, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;A kingdom, he! what, Monsieur
d'Herblay?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I repeat to you, monsieur,
that if he wants a kingdom, he either has it or will have it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well, as you are so earnest
that this rebel should not escape, madame, I promise you he shall not
escape.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Belle-Isle is fortified, M.
Colbert, and fortified by him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;If Belle-Isle were also
defended by him, Belle-Isle is not impregnable; and if Monsieur l'Evêque de
Vannes is shut up in Belle-Isle, well, madame, the place shall be besieged, and
he will be taken.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You may be very certain,
monsieur, that the zeal you display in the interest of the queen-mother will
please her majesty mightily, and you will be magnificently rewarded; but what
shall I tell her of your projects respecting this man?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That when once taken, he
shall be shut up in a fortress from which her secret shall never escape.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Very well, Monsieur Colbert,
and we may say, that, dating from this instant, we have formed a solid
alliance, that is, you and I, and that I am absolutely at your service.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It is I, madame, who place
myself at yours.  This Chevalier
d'Herblay is a kind of Spanish spy, is he not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Much more.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;A secret ambassador?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Higher still.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Stop - King Phillip III. of
Spain is a bigot.  He is, perhaps, the
confessor of Phillip III.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You must go higher even than
that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;<i>Mordieu!</i>&quot; cried Colbert, who forgot himself so far as to swear
in the presence of this great lady, of this old friend of the
queen-mother.  &quot;He must then be the
general of the Jesuits.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I believe you have guessed it
at last,&quot; replied the duchesse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah! then, madame, this man
will ruin us all if we do not ruin him; and we must make haste, too.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Such was my opinion,
monsieur, but I did not dare to give it you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And it was lucky for us he
has attacked the throne, and not us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;But, mark this well, M.
Colbert.  M. d'Herblay is never discouraged;
if he has missed one blow, he will be sure to make another; he will begin
again.  If he has allowed an opportunity
to escape of making a king for himself, sooner or later, he will make another,
of whom, to a certainty, you will not be prime minister.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert knitted his brow with a
menacing expression.  &quot;I feel
assured that a prison will settle this affair for us, madame, in a manner
satisfactory for both.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The duchesse smiled again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! if you knew,&quot; said
she, &quot;how many times Aramis has got out of prison!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh!&quot; replied Colbert,
&quot;we will take care that he shall not get out <i>this</i> time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;But you were not attending to
what I said to you just now.  Do you
remember that Aramis was one of the four invincibles whom Richelieu so
dreaded?  And at that period the four
musketeers were not in possession of that which they have now - money and
experience.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert bit his lips.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;We will renounce the idea of
the prison,&quot; said he, in a lower tone: &quot;we will find a little retreat
from which the invincible cannot possibly escape.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That was well spoken, our
ally!&quot; replied the duchesse. 
&quot;But it is getting late; had we not better return?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The more willingly, madame,
from my having my preparations to make for setting out with the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;To Paris!&quot; cried the
duchesse to the coachman.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>And the carriage returned towards
the Faubourg Saint Antoine, after the conclusion of the treaty that gave to
death the last friend of Fouquet, the last defender of Belle-Isle, the former
friend of Marie Michon, the new foe of the old duchesse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>D</span>'Artagnan
had set off; Fouquet likewise was gone, and with a rapidity which doubled the
tender interest of his friends.  The
first moments of this journey, or better say, this flight, were troubled by a
ceaseless dread of every horse and carriage to be seen behind the
fugitive.  It was not natural, in fact,
if Louis XIV. was determined to seize this prey, that he should allow it to
escape; the young lion was already accustomed to the chase, and he had bloodhounds
sufficiently clever to be trusted.  But
insensibly all fears were dispersed; the surintendant, by hard traveling,
placed such a distance between himself and his persecutors, that no one of them
could reasonably be expected to overtake him. 
As to his position, his friends had made it excellent for him.  Was he not traveling to join the king at
Nantes, and what did the rapidity prove but his zeal to obey?  He arrived, fatigued, but reassured, at
Orléans, where he found, thanks to the care of a courier who had preceded him,
a handsome lighter of eight oars.  These
lighters, in the shape of gondolas, somewhat wide and heavy, containing a small
chamber, covered by the deck, and a chamber in the poop, formed by a tent, then
acted as passage-boats from Orléans to Nantes, by the Loire, and this passage,
a long one in our days, appeared then more easy and convenient than the
high-road, with its post-hacks and its ill-hung carriages.  Fouquet went on board this lighter, which
set out immediately.  The rowers, knowing
they had the honor of conveying the surintendant of the finances, pulled with
all their strength, and that magic word, the <i>finances</i>, promised them a liberal gratification, of which they
wished to prove themselves worthy.  The
lighter seemed to leap the mimic waves of the Loire.  Magnificent weather, a sunrise that empurpled all the landscape,
displayed the river in all its limpid serenity.  The current and the rowers carried Fouquet along as wings carry a
bird, and he arrived before Beaugency without the slightest accident having
signalized the voyage.  Fouquet hoped to
be the first to arrive at Nantes; there he would see the notables and gain
support among the principal members of the States; he would make himself a
necessity, a thing very easy for a man of his merit, and would delay the
catastrophe, if he did not succeed in avoiding it entirely.  &quot;Besides,&quot; said Gourville to him,
&quot;at Nantes, you will make out, or we will make out, the intentions of your
enemies; we will have horses always ready to convey you to Poitou, a bark in
which to gain the sea, and when once upon the open sea, Belle-Isle is your
inviolable port.  You see, besides, that
no one is watching you, no one is following.&quot;  He had scarcely finished when they discovered at a distance, behind
an elbow formed by the river, the masts of a huge lighter coming down.  The rowers of Fouquet's boat uttered a cry
of surprise on seeing this galley.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is the matter?&quot; asked Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
matter is, monseigneur,&quot; replied the patron of the bark, &quot;that it is
a truly remarkable thing - that lighter comes along like a hurricane.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Gourville
started, and mounted to the deck, in order to obtain a better view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
did not go up with him, but said to Gourville, with restrained mistrust:
&quot;See what it is, dear friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
lighter had just passed the elbow.  It
came on so fast, that behind it might be plainly seen the white wake illumined
with the fires of the day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
they go,&quot; repeated the skipper, &quot;how they go!  They must be well paid!  I did not think,&quot; he added, &quot;that
oars of wood could behave better than ours, but yonder oarsmen prove the
contrary.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well
they may,&quot; said one of the rowers, &quot;they are twelve, and we but
eight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Twelve
rowers!&quot; replied Gourville, &quot;twelve! impossible.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
number of eight rowers for a lighter had never been exceeded, even for the
king.  This honor had been paid to
monsieur le surintendant, more for the sake of haste than of respect.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
does it mean?&quot; said Gourville, endeavoring to distinguish beneath the
tent, which was already apparent, travelers which the most piercing eye could
not yet have succeeded in discovering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;They
must be in a hurry, for it is not the king,&quot; said the patron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
shuddered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;By
what sign do you know that it is not the king?&quot; said Gourville.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
the first place, because there is no white flag with fleurs-de-lis, which the
royal lighter always carries.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
then,&quot; said Fouquet, &quot;because it is impossible it should be the king,
Gourville, as the king was still in Paris yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Gourville
replied to the surintendant by a look which said: &quot;You were there yourself
yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And by what sign do you make
out they are in such haste?&quot; added he, for the sake of gaining time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;By this, monsieur,&quot; said
the patron; &quot;these people must have set out a long while after us, and
they have already nearly overtaken us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Bah!&quot; said Gourville,
&quot;who told you that they do not come from Beaugency or from Moit
even?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;We have seen no lighter of
that shape, except at Orléans.  It comes
from Orléans, monsieur, and makes great haste.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet and Gourville exchanged a
glance.  The captain remarked their
uneasiness, and, to mislead him, Gourville immediately said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Some friend, who has laid a
wager he would catch us; let us win the wager, and not allow him to come up
with us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The patron opened his mouth to say
that it was quite impossible, but Fouquet said with much <i>hauteur</i>, - &quot;If it is any one who wishes to overtake us, let
him come.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;We can try,
monseigneur,&quot; said the man, timidly. 
&quot;Come, you fellows, put out your strength; row, row!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No,&quot; said Fouquet,
&quot;on the contrary; stop short.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monseigneur! what
folly!&quot; interrupted Gourville, stooping towards his ear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Pull up!&quot; repeated
Fouquet.  The eight oars stopped, and
resisting the water, created a retrograde motion.  It stopped.  The twelve
rowers in the other did not, at first, perceive this maneuver, for they
continued to urge on their boat so vigorously that it arrived quickly within
musket-shot.  Fouquet was short-sighted,
Gourville was annoyed by the sun, now full in his eyes; the skipper alone, with
that habit and clearness which are acquired by a constant struggle with the
elements, perceived distinctly the travelers in the neighboring lighter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I can see them!&quot; cried
he; &quot;there are two.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I can see nothing,&quot; said
Gourville.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You will not be long before
you distinguish them; in twenty strokes of their oars they will be within ten
paces of us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>But what the patron announced was
not realized; the lighter imitated the movement commanded by Fouquet, and
instead of coming to join its pretended friends, it stopped short in the middle
of the river.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I cannot comprehend
this,&quot; said the captain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Nor I,&quot; cried Gourville.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You who can see so plainly
the people in that lighter,&quot; resumed Fouquet, &quot;try to describe them
to us, before we are too far off.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I thought I saw two,&quot;
replied the boatman.  &quot;I can only
see one now, under the tent.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What sort of man is he?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He is a dark man,
broad-shouldered, bull-necked.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>A little cloud at that moment
passed across the azure, darkening the sun. 
Gourville, who was still looking, with one hand over his eyes, became
able to see what he sought, and all at once, jumping from the deck into the
chamber where Fouquet awaited him: &quot;Colbert!&quot; said he, in a voice
broken by emotion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Colbert!&quot; repeated
Fouquet.  &quot;Too strange! but no, it
is impossible!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I tell you I recognized him,
and he, at the same time, so plainly recognized me, that he is just gone into
the chamber on the poop.  Perhaps the
king has sent him on our track.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In that case he would join
us, instead of lying by.  What is he
doing there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He is watching us, without a
doubt.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I do not like
uncertainty,&quot; said Fouquet; &quot;let us go straight up to him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! monseigneur, do not do
that, the lighter is full of armed men.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He wishes to arrest me, then,
Gourville?  Why does he not come
on?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monseigneur, it is not
consistent with your dignity to go to meet even your ruin.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;But to allow them to watch me
like a malefactor!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Nothing yet proves that they
are watching you, monseigneur; be patient!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What is to be done,
then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Do not stop; you were only
going so fast to appear to obey the king's order with zeal.  Redouble the speed.  He who lives will see!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is better.  Come!&quot; cried Fouquet; &quot;since they
remain stock-still yonder, let us go on.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The captain gave the signal, and
Fouquet's rowers resumed their task with all the success that could be looked
for from men who had rested.  Scarcely
had the lighter made a hundred fathoms, than the other, that with the twelve
rowers, resumed its rapid course.  This
position lasted all day, without any increase or diminution of distance between
the two vessels.  Towards evening
Fouquet wished to try the intentions of his persecutor.  He ordered his rowers to pull towards the
shore, as if to effect a landing. 
Colbert's lighter imitated this maneuver, and steered towards the shore
in a slanting direction.  By the merest
chance, at the spot where Fouquet pretended to wish to land, a stableman, from
the château of Langeais, was following the flowery banks leading three horses
in halters.  Without doubt the people of
the twelve-oared lighter fancied that Fouquet was directing his course to these
horses ready for flight, for four or five men, armed with muskets, jumped from
the lighter on to the shore, and marched along the banks, as if to gain ground
on the horseman.  Fouquet, satisfied of
having forced the enemy to a demonstration, considered his intention evident,
and put his boat in motion again. 
Colbert's people returned likewise to theirs, and the course of the two
vessels was resumed with fresh perseverance. 
Upon seeing this, Fouquet felt himself threatened closely, and in a
prophetic voice - &quot;Well, Gourville,&quot; said he, whisperingly,
&quot;what did I say at our last repast, at my house?  Am I going, or not, to my ruin?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! monseigneur!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;These two boats, which follow
each other with so much emulation, as if we were disputing, M. Colbert and I, a
prize for swiftness on the Loire, do they not aptly represent our fortunes; and
do you not believe, Gourville, that one of the two will be wrecked at
Nantes?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;At least,&quot; objected
Gourville, &quot;there is still uncertainty; you are about to appear at the
States; you are about to show what sort of man you are; your eloquence and
genius for business are the buckler and sword that will serve to defend you, if
not to conquer with.  The Bretons do not
know you; and when they become acquainted with you your cause is won!  Oh! let M. Colbert look to it well, for his
lighter is as much exposed as yours to being upset.  Both go quickly, his faster than yours, it is true; we shall see
which will be wrecked first.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet, taking Gourville's hand -
&quot;My friend,&quot; said he, &quot;everything considered, remember the
proverb, 'First come, first served!' 
Well!  M. Colbert takes care not
to pass me.  He is a prudent man is M.
Colbert.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>He was right; the two lighters held
their course as far as Nantes, watching each other.  When the surintendant landed, Gourville hoped he should be able
to seek refuge at once, and have the relays prepared.  But, at the landing, the second lighter joined the first, and
Colbert, approaching Fouquet, saluted him on the quay with marks of the
profoundest respect - marks so significant, so public, that their result was
the bringing of the whole population upon La Fosse.  Fouquet was completely self-possessed; he felt that in his last
moments of greatness he had obligations towards himself.  He wished to fall from such a height that
his fall should crush some of his enemies. 
Colbert was there - so much the worse for Colbert.  The surintendant, therefore, coming up to
him, replied, with that arrogant semi-closure of the eyes peculiar to him -
&quot;What! is that you, M. Colbert?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;To offer you my respects,
monseigneur,&quot; said the latter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Were you in that
lighter?&quot; - pointing to the one with twelve rowers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Of twelve rowers?&quot; said
Fouquet; &quot;what luxury, M. Colbert. 
For a moment I thought it was the queen-mother.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monseigneur!&quot; - and
Colbert blushed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;This is a voyage that will cost
those who have to pay for it dear, Monsieur l'Intendant!&quot; said
Fouquet.  &quot;But you have, happily,
arrived! - You see, however,&quot; added he, a moment after, &quot;that I, who
had but eight rowers, arrived before you.&quot;  And he turned his back towards him, leaving him uncertain whether
the maneuvers of the second lighter had escaped the notice of the first.  At least he did not give him the
satisfaction of showing that he had been frightened.  Colbert, so annoyingly attacked, did not give way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I have not been quick,
monseigneur,&quot; he replied, &quot;because I followed your example whenever
you stopped.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And why did you do that,
Monsieur Colbert?&quot; cried Fouquet, irritated by the base audacity; &quot;as
you had a superior crew to mine, why did you not either join me or pass me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Out of respect,&quot; said
the intendant, bowing to the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet got into a carriage which
the city had sent to him, we know not why or how, and he repaired to <i>la Maison de Nantes</i>, escorted by a vast
crowd of people, who for several days had been agog with expectation of a
convocation of the States.  Scarcely was
he installed when Gourville went out to order horses on the route to Poitiers
and Vannes, and a boat at Paimbf.  He
performed these various operations with so much mystery, activity, and
generosity, that never was Fouquet, then laboring under an attack of fever,
more nearly saved, except for the counteraction of that immense disturber of
human projects, - chance.  A report was
spread during the night, that the king was coming in great haste on post
horses, and would arrive in ten or twelve hours at the latest.  The people, while waiting for the king, were
greatly rejoiced to see the musketeers, newly arrived, with Monsieur
d'Artagnan, their captain, and quartered in the castle, of which they occupied
all the posts, in quality of guard of honor. 
M. d'Artagnan, who was very polite, presented himself, about ten
o'clock, at the lodgings of the surintendant to pay his respectful compliments;
and although the minister suffered from fever, although he was in such pain as
to be bathed in sweat, he would receive M. d'Artagnan, who was delighted with
that honor, as will be seen by the conversation they had together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Bon jour!</i> monseigneur,&quot; replied the

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I?  Oh, monseigneur!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No doubt you do.  Is it at Nantes as at Paris?  Do you not come in the king's name?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;For Heaven's sake,
monseigneur,&quot; replied the captain, &quot;leave the king alone!  The day on which I shall come on the part of
the king, for the purpose you mean, take my word for it, I will not leave you

hand on my sword, according to the <i>ordonnance</i>,

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You promise me that
frankness?&quot; said the superintendent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Upon my honor!  But we have not come to that, believe
me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What makes you think that, M.

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I have heard speak of nothing
of the kind,&quot; replied D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Eh! eh!&quot; said Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Indeed, no.  You are an agreeable man, in spite of your
fever.  The king should not, cannot help
loving you, at the bottom of his heart.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet's expression implied
doubt.  &quot;But M. Colbert?&quot; said
he; &quot;does M. Colbert love me as much as you say?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I am not speaking of M.
Colbert,&quot; replied D'Artagnan. 
&quot;He is an exceptional man. 
He does not love you; so much is very possible; but, <i>mordioux!</i> the squirrel can guard himself
against the adder with very little trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Do you know that you are
speaking to me quite as a friend?&quot; replied Fouquet; &quot;and that, upon
my life!  I have never met with a man of
your intelligence, and heart?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You are pleased to say
so,&quot; replied D'Artagnan.  &quot;Why
did you wait till to-day to pay me such a compliment?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Blind that we are!&quot;
murmured Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Your voice is getting
hoarse,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;drink, monseigneur, drink!&quot;  And he offered him a cup of <i>tisane</i>, with the most friendly
cordiality; Fouquet took it, and thanked him by a gentle smile.  &quot;Such things only happen to me,&quot;
said the musketeer.  &quot;I have passed
ten years under your very beard, while you were rolling about tons of
gold.  You were clearing an annual
pension of four millions; you never observed me; and you find out there is such
a person in the world, just at the moment you - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Just at the moment I am about
to fall,&quot; interrupted Fouquet. 
&quot;That is true, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I did not say so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;But you thought so; and that
is the same thing.  Well! if I fall,
take my word as truth, I shall not pass a single day without saying to myself,
as I strike my brow, 'Fool! fool! - stupid mortal!  You had a Monsieur d'Artagnan under your eye and hand, and you
did not employ him, you did not enrich him!'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You overwhelm me,&quot; said
the captain.  &quot;I esteem you
greatly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;There exists another man,
then, who does not think as M. Colbert thinks,&quot; said the surintendant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;How this M. Colbert looms up
in your imagination!  He is worse than
fever!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh!  I have good cause,&quot; said Fouquet.  &quot;Judge for yourself.&quot; 
And he related the details of the course of the lighters, and the
hypocritical persecution of Colbert. 
&quot;Is not this a clear sign of my ruin?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan became very
serious.  &quot;That is true,&quot; he
said.  &quot;Yes; it has an unsavory
odor, as M. de Tréville used to say.&quot; 
And he fixed on M. Fouquet his intelligent and significant look.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Am I not clearly designated
in that, captain?  Is not the king
bringing me to Nantes to get me away from Paris, where I have so many
creatures, and to possess himself of Belle-Isle?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Where M. d'Herblay is,&quot;
added D'Artagnan.  Fouquet raised his
head.  &quot;As for me,
monseigneur,&quot; continued D'Artagnan, &quot;I can assure you the king has said
nothing to me against you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Indeed!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The king commanded me to set
out for Nantes, it is true; and to say nothing about it to M. de Gesvres.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;My friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;To M. de Gesvres, yes,
monseigneur,&quot; continued the musketeer, whose eyes did not cease to speak a
language different from the language of his lips.  &quot;The king, moreover, commanded me to take a brigade of
musketeers, which is apparently superfluous, as the country is quite
quiet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;A brigade!&quot; said
Fouquet, raising himself upon his elbow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ninety-six horsemen, yes,
monseigneur.  The same number as were
employed in arresting MM. de Chalais, de Cinq-Mars, and Montmorency.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet pricked up his ears at
these words, pronounced without apparent value.  &quot;And what else?&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! nothing but insignificant
orders; such as guarding the castle, guarding every lodging, allowing none of
M. de Gesvres's guards to occupy a single post.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And as to myself,&quot; cried
Fouquet, &quot;what orders had you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;As to you, monseigneur? - not
the smallest word.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur d'Artagnan, my
safety, my honor, perhaps my life are at stake.  You would not deceive me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I? - to what end?  Are you threatened?  Only there really is an order with respect
to carriages and boats - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;An order?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes; but it cannot concern
you - a simple measure of police.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What is it, captain? - what
is it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;To forbid all horses or boats
to leave Nantes, without a pass, signed by the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Great God! but - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan began to laugh.  &quot;All that is not to be put into
execution before the arrival of the king at Nantes.  So that you see plainly, monseigneur, the order in nowise concerns
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet became thoughtful, and
D'Artagnan feigned not to observe his preoccupation.  &quot;It is evident, by my thus confiding to you the orders which
have been given to me, that I am friendly towards you, and that I am trying to
prove to you that none of them are directed against you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Without doubt! - without
doubt!&quot; said Fouquet, still absent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Let us recapitulate,&quot;
said the captain, his glance beaming with earnestness.  &quot;A special guard about the castle, in
which your lodging is to be, is it not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Do you know the castle?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah! monseigneur, a regular
prison!  The absence of M. de Gesvres,
who has the honor of being one of your friends.  The closing of the gates of the city, and of the river without a
pass; but, only when the king shall have arrived.  Please to observe, Monsieur Fouquet, that if, instead of speaking
to man like you, who are one of the first in the kingdom, I were speaking to a
troubled, uneasy conscience - I should compromise myself forever.  What a fine opportunity for any one who
wished to be free!  No police, no
guards, no orders; the water free, the roads free, Monsieur d'Artagnan obliged
to lend his horses, if required.  All
this ought to reassure you, Monsieur Fouquet, for the king would not have left
me thus independent, if he had any sinister designs.  In truth, Monsieur Fouquet, ask me whatever you like, I am at
your service; and, in return, if you will consent to do it, do me a service,
that of giving my compliments to Aramis and Porthos, in case you embark for
Belle-Isle, as you have a right to do without changing your dress, immediately,
in your <i>robe de chambre</i> - just as you
are.&quot;  Saying these words, and with
a profound bow, the musketeer, whose looks had lost none of their intelligent
kindness, left the apartment.  He had
not reached the steps of the vestibule, when Fouquet, quite beside himself,
hung to the bell-rope, and shouted, &quot;My horses! - my lighter!&quot;  But nobody answered.  The surintendant dressed himself with
everything that came to hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Gourville! - Gourville!&quot;
cried he, while slipping his watch into his pocket.  And the bell sounded again, whilst Fouquet repeated,
&quot;Gourville! - Gourville!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Gourville at length appeared,
breathless and pale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Let us be gone!  Let us be gone!&quot; cried Fouquet, as soon
as he saw him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It is too late!&quot; said
the surintendant's poor friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Too late! - why?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Listen!&quot;  And they heard the sounds of trumpets and
drums in front of the castle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What does that mean,
Gourville?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It means the king is come,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The king!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The king, who has ridden
double stages, who has killed horses, and who is eight hours in advance of all
our calculations.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;We are lost!&quot; murmured
Fouquet.  &quot;Brave D'Artagnan, all is
over, thou has spoken to me too late!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king, in fact, was entering the
city, which soon resounded with the cannon from the ramparts, and from a vessel
which replied from the lower parts of the river.  Fouquet's brow darkened; he called his <i>valets de chambre</i> and dressed in ceremonial costume.  From his window, behind the curtains, he
could see the eagerness of the people, and the movement of a large troop, which
had followed the prince.  The king was
conducted to the castle with great pomp, and Fouquet saw him dismount under the
portcullis, and say something in the ear of D'Artagnan, who held his
stirrup.  D'Artagnan, when the king had
passed under the arch, directed his steps towards the house Fouquet was in; but
so slowly, and stopping so frequently to speak to his musketeers, drawn up like
a hedge, that it might be said he was counting the seconds, or the steps,
before accomplishing his object. 
Fouquet opened the window to speak to him in the court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah!&quot; cried D'Artagnan,
on perceiving him, &quot;are you still there, monseigneur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>And that word <i>still</i> completed the proof to Fouquet of how much information and
how many useful counsels were contained in the first visit the musketeer had
paid him.  The surintendant sighed
deeply.  &quot;Good heavens! yes,
monsieur,&quot; replied he.  &quot;The
arrival of the king has interrupted me in the projects I had formed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh, then you know that the
king has arrived?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, monsieur, I have seen
him; and this time you come from him - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;To inquire after you,
monseigneur; and, if your health is not too bad, to beg you to have the
kindness to repair to the castle.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Directly, Monsieur
d'Artagnan, directly!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah, <i>mordioux!</i>&quot; said the captain, &quot;now the king is come, there
is no more walking for anybody - no more free will; the password governs all
now, you as much as me, me as much as you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet heaved a last sigh, climbed
with difficulty into his carriage, so great was his weakness, and went to the
castle, escorted by D'Artagnan, whose politeness was not less terrifying this
time than it had just before been consoling and cheerful.</p>

Fouquet was alighting from his carriage, to enter the castle of Nantes, a man
of mean appearance went up to him with marks of the greatest respect, and gave
him a letter.  D'Artagnan endeavored to
prevent this man from speaking to Fouquet, and pushed him away, but the message
had been given to the surintendant. 
Fouquet opened the letter and read it, and instantly a vague terror,
which D'Artagnan did not fail to penetrate, was painted on the countenance of
the first minister.  Fouquet put the
paper into the portfolio which he had under his arm, and passed on towards the
king's apartments.  D'Artagnan, through
the small windows made at every landing of the donjon stairs, saw, as he went
up behind Fouquet, the man who had delivered the note, looking round him on the
place and making signs to several persons, who disappeared in the adjacent
streets, after having themselves repeated the signals.  Fouquet was made to wait for a moment on the
terrace of which we have spoken, - a terrace which abutted on the little
corridor, at the end of which the cabinet of the king was located.  Here D'Artagnan passed on before the
surintendant, whom, till that time, he had respectfully accompanied, and
entered the royal cabinet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well?&quot;
asked Louis XIV., who, on perceiving him, threw on to the table covered with
papers a large green cloth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
order is executed, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
Fouquet?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
le surintendant follows me,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
ten minutes let him be introduced,&quot; said the king, dismissing D'Artagnan
again with a gesture.  The latter
retired; but had scarcely reached the corridor at the extremity of which
Fouquet was waiting for him, when he was recalled by the king's bell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Did
he not appear astonished?&quot; asked the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who,
sire?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Fouquet</i>,&quot; replied the king, without
saying monsieur, a peculiarity which confirmed the captain of the musketeers in
his suspicions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
sire,&quot; replied he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That's
well!&quot;  And a second time Louis
dismissed D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
had not quitted the terrace where he had been left by his guide.  He reperused his note, conceived thus:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Something
is being contrived against you.  Perhaps
they will not dare to carry it out at the castle; it will be on your return
home.  The house is already surrounded
by musketeers.  Do not enter.  A white horse is in waiting for you behind
the esplanade!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
recognized the writing and zeal of Gourville. 
Not being willing that, if any evil happened to himself, this paper
should compromise a faithful friend, the surintendant was busy tearing it into
a thousand morsels, spread about by the wind from the balustrade of the
terrace.  D'Artagnan found him watching
the snowflake fluttering of the last scraps in space.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
said he, &quot;the king awaits you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
walked with a deliberate step along the little corridor, where MM. de Brienne
and Rose were at work, whilst the Duc de Saint-Aignan, seated on a chair,
likewise in the corridor, appeared to be waiting for orders, with feverish
impatience, his sword between his legs. 
It appeared strange to Fouquet that MM. Brienne, Rose, and de
Saint-Aignan, in general so attentive and obsequious, should scarcely take the
least notice, as he, the surintendant, passed. 
But how could he expect to find it otherwise among courtiers, he whom
the king no longer called anything but <i>Fouquet?</i>  He raised his head, determined to look every
one and everything bravely in the face, and entered the king's apartment, where
a little bell, which we already know, had already announced him to his majesty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
king, without rising, nodded to him, and with interest: &quot;Well! how are
you, Monsieur Fouquet?&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am in a high fever,&quot; replied the surintendant; &quot;but I am at the
king's service.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is well; the States
assemble to-morrow; have you a speech ready?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet looked at the king with
astonishment.  &quot;I have not,
sire,&quot; replied he; &quot;but I will improvise one.  I am too well acquainted with affairs to
feel any embarrassment.  I have only one
question to ask; will your majesty permit me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Certainly.  Ask it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Why did not your majesty do
his first minister the honor of giving him notice of this in Paris?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You were ill; I was not
willing to fatigue you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Never did a labor - never did
an explanation fatigue me, sire; and since the moment is come for me to demand
an explanation of my king - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh, Monsieur Fouquet! an
explanation?  An explanation, pray, of
what?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Of your majesty's intentions
with respect to myself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king blushed.  &quot;I have been calumniated,&quot;
continued Fouquet, warmly, &quot;and I feel called upon to adjure the justice
of the king to make inquiries.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You say all this to me very
uselessly, Monsieur Fouquet; I know what I know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Your majesty can only know
the things that have been told to you; and I, on my part, have said nothing to
you, whilst others have spoken many, many times - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What do you wish to
say?&quot; said the king, impatient to put an end to this embarrassing
conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I will go straight to the
facts, sire; and I accuse a certain man of having injured me in your majesty's
opinion.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Nobody has injured you,
Monsieur Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That reply proves to me,
sire, that I am right.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur Fouquet, I do not
like people to be accused.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Not when one is
accused?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;We have already spoken too
much about this affair.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Your majesty will not allow
me to justify myself?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I repeat that I do not accuse
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet, with a half-bow, made a
step backward.  &quot;It is
certain,&quot; thought he, &quot;that he has made up his mind.  He alone who cannot go back can show such
obstinacy.  Not to see the danger now
would be to be blind indeed; not to shun it would be stupid.&quot;  He resumed aloud, &quot;Did your majesty
send for me on business?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No, Monsieur Fouquet, but for
some advice I wish to give you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I respectfully await it,
sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Rest yourself, Monsieur
Fouquet, do not throw away your strength; the session of the States will be
short, and when my secretaries shall have closed it, I do not wish business to
be talked of in France for a fortnight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Has the king nothing to say
to me on the subject of this assembly of the States?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No, Monsieur Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Not to me, the surintendant
of the finances?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Rest yourself, I beg you;
that is all I have to say to you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Fouquet bit his lips and hung his
head.  He was evidently busy with some
uneasy thought.  This uneasiness struck
the king.  &quot;Are you angry at having
to rest yourself, M. Fouquet?&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, sire, I am not
accustomed to take rest.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;But you are ill; you must
take care of yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Your majesty spoke just now
of a speech to be pronounced to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>His majesty made no reply; this
unexpected stroke embarrassed him. 
Fouquet felt the weight of this hesitation.  He thought he could read danger in the eyes of the young prince,
which fear would but precipitate. 
&quot;If I appear frightened, I am lost,&quot; thought he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king, on his part, was only
uneasy at the alarm of Fouquet. 
&quot;Has he a suspicion of anything?&quot; murmured he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;If his first word is
severe,&quot; again thought Fouquet; &quot;if he becomes angry, or feigns to be
angry for the sake of a pretext, how shall I extricate myself?  Let us smooth the declivity a little.  Gourville was right.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Sire,&quot; said he,
suddenly, &quot;since the goodness of the king watches over my health to the
point of dispensing with my labor, may I not be allowed to be absent from the
council of to-morrow?  I could pass the
day in bed, and will entreat the king to grant me his physician, that we may
endeavor to find a remedy against this fearful fever.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;So be it, Monsieur Fouquet,
it shall be as you desire; you shall have a holiday to-morrow, you shall have
the physician, and shall be restored to health.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Thanks!&quot; said Fouquet,
bowing.  Then, opening his game: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Shall I not have the
happiness of conducting your majesty to my residence of Belle-Isle?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>And he looked Louis full in the
face, to judge of the effect of such a proposal.  The king blushed again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Do you know,&quot; replied
he, endeavoring to smile, &quot;that you have just said, 'My residence of
Belle-Isle'?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well! do you not
remember,&quot; continued the king in the same cheerful tone, &quot;that you
gave me Belle-Isle?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is true again,
sire.  Only, as you have not taken it,
you will doubtless come with me and take possession of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I mean to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That was, besides, your
majesty's intention as well as mine; and I cannot express to your majesty how
happy and proud I have been to see all the king's regiments from Paris to help
take possession.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king stammered out that he did
not bring the musketeers for that alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh, I am convinced of
that,&quot; said Fouquet, warmly; &quot;your majesty knows very well that you
have nothing to do but to come alone with a cane in your hand, to bring to the
ground all the fortifications of Belle-Isle.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;<i>Peste!</i>&quot; cried the king; &quot;I do not wish those fine
fortifications, which cost so much to build, to fall at all.  No, let them stand against the Dutch and
English.  You would not guess what I
want to see at Belle-Isle, Monsieur Fouquet; it is the pretty peasants and
women of the lands on the sea-shore, who dance so well, and are so seducing
with their scarlet petticoats!  I have
heard great boast of your pretty tenants, monsieur le surintendant; well, let
me have a sight of them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Whenever your majesty
pleases.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Have you any means of
transport?  It shall be to-morrow, if
you like.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The surintendant felt this stroke,
which was not adroit, and replied, &quot;No, sire; I was ignorant of your
majesty's wish; above all, I was ignorant of your haste to see Belle-Isle, and
I am prepared with nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You have a boat of your own,
nevertheless?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I have five; but they are all
in port, or at Paimbuf; and to join them, or bring them hither, would require
at least twenty-four hours.  Have I any
occasion to send a courier?  Must I do
so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Wait a little, put an end to
the fever, - wait till to-morrow.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is true.  Who knows but that by to-morrow we may not
have a hundred other ideas?&quot; replied Fouquet, now perfectly convinced and
very pale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king started, and stretched his
hand out towards his little bell, but Fouquet prevented his ringing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Sire,&quot; said he, &quot;I
have an ague - I am trembling with cold. 
If I remain a moment longer, I shall most likely faint.  I request your majesty's permission to go and
fling myself beneath the bedclothes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Indeed, you are in a shiver;
it is painful to behold!  Come, Monsieur
Fouquet, begone!  I will send to inquire
after you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Your majesty overwhelms me
with kindness.  In an hour I shall be
better.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I will call some one to
reconduct you,&quot; said the king. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;As you please, sire; I would
gladly take the arm of any one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur d'Artagnan!&quot;
cried the king, ringing his little bell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh, sire,&quot; interrupted
Fouquet, laughing in such a manner as made the prince feel cold, &quot;would
you give me the captain of your musketeers to take me to my lodgings?  An equivocal honor that, sire!  A simple footman, I beg.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And why, M. Fouquet?  M. d'Artagnan conducts me often, and
extremely well!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, but when he conducts
you, sire, it is to obey you; whilst me - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Go on!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;If I am obliged to return
home supported by the leader of the musketeers, it would be everywhere said you
had had me arrested.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Arrested!&quot; replied the
king, who became paler than Fouquet himself, - &quot;arrested! oh!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And why should they not say
so?&quot; continued Fouquet, still laughing; &quot;and I would lay a wager
there would be people found wicked enough to laugh at it.&quot;  This sally disconcerted the monarch.  Fouquet was skillful enough, or fortunate
enough, to make Louis XIV. recoil before the appearance of the deed he
meditated.  M. d'Artagnan, when he
appeared, received an order to desire a musketeer to accompany the
surintendant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Quite unnecessary,&quot; said
the latter; &quot;sword for sword; I prefer Gourville, who is waiting for me
below.  But that will not prevent me
enjoying the society of M. d'Artagnan. 
I am glad he will see Belle-Isle, he is so good a judge of
fortifications.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan bowed, without at all
comprehending what was going on. 
Fouquet bowed again and left the apartment, affecting all the slowness
of a man who walks with difficulty. 
When once out of the castle, &quot;I am saved!&quot; said he.  &quot;Oh! yes, disloyal king, you shall see
Belle-Isle, but it shall be when I am no longer there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>He disappeared, leaving D'Artagnan
with the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Captain,&quot; said the king,
&quot;you will follow M. Fouquet at the distance of a hundred paces.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He is going to his lodgings
again.  You will go with him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You will arrest him in my
name, and will shut him up in a carriage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In a carriage.  Well, sire?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In such a fashion that he may
not, on the road, either converse with any one or throw notes to people he may
meet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That will be rather
difficult, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Not at all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Pardon me, sire, I cannot
stifle M. Fouquet, and if he asks for liberty to breathe, I cannot prevent him
by closing both the windows and the blinds. 
He will throw out at the doors all the cries and notes possible.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The case is provided for,
Monsieur d'Artagnan; a carriage with a trellis will obviate both the
difficulties you point out.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;A carriage with an iron
trellis!&quot; cried D'Artagnan; &quot;but a carriage with an iron trellis is
not made in half an hour, and your majesty commands me to go immediately to M.
Fouquet's lodgings.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The carriage in question is
already made.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah! that is quite a different
thing,&quot; said the captain; &quot;if the carriage is ready made, very well,
then, we have only to set it in motion.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It is ready - and the horses
harnessed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And the coachman, with the
outriders, is waiting in the lower court of the castle.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan bowed.  &quot;There only remains for me to ask your
majesty whither I shall conduct M. Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;To the castle of Angers, at
first.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Very well, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Afterwards we will see.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur d'Artagnan, one last
word: you have remarked that, for making this capture of M. Fouquet, I have not
employed my guards, on which account M. de Gesvres will be furious.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Your majesty does not employ
your guards,&quot; said the captain, a little humiliated, &quot;because you
mistrust M. de Gesvres, that is all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is to say, monsieur,
that I have more confidence in you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I know that very well, sire!
and it is of no use to make so much of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It is only for the sake of
arriving at this, monsieur, that if, from this moment, it should happen that by
any chance whatever M. Fouquet should escape - such chances have been, monsieur
- &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! very often, sire; but for
others, not for me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And why not with you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Because I, sire, have, for an
instant, wished to save M. Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king started.  &quot;Because,&quot; continued the captain,
&quot;I had then a right to do so, having guessed your majesty's plan, without
you having spoken to me of it, and that I took an interest in M. Fouquet.  Now, was I not at liberty to show my
interest in this man?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In truth, monsieur, you do
not reassure me with regard to your services.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;If I had saved him then, I
should have been perfectly innocent; I will say more, I should have done well,
for M. Fouquet is not a bad man.  But he
was not willing; his destiny prevailed; he let the hour of liberty slip
by.  So much the worse!  Now I have orders, I will obey those orders,
and M. Fouquet you may consider as a man arrested.  He is at the castle of Angers, this very M. Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! you have not got him yet,
captain.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That concerns me; every one
to his trade, sire; only, once more, reflect! 
Do you seriously give me orders to arrest M. Fouquet, sire?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, a thousand times,
yes!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In writing, sire, then.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Here is the order.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan read it, bowed to the
king, and left the room.  From the
height of the terrace he perceived Gourville, who went by with a joyous air
towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Chapter XL:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>The White Horse and

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>&quot;T</span>hat
is rather surprising,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;Gourville running about the
streets so gayly, when he is almost certain that M. Fouquet is in danger; when
it is almost equally certain that it was Gourville who warned M. Fouquet just
now by the note which was torn into a thousand pieces upon the terrace, and
given to the winds by monsieur le surintendant.  Gourville is rubbing his hands; that is because he has done
something clever.  Whence comes M.
Gourville?  Gourville is coming from the
Rue aux Herbes.  Whither does the Rue
aux Herbes lead?&quot;  And D'Artagnan
followed, along the tops of the houses of Nantes, dominated by the castle, the
line traced by the streets, as he would have done upon a topographical plan;
only, instead of the dead, flat paper, the living chart rose in relief with the
cries, the movements, and the shadows of men and things.  Beyond the inclosure of the city, the great
verdant plains stretched out, bordering the Loire, and appeared to run towards
the pink horizon, which was cut by the azure of the waters and the dark green of
the marshes.  Immediately outside the gates
of Nantes two white roads were seen diverging like separate fingers of a
gigantic hand.  D'Artagnan, who had
taken in all the panorama at a glance by crossing the terrace, was led by the
line of the Rue aux Herbes to the mouth of one of those roads which took its
rise under the gates of Nantes.  One
step more, and he was about to descend the stairs, take his trellised carriage,
and go towards the lodgings of M. Fouquet. 
But chance decreed, at the moment of plunging into the staircase, that
he was attracted by a moving point then gaining ground upon that road.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is that?&quot; said the musketeer to himself; &quot;a horse galloping, - a
runaway horse, no doubt.  What a rate he
is going at!&quot;  The moving point
became detached from the road, and entered into the fields.  &quot;A white horse,&quot; continued the
captain, who had just observed the color thrown luminously against the dark
ground, &quot;and he is mounted; it must be some boy whose horse is thirsty and
has run away with him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                These
reflections, rapid as lightning, simultaneous with visual perception,
D'Artagnan had already forgotten when he descended the first steps of the
staircase.  Some morsels of paper were
spread over the stairs, and shone out white against the dirty stones.  &quot;Eh! eh!&quot; said the captain to himself,
&quot;here are some of the fragments of the note torn by M. Fouquet.  Poor man! he has given his secret to the
wind; the wind will have no more to do with it, and brings it back to the king.  Decidedly, Fouquet, you play with
misfortune! the game is not a fair one, - fortune is against you.  The star of Louis XIV. obscures yours; the
adder is stronger and more cunning than the squirrel.&quot;  D'Artagnan picked up one of these morsels of
paper as he descended. 
&quot;Gourville's pretty little hand!&quot; cried he, whilst examining
one of the fragments of the note; &quot;I was not mistaken.&quot;  And he read the word &quot;horse.&quot;  &quot;Stop!&quot; said he; and he examined
another, upon which there was not a letter traced.  Upon a third he read the word &quot;white;&quot; &quot;white
horse,&quot; repeated he, like a child that is spelling.  &quot;Ah, <i>mordioux!</i>&quot; cried the suspicious spirit, &quot;a white
horse!&quot;  And, like that grain of
powder which, burning, dilates into ten thousand times its volume, D'Artagnan,
enlightened by ideas and suspicions, rapidly reascended the stairs towards the
terrace.  The white horse was still
galloping in the direction of the Loire, at the extremity of which, melting
into the vapors of the water, a little sail appeared, wave-balanced like a
water-butterfly.  &quot;Oh!&quot; cried
the musketeer, &quot;only a man who wants to fly would go at that pace across
plowed lands; there is but one Fouquet, a financier, to ride thus in open day
upon a white horse; there is no one but the lord of Belle-Isle who would make
his escape towards the sea, while there are such thick forests on land, and
there is but one D'Artagnan in the world to catch M. Fouquet, who has half an
hour's start, and who will have gained his boat within an hour.&quot;  This being said, the musketeer gave orders
that the carriage with the iron trellis should be taken immediately to a
thicket situated just outside the city. 
He selected his best horse, jumped upon his back, galloped along the Rue
aux Herbes, taking, not the road Fouquet had taken, but the bank itself of the
Loire, certain that he should gain ten minutes upon the total distance, and, at
the intersection of the two lines, come up with the fugitive, who could have no
suspicion of being pursued in that direction. 
In the rapidity of the pursuit, and with the impatience of the avenger,
animating himself as in war, D'Artagnan, so mild, so kind towards Fouquet, was
surprised to find himself become ferocious - almost sanguinary.  For a long time he galloped without catching
sight of the white horse.  His rage
assumed fury, he doubted himself, - he suspected that Fouquet had buried
himself in some subterranean road, or that he had changed the white horse for
one of those famous black ones, as swift as the wind, which D'Artagnan, at
Saint-Mandé, had so frequently admired and envied for their vigor and their
fleetness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At such
moments, when the wind cut his eyes so as to make the tears spring from them,
when the saddle had become burning hot, when the galled and spurred horse
reared with pain, and threw behind him a shower of dust and stones, D'Artagnan,
raising himself in his stirrups, and seeing nothing on the waters, nothing
beneath the trees, looked up into the air like a madman.  He was losing his senses.  In the paroxysms of eagerness he dreamt of
aerial ways, - the discovery of following century; he called to his mind
Dædalus and the vast wings that had saved him from the prisons of Crete.  A hoarse sigh broke from his lips, as he
repeated, devoured by the fear of ridicule, &quot;I!  I! duped by a Gourville! 
I!  They will say that I am
growing old, - they will say I have received a million to allow Fouquet to
escape!&quot;  And he again dug his
spurs into the sides of his horse: he had ridden astonishingly fast.  Suddenly, at the extremity of some open
pasture-ground, behind the hedges, he saw a white form which showed itself,
disappeared, and at last remained distinctly visible against the rising
ground.  D'Artagnan's heart leaped with
joy.  He wiped the streaming sweat from
his brow, relaxed the tension of his knees, - by which the horse breathed more
freely, - and, gathering up his reins, moderated the speed of the vigorous
animal, his active accomplice on this man-hunt.  He had then time to study the direction of the road, and his
position with regard to Fouquet.  The
superintendent had completely winded his horse by crossing the soft
ground.  He felt the necessity of
gaining a firmer footing, and turned towards the road by the shortest secant
line.  D'Artagnan, on his part, had nothing
to do but to ride straight on, concealed by the sloping shore; so that he would
cut his quarry off the road when he came up with him.  Then the real race would begin, - then the struggle would be in
earnest.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
gave his horse good breathing-time.  He
observed that the superintendent had relaxed into a trot, which was to say, he,
too, was favoring his horse.  But both
of them were too much pressed for time to allow them to continue long at that
pace.  The white horse sprang off like
an arrow the moment his feet touched firm ground.  D'Artagnan dropped his head, and his black horse broke into a
gallop.  Both followed the same route;
the quadruple echoes of this new race-course were confounded.  Fouquet had not yet perceived D'Artagnan.  But on issuing from the slope, a single echo
struck the air; it was that of the steps of D'Artagnan's horse, which rolled
along like thunder.  Fouquet turned
round, and saw behind him, within a hundred paces, his enemy bent over the neck
of his horse.  There could be no doubt -
the shining baldrick, the red cassock - it was a musketeer.  Fouquet slackened his hand likewise, and the
white horse placed twenty feet more between his adversary and himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
but,&quot; thought D'Artagnan, becoming very anxious, &quot;that is not a
common horse M. Fouquet is upon - let us see!&quot;  And he attentively examined with his infallible eye the shape and
capabilities of the courser.  Round full
quarters - a thin long tail - large hocks - thin legs, as dry as bars of steel
- hoofs hard as marble.  He spurred his
own, but the distance between the two remained the same.  D'Artagnan listened attentively; not a
breath of the horse reached him, and yet he seemed to cut the air.  The black horse, on the contrary, began to
puff like any blacksmith's bellows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
must overtake him, if I kill my horse,&quot; thought the musketeer; and he
began to saw the mouth of the poor animal, whilst he buried the rowels of his
merciless spurs into his sides.  The
maddened horse gained twenty toises, and came up within pistol-shot of Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Courage!&quot;
said the musketeer to himself, &quot;courage! the white horse will perhaps grow
weaker, and if the horse does not fall, the master must pull up at
last.&quot;  But horse and rider
remained upright together, gaining ground by difficult degrees.  D'Artagnan uttered a wild cry, which made
Fouquet turn round, and added speed to the white horse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
famous horse! a mad rider!&quot; growled the captain.  &quot;Hola! <i>mordioux!</i>  Monsieur Fouquet! stop! in the king's
name!&quot;  Fouquet made no reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you hear me?&quot; shouted D'Artagnan, whose horse had just stumbled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Pardieu!</i>&quot; replied Fouquet,
laconically; and rode on faster.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
was nearly mad; the blood rushed boiling to his temples and his eyes.  &quot;In the king's name!&quot; cried he
again, &quot;stop, or I will bring you down with a pistol-shot!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do!&quot;
replied Fouquet, without relaxing his speed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
seized a pistol and cocked it, hoping that the double click of the spring would
stop his enemy.  &quot;You have pistols
likewise,&quot; said he, &quot;turn and defend yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
did turn round at the noise, and looking D'Artagnan full in the face, opened,
with his right hand, the part of his dress which concealed his body, but he did
not even touch his holsters.  There were
not more than twenty paces between the two.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Mordioux!</i>&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;I
will not assassinate you; if you will not fire upon me, surrender! what is a
prison?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
would rather die!&quot; replied Fouquet; &quot;I shall suffer less.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan,
drunk with despair, hurled his pistol to the ground.  &quot;I will take you alive!&quot; said he; and by a prodigy of
skill which this incomparable horseman alone was capable, he threw his horse
forward to within ten paces of the white horse; already his hand was stretched
out to seize his prey.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Kill
me! kill me!&quot; cried Fouquet, &quot;'twould be more humane!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No!
alive - alive!&quot; murmured the captain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At this
moment his horse made a false step for the second time, and Fouquet's again
took the lead.  It was an unheard-of
spectacle, this race between two horses which now only kept alive by the will
of their riders.  It might be said that
D'Artagnan rode, carrying his horse along between his knees.  To the furious gallop had succeeded the fast
trot, and that had sunk to what might be scarcely called a trot at all.  But the chase appeared equally warm in the
two fatigued <i>athlet</i>.  D'Artagnan, quite in despair, seized his
second pistol, and cocked it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;At
your horse! not at you!&quot; cried he to Fouquet.  And he fired.  The animal
was hit in the quarters - he made a furious bound, and plunged forward.  At that moment D'Artagnan's horse fell dead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am dishonored!&quot; thought the musketeer; &quot;I am a miserable wretch! for
pity's sake, M. Fouquet, throw me one of your pistols, that I may blow out my
brains!&quot;  But Fouquet rode away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;For
mercy's sake! for mercy's sake!&quot; cried D'Artagnan; &quot;that which you
will not do at this moment, I myself will do within an hour, but here, upon
this road, I should die bravely; I should die esteemed; do me that service, M.
Fouquet!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                M.
Fouquet made no reply, but continued to trot on.  D'Artagnan began to run after his enemy.  Successively he threw away his hat, his
coat, which embarrassed him, and then the sheath of his sword, which got
between his legs as he was running.  The
sword in his hand itself became too heavy, and he threw it after the sheath.  The white horse began to rattle in its
throat; D'Artagnan gained upon him. 
From a trot the exhausted animal sunk to a staggering walk - the foam
from his mouth was mixed with blood. 
D'Artagnan made a desperate effort, sprang towards Fouquet, and seized
him by the leg, saying in a broken, breathless voice, &quot;I arrest you in the
king's name! blow my brains out, if you like; we have both done our duty.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
hurled far from him, into the river, the two pistols D'Artagnan might have
seized, and dismounting from his horse - &quot;I am your prisoner,
monsieur,&quot; said he; &quot;will you take my arm, for I see you are ready to
faint?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Thanks!&quot;
murmured D'Artagnan, who, in fact, felt the earth sliding from under his feet,
and the light of day turning to blackness around him; then he rolled upon the
sand, without breath or strength. 
Fouquet hastened to the brink of the river, dipped some water in his
hat, with which he bathed the temples of the musketeer, and introduced a few drop
between his lips.  D'Artagnan raised
himself with difficulty, and looked about him with a wandering eye.  He beheld Fouquet on his knees, with his wet
hat in his hand, smiling upon him with ineffable sweetness.  &quot;You are not off, then?&quot; cried
he.  &quot;Oh, monsieur! the true king
of royalty, in heart, in soul, is not Louis of the Louvre, or Philippe of
Sainte-Marguerite; it is you, proscribed, condemned!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I,
who this day am ruined by a single error, M. d'Artagnan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What,
in the name of Heaven, is that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
should have had you for a friend!  But
how shall we return to Nantes?  We are a
great way from it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is true,&quot; said D'Artagnan, gloomily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
white horse will recover, perhaps; he is a good horse!  Mount, Monsieur d'Artagnan; I will walk till
you have rested a little.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Poor
beast! and wounded, too?&quot; said the musketeer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
will go, I tell you; I know him; but we can do better still, let us both get
up, and ride slowly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
can try,&quot; said the captain.  But
they had scarcely charged the animal with this double load, when he began to
stagger, and then with a great effort walked a few minutes, then staggered
again, and sank down dead by the side of the black horse, which he had just
managed to come up to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
will go on foot - destiny wills it so - the walk will be pleasant,&quot; said
Fouquet, passing his arm through that of D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Mordioux!</i>&quot; cried the latter, with a
fixed eye, a contracted brow, and a swelling heart - &quot;What a disgraceful
day!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                They
walked slowly the four leagues which separated them from the little wood behind
which the carriage and escort were in waiting. 
When Fouquet perceived that sinister machine, he said to D'Artagnan, who
cast down his eyes, ashamed of Louis XIV., &quot;There is an idea that did not
emanate from a brave man, Captain d'Artagnan; it is not yours.  What are these gratings for?&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
prevent your throwing letters out.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ingenious!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
you can speak, if you cannot write,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Can
I speak to you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
certainly, if you wish to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fouquet
reflected for a moment, then looking the captain full in the face, &quot;One
single word,&quot; said he; &quot;will you remember it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will not forget it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Will
you speak it to whom I wish?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Saint-Mandé,&quot;
articulated Fouquet, in a low voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!
and for whom?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;For
Madame de Bellière or Pélisson.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
shall be done.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
carriage rolled through Nantes, and took the route to Angers.</p>

was two o'clock in the afternoon.  The
king, full of impatience, went to his cabinet on the terrace, and kept opening
the door of the corridor, to see what his secretaries were doing.  M. Colbert, seated in the same place M. de
Saint-Aignan had so long occupied in the morning, was chatting in a low voice
with M. de Brienne.  The king opened the
door suddenly, and addressed them. 
&quot;What is it you are saying?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
were speaking of the first sitting of the States,&quot; said M. de Brienne,
rising.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
well,&quot; replied the king, and returned to his room.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Five
minutes after, the summons of the bell recalled Rose, whose hour it was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Have
you finished your copies?&quot; asked the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Not
yet, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;See
if M. d'Artagnan has returned.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Not
yet, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is very strange,&quot; murmured the king. 
&quot;Call M. Colbert.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Colbert
entered; he had been expecting this all the morning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
Colbert,&quot; said the king, very sharply; &quot;you must ascertain what has
become of M. d'Artagnan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Colbert
in his calm voice replied, &quot;Where does your majesty desire him to be
sought for?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh!
monsieur! do you not know on what I have sent him?&quot; replied Louis,
acrimoniously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
majesty did not inform me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,
there are things that must be guessed; and you, above all, are apt to guess
them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
might have been able to imagine, sire; but I do not presume to be
positive.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Colbert
had not finished these words when a rougher voice than that of the king
interrupted the interesting conversation thus begun between the monarch and his
clerk.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;D'Artagnan!&quot;
cried the king, with evident joy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan,
pale and in evidently bad humor, cried to the king, as he entered, &quot;Sire,
is it your majesty who has given orders to my musketeers?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
orders?&quot; said the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;About
M. Fouquet's house?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;None!&quot;
replied Louis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ha!&quot;
said D'Artagnan, biting his mustache; &quot;I was not mistaken, then; it was
monsieur here;&quot; and he pointed to Colbert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
orders?  Let me know,&quot; said the
king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Orders
to turn the house topsy-turvy, to beat M. Fouquet's servants, to force the
drawers, to give over a peaceful house to pillage!  <i>Mordioux!</i> these are
savage orders!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur!&quot;
said Colbert, turning pale.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
interrupted D'Artagnan, &quot;the king alone, understand, - the king alone has
a right to command my musketeers; but, as to you, I forbid you to do it, and I
tell you so before his majesty; gentlemen who carry swords do not sling pens
behind their ears.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;D'Artagnan!  D'Artagnan!&quot; murmured the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is humiliating,&quot; continued the musketeer; &quot;my soldiers are
disgraced.  I do not command <i>reîtres</i>, thank you, nor clerks of the
intendant, <i>mordioux!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!
but what is all this about?&quot; said the king with authority.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;About
this, sire; monsieur - monsieur, who could not guess your majesty's orders, and
consequently could not know I was gone to arrest M. Fouquet; monsieur, who has
caused the iron cage to be constructed for his patron of yesterday - has sent
M. de Roncherolles to the lodgings of M. Fouquet, and, under the pretense of
securing the surintendant's papers, they have taken away the furniture.  My musketeers have been posted round the
house all the morning; such were my orders. 
Why did any one presume to order them to enter?  Why, by forcing them to assist in this
pillage, have they been made accomplices in it?  <i>Mordioux!</i> we serve the
king, we do; but we do not serve M. Colbert!&quot; <b><sup>5</sup></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
d'Artagnan,&quot; said the king, sternly, &quot;take care; it is not in my
presence that such explanations, and made in such a tone, should take
place.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have acted for the good of the king,&quot; said Colbert, in a faltering
voice.  &quot;It is hard to be so
treated by one of your majesty's officers, and that without redress, on account
of the respect I owe the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
respect you owe the king,&quot; cried D'Artagnan, his eyes flashing fire,
&quot;consists, in the first place, in making his authority respected, and his
person beloved.  Every agent of a power
without control represents that power, and when people curse the hand which
strikes them, it is the royal hand that God reproaches, do you hear?  Must a soldier, hardened by forty years of
wounds and blood, give you this lesson, monsieur?  Must mercy be on my side, and ferocity on yours?  You have caused the innocent to be arrested,
bound, and imprisoned!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Accomplices,
perhaps, of M. Fouquet,&quot; said Colbert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
told you M. Fouquet had accomplices, or even that he was guilty?  The king alone knows that; his justice is
not blind!  When he says, 'Arrest and
imprison' such and such a man, he is obeyed. 
Do not talk to me, then, any more of the respect you owe the king, and
be careful of your words, that they may not chance to convey the slightest
menace; for the king will not allow those to be threatened who do him service
by others who do him disservice; and if in case I should have, which God
forbid! a master so ungrateful, I would make myself respected.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Thus
saying, D'Artagnan took his station haughtily in the king's cabinet, his eyes
flashing, his hand on his sword, his lips trembling, affecting much more anger
than he really felt.  Colbert,
humiliated and devoured with rage, bowed to the king as if to ask his
permission to leave the room.  The king,
thwarted alike in pride and in curiosity, knew not which part to take.  D'Artagnan saw him hesitate.  To remain longer would have been a mistake:
it was necessary to score a triumph over Colbert, and the only method was to
touch the king so near the quick, that his majesty would have no other means of
extrication but choosing between the two antagonists.  D'Artagnan bowed as Colbert had done; but the king, who, in
preference to everything else, was anxious to have all the exact details of the
arrest of the surintendant of the finances from him who had made him tremble
for a moment, - the king, perceiving that the ill-humor of D'Artagnan would put
off for half an hour at least the details he was burning to be acquainted with,
- Louis, we say, forgot Colbert, who had nothing new to tell him, and recalled
his captain of the musketeers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
the first place,&quot; said he, &quot;let me see the result of your commission,
monsieur; you may rest yourself hereafter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan,
who was just passing through the doorway, stopped at the voice of the king,
retraced his steps, and Colbert was forced to leave the closet.  His countenance assumed almost a purple hue,
his black and threatening eyes shone with a dark fire beneath their thick
brows; he stepped out, bowed before the king, half drew himself up in passing
D'Artagnan, and went away with death in his heart.  D'Artagnan, on being left alone with the king, softened
immediately, and composing his countenance: &quot;Sire,&quot; said he,
&quot;you are a young king.  It is by
the dawn that people judge whether the day will be fine or dull.  How, sire, will the people, whom the hand of
God has placed under your law, argue of your reign, if between them and you,
you allow angry and violent ministers to interpose their mischief?  But let us speak of myself, sire, let us
leave a discussion that may appear idle, and perhaps inconvenient to you.  Let us speak of myself.  I have arrested M. Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
took plenty of time about it,&quot; said the king, sharply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
looked at the king.  &quot;I perceive
that I have expressed myself badly.  I
announced to your majesty that I had arrested Monsieur Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
did; and what then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!  I ought to have told your majesty that M.
Fouquet had arrested me; that would have been more just.  I re-establish the truth, then; I have been
arrested by M. Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                It was
now the turn of Louis XIV. to be surprised. 
His majesty was astonished in his turn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan,
with his quick glance, appreciated what was passing in the heart of his
master.  He did not allow him time to
put any questions.  He related, with
that poetry, that picturesqueness, which perhaps he alone possessed at that
period, the escape of Fouquet, the pursuit, the furious race, and, lastly, the
inimitable generosity of the surintendant, who might have fled ten times over,
who might have killed the adversary in the pursuit, but who had preferred
imprisonment, perhaps worse, to the humiliation of one who wished to rob him of
his liberty.  In proportion as the tale
advanced, the king became agitated, devouring the narrator's words, and
drumming with his finger-nails upon the table.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
results from all this, sire, in my eyes, at least, that the man who conducts
himself thus is a gallant man, and cannot be an enemy to the king.  That is my opinion, and I repeat it to your
majesty.  I know what the king will say
to me, and I bow to it, - reasons of state. 
So be it!  To my ears that sounds
highly respectable.  But I am a soldier,
and I have received my orders, my orders are executed - very unwillingly on my
part, it is true, but they are executed. 
I say no more.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Where
is M. Fouquet at this moment?&quot; asked Louis, after a short silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
Fouquet, sire,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, &quot;is in the iron cage that M.
Colbert had prepared for him, and is galloping as fast as four strong horses
can drag him, towards Angers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why
did you leave him on the road?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Because
your majesty did not tell me to go to Angers. 
The proof, the best proof of what I advance, is that the king desired me
to be sought for but this minute.  And
then I had another reason.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Whilst
I was with him, poor M. Fouquet would never attempt to escape.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!&quot;
cried the king, astonished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
majesty ought to understand, and does understand, certainly, that my warmest
wish is to know that M. Fouquet is at liberty. 
I have given him one of my brigadiers, the most stupid I could find
among my musketeers, in order that the prisoner might have a chance of
escaping.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Are
you mad, Monsieur d'Artagnan?&quot; cried the king, crossing his arms on his
breast.  &quot;Do people utter such
enormities, even when they have the misfortune to think them?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
sire, you cannot expect that I should be an enemy to M. Fouquet, after what he
has just done for you and me.  No, no;
if you desire that he should remain under your lock and bolt, never give him in
charge to me; however closely wired might be the cage, the bird would, in the
end, take wing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am surprised,&quot; said the king, in his sternest tone, &quot;you did not
follow the fortunes of the man M. Fouquet wished to place upon my throne.  You had in him all you want - affection,
gratitude.  In my service, monsieur, you
will only find a master.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
M. Fouquet had not gone to seek you in the Bastile, sire,&quot; replied
D'Artagnan, with a deeply impressive manner, &quot;one single man would have
gone there, and I should have been that man - you know that right well,
sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
king was brought to a pause.  Before
that speech of his captain of the musketeers, so frankly spoken and so true,
the king had nothing to offer.  On
hearing D'Artagnan, Louis remembered the D'Artagnan of former times; him who,
at the Palais Royal, held himself concealed behind the curtains of his bed,
when the people of Paris, led by Cardinal de Retz, came to assure themselves of
the presence of the king; the D'Artagnan whom he saluted with his hand at the
door of his carriage, when repairing to Notre Dame on his return to Paris; the
soldier who had quitted his service at Blois; the lieutenant he had recalled to
be beside his person when the death of Mazarin restored his power; the man he
had always found loyal, courageous, devoted. 
Louis advanced towards the door and called Colbert.  Colbert had not left the corridor where the
secretaries were at work.  He
reappeared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Colbert,
did you make a perquisition on the house of M. Fouquet?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
has it produced?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
de Roncherolles, who was sent with your majesty's musketeers, has remitted me
some papers,&quot; replied Colbert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will look at them.  Give me your
hand.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
hand, sire!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
that I may place it in that of M. d'Artagnan. 
In fact, M. d'Artagnan,&quot; added he, with a smile, turning towards
the soldier, who, at sight of the clerk, had resumed his haughty attitude,
&quot;you do not know this man; make his acquaintance.&quot;  And he pointed to Colbert.  &quot;He has been made but a moderately
valuable servant in subaltern positions, but he will be a great man if I raise
him to the foremost rank.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Sire!&quot;
stammered Colbert, confused with pleasure and fear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
always understood why,&quot; murmured D'Artagnan in the king's ear; &quot;he
was jealous.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Precisely,
and his jealousy confined his wings.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
will henceforward be a winged-serpent,&quot; grumbled the musketeer, with a
remnant of hatred against his recent adversary.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                But
Colbert, approaching him, offered to his eyes a physiognomy so different from
that which he had been accustomed to see him wear; he appeared so good, so
mild, so easy; his eyes took the expression of an intelligence so noble, that
D'Artagnan, a connoisseur in physiognomies, was moved, and almost changed in
his convictions.  Colbert pressed his
hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
which the king has just told you, monsieur, proves how well his majesty is
acquainted with men.  The inveterate
opposition I have displayed, up to this day, against abuses and not against
men, proves that I had it in view to prepare for my king a glorious reign, for
my country a great blessing.  I have
many ideas, M. d'Artagnan.  You will see
them expand in the sun of public peace; and if I have not the good fortune to
conquer the friendship of honest men, I am at least certain, monsieur, that I
shall obtain their esteem.  For their
admiration, monsieur, I would give my life.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This
change, this sudden elevation, this mute approbation of the king, gave the
musketeer matter for profound reflection. 
He bowed civilly to Colbert, who did not take his eyes off him.  The king, when he saw they were reconciled,
dismissed them.  They left the room
together.  As soon as they were out of
the cabinet, the new minister, stopping the captain, said:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is
it possible, M. d'Artagnan, that with such an eye as yours, you did not, at the
first glance, at the first impression, discover what sort of man I am?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
Colbert,&quot; replied the musketeer, &quot;a ray of the sun in our eyes
prevents us from seeing the most vivid flame. 
The man in power radiates, you know; and since you are there, why should
you continue to persecute him who had just fallen into disgrace, and fallen
from such a height?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I,
monsieur!&quot; said Colbert; &quot;oh, monsieur!  I would never persecute him. 
I wished to administer the finances and to administer them alone,
because I am ambitious, and, above all, because I have the most entire
confidence in my own merit; because I know that all the gold of this country
will ebb and flow beneath my eyes, and I love to look at the king's gold;
because, if I live thirty years, in thirty years not a <i>dénir</i> of it will remain in my hands; because, with that gold, I
will build granaries, castles, cities, and harbors; because I will create a
marine, I will equip navies that shall waft the name of France to the most
distant people; because I will create libraries and academies; because I will
make France the first country in the world, and the wealthiest.  These are the motives for my animosity
against M. Fouquet, who prevented my acting. 
And then, when I shall be great and strong, when France is great and
strong, in my turn, then, will I cry, 'Mercy'!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Mercy,
did you say? then ask his liberty of the king. 
The king is only crushing him on <i>your</i>
account.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Colbert
again raised his head. 
&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said he, &quot;you know that is not so, and that
the king has his own personal animosity against M. Fouquet; it is not for me to
teach you that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
the king will grow tired; he will forget.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
king never forgets, M. d'Artagnan. 
Hark! the king calls.  He is
going to issue an order.  I have not
influenced him, have I?  Listen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
king, in fact, was calling his secretaries. 
&quot;Monsieur d'Artagnan,&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am here, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Give
twenty of your musketeers to M. de Saint-Aignan, to form a guard for M.
Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
and Colbert exchanged looks.  &quot;And
from Angers,&quot; continued the king, &quot;they will conduct the prisoner to
the Bastile, in Paris.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
were right,&quot; said the captain to the minister.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Saint-Aignan,&quot;
continued the king, &quot;you will have any one shot who shall attempt to speak
privately with M. Fouquet, during the journey.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
myself, sire,&quot; said the duke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You,
monsieur, you will only speak to him in the presence of the
musketeers.&quot;  The duke bowed and
departed to execute his commission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
was about to retire likewise; but the king stopped him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
said he, &quot;you will go immediately, and take possession of the isle and
fief of Belle-Île-en-Mer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
sire.  Alone?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will take a sufficient number of troops to prevent delay, in case the place
should be contumacious.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                A
murmur of courtly incredulity rose from the group of courtiers.  &quot;That shall be done,&quot; said
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
saw the place in my infancy,&quot; resumed the king, &quot;and I do not wish to
see it again.  You have heard me?  Go, monsieur, and do not return without the
keys.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Colbert
went up to D'Artagnan.  &quot;A
commission which, if you carry it out well,&quot; said he, &quot;will be worth
a maréchal's baton to you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why
do you employ the words, 'if you carry it out well'?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Because
it is difficult.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
in what respect?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have friends in Belle-Isle, Monsieur d'Artagnan; and it is not an easy thing
for men like you to march over the bodies of their friends to obtain
success.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
hung his head in deepest thought, whilst Colbert returned to the king.  A quarter of an hour after, the captain
received the written order from the king, to blow up the fortress of
Belle-Isle, in case of resistance, with power of life and death over all the
inhabitants or refugees, and an injunction not to allow one to escape.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Colbert
was right,&quot; thought D'Artagnan; &quot;for me the baton of a maréchal of
France will cost the lives of my two friends. 
Only they seem to forget that my friends are not more stupid than the
birds, and that they will not wait for the hand of the fowler to extend over
their wings.  I will show them that hand
so plainly, that they will have quite time enough to see it.  Poor Porthos!  Poor Aramis!  No; my
fortune should shall not cost your wings a feather.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Having
thus determined, D'Artagnan assembled the royal army, embarked it at Paimbuf,
and set sail, without the loss of an unnecessary minute.</p>

the extremity of the mole, against which the furious sea beats at the evening
tide, two men, holding each other by the arm, were conversing in an animated
and expansive tone, without the possibility of any other human being hearing
their words, borne away, as they were, one by one, by the gusts of wind, with
the white foam swept from the crests of the waves.  The sun had just gone down in the vast sheet of the crimsoned
ocean, like a gigantic crucible.  From
time to time, one of these men, turning towards the east, cast an anxious,
inquiring look over the sea.  The other,
interrogating the features of his companion, seemed to seek for information in
his looks.  Then, both silent, busied
with dismal thoughts, they resumed their walk. 
Every one has already perceived that these two men were our proscribed
heroes, Porthos and Aramis, who had taken refuge in Belle-Isle, since the ruin
of their hopes, since the discomfiture of the colossal schemes of M. d'Herblay.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
is of no use your saying anything to the contrary, my dear Aramis,&quot;
repeated Porthos, inhaling vigorously the salt breeze with which he charged his
massive chest, &quot;It is of no use, Aramis. 
The disappearance of all the fishing-boats that went out two days ago is
not an ordinary circumstance.  There has
been no storm at sea; the weather has been constantly calm, not even the
lightest gale; and even if we had had a tempest, all our boats would not have
foundered.  I repeat, it is
strange.  This complete disappearance
astonishes me, I tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;True,&quot;
murmured Aramis.  &quot;You are right,
friend Porthos; it is true, there is something strange in it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
further,&quot; added Porthos, whose ideas the assent of the bishop of Vannes
seemed to enlarge; &quot;and, further, do you not observe that if the boats
have perished, not a single plank has washed ashore?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have remarked it as well as yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
do you not think it strange that the two only boats we had left in the whole
island, and which I sent in search of the others - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
here interrupted his companion by a cry, and by so sudden a movement, that
Porthos stopped as if he were stupefied.  &quot;What do you say, Porthos? 
What! - You have sent the two boats - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
search of the others!  Yes, to be sure I
have,&quot; replied Porthos, calmly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Unhappy
man!  What have you done?  Then we are indeed lost,&quot; cried the
bishop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Lost!
- what did you say?&quot; exclaimed the terrified Porthos.  &quot;How lost, Aramis?  How are we lost?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
bit his lips.  &quot;Nothing!
nothing!  Your pardon, I meant to say -
&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
if we were inclined - if we took a fancy to make an excursion by sea, we could
not.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
good! and why should that vex you?  A
precious pleasure, <i>ma foi!</i>  For my part, I don't regret it at all.  What I regret is certainly not the more or
less amusement we can find at Belle-Isle: what I regret, Aramis, is
Pierrefonds; Bracieux; le Vallon; beautiful France!  Here, we are not in France, my dear friend; we are - I know not
where.  Oh!  I tell you, in full sincerity of soul, and your affection will
excuse my frankness, but I declare to you I am not happy at Belle-Isle.  No; in good truth, I am not happy!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
breathed a long, but stifled sigh. 
&quot;Dear friend,&quot; replied he: &quot;that is why it is so sad a
thing you have sent the two boats we had left in search of the boats which
disappeared two days ago.  If you had
not sent them away, we would have departed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Departed!'  And the orders, Aramis?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
orders?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Parbleu!</i>  Why, the orders you have been constantly, in and out of season,
repeating to me - that we were to hold Belle-Isle against the usurper.  You know very well!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is true!&quot; murmured Aramis again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
see, then, plainly, my friend, that we could not depart; and that the sending
away of the boats in search of the others cannot prove prejudicial to us in the
very least.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
was silent; and his vague glances, luminous as that of an albatross, hovered
for a long time over the sea, interrogating space, seeking to pierce the very
horizon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;With
all that, Aramis,&quot; continued Porthos, who adhered to his idea, and that
the more closely from the bishop having apparently endorsed it, - &quot;with
all that, you give me no explanation about what can have happened to these
unfortunate boats.  I am assailed by
cries and complaints whichever way I go. 
The children cry to see the desolation of the women, as if I could
restore the absent husbands and fathers. 
What do you suppose, my friend, and how ought I to answer them?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Think
all you like, my good Porthos, and say nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This
reply did not satisfy Porthos at all. 
He turned away grumbling something in ill-humor.  Aramis stopped the valiant musketeer.  &quot;Do you remember,&quot; said he, in a
melancholy tone, kneading the two hands of the giant between his own with
affectionate cordiality, &quot;do you remember, my friend, that in the glorious
days of youth - do you remember, Porthos, when we were all strong and valiant -
we, and the other two - if we had then had an inclination to return to France,
do you think this sheet of salt water would have stopped us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!&quot;
said Porthos; &quot;but six leagues.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
you had seen me get astride of a plank, would you have remained on land,
Porthos?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
<i>pardieu!</i>  No, Aramis.  But,
nowadays, what sort of a plank should we want, my friend!  I, in particular.&quot;  And the Seigneur de Bracieux cast a profound
glance over his colossal rotundity with a loud laugh.  &quot;And do you mean seriously to say you are not tired of
Belle-Isle a little, and that you would not prefer the comforts of your
dwelling - of your episcopal palace, at Vannes?  Come, confess.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,&quot;
replied Aramis, without daring to look at Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
us stay where we are, then,&quot; said his friend, with a sigh, which, in spite
of the efforts he made to restrain it, escaped his echoing breast.  &quot;Let us remain! - let us remain!  And yet,&quot; added he, &quot;and yet, if
we seriously wished, but that decidedly - if we had a fixed idea, one firmly
taken, to return to France, and there were not boats - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Have
you remarked another thing, my friend - that is, since the disappearance of our
barks, during the last two days' absence of fishermen, not a single small boat
has landed on the shores of the isle?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
certainly! you are right.  I, too, have
remarked it, and the observation was the more naturally made, for, before the
last two fatal days, barks and shallops were as plentiful as shrimps.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
must inquire,&quot; said Aramis, suddenly, and with great agitation.  &quot;And then, if we had a raft constructed
- &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
there are some canoes, my friend; shall I board one?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
canoe! - a canoe!  Can you think of such
a thing, Porthos?  A canoe to be upset
in.  No, no,&quot; said the bishop of
Vannes; &quot;it is not our trade to ride upon the waves.  We will wait, we will wait.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
Aramis continued walking about with increased agitation.  Porthos, who grew tired of following all the
feverish movements of his friend - Porthos, who in his faith and calmness
understood nothing of the sort of exasperation which was betrayed by his
companion's continual convulsive starts - Porthos stopped him.  &quot;Let us sit down upon this rock,&quot;
said he.  &quot;Place yourself there,
close to me, Aramis, and I conjure you, for the last time, to explain to me in
a manner I can comprehend - explain to me what we are doing here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Porthos,&quot;
said Aramis, much embarrassed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
know that the false king wished to dethrone the true king.  That is a fact, that I understand.  Well - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes?&quot;
said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
know that the false king formed the project of selling Belle-Isle to the
English.  I understand that, too.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
know that we engineers and captains came and threw ourselves into Belle-Isle to
take direction of the works, and the command of ten companies levied and paid
by M. Fouquet, or rather the ten companies of his son-in-law.  All that is plain.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
rose in a state of great impatience.  He
might be said to be a lion importuned by a gnat.  Porthos held him by the arm. 
&quot;But what I cannot understand, what, in spite of all the efforts of
my mind, and all my reflections, I cannot comprehend, and never shall
comprehend, is, that instead of sending us troops, instead of sending us
reinforcements of men, munitions, provisions, they leave us without boats, they
leave Belle-Isle without arrivals, without help; it is that instead of
establishing with us a correspondence, whether by signals, or written or verbal
communications, all relations with the shore are intercepted.  Tell me, Aramis, answer me, or rather,
before answering me, will you allow me to tell you what I have thought?  Will you hear what my idea is, the plan I
have conceived?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
bishop raised his head. 
&quot;Well!  Aramis,&quot;
continued Porthos, &quot;I have dreamed, I have imagined that an event has
taken place in France.  I dreamt of M.
Fouquet all the night, of lifeless fish, of broken eggs, of chambers badly
furnished, meanly kept.  Villainous
dreams, my dear D'Herblay; very unlucky, such dreams!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Porthos,
what is that yonder?&quot; interrupted Aramis, rising suddenly, and pointing
out to his friend a black spot upon the empurpled line of the water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
bark!&quot; said Porthos; &quot;yes, it is a bark!  Ah! we shall have some news at last.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
are two!&quot; cried the bishop, on discovering another mast; &quot;two! three!
four!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Five!&quot;
said Porthos, in his turn.  &quot;Six!
seven!  Ah! <i>mon Dieu! mon Dieu!</i> it is a fleet!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Our
boats returning, probably,&quot; said Aramis, very uneasily, in spite of the
assurance he affected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;They
are very large for fishing-boats,&quot; observed Porthos, &quot;and do you not
remark, my friend, that they come from the Loire?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;They
come from the Loire - yes - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
look! everybody here sees them as well as ourselves; look, women and children
are beginning to crowd the jetty.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                An old
fisherman passed.  &quot;Are those our
barks, yonder?&quot; asked Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The old
man looked steadily into the eye of the horizon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
monseigneur,&quot; replied he, &quot;they are lighter boars, boats in the
king's service.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Boats
in the royal service?&quot; replied Aramis, starting.  &quot;How do you know that?&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;By
the flag.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,&quot;
said Porthos, &quot;the boat is scarcely visible; how the devil, my friend, can
you distinguish the flag?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
see there is one,&quot; replied the old man; &quot;our boats, trade lighters,
do not carry any.  That sort of craft is
generally used for transport of troops.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
groaned Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Vivat!</i>&quot; cried Porthos, &quot;they
are sending us reinforcements, don't you think they are, Aramis?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Probably.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Unless
it is the English coming.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;By
the Loire?  That would have an evil
look, Porthos; for they must have come through Paris!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are right; they are reinforcements, decidedly, or provisions.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
leaned his head upon his hands, and made no reply.  Then, all at once, - &quot;Porthos,&quot; said he, &quot;have the
alarm sounded.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
alarm! do you imagine such a thing?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
and let the cannoniers mount their batteries, the artillerymen be at their
pieces, and be particularly watchful of the coast batteries.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos
opened his eyes to their widest extent. 
He looked attentively at his friend, to convince himself he was in his
proper senses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>I</i> will do it, my dear Porthos,&quot;
continued Aramis, in his blandest tone; &quot;I will go and have these orders
executed myself, if you do not go, my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!  I will - instantly!&quot; said Porthos, who
went to execute the orders, casting all the while looks behind him, to see if
the bishop of Vannes were not deceived; and if, on recovering more rational
ideas, he would not recall him.  The
alarm was sounded, trumpets brayed, drums rolled; the great bronze bell swung
in horror from its lofty belfry.  The
dikes and moles were quickly filled with the curious and soldiers; matches
sparkled in the hands of the artillerymen, placed behind the large cannon
bedded in their stone carriages.  When
every man was at his post, when all the preparations for defense were made:
&quot;Permit me, Aramis, to try to comprehend,&quot; whispered Porthos,
timidly, in Aramis's ear.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
dear friend, you will comprehend but too soon,&quot; murmured M. d'Herblay, in
reply to this question of his lieutenant.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
fleet which is coming yonder, with sails unfurled, straight towards the port of
Belle-Isle, is a royal fleet, is it not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
as there are two kings in France, Porthos, to which of these two kings does
this fleet belong?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
you open my eyes,&quot; replied the giant, stunned by the insinuation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
Porthos, whose eyes this reply of his friend's had at last opened, or rather
thickened the bandage which covered his sight, went with his best speed to the
batteries to overlook his people, and exhort every one to do his duty.  In the meantime, Aramis, with his eye fixed
on the horizon, saw the ships continually drawing nearer.  The people and the soldiers, perched on the
summits of the rocks, could distinguish the masts, then the lower sails, and at
last the hulls of the lighters, bearing at the masthead the royal flag of
France.  It was night when one of these
vessels, which had created such a sensation among the inhabitants of
Belle-Isle, dropped anchor within cannon shot of the place.  It was soon seen, notwithstanding the
darkness, that some sort of agitation reigned on board the vessel, from the side
of which a skiff was lowered, of which the three rowers, bending to their oars,
took the direction of the port, and in a few instants struck land at the foot
of the fort.  The commander jumped
ashore.  He had a letter in his hand,
which he waved in the air, and seemed to wish to communicate with
somebody.  This man was soon recognized
by several soldiers as one of the pilots of the island.  He was the captain of one of the two barks
retained by Aramis, but which Porthos, in his anxiety with regard to the fate
of the fishermen who had disappeared, had sent in search of the missing
boats.  He asked to be conducted to M.
d'Herblay.  Two soldiers, at a signal
from a sergeant, marched him between them, and escorted him.  Aramis was upon the quay.  The envoy presented himself before the
bishop of Vannes.  The darkness was
almost absolute, notwithstanding the flambeaux borne at a small distance by the
soldiers who were following Aramis in his rounds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
Jonathan, from whom do you come?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur,
from those who captured me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
captured you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
know, monseigneur, we set out in search of our comrades?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
and afterwards?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!
monseigneur, within a short league we were captured by a <i>chasse marée</i> belonging to the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Of
which king?&quot; cried Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Jonathan
started.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Speak!&quot;
continued the bishop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
were captured, monseigneur, and joined to those who had been taken yesterday
morning.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
was the cause of the mania for capturing you all?&quot; said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,
to prevent us from telling you,&quot; replied Jonathan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos
was again at a loss to comprehend. 
&quot;And they have released you to-day?&quot; asked he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
I might tell you they have captured us, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Trouble
upon trouble,&quot; thought honest Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                During
this time Aramis was reflecting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Humph!&quot;
said he, &quot;then I suppose it is a royal fleet blockading the coasts?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
commands it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
captain of the king's musketeers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;D'Artagnan?&quot;<br>                &quot;D'Artagnan!&quot;
exclaimed Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
believe that is the name.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
did he give you this letter?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bring
the torches nearer.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is his writing,&quot; said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
eagerly read the following lines:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Order
of the king to take Belle-Isle; or to put the garrison to the sword, if they
resist; order to make prisoners of all the men of the garrison; signed,
D'ARTAGNAN, who, the day before yesterday, arrested M. Fouquet, for the purpose
of his being sent to the Bastile.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
turned pale, and crushed the paper in his hands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is it?&quot; asked Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nothing,
my friend, nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Tell
me, Jonathan?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Did
you speak to M. d'Artagnan?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
did he say to you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
for ampler information, he would speak with monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Where?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;On
board his own vessel.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;On
board his vessel!&quot; and Porthos repeated, &quot;On board his vessel!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
le mousquetaire,&quot; continued Jonathan, &quot;told me to take you both on
board my canoe, and bring you to him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
us go at once,&quot; exclaimed Porthos. 
&quot;Dear D'Artagnan!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                But
Aramis stopped him.  &quot;Are you
mad?&quot; cried he.  &quot;Who knows
that it is not a snare?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Of
the other king's?&quot; said Porthos, mysteriously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
snare, in fact!  That's what it is, my
friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
possibly; what is to be done, then?  If
D'Artagnan sends for us - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
assures you that D'Artagnan sends for us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
but - but his writing - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Writing
is easily counterfeited.  This looks
counterfeited - unsteady - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are always right; but, in the meantime, we know nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
was silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is true,&quot; said the good Porthos, &quot;we do not want to know
anything.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
shall I do?&quot; asked Jonathan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will return on board this captain's vessel.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
will tell him that we beg he will himself come into the island.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!  I comprehend!&quot; said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur,&quot; replied Jonathan; &quot;but if the captain should refuse to
come to Belle-Isle?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
he refuses, as we have cannon, we will make use of them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!
against D'Artagnan?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
it is D'Artagnan, Porthos, he will come. 
Go, Jonathan, go!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Ma foi!</i> 
I no longer comprehend anything,&quot; murmured Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will make you comprehend it all, my dear friend; the time for it has come; sit
down upon this gun-carriage, open your ears, and listen well to me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
<i>pardieu!</i>  I will listen, no fear of that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;May
I depart, monseigneur?&quot; cried Jonathan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
begone, and bring back an answer.  Allow
the canoe to pass, you men there!&quot; 
And the canoe pushed off to regain the fleet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
took Porthos by the hand, and commenced his explanations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>&quot;W</span>hat
I have to say to you, friend Porthos, will probably surprise you, but it may
prove instructive.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
like to be surprised,&quot; said Porthos, in a kindly tone; &quot;do not spare
me, therefore, I beg.  I am hardened
against emotions; don't fear, speak out.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is difficult, Porthos - difficult; for, in truth, I warn you a second time, I
have very strange things, very extraordinary things, to tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
you speak so well, my friend, that I could listen to you for days
together.  Speak, then, I beg - and -
stop, I have an idea: I will, to make your task more easy, I will, to assist
you in telling me such things, question you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
shall be pleased at your doing so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
are we going to fight for, Aramis?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
you ask me many such questions as that - if you would render my task the easier
by interrupting my revelations thus, Porthos, you will not help me at all.  So far, on the contrary, that is the very
Gordian knot.  But, my friend, with a
man like you, good, generous, and devoted, the confession must be bravely
made.  I have deceived you, my worthy
friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have deceived me!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Good
Heavens! yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Was
it for my good, Aramis?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
thought so, Porthos; I thought so sincerely, my friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then,&quot;
said the honest seigneur of Bracieux, &quot;you have rendered me a service, and
I thank you for it; for if you had not deceived me, I might have deceived
myself.  In what, then, have you
deceived me, tell me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
that I was serving the usurper against whom Louis XIV., at this moment, is
directing his efforts.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
usurper!&quot; said Porthos, scratching his head.  &quot;That is - well, I do not quite clearly comprehend!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
is one of the two kings who are contending fro the crown of France.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
well!  Then you were serving him who is
not Louis XIV.?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have hit the matter in one word.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
follows that - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
follows that we are rebels, my poor friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
devil! the devil!&quot; cried Porthos, much disappointed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
but, dear Porthos, be calm, we shall still find means of getting out of the
affair, trust me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is not that which makes me uneasy,&quot; replied Porthos; &quot;that which
alone touches me is that ugly word <i>rebels</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
but - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
so, according to this, the duchy that was promised me - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
was the usurper that was to give it to you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
that is not the same thing, Aramis,&quot; said Porthos, majestically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
friend, if it had only depended upon me, you should have become a prince.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos
began to bite his nails in a melancholy way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is where you have been wrong,&quot; continued he, &quot;in deceiving me; for
that promised duchy I reckoned upon. 
Oh!  I reckoned upon it
seriously, knowing you to be a man of your word, Aramis.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Poor
Porthos! pardon me, I implore you!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;So,
then,&quot; continued Porthos, without replying to the bishop's prayer,
&quot;so then, it  seems, I have quite
fallen out with Louis XIV.?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!  I will settle all that, my good friend, I
will settle all that.  I will take it on
myself alone!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Aramis!&quot;<br>                &quot;No, no, Porthos, I
conjure you, let me act.  No false
generosity!  No inopportune
devotedness!  You knew nothing of my
projects.  You have done nothing of
yourself.  With me it is different.  I alone am the author of this plot.  I stood in need of my inseparable companion;
I called upon you, and you came to me in remembrance of our ancient device,
'All for one, one for all.'  My crime is
that I was an egotist.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Now,
that is a word I like,&quot; said Porthos; &quot;and seeing that you have acted
entirely for yourself, it is impossible for me to blame you.  It is natural.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
upon this sublime reflection, Porthos pressed his friend's hand cordially.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                In
presence of this ingenuous greatness of soul, Aramis felt his own littleness.  It was the second time he had been compelled
to bend before real superiority of heart, which is more imposing than
brilliancy of mind.  He replied by a
mute and energetic pressure to the endearment of his friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Now,&quot;
said Porthos, &quot;that we have come to an explanation, now that I am
perfectly aware of our situation with respect to Louis XIV., I think, my
friend, it is time to make me comprehend the political intrigue of which we are
the victims - for I plainly see there is a political intrigue at the bottom of
all this.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;D'Artagnan,
my good Porthos, D'Artagnan is coming, and will detail it to you in all its
circumstances; but, excuse me, I am deeply grieved, I am bowed down with mental
anguish, and I have need of all my presence of mind, all my powers of
reflection, to extricate you from the false position in which I have so
imprudently involved you; but nothing can be more clear, nothing more plain,
than your position, henceforth.  The
king Louis XIV. has no longer now but one enemy: that enemy is myself, myself
alone.  I have made you a prisoner, you
have followed me, to-day I liberate you, you fly back to your prince.  You can perceive, Porthos, there is not one
difficulty in all this.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you think so?&quot; said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am quite sure of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
why,&quot; said the admirable good sense of Porthos, &quot;then why, if we are
in such an easy position, why, my friend, do we prepare cannon, muskets, and
engines of all sorts?  It seems to me it
would be much more simple to say to Captain d'Artagnan: 'My dear friend, we
have been mistaken; that error is to be repaired; open the door to us, let us
pass through, and we will say good-bye.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
that!&quot; said Aramis, shaking his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why
do you say 'that'?  Do you not approve
of my plan, my friend?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
see a difficulty in it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
hypothesis that D'Artagnan may come with orders which will oblige us to defend
ourselves.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!
defend ourselves against D'Artagnan? 
Folly!  Against the good
D'Artagnan!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
once more replied by shaking his head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Porthos,&quot;
at length said he, &quot;if I have had the matches lighted and the guns
pointed, if I have had the signal of alarm sounded, if I have called every man
to his post upon the ramparts, those good ramparts of Belle-Isle which you have
so well fortified, it was not for nothing. 
Wait to judge; or rather, no, do not wait - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
can I do?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
I knew, my friend, I would have told you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
there is one thing much more simple than defending ourselves: - a boat, and
away for France - where -&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
dear friend,&quot; said Aramis, smiling with a 
strong shade of sadness, &quot;do not let us reason like children; let
us be men in council and in execution. - But, hark!  I hear a hail for landing at the port.  Attention, Porthos, serious attention!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is D'Artagnan, no doubt,&quot; said Porthos, in a voice of thunder, approaching
the parapet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
it is I,&quot; replied the captain of the musketeers, running lightly up the
steps of the mole, and gaining rapidly the little esplanade on which his two
friends waited for him.  As soon as he
came towards them, Porthos and Aramis observed an officer who followed
D'Artagnan, treading apparently in his very steps.  The captain stopped upon the stairs of the mole, when half-way
up.  His companions imitated him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Make
your men draw back,&quot; cried D'Artagnan to Porthos and Aramis; &quot;let
them retire out of hearing.&quot;  This
order, given by Porthos, was executed immediately.  Then D'Artagnan, turning towards him who followed him:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
said he, &quot;we are no longer on board the king's fleet, where, in virtue of
your order, you spoke so arrogantly to me, just now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
replied the officer, &quot;I did not speak arrogantly to you; I simply, but
rigorously, obeyed instructions.  I was
commanded to follow you.  I follow you.  I am directed not to allow you to
communicate with any one without taking cognizance of what you do; I am in duty
bound, accordingly, to overhear your conversations.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
trembled with rage, and Porthos and Aramis, who heard this dialogue, trembled
likewise, but with uneasiness and fear. 
D'Artagnan, biting his mustache with that vivacity which denoted in him
exasperation, closely to be followed by an explosion, approached the officer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
said he, in a low voice, so much the more impressive, that, affecting calm, it
threatened tempest - &quot;monsieur, when I sent a canoe hither, you wished to
know what I wrote to the defenders of Belle-Isle.  You produced an order to that effect; and, in my turn, I instantly
showed you the note I had written.  When
the skipper of the boat sent by me returned, when I received the reply of these
two gentlemen&quot; (and he pointed to Aramis and Porthos), &quot;you heard
every word of what the messenger said. 
All that was plainly in your orders, all that was well executed, very
punctually, was it not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monsieur,&quot; stammered the officer; &quot;yes, without doubt, but - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
continued D'Artagnan, growing warm - &quot;monsieur, when I manifested the
intention of quitting my vessel to cross to Belle-Isle, you demanded to
accompany me; I did not hesitate; I brought you with me.  You are now at Belle-Isle, are you
not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monsieur; but - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
- the question no longer is of M. Colbert, who has given you that order, or of
whomsoever in the world you are following the instructions; the question now is
of a man who is a clog upon M. d'Artagnan, and who is alone with M. d'Artagnan
upon steps whose feet are bathed by thirty feet of salt water; a bad position
for that man, a bad position, monsieur! 
I warn you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,
monsieur, if I am a restraint upon you,&quot; said the officer, timidly, and
almost faintly, &quot;it is my duty which - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,
you have had the misfortune, either you or those that sent you, to insult
me.  It is done.  I cannot seek redress from those who employ
you, - they are unknown to me, or are at too great a distance.  But you are under my hand, and I swear that
if you make one step behind me when I raise my feet to go up to those
gentlemen, I swear to you by my name, I will cleave your head in two with my
sword, and pitch you into the water. 
Oh! it will happen! it will happen! 
I have only been six times angry in my life, monsieur, and all five
preceding times <i>I killed my man</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
officer did not stir; he became pale under this terrible threat, but replied
with simplicity, &quot;Monsieur, you are wrong in acting against my
orders.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos
and Aramis, mute and trembling at the top of the parapet, cried to the
musketeer, &quot;Good D'Artagnan, take care!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
made them a sign to keep silence, raised his foot with ominous calmness to
mount the stair, and turned round, sword in hand, to see if the officer
followed him.  The officer made a sign
of the cross and stepped up.  Porthos
and Aramis, who knew their D'Artagnan, uttered a cry, and rushed down to
prevent the blow they thought they already heard.  But D'Artagnan passed his sword into his left hand, - </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
said he to the officer, in an agitated voice, &quot;you are a brave man.  You will all the better comprehend what I am
going to say to you now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Speak,
Monsieur d'Artagnan, speak,&quot; replied the officer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;These
gentlemen we have just seen, and against whom you have orders, are my
friends.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
know they are, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
can understand whether or not I ought to act towards them as your instructions
prescribe.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
understand your reserve.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
well; permit me, then, to converse with them without a witness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
d'Artagnan, if I yield to your request, if I do that which you beg me, I break
my word; but if I do not do it, I disoblige you.  I prefer the one dilemma to the other.  Converse with your friends, and do not despise me, monsieur, for
doing this for <i>your </i>sake, whom I
esteem and honor; do not despise me for committing for you, and you alone, an
unworthy act.&quot;  D'Artagnan, much
agitated, threw his arm round the neck of the young man, and then went up to
his friends.  The officer, enveloped in
his cloak, sat down on the damp, weed-covered steps.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!&quot;
said D'Artagnan to his friends, &quot;such is my position, judge for
yourselves.&quot;  All three embraced as
in the glorious days of their youth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is the meaning of all these preparations?&quot; said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
ought to have a suspicion of what they signify,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Not
any, I assure you, my dear captain; for, in fact, I have done nothing, no more
has Aramis,&quot; the worthy baron hastened to say.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
darted a reproachful look at the prelate, which penetrated that hardened heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Dear
Porthos!&quot; cried the bishop of Vannes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
see what is being done against you,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;interception
of all boats coming to or going from Belle-Isle.  Your means of transport seized. 
If you had endeavored to fly, you would have fallen into the hands of
the cruisers that plow the sea in all directions, on the watch for you.  The king wants you to be taken, and he will
take you.&quot;  D'Artagnan tore at his
gray mustache.  Aramis grew somber,
Porthos angry.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
idea was this,&quot; continued D'Artagnan: &quot;to make you both come on
board, to keep you near me, and restore you your liberty.  But now, who can say, when I return to my
ship, I may not find a superior; that I may not find secret orders which will
take from me my command, and give it to another, who will dispose of me and you
without hope of help?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
must remain at Belle-Isle,&quot; said Aramis, resolutely; &quot;and I assure
you, for my part, I will not surrender easily.&quot;  Porthos said nothing. 
D'Artagnan remarked the silence of his friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have another trial to make of this officer, of this brave fellow who
accompanies me, and whose courageous resistance makes me very happy; for it
denotes an honest man, who, though an enemy, is a thousand times better than a
complaisant coward.  Let us try to learn
from him what his instructions are, and what his orders permit or forbid.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
us try,&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
went to the parapet, leaned over towards the steps of the mole, and called the
officer, who immediately came up. 
&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said D'Artagnan, after having exchanged the
cordial courtesies natural between gentlemen who know and appreciate each
other, &quot;monsieur, if I wished to take away these gentlemen from here, what
would you do?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
should not oppose it, monsieur; but having direct explicit orders to put them
under guard, I should detain them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That's
all over,&quot; said Aramis, gloomily. 
Porthos did not stir.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
still take Porthos,&quot; said the bishop of Vannes.  &quot;He can prove to the king, and I will help him do so, and
you too, Monsieur d'Artagnan, that he had nothing to do with this affair.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Hum!&quot;
said D'Artagnan.  &quot;Will you
come?  Will you follow me, Porthos?  The king is merciful.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
want time for reflection,&quot; said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will remain here, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Until
fresh orders,&quot; said Aramis, with vivacity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Until
we have an idea,&quot; resumed D'Artagnan; &quot;and I now believe that will
not be long, for I have one already.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
us say adieu, then,&quot; said Aramis; &quot;but in truth, my good Porthos, you
ought to go.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,&quot;
said the latter, laconically.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;As
you please,&quot; replied Aramis, a little wounded in his susceptibilities at
the morose tone of his companion. 
&quot;Only I am reassured by the promise of an idea from D'Artagnan, an
idea I fancy I have divined.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
us see,&quot; said the musketeer, placing his ear near Aramis's mouth.  The latter spoke several words rapidly, to
which D'Artagnan replied, &quot;That is it, precisely.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Infallible!&quot;
cried Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;During
the first emotion this resolution will cause, take care of yourself,
Aramis.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
don't be afraid.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Now,
monsieur,&quot; said D'Artagnan to the officer, &quot;thanks, a thousand
thanks!  You have made yourself three
friends for life.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,&quot;
added Aramis.  Porthos alone said
nothing, but merely bowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan,
having tenderly embraced his two old friends, left Belle-Isle with the
inseparable companion with whom M. Colbert had saddled him.  Thus, with the exception of the explanation
with which the worthy Porthos had been willing to be satisfied, nothing had
changed in appearance in the fate of one or the other, &quot;Only,&quot; said
Aramis, &quot;there is D'Artagnan's idea.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
did not return on board without profoundly analyzing the idea he had
discovered.  Now, we know that whatever
D'Artagnan did examine, according to custom, daylight was certain to
illuminate.  As to the officer, now
grown mute again, he had full time for meditation.  Therefore, on putting his foot on board his vessel, moored within
cannon-shot of the island, the captain of the musketeers had already got
together all his means, offensive and defensive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He
immediately assembled his council, which consisted of the officers serving
under his orders.  These were eight in
number; a chief of the maritime forces; a major directing the artillery; an
engineer, the officer we are acquainted with, and four lieutenants.  Having assembled them, D'Artagnan arose,
took of his hat, and addressed them thus:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Gentlemen,
I have been to reconnoiter Belle-Île-en-Mer, and I have found in it a good and
solid garrison; moreover, preparations are made for a defense that may prove troublesome.  I therefore intend to send for two of the
principal officers of the place, that we may converse with them.  Having separated them from their troops and
cannon, we shall be better able to deal with them; particularly by reasoning
with them.  Is not this your opinion,
gentlemen?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
major of artillery rose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
said he, with respect, but firmness, &quot;I have heard you say that the place
is preparing to make a troublesome defense. 
The place is then, as you know, determined on rebellion?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
was visibly put out by this reply; but he was not the man to allow himself to
be subdued by a trifle, and resumed:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
said he, &quot;your reply is just.  But
you are ignorant that Belle-Isle is a fief of M. Fouquet's, and that former
monarchs gave the right to the seigneurs of Belle-Isle to arm their
people.&quot;  The major made a
movement.  &quot;Oh! do not interrupt
me,&quot; continued D'Artagnan. 
&quot;You are going to tell me that that right to arm themselves against
the English was not a right to arm themselves against their king.  But it is not M. Fouquet, I suppose, who
holds Belle-Isle at this moment, since I arrested M. Fouquet the day before
yesterday.  Now the inhabitants and
defenders of Belle-Isle know nothing of this arrest.  You would announce it to them in vain.  It is a thing so unheard-of and extraordinary, so unexpected,
that they would not believe you.  A
Breton serves his master, and not his masters; he serves his master till he has
seen him dead.  Now the Bretons, as far
as I know, have not seen the body of M. Fouquet.  It is not, then, surprising they hold out against that which is
neither M. Fouquet nor his signature.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
major bowed in token of assent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is why,&quot; continued D'Artagnan, &quot;I propose to cause two of the
principal officers of the garrison to come on board my vessel.  They will see you, gentlemen; they will see
the forces we have at our disposal; they will consequently know to what they
have to trust, and the fate that attends them, in case of rebellion.  We will affirm to them, upon our honor, that
M. Fouquet is a prisoner, and that all resistance can only be prejudicial to
them.  We will tell them that at the
first cannon fired, there will be no further hope of mercy from the king.  Then, or so at least I trust, they will
resist no longer.  They will yield up
without fighting, and we shall have a place given up to us in a friendly way
which it might cost prodigious efforts to subdue.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
officer who had followed D'Artagnan to Belle-Isle was preparing to speak, but
D'Artagnan interrupted him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
I know what you are going to tell me, monsieur; I know that there is an order
of the king's to prevent all secret communications with the defenders of
Belle-Isle, and that is exactly why I do not offer to communicate except in
presence of my staff.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
D'Artagnan made an inclination of the head to his officers, who knew him well
enough to attach a certain value to the condescension.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
officers looked at each other as if to read each other's opinions in their
eyes, with the intention of evidently acting, should they agree, according to
the desire of D'Artagnan.  And already
the latter saw with joy that the result of their consent would be sending a
bark to Porthos and Aramis, when the king's officer drew from a pocket a folded
paper, which he placed in the hands of D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This
paper bore upon its superscription the number 1.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What,
more!&quot; murmured the surprised captain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Read,
monsieur,&quot; said the officer, with a courtesy that was not free from
sadness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan,
full of mistrust, unfolded the paper, and read these words: &quot;Prohibition
to M. d'Artagnan to assemble any council whatever, or to deliberate in any way
before Belle-Isle be surrendered and the prisoners shot.  Signed - LOUIS.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
repressed the quiver of impatience that ran through his whole body, and with a
gracious smile:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is well, monsieur,&quot; said he; &quot;the king's orders shall be complied
with.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>Result of the Ideas
of the King, and the Ideas of D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he
blow was direct.  It was severe,
mortal.  D'Artagnan, furious at having
been anticipated by an idea of the king's, did not despair, however, even yet;
and reflecting upon the idea he had brought back from Belle-Isle, he elicited
therefrom novel means of safety for his friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Gentlemen,&quot;
said he, suddenly, &quot;since the king has charged some other than myself with
his secret orders, it must be because I no longer possess his confidence, and I
should really be unworthy of it if I had the courage to hold a command subject
to so many injurious suspicions. 
Therefore I will go immediately and carry my resignation to the
king.  I tender it before you all,
enjoining you all to fall back with me upon the coast of France, in such a way
as not to compromise the safety of the forces his majesty has confided to
me.  For this purpose, return all to
your posts; within an hour, we shall have the ebb of the tide.  To your posts, gentlemen!  I suppose,&quot; added he, on seeing that
all prepared to obey him, except the surveillant officer, &quot;you have no
orders to object, this time?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
D'Artagnan almost triumphed while speaking these words.  This plan would prove the safety of his
friends.  The blockade once raised, they
might embark immediately, and set sail for England or Spain, without fear of
being molested.  Whilst they were making
their escape, D'Artagnan would return to the king; would justify his return by
the indignation which the mistrust of Colbert had raised in him; he would be sent
back with full powers, and he would take Belle-Isle; that is to say, the cage,
after the birds had flown.  But to this
plan the officer opposed a further order of the king's.  It was thus conceived:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;From
the moment M. d'Artagnan shall have manifested the desire of giving in his
resignation, he shall no longer be reckoned leader of the expedition, and every
officer placed under his orders shall be held to no longer obey him.  Moreover, the said Monsieur d'Artagnan,
having lost that quality of leader of the army sent against Belle-Isle, shall
set out immediately for France, accompanied by the officer who will have
remitted the message to him, and who will consider him a prisoner for whom he
is answerable.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Brave
and careless as he was, D'Artagnan turned pale.  Everything had been calculated with a depth of precognition
which, for the first time in thirty years, recalled to him the solid foresight
and inflexible logic of the great cardinal. 
He leaned his head on his hand, thoughtful, scarcely breathing.  &quot;If I were to put this order in my pocket,&quot;
thought he, &quot;who would know it, what would prevent my doing it?  Before the king had had time to be informed,
I should have saved those poor fellows yonder. 
Let us exercise some small audacity! 
My head is not one of those the executioner strikes off for
disobedience.  We will
disobey!&quot;  But at the moment he was
about to adopt this plan, he saw the officers around him reading similar
orders, which the passive agent of the thoughts of that infernal Colbert had
distributed to them.  This contingency of
his disobedience had been foreseen - as all the rest had been.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
said the officer, coming up to him, &quot;I await your good pleasure to
depart.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am ready, monsieur,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, grinding his teeth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
officer immediately ordered a canoe to receive M. d'Artagnan and himself.  At sight of this he became almost distraught
with rage.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How,&quot;
stammered he, &quot;will you carry on the directions of the different
corps?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;When
you are gone, monsieur,&quot; replied the commander of the fleet, &quot;it is to
me the command of the whole is committed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then,
monsieur,&quot; rejoined Colbert's man, addressing the new leader, &quot;it is
for you that this last order remitted to me is intended.  Let us see your powers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Here
they are,&quot; said the officer, exhibiting the royal signature.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Here
are your instructions,&quot; replied the officer, placing the folded paper in
his hands; and turning round towards D'Artagnan, &quot;Come, monsieur,&quot;
said he, in an agitated voice (such despair did he behold in that man of iron),
&quot;do me the favor to depart at once.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Immediately!&quot;
articulated D'Artagnan, feebly, subdued, crushed by implacable impossibility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And he
painfully subsided into the little boat, which started, favored by wind and
tide, for the coast of France.  The
king's guards embarked with him.  The
musketeer still preserved the hope of reaching Nantes quickly, and of pleading
the cause of his friends eloquently enough to incline the king to mercy.  The bark flew like a swallow.  D'Artagnan distinctly saw the land of France
profiled in black against the white clouds of night.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
monsieur,&quot; said he, in a low voice, to the officer to whom, for an hour,
he had ceased speaking, &quot;what would I give to know the instructions for
the new commander!  They are all
pacific, are they not? and - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He did
not finish; the thunder of a distant cannon rolled athwart the waves, another,
and two or three still louder. 
D'Artagnan shuddered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;They
have commenced the siege of Belle-Isle,&quot; replied the officer.  The canoe had just touched the soil of France.</p>

D'Artagnan left Aramis and Porthos, the latter returned to the principal fort,
in order to converse with greater liberty. 
Porthos, still thoughtful, was a restraint on Aramis, whose mind had
never felt itself more free.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Dear
Porthos,&quot; said he, suddenly, &quot;I will explain D'Artagnan's idea to
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
idea, Aramis?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;An
idea to which we shall owe our liberty within twelve hours.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
indeed!&quot; said Porthos, much astonished. 
&quot;Let us hear it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Did
you remark, in the scene our friend had with the officer, that certain orders
constrained him with regard to us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
I did notice that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!  D'Artagnan is going to give in his
resignation to the king, and during the confusion that will result from his
absence, we will get away, or rather you will get away, Porthos, if there is
possibility of flight for only one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Here
Porthos shook his head and replied: &quot;We will escape together, Aramis, or
we will stay together.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Thine
is a right, a generous heart,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;only your melancholy
uneasiness affects me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am not uneasy,&quot; said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
you are angry with me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am not angry with you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
why, my friend, do you put on such a dismal countenance?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will tell you; I am making my will.&quot; 
And while saying these words, the good Porthos looked sadly in the face
of Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
will!&quot; cried the bishop. 
&quot;What, then! do you think yourself lost?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
feel fatigued.  It is the first time,
and there is a custom in our family.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is it, my friend?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
grandfather was a man twice as strong as I am.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Indeed!&quot;
said Aramis; &quot;then your grandfather must have been Samson himself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No;
his name was Antoine.  Well! he was
about my age, when, setting out one day for the chase, he felt his legs weak,
the man who had never known what weakness was before.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
was the meaning of that fatigue, my friend?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nothing
good, as you will see; for having set out, complaining still of weakness of the
legs, he met a wild boar, which made head against him; he missed him with his
arquebuse, and was ripped up by the beast and died immediately.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
is no reason in that why you should alarm yourself, dear Porthos.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
you will see.  My father was as strong
again as I am.  He was a rough soldier,
under Henry III. and Henry IV.; his name was not Antoine, but Gaspard, the same
as M. de Coligny.  Always on horseback,
he had never known what lassitude was. 
One evening, as he rose from table, his legs failed him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
had supped heartily, perhaps,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;and that was why he
staggered.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bah!  A friend of M. de Bassompierre,
nonsense!  No, no, he was astonished at
this lassitude, and said to my mother, who laughed at him, 'Would not one
believe I was going to meet with a wild boar, as the late M. du Vallon, my
father did?'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well?&quot;
said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
having this weakness, my father insisted upon going down into the garden,
instead of going to bed; his foot slipped on the first stair, the staircase was
steep; my father fell against a stone in which an iron hinge was fixed.  The hinge gashed his temple; and he was
stretched out dead upon the spot.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
raised his eyes to his friend: &quot;These are two extraordinary
circumstances,&quot; said he; &quot;let us not infer that there may succeed a
third.  It is not becoming in a man of
your strength to be superstitious, my brave Porthos.  Besides, when were your legs known to fail?  Never have you stood so firm, so haughtily;
why, you could carry a house on your shoulders.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;At
this moment,&quot; said Porthos, &quot;I feel myself pretty active; but at
times I vacillate; I sink; and lately this phenomenon, as you say, has occurred
four times.  I will not say this
frightens me, but it annoys me.  Life is
an agreeable thing.  I have money; I
have fine estates; I have horses that I love; I have also friends that I love:
D'Artagnan, Athos, Raoul, and you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
admirable Porthos did not even take the trouble to dissimulate in the very
presence of Aramis the rank he gave him in his friendship.  Aramis pressed his hand: &quot;We will still
live many years,&quot; said he, &quot;to preserve to the world such specimens
of its rarest men.  Trust yourself to
me, my friend; we have no reply from D'Artagnan, that is a good sign.  He must have given orders to get the vessels
together and clear the seas.  On my part
I have just issued directions that a bark should be rolled on rollers to the
mouth of the great cavern of Locmaria, which you know, where we have so often
lain in wait for the foxes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
and which terminates at the little creek by a trench where we discovered the
day that splendid fox escaped that way.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Precisely.  In case of misfortunes, a bark is to be
concealed for us in that cavern; indeed, it must be there by this time.  We will wait for a favorable moment, and
during the night we will go to sea!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is a grand idea.  What shall we gain by
it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
shall gain this - nobody knows that grotto, or rather its issue, except
ourselves and two or three hunters of the island; we shall gain this - that if
the island is occupied, the scouts, seeing no bark upon the shore, will never
imagine we can escape, and will cease to watch.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
understand.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!
that weakness in the legs?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
better, much, just now.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
see, then, plainly, that everything conspires to give us quietude and
hope.  D'Artagnan will sweep the sea and
leave us free.  No royal fleet or
descent to be dreaded.  <i>Vive Dieu!</i>  Porthos, we have still half a century of magnificent adventure
before us, and if I once touch Spanish ground, I swear to you,&quot; added the
bishop with terrible energy, &quot;that your brevet of duke is not such a
chance as it is said to be.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
live by hope,&quot; said Porthos, enlivened by the warmth of his companion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                All at
once a cry resounded in their ears: &quot;To arms! to arms!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This
cry, repeated by a hundred throats, piercing the chamber where the two friends
were conversing, carried surprise to one, and uneasiness to the other.  Aramis opened the window; he saw a crowd of
people running with flambeaux.  Women
were seeking places of safety, the armed population were hastening to their
posts.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
fleet! the fleet!&quot; cried a soldier, who recognized Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
fleet?&quot; repeated the latter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Within
half cannon-shot,&quot; continued the soldier.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
arms!&quot; cried Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
arms!&quot; repeated Porthos, formidably. 
And both rushed forth towards the mole to place themselves within the
shelter of the batteries.  Boats, laden
with soldiers, were seen approaching; and in three directions, for the purpose
of landing at three points at once.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
must be done?&quot; said an officer of the guard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Stop
them; and if they persist, fire!&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Five
minutes later, the cannonade commenced. 
These were the shots that D'Artagnan had heard as he landed in
France.  But the boats were too near the
mole to allow the cannon to aim correctly. 
They landed, and the combat commenced hand to hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What's
the matter, Porthos?&quot; said Aramis to his friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nothing!
nothing! - only my legs; it is really incomprehensible! - they will be better when
we charge.&quot;  In fact, Porthos and
Aramis did charge with such vigor, and so thoroughly animated their men, that
the royalists re-embarked precipitately, without gaining anything but the
wounds they carried away.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh!
but Porthos,&quot; cried Aramis, &quot;we must have a prisoner, quick!
quick!&quot;  Porthos bent over the
stair of the mole, and seized by the nape of the neck one of the officers of
the royal army who was waiting to embark till all his people should be in the
boat.  The arm of the giant lifted up
his prey, which served him as a buckler, and he recovered himself without a
shot being fired at him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Here
is a prisoner for you,&quot; said Porthos coolly to Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!&quot;
cried the latter, laughing, &quot;did you not calumniate your legs?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
was not with my legs I captured him,&quot; said Porthos, &quot;it was with my
arms!&quot;</p>

Bretons of the Isle were very proud of this victory; Aramis did not encourage
them in the feeling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
will happen,&quot; said he to Porthos, when everybody was gone home, &quot;will
be that the anger of the king will be roused by the account of the resistance;
and that these brave people will be decimated or shot when they are taken,
which cannot fail to take place.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;From
which it results, then,&quot; said Porthos, &quot;that what we have done is of
not the slightest use.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;For
the moment it may be,&quot; replied the bishop, &quot;for we have a prisoner
from whom we shall learn what our enemies are preparing to do.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
let us interrogate the prisoner,&quot; said Porthos, &quot;and the means of
making him speak are very simple.  We
are going to supper; we will invite him to join us; as he drinks he will
talk.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This
was done.  The officer was at first
rather uneasy, but became reassured on seeing what sort of men he had to deal
with.  He gave, without having any fear
of compromising himself, all the details imaginable of the resignation and
departure of D'Artagnan.  He explained
how, after that departure, the new leader of the expedition had ordered a
surprise upon Belle-Isle.  There his
explanations stopped.  Aramis and
Porthos exchanged a glance that evinced their despair.  No more dependence to be placed now on
D'Artagnan's fertile imagination - no further resource in the event of
defeat.  Aramis, continuing his
interrogations, asked the prisoner what the leaders of the expedition
contemplated doing with the leaders of Belle-Isle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
orders are,&quot; replied he, &quot;to kill <i>during</i>
combat, or hang <i>afterwards</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos
and Aramis looked at each other again, and the color mounted to their faces.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am too light for the gallows,&quot; replied Aramis; &quot;people like me are
not hung.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
I am too heavy,&quot; said Porthos; &quot;people like me break the cord.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am sure,&quot; said the prisoner, gallantly, &quot;that we could have
guaranteed you the exact kind of death you preferred.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
thousand thanks!&quot; said Aramis, seriously. 
Porthos bowed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;One
more cup of wine to your health,&quot; said he, drinking himself.  From one subject to another the chat with
the officer was prolonged.  He was an
intelligent gentleman, and suffered himself to be led on by the charm of
Aramis's wit and Porthos's cordial <i>bonhomie</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Pardon
me,&quot; said he, &quot;if I address a question to you; but men who are in
their sixth bottle have a clear right to forget themselves a little.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Address
it!&quot; cried Porthos; &quot;address it!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Speak,&quot;
said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Were
you not, gentlemen, both in the musketeers of the late king?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monsieur, and amongst the best of them, if you please,&quot; said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is true; I should say even the best of all soldiers, messieurs, if I did not
fear to offend the memory of my father.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Of
your father?&quot; cried Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you know what my name is?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Ma foi!</i> no, monsieur; but you can tell
us, and - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am called Georges de Biscarrat.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!&quot;
cried Porthos, in his turn. 
&quot;Biscarrat!  Do you remember
that name, Aramis?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Biscarrat!&quot;
reflected the bishop.  &quot;It seems to
me - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Try
to recollect, monsieur,&quot; said the officer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Pardieu!</i> that won't take me long,&quot;
said Porthos.  &quot;Biscarrat - called Cardinal
- one of the four who interrupted us on the day on which we formed our
friendship with D'Artagnan, sword in hand.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Precisely,
gentlemen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
only one,&quot; cried Aramis, eagerly, &quot;we could not scratch.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Consequently,
a capital blade?&quot; said the prisoner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That's
true! most true!&quot; exclaimed both friends together.  &quot;<i>Ma
foi!</i>  Monsieur Biscarrat, we are
delighted to make the acquaintance of such a brave man's son.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Biscarrat
pressed the hands held out by the two musketeers.  Aramis looked at Porthos as much as to say, &quot;Here is a man
who will help us,&quot; and without delay, - &quot;Confess, monsieur,&quot;
said he, &quot;that it is good to have once been a good man.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;&quot;My
father always said so, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Confess,
likewise, that it is a sad circumstance in which you find yourself, of falling
in with men destined to be shot or hung, and to learn that these men are old
acquaintances, in fact, hereditary friends.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
you are not reserved for such a frightful fate as that, messieurs and
friends!&quot; said the young man, warmly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Bah!
you said so yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
said so just now, when I did not know you; but now that I know you, I say - you
will evade this dismal fate, if you wish!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
- if we wish?&quot; echoed Aramis, whose eyes beamed with intelligence as he
looked alternately at the prisoner and Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Provided,&quot;
continued Porthos, looking, in his turn, with noble intrepidity, at M.
Biscarrat and the bishop - &quot;provided nothing disgraceful be required of
us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nothing
at all will be required of you, gentlemen,&quot; replied the officer -
&quot;what should they ask of you?  If
they find you they will kill you, that is a predetermined thing; try, then,
gentlemen, to prevent their finding you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
don't think I am mistaken,&quot; said Porthos, with dignity; &quot;but it
appears evident to me that if they want to find us, they must come and seek us
here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
that you are perfectly right, my worthy friend,&quot; replied Aramis,
constantly consulting with his looks the countenance of Biscarrat, who had
grown silent and constrained.  &quot;You
wish, Monsieur de Biscarrat, to say something to us, to make us some overture,
and you dare not - is that true?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
gentlemen and friends! it is because by speaking I betray the watchword.  But, hark! 
I hear a voice that frees mine by dominating it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Cannon!&quot;
said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Cannon
and musketry, too!&quot; cried the bishop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                On
hearing at a distance, among the rocks, these sinister reports of a combat
which they thought had ceased:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
can that be?&quot; asked Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh!  <i>Pardieu!</i>&quot;
cried Aramis; &quot;that is just what I expected.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
the attack made by you was nothing but a feint; is not that true,
monsieur?  And whilst your companions
allowed themselves to be repulsed, you were certain of effecting a landing on
the other side of the island.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
several, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
are lost, then,&quot; said the bishop of Vannes, quietly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Lost!
that is possible,&quot; replied the Seigneur de Pierrefonds, &quot;but we are
not taken or hung.&quot;  And so saying,
he rose from the table, went to the wall, and coolly took down his sword and
pistols, which he examined with the care of an old soldier who is preparing for
battle, and who feels that life, in a great measure, depends upon the
excellence and right conditions of his arms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At the
report of the cannon, at the news of the surprise which might deliver up the
island to the royal troops, the terrified crowd rushed precipitately to the
fort to demand assistance and advice from their leaders.  Aramis, pale and downcast, between two
flambeaux, showed himself at the window which looked into the principal court,
full of soldiers waiting for orders and bewildered inhabitants imploring
succor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
friends,&quot; said D'Herblay, in a grave and sonorous voice, &quot;M. Fouquet,
your protector, your friend, you father, has been arrested by an order of the
king, and thrown into the Bastile.&quot; 
A sustained yell of vengeful fury came floating up to the window at
which the bishop stood, and enveloped him in a magnetic field.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Avenge
Monsieur Fouquet!&quot; cried the most excited of his hearers, &quot;death to
the royalists!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
my friends,&quot; replied Aramis, solemnly; &quot;no, my friends; no
resistance.  The king is master in his
kingdom.  The king is the mandatory of
God.  The king and God have struck M.
Fouquet.  Humble yourselves before the
hand of God.  Love God and the king, who
have struck M. Fouquet.  But do not
avenge your seigneur, do not think of avenging him.  You would sacrifice yourselves in vain - you, your wives and
children, your property, your liberty. 
Lay down your arms, my friends - lay down your arms! since the king
commands you so to do - and retire peaceably to your dwellings.  It is I who ask you to do so; it is I who
beg you to do so; it is I who now, in the hour of need, command you to do so,
in the name of M. Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
crowd collected under the window uttered a prolonged roar of anger and
terror.  &quot;The soldiers of Louis
XIV. have reached the island,&quot; continued Aramis.  &quot;From this time it would no longer be a fight betwixt them
and you - it would be a massacre. 
Begone, then, begone, and forget; this time I command you, in the name
of the Lord of Hosts!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
mutineers retired slowly, submissive, silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
what have you just been saying, my friend?&quot; said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
said Biscarrat to the bishop, &quot;you may save all these inhabitants, but
thus you will neither save yourself nor your friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
de Biscarrat,&quot; said the bishop of Vannes, with a singular accent of
nobility and courtesy, &quot;Monsieur de Biscarrat, be kind enough to resume
your liberty.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am very willing to do so, monsieur; but - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
would render us a service, for when announcing to the king's lieutenant the
submission of the islanders, you will perhaps obtain some grace for us on
informing him of the manner in which that submission has been effected.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Grace!&quot;
replied Porthos with flashing eyes, &quot;what is the meaning of that
word?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
touched the elbow of his friend roughly, as he had been accustomed to do in the
days of their youth, when he wanted to warn Porthos that he had committed, or
was about to commit, a blunder.  Porthos
understood him, and was silent immediately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will go, messieurs,&quot; replied Biscarrat, a little surprised likewise at the
word &quot;grace&quot; pronounced by the haughty musketeer, of and to whom, but
a few minutes before, he had related with so much enthusiasm the heroic
exploits with which his father had delighted him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Go,
then, Monsieur Biscarrat,&quot; said Aramis, bowing to him, &quot;and at
parting receive the expression of our entire gratitude.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
you, messieurs, you whom I think it an honor to call my friends, since you have
been willing to accept that title, what will become of you in the
meantime?&quot; replied the officer, very much agitated at taking leave of the
two ancient adversaries of his father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
will wait here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,
<i>mon Dieu!</i> - the order is precise and
formal.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am bishop of Vannes, Monsieur de Biscarrat; and they no more shoot a bishop
than they hang a gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
yes, monsieur - yes, monseigneur,&quot; replied Biscarrat; &quot;it is true,
you are right, there is still that chance for you.  Then, I will depart, I will repair to the commander of the
expedition, the king's lieutenant. 
Adieu! then, messieurs, or rather, to meet again, I hope.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
worthy officer, jumping upon a horse given him by Aramis, departed in the
direction of the sound of cannon, which, by surging the crowd into the fort,
had interrupted the conversation of the two friends with their prisoner.  Aramis watched the departure, and when left
alone with Porthos:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
do you comprehend?&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Ma foi!</i> no.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Did
not Biscarrat inconvenience you here?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No;
he is a brave fellow.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
but the grotto of Locmaria - is it necessary all the world should know
it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
that is true, that is true; I comprehend. 
We are going to escape by the cavern.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
you please,&quot; cried Aramis, gayly. 
&quot;Forward, friend Porthos; our boat awaits us.  King Louis has not caught us - <i>yet</i>.&quot;</p>

cavern of Locmaria was sufficiently distant from the mole to render it
necessary for our friends to husband their strength in order to reach it.  Besides, night was advancing; midnight had
struck at the fort.  Porthos and Aramis
were loaded with money and arms.  They
walked, then, across the heath, which stretched between the mole and the
cavern, listening to every noise, in order better to avoid an ambush.  From time to time, on the road which they
had carefully left on their left, passed fugitives coming from the interior, at
the news of the landing of the royal troops. 
Aramis and Porthos, concealed behind some projecting mass of rock,
collected the words that escaped from the poor people, who fled, trembling,
carrying with them their most valuable effects, and tried, whilst listening to
their complaints, to gather something from them for their own interest.  At length, after a rapid race, frequently
interrupted by prudent stoppages, they reached the deep grottoes, in which the
prophetic bishop of Vannes had taken care to have secreted a bark capable of
keeping the sea at this fine season.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
good friend,&quot; said Porthos, panting vigorously, &quot;we have arrived, it
seems.  But I thought you spoke of three
men, three servants, who were to accompany us. 
I don't see them - where are they?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why
should you see them, Porthos?&quot; replied Aramis.  &quot;They are certainly waiting for us in the cavern, and, no
doubt, are resting, having accomplished their rough and difficult task.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
stopped Porthos, who was preparing to enter the cavern.  &quot;Will you allow me, my friend,&quot;
said he to the giant, &quot;to pass in first? 
I know the signal I have given to these men; who, not hearing it, would
be very likely to fire upon you or slash away with their knives in the
dark.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Go
on, then, Aramis; go on - go first; you impersonate wisdom and foresight;
go.  Ah! there is that fatigue again, of
which I spoke to you.  It has just
seized me afresh.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
left Porthos sitting at the entrance of the grotto, and bowing his head, he
penetrated into the interior of the cavern, imitating the cry of the owl.  A little plaintive cooing, a scarcely
distinct echo, replied from the depths of the cave.  Aramis pursued his way cautiously, and soon was stopped by the
same kind of cry as he had first uttered, within ten paces of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Are
you there, Yves?&quot; said the bishop.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur; Goenne is here likewise. 
His son accompanies us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is well.  Are all things ready?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monseigneur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Go
to the entrance of the grottoes, my good Yves, and you will there find the
Seigneur de Pierrefonds, who is resting after the fatigue of our journey.  And if he should happen not to be able to
walk, lift him up, and bring him hither to me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
three men obeyed.  But the
recommendation given to his servants was superfluous.  Porthos, refreshed, had already commenced the descent, and his
heavy step resounded amongst the cavities, formed and supported by columns of
porphyry and granite.  As soon as the
Seigneur de Bracieux had rejoined the bishop, the Bretons lighted a lantern
with which they were furnished, and Porthos assured his friend that he felt as
strong again as ever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
us inspect the boat,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;and satisfy ourselves at once
what it will hold.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
not go too near with the light,&quot; said the patron Yves; &quot;for as you
desired me, monseigneur, I have placed under the bench of the poop, in the
coffer you know of, the barrel of powder, and the musket-charges that you sent
me from the fort.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
well,&quot; said Aramis; and, taking the lantern himself, he examined minutely
all parts of the canoe, with the precautions of a man who is neither timid nor
ignorant in the face of danger.  The
canoe was long, light, drawing little water, thin of keel; in short, one of
those that have always been so aptly built at Belle-Isle; a little high in its
sides, solid upon the water, very manageable, furnished with planks which, in
uncertain weather, formed a sort of deck over which the waves might glide, so
as to protect the rowers.  In two
well-closed coffers, placed beneath the benches of the prow and the poop,
Aramis found bread, biscuit, dried fruits, a quarter of bacon, a good provision
of water in leathern bottles; the whole forming rations sufficient for people
who did not mean to quit the coast, and would be able to revictual, if
necessity commanded.  The arms, eight
muskets, and as many horse-pistols, were in good condition, and all
loaded.  There were additional oars, in
case of accident, and that little sail called <i>trinquet</i>, which assists the speed of the canoe at the same time the
boatmen row, and is so useful when the breeze is slack.  When Aramis had seen to all these things,
and appeared satisfied with the result of his inspection, &quot;Let us consult
Porthos,&quot; said he, &quot;to know if we must endeavor to get the boat out
by the unknown extremity of the grotto, following the descent and the shade of
the cavern, or whether it be better, in the open air, to make it slide upon its
rollers through the bushes, leveling the road of the little beach, which is but
twenty feet high, and gives, at high tide, three or four fathoms of good water
upon a sound bottom.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
must be as you please, monseigneur,&quot; replied the skipper Yves,
respectfully; &quot;but I don't believe that by the slope of the cavern, and in
the dark in which we shall be obliged to maneuver our boat, the road will be so
convenient as the open air.  I know the
beach well, and can certify that it is as smooth as a grass-plot in a garden;
the interior of the grotto, on the contrary, is rough; without reckoning,
monseigneur, that at its extremity we shall come to the trench which leads into
the sea, and perhaps the canoe will not pass down it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have made my calculation,&quot; said the bishop, &quot;and I am certain it will
pass.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;So
be it; I wish it may, monseigneur,&quot; continued Yves; &quot;but your
highness knows very well that to make it reach the extremity of the trench,
there is an enormous stone to be lifted - that under which the fox always
passes, and which closes the trench like a door.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
can be raised,&quot; said Porthos; &quot;that is nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!  I know that monseigneur has the strength of
ten men,&quot; replied Yves; &quot;but that is giving him a great deal of
trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
think the skipper may be right,&quot; said Aramis; &quot;let us try the
open-air passage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
more so, monseigneur,&quot; continued the fisherman, &quot;that we should not
be able to embark before day, it will require so much labor, and that as soon
as daylight appears, a good <i>vedette</i>
placed outside the grotto would be necessary, indispensable even, to watch the
maneuvers of the lighters or cruisers that are on the look-out for us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
yes, Yves, your reasons are good; we will go by the beach.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And the
three robust Bretons went to the boat, and were beginning to place their
rollers underneath it to put it in motion, when the distant barking of dogs was
heard, proceeding from the interior of the island.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
darted out of the grotto, followed by Porthos. 
Dawn just tinted with purple and white the waves and plain; through the
dim light, melancholy fir-trees waved their tender branches over the pebbles,
and long flights of crows were skimming with their black wings the shimmering
fields of buckwheat.  In a quarter of an
hour it would be clear daylight; the wakened birds announced it to all
nature.  The barkings which had been
heard, which had stopped the three fishermen engaged in moving the boat, and
had brought Aramis and Porthos out of the cavern, now seemed to come from a
deep gorge within about a league of the grotto.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is a pack of hounds,&quot; said Porthos; &quot;the dogs are on a scent.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
can be hunting at such a moment as this?&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
this way, particularly,&quot; continued Porthos, &quot;where they might expect
the army of the royalists.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
noise comes nearer.  Yes, you are right,
Porthos, the dogs are on a scent.  But,
Yves!&quot; cried Aramis, &quot;come here! come here!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Yves
ran towards him, letting fall the cylinder which he was about to place under
the boat when the bishop's call interrupted him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is the meaning of this hunt, skipper?&quot; said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh!
monseigneur, I cannot understand it,&quot; replied the Breton.  &quot;It is not at such a moment that the
Seigneur de Locmaria would hunt.  No,
and yet the dogs - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Unless
they have escaped from the kennel.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,&quot;
said Goenne, &quot;they are not the Seigneur de Locmaria's hounds.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
common prudence,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;let us go back into the grotto; the
voices evidently draw nearer, we shall soon know what we have to trust
to.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                They
re-entered, but had scarcely proceeded a hundred steps in the darkness, when a
noise like the hoarse sigh of a creature in distress resounded through the
cavern, and breathless, rapid, terrified, a fox passed like a flash of
lightning before the fugitives, leaped over the boat and disappeared, leaving behind
its sour scent, which was perceptible for several seconds under the low vaults
of the cave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
fox!&quot; cried the Bretons, with the glad surprise of born hunters.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Accursed
mischance!&quot; cried the bishop, &quot;our retreat is discovered.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
so?&quot; said Porthos; &quot;are you afraid of a fox?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh!
my friend, what do you mean by that? why do you specify the fox?  It is not the fox alone.  <i>Pardieu!</i>  But don't you know, Porthos, that after the
foxes come hounds, and after hounds men?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos
hung his head.  As though to confirm the
words of Aramis, they heard the yelping pack approach with frightful swiftness
upon the trail.  Six foxhounds burst at
once upon the little heath, with mingling yelps of triumph.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
are the dogs, plain enough!&quot; said Aramis, posted on the look-out behind a
chink in the rocks; &quot;now, who are the huntsmen?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
it is the Seigneur de Locmaria's,&quot; replied the sailor, &quot;he will leave
the dogs to hunt the grotto, for he knows them, and will not enter in himself,
being quite sure that the fox will come out the other side; it is there he will
wait for him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is not the Seigneur de Locmaria who is hunting,&quot; replied Aramis, turning
pale in spite of his efforts to maintain a placid countenance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
is it, then?&quot; said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Look!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos
applied his eye to the slit, and saw at the summit of a hillock a dozen
horsemen urging on their horses in the track of the dogs, shouting, &quot;<i>Taïaut! taïaut!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
guards!&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
my friend, the king's guards.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
king's guards! do you say, monseigneur?&quot; cried the Bretons, growing pale
in turn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;With
Biscarrat at their head, mounted upon my gray horse,&quot; continued Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
hounds at the same moment rushed into the grotto like an avalanche, and the
depths of the cavern were filled with their deafening cries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
the devil!&quot; said Aramis, resuming all his coolness at the sight of this
certain, inevitable danger.  &quot;I am
perfectly satisfied we are lost, but we have, at least, one chance left.  If the guards who follow their hounds happen
to discover there is an issue to the grotto, there is no help for us, for on
entering they must see both ourselves and our boat.  The dogs must not go out of the cavern.  Their masters must not enter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is clear,&quot; said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
understand,&quot; added Aramis, with the rapid precision of command;
&quot;there are six dogs that will be forced to stop at the great stone under
which the fox has glided - but at the too narrow opening of which they must be
themselves stopped and killed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
Bretons sprang forward, knife in hand. 
In a few minutes there was a lamentable concert of angry barks and
mortal howls - and then, silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That's
well!&quot; said Aramis, coolly, &quot;now for the masters!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is to be done with them?&quot; said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Wait
their arrival, conceal ourselves, and kill them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Kill them!</i>&quot; replied Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;There
are sixteen,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;at least, at present.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And well armed,&quot; added
Porthos, with a smile of consolation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It will last about ten
minutes,&quot; said Aramis.  &quot;To
work!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>And with a resolute air he took up
a musket, and placed a hunting-knife between his teeth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yves, Goenne, and his
son,&quot; continued Aramis, will pass the muskets to us.  You, Porthos, will fire when they are
close.  We shall have brought down, at
the lowest computation, eight, before the others are aware of anything - that
is certain; then all, there are five of us, will dispatch the other eight,
knife in hand.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And poor Biscarrat?&quot;
said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis reflected a moment -
&quot;Biscarrat first,&quot; replied he, coolly.  &quot;He knows us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Chapter XLVIII:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>The Grotto.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>I</span>n
spite of the sort of divination which was the remarkable side of the character
of Aramis, the event, subject to the risks of things over which uncertainty
presides, did not fall out exactly as the bishop of Vannes had foreseen.  Biscarrat, better mounted than his
companions, arrived first at the opening of the grotto, and comprehended that
fox and hounds were one and all engulfed in it.  Only, struck by that superstitious terror which every dark and
subterraneous way naturally impresses upon the mind of man, he stopped at the
outside of the grotto, and waited till his companions should have assembled
round him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!&quot;
asked the young men, coming up, out of breath, and unable to understand the
meaning of this inaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!  I cannot hear the dogs; they and the fox
must all be lost in this infernal cavern.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;They
were too close up,&quot; said one of the guards, &quot;to have lost scent all
at once.  Besides, we should hear them
from one side or another.  They must, as
Biscarrat says, be in this grotto.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
then,&quot; said one of the young men, &quot;why don't they give tongue?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is strange!&quot; muttered another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
but,&quot; said a fourth, &quot;let us go into this grotto.  Does it happen to be forbidden we should
enter it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,&quot;
replied Biscarrat.  &quot;Only, as it
looks as dark as a wolf's mouth, we might break our necks in it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Witness
the dogs,&quot; said a guard, &quot;who seem to have broken theirs.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
the devil can have become of them?&quot; asked the young men in chorus.  And every master called his dog by his name,
whistled to him in his favorite mode, without a single one replying to either
call or whistle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is perhaps an enchanted grotto,&quot; said Biscarrat; &quot;let us
see.&quot;  And, jumping from his horse,
he made a step into the grotto.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Stop!
stop!  I will accompany you,&quot; said
one of the guards, on seeing Biscarrat disappear in the shades of the cavern's
mouth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,&quot;
replied Biscarrat, &quot;there must be something extraordinary in the place -
don't let us risk ourselves all at once. 
If in ten minutes you do not hear of me, you can come in, but not all at
once.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Be
it so,&quot; said the young man, who, besides, did not imagine that Biscarrat
ran much risk in the enterprise, &quot;we will wait for you.&quot;  And without dismounting from their horses,
they formed a circle round the grotto.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Biscarrat
entered then alone, and advanced through the darkness till he came in contact
with the muzzle of Porthos's musket. 
The resistance which his chest met with astonished him; he naturally
raised his hand and laid hold of the icy barrel.  At the same instant, Yves lifted a knife against the young man,
which was about to fall upon him with all force of a Breton's arm, when the
iron wrist of Porthos stopped it half-way. 
Then, like low muttering thunder, his voice growled in the darkness,
&quot;I will not have him killed!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Biscarrat
found himself between a protection and a threat, the one almost as terrible as
the other.  However brave the young man
might be, he could not prevent a cry escaping him, which Aramis immediately
suppressed by placing a handkerchief over his mouth.  &quot;Monsieur de Biscarrat,&quot; said he, in a low voice,
&quot;we mean you no harm, and you must know that if you have recognized us;
but, at the first word, the first groan, the first whisper, we shall be forced
to kill you as we have killed your dogs.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
I recognize you, gentlemen,&quot; said the officer, in a low voice.  &quot;But why are you here - what are you
doing, here?  Unfortunate men!  I thought you were in the fort.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
you, monsieur, you were to obtain conditions for us, I think?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
did all I was able, messieurs, but - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
what?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
there are positive orders.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
kill us?&quot;<br>                Biscarrat made no
reply.  It would have cost him too much
to speak of the cord to gentlemen. 
Aramis understood the silence of the prisoner.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
Biscarrat,&quot; said he, &quot;you would be already dead if we had not regard
for your youth and our ancient association with your father; but you may yet
escape from the place by swearing that you will not tell your companions what
you have seen.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will not only swear that I will not speak of it,&quot; said Biscarrat,
&quot;but I still further swear that I will do everything in the world to
prevent my companions from setting foot in the grotto.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Biscarrat!  Biscarrat!&quot; cried several voices from
the outside, coming like a whirlwind into the cave.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Reply,&quot;
said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Here
I am!&quot; cried Biscarrat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Now,
begone; we depend on your loyalty.&quot; 
And he left his hold of the young man, who hastily returned towards the
light.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Biscarrat!  Biscarrat!&quot; cried the voices, still
nearer.  And the shadows of several
human forms projected into the interior of the grotto.  Biscarrat rushed to meet his friends in
order to stop them, and met them just as they were adventuring into the
cave.  Aramis and Porthos listened with
the intense attention of men whose life depends upon a breath of air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
oh!&quot; exclaimed one of the guards, as he came to the light, &quot;how pale
you are!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Pale!&quot;
cried another; &quot;you ought to say corpse-color.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I!&quot;
said the young man, endeavoring to collect his faculties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
the name of Heaven! what has happened?&quot; exclaimed all the voices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have not a drop of blood in your veins, my poor friend,&quot; said one of them,
laughing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Messieurs,
it is serious,&quot; said another, &quot;he is going to faint; does any one of
you happen to have any salts?&quot;  And
they all laughed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This
hail of jests fell round Biscarrat's ears like musket-balls in a <i>mêlée</i>. 
He recovered himself amidst a deluge of interrogations.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
do you suppose I have seen?' asked he. 
&quot;I was too hot when I entered the grotto, and I have been struck
with a chill.  That is all.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
the dogs, the dogs; have you seen them again - did you see anything of them -
do you know anything about them?&quot;<br>                &quot;I suppose they have
got out some other way.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Messieurs,&quot;
said one of the young men, &quot;there is in that which is going on, in the
paleness and silence of our friend, a mystery which Biscarrat will not, or
cannot reveal.  Only, and this is
certain, Biscarrat has seen something in the grotto.  Well, for my part, I am very curious to see what it is, even if
it is the devil!  To the grotto!
messieurs, to the grotto!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
the grotto!&quot; repeated all the voices. 
And the echo of the cavern carried like a menace to Porthos and Aramis,
&quot;To the grotto! to the grotto!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Biscarrat
threw himself before his companions. 
&quot;Messieurs! messieurs!&quot; cried he, &quot;in the name of Heaven!
do not go in!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
what is there so terrific in the cavern?&quot; asked several at once.  &quot;Come, speak, Biscarrat.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Decidedly,
it is the devil he has seen,&quot; repeated he who had before advanced that
hypothesis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,&quot;
said another, &quot;if he has seen him, he need not be selfish; he may as well
let us have a look at him in turn.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Messieurs!
messieurs!  I beseech you,&quot; urged
Biscarrat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nonsense!  Let us pass!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Messieurs,
I implore you not to enter!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
you went in yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Then
one of the officers, who - of a riper age than the others - had till this time
remained behind, and had said nothing, advanced.  &quot;Messieurs,&quot; said he, with a calmness which contrasted
with the animation of the young men, &quot;there is in there some person, or
something, that is not the devil; but which, whatever it may be, has had
sufficient power to silence our dogs. 
We must discover who this some one is, or what this something is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Biscarrat
made a last effort to stop his friends, but it was useless.  In vain he threw himself before the rashest;
in vain he clung to the rocks to bar the passage; the crowd of young men rushed
into the cave, in the steps of the officer who had spoken last, but who had
sprung in first, sword in hand, to face the unknown danger.  Biscarrat, repulsed by his friends, unable
to accompany them, without passing in the eyes of Porthos and Aramis for a
traitor and a perjurer, with painfully attentive ear and unconsciously
supplicating hands leaned against the rough side of a rock which he thought
must be exposed to the fire of the musketeers. 
As to the guards, they penetrated further and further, with exclamations
that grew fainter as they advanced.  All
at once, a discharge of musketry, growling like thunder, exploded in the
entrails of the vault.  Two or three
balls were flattened against the rock on which Biscarrat was leaning.  At the same instant, cries, shrieks,
imprecations burst forth, and the little troop of gentlemen reappeared - some
pale, some bleeding - all enveloped in a cloud of smoke, which the outer air
seemed to suck from the depths of the cavern. 
&quot;Biscarrat! 
Biscarrat!&quot; cried the fugitives, &quot;you knew there was an
ambuscade in that cavern, and you did not warn us!  Biscarrat, you are the cause that four of us are murdered
men!  Woe be to you, Biscarrat!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are the cause of my being wounded unto death,&quot; said one of the young men,
letting a gush of scarlet life-blood vomit in his palm, and spattering it into
Biscarrat's livid face.  &quot;My blood
be on your head!&quot;  And he rolled in
agony at the feet of the young man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,
at least, tell us who is there?&quot; cried several furious voices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Biscarrat
remained silent.  &quot;Tell us, or
die!&quot; cried the wounded man, raising himself upon one knee, and lifting
towards his companion an arm bearing a useless sword.  Biscarrat rushed towards him, opening his breast for the blow,
but the wounded man fell back not to rise again, uttering a groan which was his
last.  Biscarrat, with hair on end,
haggard eyes, and bewildered head, advanced towards the interior of the cavern,
saying, &quot;You are right.  Death to
me, who have allowed my comrades to be assassinated.  I am a worthless wretch!&quot; 
And throwing away his sword, for he wished to die without defending
himself, he rushed head foremost into the cavern.  The others followed him. 
The eleven who remained out of sixteen imitated his example; but they
did not go further than the first.  A
second discharge laid five upon the icy sand; and as it was impossible to see
whence this murderous thunder issued, the others fell back with a terror that
can be better imagined than described. 
But, far from flying, as the others had done, Biscarrat remained safe
and sound, seated on a fragment of rock, and waited.  There were only six gentlemen left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Seriously,&quot;
said one of the survivors, &quot;is it the devil?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Ma foi!</i> it is much worse,&quot; said
another.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ask
Biscarrat, he knows.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Where
is Biscarrat?&quot;  The young men
looked round them, and saw that Biscarrat did not answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
is dead!&quot; said two or three voices.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
no!&quot; replied another, &quot;I saw him through the smoke, sitting quietly
on a rock.  He is in the cavern; he is
waiting for us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
must know who are there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;And how should he know
them?&quot;<br>
&quot;He was taken prisoner by the rebels.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is true.  Well! let us call him, and learn from him
whom we have to deal with.&quot;  And
all voices shouted, &quot;Biscarrat! 
Biscarrat!&quot;  But Biscarrat
did not answer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Good!&quot; said the officer
who had shown so much coolness in the affair. 
&quot;We have no longer any need of him; here are reinforcements
coming.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In fact, a company of guards, left
in the rear by their officers, whom the ardor of the chase had carried away -
from seventy-five to eighty men - arrived in good order, led by their captain
and the first lieutenant.  The five
officers hastened to meet their soldiers; and, in language the eloquence of
which may be easily imagined, they related the adventure, and asked for
aid.  The captain interrupted them.  &quot;Where are your companions?&quot;
demanded he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Dead!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;But there were sixteen of
you!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ten are dead.  Biscarrat is in the cavern, and we are five.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Biscarrat is a
prisoner?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Probably.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No, for here he is -
look.&quot;  In fact, Biscarrat appeared
at the opening of the grotto.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He is making a sign to come
on,&quot; said the officer.  &quot;Come
on!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Come on!&quot; cried all the
troop.  And they advanced to meet
Biscarrat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said the
captain, addressing Biscarrat, &quot;I am assured that you know who the men are
in that grotto, and who make such a desperate defense.  In the king's name I command you to declare
what you know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Captain,&quot; said
Biscarrat, &quot;you have no need to command me.  My word has been restored to me this very instant; and I came in
the name of these men.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;To tell me who they
are?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;To tell you they are
determined to defend themselves to the death, unless you grant them
satisfactory terms.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;How many are there of them,
then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;There are two,&quot; said
Biscarrat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;There are two - and want to
impose conditions upon us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;There are two, and they have
already killed ten of our men.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What sort of people are they
- giants?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Worse than that.  Do you remember the history of the Bastion
Saint-Gervais, captain?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes; where four musketeers
held out against an army.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well, these are two of those
same musketeers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And their names?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;At that period they were
called Porthos and Aramis.  Now they are
styled M. d'Herblay and M. du Vallon.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And what interest have they
in all this?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It is they who were holding
Bell-Isle for M. Fouquet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>A murmur ran through the ranks of
the soldiers on hearing the two words &quot;Porthos and Aramis.&quot;  &quot;The musketeers! the musketeers!&quot;
repeated they.  And among all these
brave men, the idea that they were going to have a struggle against two of the
oldest glories of the French army, made a shiver, half enthusiasm, two-thirds
terror, run through them.  In fact,
those four names - D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis - were venerated
among all who wore a sword; as, in antiquity, the names of Hercules, Theseus,
Castor, and Pollux were venerated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Two men - and they have
killed ten in two discharges!  It is
impossible, Monsieur Biscarrat!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Eh! captain,&quot; replied
the latter, &quot;I do not tell you that they have not with them two or three
men, as the musketeers of the Bastion Saint-Gervais had two or three lackeys;
but, believe me, captain, I have seen these men, I have been taken prisoner by
them - I know they themselves alone are all-sufficient to destroy an
army.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That we shall see,&quot; said
the captain, &quot;and that in a moment, too. 
Gentlemen, attention!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>At this reply, no one stirred, and
all prepared to obey.  Biscarrat alone
risked a last attempt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said he, in a
low voice, &quot;be persuaded by me; let us pass on our way.  Those two men, those two lions you are going
to attack, will defend themselves to the death.  They have already killed ten of our men; they will kill double
the number, and end by killing themselves rather than surrender.  What shall we gain by fighting them?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;We shall gain the
consciousness, monsieur, of not having allowed eighty of the king's guards to
retire before two rebels.  If I listened
to your advice, monsieur, I should be a dishonored man; and by dishonoring
myself I should dishonor the army. 
Forward, my men!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>And he marched first as far as the
opening of the grotto.  There he
halted.  The object of this halt was to
give Biscarrat and his companions time to describe to him the interior of the
grotto.  Then, when he believed he had a
sufficient acquaintance with the place, he divided his company into three
bodies, which were to enter successively, keeping up a sustained fire in all
directions.  No doubt, in this attack
they would lose five more, perhaps ten; but, certainly, they must end by taking
the rebels, since there was no issue; and, at any rate, two men could not kill
eighty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Captain,&quot; said
Biscarrat, &quot;I beg to be allowed to march at the head of the first
platoon.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;So be it,&quot; replied the
captain; &quot;you have all the honor. 
I make you a present of it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Thanks!&quot; replied the
young man, with all the firmness of his race.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Take your sword, then.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I shall go as I am,
captain,&quot; said Biscarrat, &quot;for I do not go to kill, I go to be
killed.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>And placing himself at the head of
the first platoon, with head uncovered and arms crossed, - &quot;March,
gentlemen,&quot; said he.</p>

is time to pass to the other camp, and to describe at once the combatants and
the field of battle.  Aramis and Porthos
had gone to the grotto of Locmaria with the expectation of finding there their
canoe ready armed, as well as the three Bretons, their assistants; and they at
first hoped to make the bark pass through the little issue of the cavern,
concealing in that fashion both their labors and their flight.  The arrival of the fox and dogs obliged them
to remain concealed.  The grotto
extended the space of about a hundred <i>toises</i>,
to that little slope dominating a creek. 
Formerly a temple of the Celtic divinities, when Belle-Isle was still
called Kalonèse, this grotto had beheld more than one human sacrifice
accomplished in its mystic depths.  The
first entrance to the cavern was by a moderate descent, above which distorted
rocks formed a weird arcade; the interior, very uneven and dangerous from the
inequalities of the vault, was subdivided into several compartments, which
communicated with each other by means of rough and jagged steps, fixed right
and left, in uncouth natural pillars. 
At the third compartment the vault was so low, the passage so narrow,
that the bark would scarcely have passed without touching the side; nevertheless,
in moments of despair, wood softens and stone grows flexible beneath the human
will.  Such was the thought of Aramis,
when, after having fought the fight, he decided upon flight - a flight most
dangerous, since all the assailants were not dead; and that, admitting the
possibility of putting the bark to sea, they would have to fly in open day,
before the conquered, so interested on recognizing their small number, in
pursuing their conquerors.  When the two
discharges had killed ten men, Aramis, familiar with the windings of the
cavern, went to reconnoiter them one by one, and counted them, for the smoke
prevented seeing outside; and he immediately commanded that the canoe should be
rolled as far as the great stone, the closure of the liberating issue.  Porthos collected all his strength, took the
canoe in his arms, and raised it up, whilst the Bretons made it run rapidly
along the rollers.  They had descended
into the third compartment; they had arrived at the stone which walled the
outlet.  Porthos seized this gigantic
stone at its base, applied his robust shoulder, and gave a heave which made the
wall crack.  A cloud of dust fell from
the vault, with the ashes of ten thousand generations of sea birds, whose nests
stuck like cement to the rock.  At the
third shock the stone gave way, and oscillated for a minute.  Porthos, placing his back against the
neighboring rock, made an arch with his foot, which drove the block out of the
calcareous masses which served for hinges and cramps.  The stone fell, and daylight was visible, brilliant, radiant, flooding
the cavern through the opening, and the blue sea appeared to the delighted
Bretons.  They began to lift the bark
over the barricade.  Twenty more <i>toises</i>, and it would glide into the
ocean.  It was during this time that the
company arrived, was drawn up by the captain, and disposed for either an
escalade or an assault.  Aramis watched
over everything, to favor the labors of his friends.  He saw the reinforcements, counted the men, and convinced himself
at a single glance of the insurmountable peril to which fresh combat would
expose them.  To escape by sea, at the
moment the cavern was about to be invaded, was impossible.  In fact, the daylight which had just been
admitted to the last compartments had exposed to the soldiers the bark being
rolled towards the sea, the two rebels within musket-shot; and one of their
discharges would riddle the boat if it did not kill the navigators.  Besides, allowing everything, - if the bark
escaped with the men on board of it, how could the alarm be suppressed - how could
notice to the royal lighters be prevented? 
What could hinder the poor canoe, followed by sea and watched from the
shore, from succumbing before the end of the day?  Aramis, digging his hands into his gray hair with rage, invoked
the assistance of God and the assistance of the demons.  Calling to Porthos, who was doing more work
than all the rollers - whether of flesh or wood - &quot;My friend,&quot; said
he, &quot;our adversaries have just received a reinforcement.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah,
ah!&quot; said Porthos, quietly, &quot;what is to be done, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
recommence the combat,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;is hazardous.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,&quot;
said Porthos, &quot;for it is difficult to suppose that out of two, one should
not be killed; and certainly, if one of us was killed, the other would get
himself killed also.&quot;  Porthos
spoke these words with that heroic nature which, with him, grew grander with
necessity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
felt it like a spur to his heart. 
&quot;We shall neither of us be killed if you do what I tell you, friend
Porthos.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Tell
me what?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;These
people are coming down into the grotto.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
could kill about fifteen of them, but no more.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
many are there in all?&quot; asked Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;They
have received a reinforcement of seventy-five men.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Seventy-five
and five, eighty.  Ah!&quot; sighed
Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
they fire all at once they will riddle us with balls.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Certainly
they will.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Without
reckoning,&quot; added Aramis, &quot;that the detonation might occasion a
collapse of the cavern.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ay,&quot;
said Porthos, &quot;a piece of falling rock just now grazed my shoulder.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
see, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
it is nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
must determine upon something quickly. 
Our Bretons are going to continue to roll the canoe towards the
sea.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
well.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
two will keep the powder, the balls, and the muskets here.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
only two, my dear Aramis - we shall never fire three shots together,&quot; said
Porthos, innocently, &quot;the defense by musketry is a bad one.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Find
a better, then.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have found one,&quot; said the giant, eagerly; &quot;I will place myself in
ambuscade behind the pillar with this iron bar, and invisible, unattackable, if
they come in floods, I can let my bar fall upon their skulls, thirty times in a
minute.  <i>Hein!</i> what do you think of the project?  You smile!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Excellent,
dear friend, perfect!  I approve it
greatly; only you will frighten them, and half of them will remain outside to
take us by famine.  What we want, my
good friend, is the entire destruction of the troop.  A single survivor encompasses our ruin.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
are right, my friend, but how can we attract them, pray?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;By
not stirring, my good Porthos.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!
we won't stir, then; but when they are all together - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then
leave it to me, I have an idea.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;If
it is so, and your idea proves a good one - and your idea is most likely to be
good - I am satisfied.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
your ambuscade, Porthos, and count how many enter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
you, what will you do?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Don't
trouble yourself about me; I have a task to perform.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
think I hear shouts.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is they!  To your post.  Keep within reach of my voice and
hand.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos
took refuge in the second compartment, which was in darkness, absolutely
black.  Aramis glided into the third;
the giant held in his hand an iron bar of about fifty pounds weight.  Porthos handled this lever, which had been
used in rolling the bark, with marvelous facility.  During this time, the Bretons had pushed the bark to the
beach.  In the further and lighter
compartment, Aramis, stooping and concealed, was busy with some mysterious
maneuver.  A command was given in a loud
voice.  It was the last order of the
captain commandant.  Twenty-five men
jumped from the upper rocks into the first compartment of the grotto, and
having taken their ground, began to fire. 
The echoes shrieked and barked, the hissing balls seemed actually to
rarefy the air, and then opaque smoke filled the vault.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
the left! to the left!&quot; cried Biscarrat, who, in his first assault, had
seen the passage to the second chamber, and who, animated by the smell of
powder, wished to guide his soldiers in that direction.  The troop, accordingly, precipitated
themselves to the left - the passage gradually growing narrower.  Biscarrat, with his hands stretched forward,
devoted to death, marched in advance of the muskets.  &quot;Come on! come on!&quot; exclaimed he, &quot;I see
daylight!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Strike,
Porthos!&quot; cried the sepulchral voice of Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos
breathed a heavy sigh - but he obeyed. 
The iron bar fell full and direct upon the head of Biscarrat, who was
dead before he had ended his cry.  Then
the formidable lever rose ten times in ten seconds, and made ten corpses.  The soldiers could see nothing; they heard
sighs and groans; they stumbled over dead bodies, but as they had no conception
of the cause of all this, they came forward jostling each other.  The implacable bar, still falling,
annihilated the first platoon, without a single sound to warn the second, which
was quietly advancing; only, commanded by the captain, the men had stripped a
fir, growing on the shore, and, with its resinous branches twisted together,
the captain had made a flambeau.  On
arriving at the compartment where Porthos, like the exterminating angel, had
destroyed all he touched, the first rank drew back in terror.  No firing had replied to that of the guards,
and yet their way was stopped by a heap of dead bodies - they literally walked
in blood.  Porthos was still behind his
pillar.  The captain, illumining with
trembling pine-torch this frightful carnage, of which he in vain sought the
cause, drew back towards the pillar behind which Porthos was concealed.  Then a gigantic hand issued from the shade,
and fastened on the throat of the captain, who uttered a stifle rattle; his
stretched-out arms beating the air, the torch fell and was extinguished in
blood.  A second after, the corpse of the
captain dropped close to the extinguished torch, and added another body to the
heap of dead which blocked up the passage. 
All this was effected as mysteriously as though by magic.  At hearing the rattling in the throat of the
captain, the soldiers who accompanied him had turned round, caught a glimpse of
his extended arms, his eyes starting from their sockets, and then the torch
fell and they were left in darkness. 
From an unreflective, instinctive, mechanical feeling, the lieutenant
cried:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Fire!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Immediately
a volley of musketry flamed, thundered, roared in the cavern, bringing down
enormous fragments from the vaults.  The
cavern was lighted for an instant by this discharge, and then immediately
returned to pitchy darkness rendered thicker by the smoke.  To this succeeded a profound silence, broken
only by the steps of the third brigade, now entering the cavern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>A</span>t
the moment when Porthos, more accustomed to the darkness than these men, coming
from open daylight, was looking round him to see if through this artificial
midnight Aramis were not making him some signal, he felt his arm gently
touched, and a voice low as a breath murmured in his ear, &quot;Come.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!&quot;
said Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Hush!&quot;
said Aramis, if possible, yet more softly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And amidst
the noise of the third brigade, which continued to advance, the imprecations of
the guards still left alive, the muffled groans of the dying, Aramis and
Porthos glided unseen along the granite walls of the cavern.  Aramis led Porthos into the last but one
compartment, and showed him, in a hollow of the rocky wall, a barrel of powder
weighing from seventy to eighty pounds, to which he had just attached a
fuse.  &quot;My friend,&quot; said he to
Porthos, &quot;you will take this barrel, the match of which I am going to set
fire to, and throw it amidst our enemies; can you do so?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Parbleu!</i>&quot; replied Porthos; and he
lifted the barrel with one hand. 
&quot;Light it!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Stop,&quot;
said Aramis, &quot;till they are all massed together, and then, my Jupiter,
hurl your thunderbolt among them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Light
it,&quot; repeated Porthos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;On
my part,&quot; continued Aramis, &quot;I will join our Bretons, and help them
to get the canoe to the sea.  I will
wait for you on the shore; launch it strongly, and hasten to us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Light
it,&quot; said Porthos, a third time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
do you understand me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Parbleu!</i>&quot; said Porthos again, with
laughter that he did not even attempt to restrain, &quot;when a thing is
explained to me I understand it; begone, and give me the light.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
gave the burning match to Porthos, who held out his arm to him, his hands being
engaged.  Aramis pressed the arm of
Porthos with both his hands, and fell back to the outlet of the cavern where
the three rowers awaited him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos,
left alone, applied the spark bravely to the match.  The spark - a feeble spark, first principle of conflagration -
shone in the darkness like a glow-worm, then was deadened against the match
which it set fire to, Porthos enlivening the flame with his breath.  The smoke was a little dispersed, and by the
light of the sparkling match objects might, for two seconds, be
distinguished.  It was a brief but
splendid spectacle, that of this giant, pale, bloody, his countenance lighted
by the fire of the match burning in surrounding darkness!  The soldiers saw him, they saw the barrel he
held in his hand - they at once understood what was going to happen.  Then, these men, already choked with horror
at the sight of what had been accomplished, filled with terror at thought of
what was about to be accomplished, gave out a simultaneous shriek of
agony.  Some endeavored to fly, but they
encountered the third brigade, which barred their passage; others mechanically
took aim and attempted to fire their discharged muskets; others fell
instinctively upon their knees.  Two or
three officers cried out to Porthos to promise him his liberty if he would
spare their lives.  The lieutenant of
the third brigade commanded his men to fire; but the guards had before them
their terrified companions, who served as a living rampart for Porthos.  We have said that the light produced by the
spark and the match did not last more than two seconds; but during these two
seconds this is what it illumined: in the first place, the giant, enlarged in
the darkness; then, at ten paces off, a heap of bleeding bodies, crushed,
mutilated, in the midst of which some still heaved in the last agony, lifting
the mass as a last respiration inflating the sides of some old monster dying in
the night.  Every breath of Porthos,
thus vivifying the match, sent towards this heap of bodies a phosphorescent
aura, mingled with streaks of purple. 
In addition to this principal group scattered about the grotto, as the
chances of death or surprise had stretched them, isolated bodies seemed to be
making ghastly exhibitions of their gaping wounds.  Above ground, bedded in pools of blood, rose, heavy and
sparkling, the short, thick pillars of the cavern, of which the strongly marked
shades threw out the luminous particles. 
And all this was seen by the tremulous light of a match attached to a
barrel of powder, that is to say, a torch which, whilst throwing a light on the
dead past, showed death to come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As I
have said, this spectacle did not last above two seconds.  During this short space of time an officer
of the third brigade got together eight men armed with muskets, and, through an
opening, ordered them to fire upon Porthos. 
But they who received the order to fire trembled so that three guards
fell by the discharge, and the five remaining balls hissed on to splinter the
vault, plow the ground, or indent the pillars of the cavern.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                A burst
of laughter replied to this volley; then the arm of the giant swung round; then
was seen whirling through the air, like a falling star, the train of fire.  The barrel, hurled a distance of thirty
feet, cleared the barricade of dead bodies, and fell amidst a group of
shrieking soldiers, who threw themselves on their faces.  The officer had followed the brilliant train
in the air; he endeavored to precipitate himself upon the barrel and tear out
the match before it reached the powder it contained.  Useless!  The air had made
the flame attached to the conductor more active; the match, which at rest might
have burnt five minutes, was consumed in thirty seconds, and the infernal work
exploded.  Furious vortices of sulphur
and nitre, devouring shoals of fire which caught every object, the terrible
thunder of the explosion, this is what the second which followed disclosed in
that cavern of horrors.  The rocks split
like planks of deal beneath the axe.  A
jet of fire, smoke, and <i>débris</i> sprang
from the middle of the grotto, enlarging as it mounted.  The large walls of silex tottered and fell
upon the sand, and the sand itself, an instrument of pain when launched from
its hard bed, riddled the faces with its myriad cutting atoms.  Shrieks, imprecations, human life, dead
bodies - all were engulfed in one terrific crash.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
three first compartments became one sepulchral sink into which fell grimly
back, in the order of their weight, every vegetable, mineral, or human
fragment.  Then the lighter sand and ash
came down in turn, stretching like a winding sheet and smoking over the dismal
scene.  And now, in this burning tomb,
this subterranean volcano, seek the king's guards with their blue coats laced
with silver.  Seek the officers,
brilliant in gold, seek for the arms upon which they depended for their
defense.  One single man has made of all
of those things a chaos more confused, more shapeless, more terrible than the
chaos which existed before the creation of the world.  There remained nothing of the three compartments - nothing by
which God could have recognized His handiwork. 
As for Porthos, after having hurled the barrel of powder amidst his
enemies, he had fled, as Aramis had directed him to do, and had gained the last
compartment, into which air, light, and sunshine penetrated through the
opening.  Scarcely had he turned the
angle which separated the third compartment from the fourth when he perceived
at a hundred paces from him the bark dancing on the waves.  There were his friends, there liberty, there
life and victory.  Six more of his
formidable strides, and he would be out of the vault; out of the vault! a dozen
of his vigorous leaps and he would reach the canoe.  Suddenly he felt his knees give way; his knees seemed powerless,
his legs to yield beneath him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
oh!&quot; murmured he, &quot;there is my weakness seizing me again!  I can walk no further!  What is this?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
perceived him through the opening, and unable to conceive what could induce him
to stop thus - &quot;Come on, Porthos! come on,&quot; he cried; &quot;come
quickly!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!&quot;
replied the giant, making an effort that contorted every muscle of his body -
&quot;oh! but I cannot.&quot;  While
saying these words, he fell upon his knees, but with his mighty hands he clung
to the rocks, and raised himself up again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Quick!
quick!&quot; repeated Aramis, bending forward towards the shore, as if to draw
Porthos towards him with his arms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Here
I am,&quot; stammered Porthos, collecting all his strength to make one step
more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
the name of Heaven!  Porthos, make
haste! the barrel will blow up!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Make
haste, monseigneur!&quot; shouted the Bretons to Porthos, who was floundering
as in a dream.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                But
there was no time; the explosion thundered, earth gaped, the smoke which hurled
through the clefts obscured the sky; the sea flowed back as though driven by
the blast of flame which darted from the grotto as if from the jaws of some
gigantic fiery chimera; the reflux took the bark out twenty <i>toises</i>; the solid rocks cracked to their
base, and separated like blocks beneath the operation of the wedge; a portion
of the vault was carried up towards heaven, as if it had been built of
cardboard; the green and blue and topaz conflagration and black lava of
liquefactions clashed and combated an instant beneath a majestic dome of smoke;
then oscillated, declined, and fell successively the mighty monoliths of rock
which the violence of the explosion had not been able to uproot from the bed of
ages; they bowed to each other like grave and stiff old men, then prostrating
themselves, lay down forever in their dusty tomb.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                This
frightful shock seemed to restore Porthos the strength that he had lost; he
arose, a giant among granite giants. 
But at the moment he was flying between the double hedge of granite
phantoms, these latter, which were no longer supported by the corresponding
links, began to roll and totter round our Titan, who looked as if precipitated
from heaven amidst rocks which he had just been launching.  Porthos felt the very earth beneath his feet
becoming jelly-tremulous.  He stretched
both hands to repulse the falling rocks. 
A gigantic block was held back by each of his extended arms.  He bent his head, and a third granite mass
sank between his shoulders.  For an
instant the power of Porthos seemed about to fail him, but this new Hercules
united all his force, and the two walls of the prison in which he was buried
fell back slowly and gave him place. 
For an instant he appeared, in this frame of granite, like the angel of
chaos, but in pushing back the lateral rocks, he lost his point of support, for
the monolith which weighed upon his shoulders, and the boulder, pressing upon
him with all its weight, brought the giant down upon his knees.  The lateral rocks, for an instant pushed back,
drew together again, and added their weight to the ponderous mass which would
have been sufficient to crush ten men. 
The hero fell without a groan - he fell while answering Aramis with
words of encouragement and hope, for, thanks to the powerful arch of his hands,
for an instant he believed that, like Enceladus, he would succeed in shaking
off the triple load.  But by degrees
Aramis beheld the block sink; the hands, strung for an instant, the arms
stiffened for a last effort, gave way, the extended shoulders sank, wounded and
torn, and the rocks continued to gradually collapse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Porthos!  Porthos!&quot; cried Aramis, tearing his
hair.  &quot;Porthos! where are
you?  Speak!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Here,
here,&quot; murmured Porthos, with a voice growing evidently weaker,
&quot;patience! patience!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Scarcely
had he pronounced these words, when the impulse of the fall augmented the
weight; the enormous rock sank down, pressed by those others which sank in from
the sides, and, as it were, swallowed up Porthos in a sepulcher of badly
jointed stones.  On hearing the dying
voice of his friend, Aramis had sprung to land.  Two of the Bretons followed him, with each a lever in his hand -
one being sufficient to take care of the bark. 
The dying rattle of the valiant gladiator guided them amidst the
ruins.  Aramis, animated, active and
young as at twenty, sprang towards the triple mass, and with his hands,
delicate as those of a woman, raised by a miracle of strength the corner-stone
of this great granite grave.  Then he
caught a glimpse, through the darkness of that charnel-house, of the still
brilliant eye of his friend, to whom the momentary lifting of the mass restored
a momentary respiration.  The two men
came rushing up, grasped their iron levers, united their triple strength, not
merely to raise it, but sustain it.  All
was useless.  They gave way with cries
of grief, and the rough voice of Porthos, seeing them exhaust themselves in a
useless struggle, murmured in an almost cheerful tone those supreme words which
came to his lips with the last respiration, &quot;Too heavy!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After
which his eyes darkened and closed, his face grew ashy pale, the hands
whitened, and the colossus sank quite down, breathing his last sigh.  With him sank the rock, which, even in his
dying agony he had still held up.  The
three men dropped the levers, which rolled upon the tumulary stone.  Then, breathless, pale, his brow covered
with sweat, Aramis listened, his breast oppressed, his heart ready to break.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Nothing
more.  The giant slept the eternal
sleep, in the sepulcher which God had built about him to his measure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>A</span>ramis,
silent and sad as ice, trembling like a timid child, arose shivering from the
stone.  A Christian does not walk on
tombs.  But, though capable of standing,
he was not capable of walking.  It might
be said that something of dead Porthos had just died within him.  His Bretons surrounded him; Aramis yielded
to their kind exertions, and the three sailors, lifting him up, carried him to
the canoe.  Then, having laid him down
upon the bench near the rudder, they took to their oars, preferring this to
hoisting sail, which might betray them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                On all
that leveled surface of the ancient grotto of Locmaria, one single hillock
attracted their eyes.  Aramis never
removed his from it; and, at a distance out in the sea, in proportion as the
shore receded, that menacing proud mass of rock seemed to draw itself up, as
formerly Porthos used to draw himself up, raising a smiling, yet invincible
head towards heaven, like that of his dear old honest valiant friend, the
strongest of the four, yet the first dead. 
Strange destiny of these men of brass! 
The most simple of heart allied to the most crafty; strength of body
guided by subtlety of mind; and in the decisive moment, when vigor alone could
save mind and body, a stone, a rock, a vile material weight, triumphed over
manly strength, and falling upon the body, drove out the mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Worthy
Porthos! born to help other men, always ready to sacrifice himself for the
safety of the weak, as if God had only given him strength for that purpose; when
dying he only thought he was carrying out the conditions of his compact with
Aramis, a compact, however, which Aramis alone had drawn up, and which Porthos
had only known to suffer by its terrible solidarity.  Noble Porthos! of what good now are thy châteaux overflowing with
sumptuous furniture, forests overflowing with game, lakes overflowing with
fish, cellars overflowing with wealth! 
Of what service to thee now thy lackeys in brilliant liveries, and in
the midst of them Mousqueton, proud of the power delegated by thee!  Oh, noble Porthos! careful heaper-up of
treasure, was it worth while to labor to sweeten and gild life, to come upon a
desert shore, surrounded by the cries of seagulls, and lay thyself, with broken
bones, beneath a torpid stone?  Was it
worth while, in short, noble Porthos, to heap so much gold, and not have even
the distich of a poor poet engraven upon thy monument?  Valiant Porthos!  he still, without doubt, sleeps, lost, forgotten, beneath the
rock the shepherds of the heath take for the gigantic abode of a <i>dolmen</i>. 
And so many twining branches, so many mosses, bent by the bitter wind of
ocean, so many lichens solder thy sepulcher to earth, that no passers-by will
imagine such a block of granite could ever have been supported by the shoulders
of one man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis,
still pale, still icy-cold, his heart upon his lips, looked, even till, with
the last ray of daylight, the shore faded on the horizon.  Not a word escaped him, not a sigh rose from
his deep breast.  The superstitious
Bretons looked upon him, trembling. 
Such silence was not that of a man, it was the silence of a statue.  In the meantime, with the first gray lines
that lighted up the heavens, the canoe hoisted its little sail, which, swelling
with the kisses of the breeze, and carrying them rapidly from the coast, made
bravest way towards Spain, across the dreaded Gulf of Gascony, so rife with
storms.  But scarcely half an hour after
the sail had been hoisted, the rowers became inactive, reclining on their
benches, and, making an eye-shade with their hands, pointed out to each other a
white spot which appeared on the horizon as motionless as a gull rocked by the
viewless respiration of the waves.  But
that which might have appeared motionless to ordinary eyes was moving at a quick
rate to the experienced eye of the sailor; that which appeared stationary upon
the ocean was cutting a rapid way through it. 
For some time, seeing the profound torpor in which their master was
plunged, they did not dare to rouse him, and satisfied themselves with
exchanging their conjectures in whispers. 
Aramis, in fact, so vigilant, so active - Aramis, whose eye, like that
of the lynx, watched without ceasing, and saw better by night than by day -
Aramis seemed to sleep in this despair of soul.  An hour passed thus, during which daylight gradually disappeared,
but during which also the sail in view gained so swiftly on the bark, that
Goenne, one of the three sailors, ventured to say aloud:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur,
we are being chased!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
made no reply; the ship still gained upon them.  Then, of their own accord, two of the sailors, by the direction
of the patron Yves, lowered the sail, in order that that single point upon the
surface of the waters should cease to be a guide to the eye of the enemy
pursuing them.  On the part of the ship
in sight, on the contrary, two more small sails were run up at the extremities
of the masts.  Unfortunately, it was the
time of the finest and longest days of the year, and the moon, in all her
brilliancy, succeeded inauspicious daylight. 
The <i>balancelle</i>, which was
pursuing the little bark before the wind, had then still half an hour of
twilight, and a whole night almost as light as day.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur!
monseigneur! we are lost!&quot; said the captain.  &quot;Look! they see us plainly, though we have lowered
sail.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is not to be wondered at,&quot; murmured one of the sailors, &quot;since they
say that, by the aid of the devil, the Paris-folk have fabricated instruments
with which they see as well at a distance as near, by night as well as by day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
took a telescope from the bottom of the boat, focussed it silently, and passing
it to the sailor, &quot;Here,&quot; said he, &quot;look!&quot;  The sailor hesitated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Don't
be alarmed,&quot; said the bishop, &quot;there is no sin in it; and if there is
any sin, I will take it on myself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
sailor lifted the glass to his eye, and uttered a cry.  He believed that the vessel, which appeared
to be distant about cannon-shot, had at a single bound cleared the whole
distance.  But, on withdrawing the
instrument from his eye, he saw that, except the way which the <i>balancelle</i> had been able to make during
that brief instant, it was still at the same distance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;So,&quot;
murmured the sailor, &quot;they can see us as we see them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;They
see us,&quot; said Aramis, and sank again into impassibility.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What!
- they see us!&quot; said Yves. 
&quot;Impossible!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
captain, look yourself,&quot; said the sailor. 
And he passed him the glass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur
assures me that the devil has nothing to do with this?&quot; asked Yves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
skipper lifted the glass to his eye. 
&quot;Oh! monseigneur,&quot; said he, &quot;it is a miracle - there they
are; it seems as if I were going to touch them.  Twenty-five men at least! 
Ah!  I see the captain
forward.  He holds a glass like this,
and is looking at us.  Ah! he turns
round, and gives an order; they are rolling a piece of cannon forward - they
are loading it - pointing it.  <i>Miséricorde!</i> they are firing at
us!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And by
a mechanical movement, the skipper put aside the telescope, and the pursuing
ship, relegated to the horizon, appeared again in its true aspect.  The vessel was still at the distance of
nearly a league, but the maneuver sighted thus was not less real.  A light cloud of smoke appeared beneath the
sails, more blue than they, and spreading like a flower opening; then, at about
a mile from the little canoe, they saw the ball take the crown off two or three
waves, dig a white furrow in the sea, and disappear at the end of it, as
inoffensive as the stone with which, in play, a boy makes ducks and drakes.  It was at once a menace and a warning.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is to be done?&quot; asked the patron.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;They
will sink us!&quot; said Goenne, &quot;give us absolution,
monseigneur!&quot;  And the sailors fell
on their knees before him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
forget that they can see you,&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is true!&quot; said the sailors, ashamed of their weakness.  &quot;Give us your orders, monseigneur, we
are prepared to die for you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
us wait,&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;How
- let us wait?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes;
do you not see, as you just now said, that if we endeavor to fly, they will
sink us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,
perhaps,&quot; the patron ventured to say, &quot;perhaps under cover of night,
we could escape them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!&quot;
said Aramis, &quot;they have, no doubt, Greek fire with which to lighten their
own course and ours likewise.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At the
same moment, as if the vessel was responsive to the appeal of Aramis, a second
cloud of smoke mounted slowly to the heavens, and from the bosom of that cloud
sparkled an arrow of flame, which described a parabola like a rainbow, and fell
into the sea, where it continued to burn, illuminating a space of a quarter of
a league in diameter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
Bretons looked at each other in terror. 
&quot;You see plainly,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;it will be better to
wait for them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The oars
dropped from the hands of the sailors, and the bark, ceasing to make way,
rocked motionless upon the summits of the waves.  Night came on, but still the ship drew nearer.  It might be imagined it redoubled its speed
with darkness.  From time to time, as a
vulture rears its head out of its nest, the formidable Greek fire darted from
its sides, and cast its flame upon the ocean like an incandescent
snowfall.  At last it came within
musket-shot.  All the men were on deck,
arms in hand; the cannoniers were at their guns, the matches burning.  It might be thought they were about to board
a frigate and to fight a crew superior in number to their own, not to attempt
the capture of a canoe manned by four people.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Surrender!&quot;
cried the commander of the <i>balancelle</i>,
with the aid of his speaking-trumpet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
sailors looked at Aramis.  Aramis made a
sign with his head.  Yves waved a white
cloth at the end of a gaff.  This was
like striking their flag.  The pursuer
came on like a race-horse.  It launched
a fresh Greek fire, which fell within twenty paces of the little canoe, and
threw a light upon them as white as sunshine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;At
the first sign of resistance,&quot; cried the commander of the <i>balancelle</i>, &quot;fire!&quot;  The soldiers brought their muskets to the
present.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Did
we not say we surrendered?&quot; said Yves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Alive,
alive, captain!&quot; cried one excited soldier, &quot;they must be taken
alive.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
yes - living,&quot; said the captain. 
Then turning towards the Bretons, &quot;Your lives are safe, my
friends!&quot; cried he, &quot;all but the Chevalier d'Herblay.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
stared imperceptibly.  For an instant
his eye was fixed upon the depths of the ocean, illumined by the last flashes
of the Greek fire, which ran along the sides of the waves, played on the crests
like plumes, and rendered still darker and more terrible the gulfs they
covered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you hear, monseigneur?&quot; said the sailors.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
are your orders?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Accept!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
you, monseigneur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
leaned still more forward, and dipped the ends of his long white fingers in the
green limpid waters of the sea, to which he turned with smiles as to a friend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Accept!&quot;
repeated he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
accept,&quot; repeated the sailors; &quot;but what security have we?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
word of a gentleman,&quot; said the officer. 
&quot;By my rank and by my name I swear that all except M. le Chevalier
d'Herblay shall have their lives spared. 
I am lieutenant of the king's frigate the 'Pomona,' and my name is Louis
Constant de Pressigny.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                With a
rapid gesture, Aramis - already bent over the side of the bark towards the sea
- drew himself up, and with a flashing eye, and a smile upon his lips,
&quot;Throw out the ladder, messieurs,&quot; said he, as if the command had
belonged to him.  He was obeyed.  When Aramis, seizing the rope ladder, walked
straight up to the commander, with a firm step, looked at him earnestly, made a
sign to him with his hand, a mysterious and unknown sign at sight of which the
officer turned pale, trembled, and bowed his head, the sailors were profoundly
astonished.  Without a word Aramis then
raised his hand to the eyes of the commander and showed him the collet of a
ring he wore on the ring-finger of his left hand.  And while making this sign Aramis, draped in cold and haughty
majesty, had the air of an emperor giving his hand to be kissed.  The commandant, who for a moment had raised
his head, bowed a second time with marks of the most profound respect.  Then stretching his hand out, in his turn,
towards the poop, that is to say, towards his own cabin, he drew back to allow
Aramis to go first.  The three Bretons,
who had come on board after their bishop, looked at each other, stupefied.  The crew were awed to silence.  Five minutes after, the commander called the
second lieutenant, who returned immediately, ordering the head to be put
towards Corunna.  Whilst this order was
being executed, Aramis reappeared upon the deck, and took a seat near the <i>bastingage</i>.  Night had fallen; the moon had not yet risen, yet Aramis looked
incessantly towards Belle-Isle.  Yves
then approached the captain, who had returned to take his post in the stern,
and said, in a low and humble voice, &quot;What course are we to follow,
captain?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
take what course monseigneur pleases,&quot; replied the officer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
passed the night leaning upon the <i>bastingage</i>.  Yves, on approaching him next morning,
remarked that &quot;the night must have been a very damp one, for the wood on
which the bishop's head had rested was soaked with dew.&quot;  Who knows? - that dew was, it may be, the
first tears that had ever fallen from the eyes of Aramis!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                What
epitaph would have been worth that, good Porthos? </p>

Nantes.  Irritation, with this vigorous man,

in about two hours; his majesty has been up all night.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
took his hat again, bowed to M. de Gesvres, and returned to his own
apartments.  He came back at half-past
nine, and was told that the king was at breakfast.  &quot;That will just suit me,&quot; said D'Artagnan.  &quot;I will talk to the king while he is
eating.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                M. de
Brienne reminded D'Artagnan that the king would not see any one at meal-time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,&quot;
said D'Artagnan, looking askant at Brienne, &quot;you do not know, perhaps,
monsieur, that I have the privilege of <i>entrée</i>
anywhere - and at any hour.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Brienne
took the captain's hand kindly, and said, &quot;Not at Nantes, dear Monsieur
d'Artagnan.  The king, in this journey,
has changed everything.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan,
a little softened, asked about what o'clock the king would have finished his
breakfast.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
don't know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Eh?
- don't know!  What does that mean?  You don't know how much time the king
devotes to eating?  It is generally an
hour; and, if we admit that the air of the Loire gives an additional appetite,
we will extend it to an hour and a half; that is enough, I think.  I will wait where I am.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
dear Monsieur d'Artagnan, the order of the day is not to allow any person to
remain in this corridor; I am on guard for that particular purpose.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
felt his anger mounting to his brain a second time.  He went out quickly, for fear of complicating the affair by a
display of premature ill-humor.  As soon
as he was out he began to reflect. 
&quot;The king,&quot; said he, &quot;will not receive me, that is
evident.  The young man is angry; he is
afraid, beforehand, of the words that I may speak to him.  Yes; but in the meantime Belle-Isle is
besieged, and my two friends by now probably taken or killed.  Poor Porthos!  As to Master Aramis, he is always full of resources, and I am
easy on his account.  But, no, no;
Porthos is not yet an invalid, nor is Aramis in his dotage.  The one with his arm, the other with his
imagination, will find work for his majesty's soldiers.  Who knows if these brave men may not get up
for the edification of his most Christian majesty a little bastion of
Saint-Gervais!  I don't despair of
it.  They have cannon and a
garrison.  And yet,&quot; continued
D'Artagnan, &quot;I don't know whether it would not be better to stop the
combat.  For myself alone I will not put
up with either surly looks or insults from the king; but for my friends I must
put up with everything.  Shall I go to
M. Colbert?  Now, there is a man I must
acquire the habit of terrifying.  I will
go to M. Colbert.&quot;  And D'Artagnan
set forward bravely to find M. Colbert, but was informed that he was working
with the king, at the castle of Nantes. 
&quot;Good!&quot; cried he, &quot;the times have come again in which I
measured my steps from De Tréville to the cardinal, from the cardinal to the
queen, from the queen to Louis XIII. 
Truly is it said that men, in growing old, become children again! - To
the castle, then!&quot;  He returned
thither.  M. de Lyonne was coming
out.  He gave D'Artagnan both hands, but
told him that the king had been busy all the preceding evening and all night,
and that orders had been given that no one should be admitted.  &quot;Not even the captain who takes the order?&quot;
cried D'Artagnan.  &quot;I think that is
rather too strong.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Not
even he,&quot; said M. de Lyonne.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Since
that is the case,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, wounded to the heart; &quot;since
the captain of the musketeers, who has always entered the king's chamber, is no
longer allowed to enter it, his cabinet, or his <i>salle-à-manger</i>, either the king is dead, or his captain is in
disgrace.  Do me the favor, then, M. de
Lyonne, who are in favor, to return and tell the king, plainly, I send him my
resignation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;D'Artagnan,
beware of what you are doing!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;For
friendship's sake, go!&quot; and he pushed him gently towards the cabinet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
I will go,&quot; said Lyonne.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
waited, walking about the corridor in no enviable mood.  Lyonne returned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
what did the king say?&quot; exclaimed D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
simply answered, ''Tis well,'&quot; replied Lyonne.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
it was well!&quot; said the captain, with an explosion.  &quot;That is to say, that he accepts
it?  Good!  Now, then, I am free!  I
am only a plain citizen, M. de Lyonne. 
I have the pleasure of bidding you good-bye!  Farewell, castle, corridor, ante-chamber! a <i>bourgeois</i>, about to breathe at liberty, takes his farewell of
you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
without waiting longer, the captain sprang from the terrace down the staircase,
where he had picked up the fragments of Gourville's letter.  Five minutes after, he was at the hostelry,
where, according to the custom of all great officers who have lodgings at the
castle, he had taken what was called his city-chamber.  But when he arrived there, instead of throwing
off his sword and cloak, he took his pistols, put his money into a large
leather purse, sent for his horses from the castle-stables, and gave orders
that would ensure their reaching Vannes during the night.  Everything went on according to his
wishes.  At eight o'clock in the
evening, he was putting his foot in the stirrup, when M. de Gesvres appeared,
at the head of twelve guards, in front of the hostelry.  D'Artagnan saw all from the corner of his
eye; he could not fail seeing thirteen men and thirteen horses.  But he feigned not to observe anything, and
was about to put his horse in motion. 
Gesvres rode up to him. 
&quot;Monsieur d'Artagnan!&quot; said he, aloud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah,
Monsieur de Gesvres! good evening!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;One
would say you were getting on horseback.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;More
than that, - I am mounted, - as you see.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is fortunate I have met with you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Were
you looking for me, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;On
the part of the king, I will wager?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;As
I, three days ago, went in search of M. Fouquet?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Nonsense!
 It is of no use being over-delicate
with me; that is all labor lost.  Tell
me at once you are come to arrest me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
arrest you? - Good heavens! no.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why
do you come to accost me with twelve horsemen at your heels, then?&quot;<br>                &quot;I am making my
round.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
isn't bad!  And so you pick me up in
your round, eh?&quot;<br>                &quot;I don't pick you up;
I meet with you, and I beg you to come with me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Where?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Good!&quot;
said D'Artagnan, with a bantering air; &quot;the king is disengaged.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;For
Heaven's sake, captain,&quot; said M. de Gesvres, in a low voice to the
musketeer, &quot;do not compromise yourself! these men hear you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
laughed aloud, and replied:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;March!  People who are arrested are placed between
the six first guards and the six last.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
as I am not arresting you,&quot; said M. de Gesvres, &quot;you will march
behind, with me, if you please.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,&quot;
said D'Artagnan, &quot;that is very polite, duke, and you are right in being
so; for if ever I had had to make my rounds near your <i>chambre-de-ville</i>, I should have been courteous to you, I assure
you, on the word of a gentleman!  Now,
one favor more; what does the king want with me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
the king is furious!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Very
well! the king, who has thought it worth while to be angry, may take the
trouble to grow calm again; that is all. 
I shan't die of that, I will swear.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
but - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
- I shall be sent to keep company with unfortunate M. Fouquet.  <i>Mordioux!</i>  That is a gallant man, a worthy man!  We shall live very sociably together, I will
be sworn.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Here
we are at our place of destination,&quot; said the duke.  &quot;Captain, for Heaven's sake be calm
with the king!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
ah! you are playing the brave man with me, duke!&quot; said D'Artagnan,
throwing one of his defiant glances over Gesvres.  &quot;I have been told that you are ambitious of uniting your
guards with my musketeers.  This strikes
me as a splendid opportunity.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will take exceeding good care not to avail myself of it, captain.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
why not, pray?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
for many reasons - in the first place, for this: if I were to succeed you in
the musketeers after having arrested you - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
then you admit you have arrested me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
I <i>don't</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Say
met me, then.  So, you were saying <i>if</i> you were to succeed me after having
arrested me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
musketeers, at the first exercise with ball cartridges, would fire <i>my </i>way, by mistake.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
as to that I won't say; for the fellows <i>do</i>
love me a little.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Gesvres
made D'Artagnan pass in first, and took him straight to the cabinet where Louis
was waiting for his captain of the musketeers, and placed himself behind his
colleague in the ante-chamber.  The king
could be heard distinctly, speaking aloud to Colbert in the same cabinet where
Colbert might have heard, a few days before, the king speaking aloud with M.
d'Artagnan.  The guards remained as a
mounted picket before the principal gate; and the report was quickly spread
throughout the city that monsieur le capitaine of the musketeers had been
arrested by order of the king.  Then
these men were seen to be in motion, and as in the good old times of Louis
XIII. and M. de Tréville, groups were formed, and staircases were filled; vague
murmurs, issuing from the court below, came rolling to the upper stories, like
the distant moaning of the waves.  M. de
Gesvres became uneasy.  He looked at his
guards, who, after being interrogated by the musketeers who had just got among
their ranks, began to shun them with a manifestation of innocence.  D'Artagnan was certainly less disturbed by
all this than M. de Gesvres, the captain of the guards.  As soon as he entered, he seated himself on
the ledge of a window whence with his eagle glance he saw all that was going on
without the least emotion.  No step of
the progressive fermentation which had shown itself at the report of his arrest
escaped him.  He foresaw the very moment
the explosion would take place; and we know that his previsions were in general
correct.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
would be very whimsical,&quot; thought he, &quot;if, this evening, my
prætorians should make me king of France. 
How I should laugh!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                But, at
the height, all was stopped.  Guards,
musketeers, officers, soldiers, murmurs, uneasiness, dispersed, vanished, died
away; there was an end of menace and sedition. 
One word had calmed the waves. 
The king had desired Brienne to say, &quot;Hush, messieurs! you disturb
the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
sighed.  &quot;All is over!&quot; said
he; &quot;the musketeers of the present day are not those of his majesty Louis
XIII.  All is over!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
d'Artagnan, you are wanted in the ante-chamber of the king,&quot; proclaimed an
usher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>Chapter LIII:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>King Louis XIV.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he
king was seated in his cabinet, with his back turned towards the door of
entrance.  In front of him was a mirror,
in which, while turning over his papers, he could see at a glance those who
came in.  He did not take any notice of
the entrance of D'Artagnan, but spread above his letters and plans the large
silk cloth he used to conceal his secrets from the importunate.  D'Artagnan understood this by-play, and kept
in the background; so that at the end of a minute the king, who heard nothing,
and saw nothing save from the corner of his eye, was obliged to cry, &quot;Is
not M. d'Artagnan there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
am here, sire,&quot; replied the musketeer, advancing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
monsieur,&quot; said the king, fixing his pellucid eyes on D'Artagnan,
&quot;what have you to say to me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I,
sire!&quot; replied the latter, who watched the first blow of his adversary to
make a good retort; &quot;I have nothing to say to your majesty, unless it be
that you have caused me to be arrested, and here I am.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The king
was going to reply that he had not had D'Artagnan arrested, but any such
sentence appeared too much like an excuse, and he was silent.  D'Artagnan likewise preserved an obstinate
silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
at length resumed the king, &quot;what did I charge you to go and do at
Belle-Isle?  Tell me, if you
please.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
king while uttering these words looked intently at his captain.  Here D'Artagnan was fortunate; the king
seemed to place the game in his hands.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
believe,&quot; replied he, &quot;that your majesty does me the honor to ask
what I went to Belle-Isle to accomplish?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,
monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!
sire, I know nothing about it; it is not of me that question should be asked,
but of that infinite number of officers of all kinds, to whom have been given
innumerable orders of all kinds, whilst to me, head of the expedition, nothing
precise was said or stated in any form whatever.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
king was hurt: he showed it by his reply. 
&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said he, &quot;orders have only been given to such
as were judged faithful.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And,
therefore, I have been astonished, sire,&quot; retorted the musketeer,
&quot;that a captain like myself, who ranks with a maréchal of France, should
have found himself under the orders of five or six lieutenants or majors, good
to make spies of, possibly, but not at all fit to conduct a warlike
expedition.  It was upon this subject I
came to demand an explanation of your majesty, when I found the door closed
against me, which, the final insult offered to a brave man, has led me to quit
your majesty's service.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
replied the king, &quot;you still believe that you are living in an age when
kings were, as you complain of having been, under the orders and at the
discretion of their inferiors.  You seem
to forget that a king owes an account of his actions to none but God.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
forget nothing, sire,&quot; said the musketeer, wounded by this lesson.  &quot;Besides, I do not see in what an
honest man, when he asks of his king how he has ill-served him, offends
him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have ill-served me, monsieur, by siding with my enemies against me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
are your enemies, sire?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
men I sent you to fight.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Two
men the enemies of the whole of your majesty's army!  That is incredible.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have no power to judge of my will.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
I have to judge of my own friendships, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
who serves his friends does not serve his master.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
so well understand this, sire, that I have respectfully offered your majesty my
resignation.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
I have accepted it, monsieur,&quot; said the king.  &quot;Before being separated from you I was willing to prove to
you that I know how to keep my word.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Your
majesty has kept more than your word, for your majesty has had me
arrested,&quot; said D'Artagnan, with his cold, bantering air; &quot;you did
not promise me that, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
king would not condescend to perceive the pleasantry, and continued, seriously,
&quot;You see, monsieur, to what grave steps your disobedience forces me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
disobedience!&quot; cried D'Artagnan, red with anger.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is the mildest term that I can find,&quot; pursued the king.  &quot;My idea was to take and punish rebels;
was I bound to inquire whether these rebels were your friends or not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
I was,&quot; replied D'Artagnan. 
&quot;It was a cruelty on your majesty's part to send me to capture my
friends and lead them to your gibbets.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
was a trial I had to make, monsieur, of pretended servants, who eat my bread
and <i>should</i> defend my person.  The trial has succeeded ill, Monsieur
d'Artagnan.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;For
one bad servant your majesty loses,&quot; said the musketeer, with bitterness,
&quot;there are ten who, on that same day, go through a like ordeal.  Listen to me, sire; I am not accustomed to
that service.  Mine is a rebel sword
when I am required to do ill.  It was ill
to send me in pursuit of two men whose lives M. Fouquet, your majesty's
preserver, implored you to save.  Still
further, these men were my friends. 
They did not attack your majesty, they succumbed to your blind
anger.  Besides, why were they not
allowed to escape?  What crime had they
committed?  I admit you may contest with
me the right of judging their conduct. 
But why suspect me before the action? 
Why surround me with spies?  Why
disgrace me before the army?  Why me, in
whom till now you showed the most entire confidence - who for thirty years have
been attached to your person, and have given you a thousand proofs of my
devotion - for it must be said, now that I am accused - why reduce me to see
three thousand of the king's soldiers march in battle against two men?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;One
would say you have forgotten what these men have done to me!&quot; said the
king, in a hollow voice, &quot;and that it was no merit of theirs I was not
lost.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Sire,
one would imagine you forget that I was there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Enough,
Monsieur d'Artagnan, enough of these dominating interests which arise to keep
the sun itself from my interests.  I am
founding a state in which there shall be but one master, as I promised you; the
moment is at hand for me to keep my promise. 
You wish to be, according to your tastes or private friendships, free to
destroy my plans and save my enemies?  I
will thwart you or will drop you - seek a more compliant master.  I know full well that another king would not
conduct himself as I do, and would allow himself to be dominated by you, at the
risk of sending you some day to keep company with M. Fouquet and the rest; but
I have an excellent memory, and for me, services are sacred titles to
gratitude, to impunity.  You shall only
have this lesson, Monsieur d'Artagnan, as the punishment of your want of
discipline, and I will not imitate my predecessors in anger, not having
imitated them in favor.  And, then,
other reasons make me act mildly towards you; in the first place, because you
are a man of sense, a man of excellent sense, a man of heart, and that you will
be a capital servant to him who shall have mastered you; secondly, because you
will cease to have any motives for insubordination.  Your friends are now destroyed or ruined by me.  These supports on which your capricious mind
instinctively relied I have caused to disappear.  At this moment, my soldiers have taken or killed the rebels of Belle-Isle.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
became pale.  &quot;Taken or
killed!&quot; cried he.  &quot;Oh! sire,
if you thought what you tell, if you were sure you were telling me the truth, I
should forget all that is just, all that is magnanimous in your words, to call
you a barbarous king, and an unnatural man. 
But I pardon you these words,&quot; said he, smiling with pride; &quot;I
pardon them to a young prince who does not know, who cannot comprehend what
such men as M. d'Herblay, M. du Vallon, and myself are.  Taken or killed!  Ah!  Ah! sire! tell me, if
the news is true, how much has it cost you in men and money.  We will then reckon if the game has been
worth the stakes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                As he
spoke thus, the king went up to him in great anger, and said, &quot;Monsieur
d'Artagnan, your replies are those of a rebel! 
Tell me, if you please, who is king of France?  Do you know any other?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Sire,&quot;
replied the captain of the musketeers, coldly, &quot;I very well remember that
one morning at Vaux you addressed that question to many people who did not
answer to it, whilst I, on my part, did answer to it.  If I recognized my king on that day, when the thing was not easy,
I think it would be useless to ask the question of me now, when your majesty
and I are alone.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At
these words Louis cast down his eyes. 
It appeared to him that the shade of the unfortunate Philippe passed
between D'Artagnan and himself, to evoke the remembrance of that terrible
adventure.  Almost at the same moment an
officer entered and placed a dispatch in the hands of the king, who, in his
turn, changed color, while reading it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur,&quot;
said he, &quot;what I learn here you would know later; it is better I should
tell you, and that you should learn it from the mouth of your king.  A battle has taken place at
Belle-Isle.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is
it possible?&quot; said D'Artagnan, with a calm air, though his heart was
beating fast enough to choke him. 
&quot;Well, sire?&quot;<br>                &quot;Well, monsieur - and
I have lost a hundred and ten men.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                A beam
of joy and pride shone in the eyes of D'Artagnan.  &quot;And the rebels?&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
rebels have fled,&quot; said the king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
could not restrain a cry of triumph. 
&quot;Only,&quot; added the king, &quot;I have a fleet which closely
blockades Belle-Isle, and I am certain not a bark can escape.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;So
that,&quot; said the musketeer, brought back to his dismal idea, &quot;if these
two gentlemen are taken - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;They
will be hanged,&quot; said the king, quietly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
do they know it?&quot; replied D'Artagnan, repressing his trembling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;They
know it, because you must have told them yourself; and all the country knows
it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Then,
sire, they will never be taken alive, I will answer for that.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
said the king, negligently, and taking up his letter again.  &quot;Very well, they will be dead, then,
Monsieur d'Artagnan, and that will come to the same thing, since I should only
take them to have them hanged.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
wiped the sweat which flowed from his brow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have told you,&quot; pursued Louis XIV., &quot;that I would one day be an
affectionate, generous, and constant master. 
You are now the only man of former times worthy of my anger or my
friendship.  I will not spare you either
sentiment, according to your conduct. 
Could you serve a king, Monsieur d'Artagnan, who should have a hundred
kings, his equals, in the kingdom? 
Could I, tell me, do with such weak instruments the great things I
meditate?  Did you ever see an artist
effect great works with an unworthy tool? 
Far from us, monsieur, the old leaven of feudal abuse!  The Fronde, which threatened to ruin
monarchy, has emancipated it.  I am
master at home, Captain d'Artagnan, and I shall have servants who, lacking,
perhaps, your genius, will carry devotion and obedience to the verge of
heroism.  Of what consequence, I ask
you, of what consequence is it that God has given no sense to arms and legs?  It is to the head he has given genius, and
the head, you know, the rest obey.  I am
the head.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
started.  Louis XIV. continued as if he
had seen nothing, although this emotion had not by any means escaped him.  &quot;Now, let us conclude between us two
the bargain I promised to make with you one day when you found me in a very
strange predicament at Blois.  Do me
justice, monsieur, when you admit I do not make any one pay for the tears of
shame that I then shed.  Look around
you; lofty heads have bowed.  Bow yours,
or choose such exile as will suit you. 
Perhaps, when reflecting upon it, you will find your king has a generous
heart, who reckons sufficiently upon your loyalty to allow you to leave him
dissatisfied, when you possess a great state secret.  You are a brave man; I know you to be so.  Why have you judged me prematurely?  Judge me from this day forward, D'Artagnan,
and be as severe as you please.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
remained bewildered, mute, undecided for the first time in his life.  At last he had found an adversary worthy of
him.  This was no longer trick, it was
calculation; no longer violence, but strength; no longer passion, but will; no
longer boasting, but council.  This
young man who had brought down a Fouquet, and could do without a D'Artagnan,
deranged the somewhat headstrong calculations of the musketeer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come,
let us see what stops you?&quot; said the king, kindly.  &quot;You have given in your resignation;
shall I refuse to accept it?  I admit
that it may be hard for such an old captain to recover lost good-humor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!&quot;
replied D'Artagnan, in a melancholy tone, &quot;that is not my most serious
care.  I hesitate to take back my
resignation because I am old in comparison with you, and have habits difficult
to abandon.  Henceforward, you must have
courtiers who know how to amuse you - madmen who will get themselves killed to
carry out what you call your great works. 
Great they will be, I feel - but, if by chance I should not think them
so?  I have seen war, sire, I have seen
peace; I have served Richelieu and Mazarin; I have been scorched with your
father, at the fire of Rochelle; riddled with sword-thrusts like a sieve,
having grown a new skin ten times, as serpents do.  After affronts and injustices, I have a command which was
formerly something, because it gave the bearer the right of speaking as he
liked to his king.  But your captain of
the musketeers will henceforward be an officer guarding the outer doors.  Truly, sire, if that is to be my employment
from this time, seize the opportunity of our being on good terms, to take it
from me.  Do not imagine that I bear
malice; no, you have tamed me, as you say; but it must be confessed that in
taming me you have lowered me; by bowing me you have convicted me of weakness.  If you knew how well it suits me to carry my
head high, and what a pitiful mien I shall have while scenting the dust of your
carpets!  Oh! sire, I regret sincerely,
and you will regret as I do, the old days when the king of France saw in every
vestibule those insolent gentlemen, lean, always swearing - cross-grained
mastiffs, who could bite mortally in the hour of danger or of battle.  These men were the best of courtiers to the
hand which fed them - they would lick it; but for the hand that struck them,
oh! the bite that followed!  A little
gold on the lace of their cloaks, a slender stomach in their <i>hauts-de-chausses</i>, a little sparkling of
gray in their dry hair, and you will behold the handsome dukes and peers, the
haughty <i>maréchaux</i> of France.  But why should I tell you all this?  The king is master; he wills that I should make
verses, he wills that I should polish the mosaics of his ante-chambers with
satin shoes.  <i>Mordioux!</i> that is difficult, but I have got over greater
difficulties.  I will do it.  Why should I do it?  Because I love money? - I have enough.  Because I am ambitious? - my career is
almost at an end.  Because I love the
court?  No.  I will remain here because I have been accustomed for thirty years
to go and take the orderly word of the king, and to have said to me 'Good
evening, D'Artagnan,' with a  smile I did
not beg for.  That smile I will beg
for!  Are you content, sire?&quot;  And D'Artagnan bowed his silver head, upon
which the smiling king placed his white hand with pride.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                 &quot;Thanks, my old servant, my faithful
friend,&quot; said he.  &quot;As,
reckoning from this day, I have no longer any enemies in France, it remains
with me to send you to a foreign field to gather your marshal's baton.  Depend upon me for finding you an
opportunity.  In the meanwhile, eat of
my very best bread, and sleep in absolute tranquillity.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is all kind and well!&quot; said D'Artagnan, much agitated.  &quot;But those poor men at Belle-Isle?  One of them, in particular - so good! so
brave! so true!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Do
you ask their pardon of me?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Upon
my knees, sire!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Well! then, go and take it to
them, if it be still in time.  But do
you answer for them?&quot;<br>
&quot;With my life, sire.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Go, then.  To-morrow I set out for Paris.  Return by that time, for I do not wish you
to leave me in the future.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Be assured of that,
sire,&quot; said D'Artagnan, kissing the royal hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>And with a heart swelling with joy,
he rushed out of the castle on his way to Belle-Isle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>T</span>he
king had returned to Paris, and with him D'Artagnan, who, in twenty-four hours,
having made with greatest care all possible inquiries at Belle-Isle, succeeded
in learning nothing of the secret so well kept by the heavy rock of Locmaria,
which had fallen on the heroic Porthos. 
The captain of the musketeers only knew what those two valiant men -
these two friends, whose defense he had so nobly taken up, whose lives he had
so earnestly endeavored to save - aided by three faithful Bretons, had
accomplished against a whole army.  He
had seen, spread on the neighboring heath, the human remains which had stained
with clouted blood the scattered stones among the flowering broom.  He learned also that a bark had been seen
far out at sea, and that, like a bird of prey, a royal vessel had pursued,
overtaken, and devoured the poor little bird that was flying with such
palpitating wings.  But there
D'Artagnan's certainties ended.  The
field of supposition was thrown open. 
Now, what could he conjecture? 
The vessel had not returned.  It
is true that a brisk wind had prevailed for three days; but the corvette was
known to be a good sailer and solid in its timbers; it had no need to fear a
gale of wind, and it ought, according to the calculation of D'Artagnan, to have
either returned to Brest, or come back to the mouth of the Loire.  Such was the news, ambiguous, it is true,
but in some degree reassuring to him personally, which D'Artagnan brought to
Louis XIV., when the king, followed by all the court, returned to Paris.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Louis,
satisfied with his success - Louis, more mild and affable as he felt himself
more powerful - had not ceased for an instant to ride beside the carriage door
of Mademoiselle de la Vallière. 
Everybody was anxious to amuse the two queens, so as to make them forget
this abandonment by son and husband. 
Everything breathed the future, the past was nothing to anybody.  Only that past was like a painful bleeding
wound to the hearts of certain tender and devoted spirits.  Scarcely was the king reinstalled in Paris,
when he received a touching proof of this. 
Louis XIV. had just risen and taken his first repast when his captain of
the musketeers presented himself before him. 
D'Artagnan was pale and looked unhappy. 
The king, at the first glance, perceived the change in a countenance
generally so unconcerned.  &quot;What is
the matter, D'Artagnan?&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Sire,
a great misfortune has happened to me.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Good
heavens! what is that?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Sire,
I have lost one of my friends, M. du Vallon, in the affair of Belle-Isle.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And,
while speaking these words, D'Artagnan fixed his falcon eye upon Louis XIV., to
catch the first feeling that would show itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
knew it,&quot; replied the king, quietly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
knew it, and did not tell me!&quot; cried the musketeer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;To
what good?  Your grief, my friend, was
so well worthy of respect.  It was my
duty to treat it gently.  To have informed
you of this misfortune, which I knew would pain you so greatly, D'Artagnan,
would have been, in your eyes, to have triumphed over you.  Yes, I knew that M. du Vallon had buried
himself beneath the rocks of Locmaria; I knew that M. d'Herblay had taken one
of my vessels with its crew, and had compelled it to convey him to
Bayonne.  But I was willing you should
learn these matters in a direct manner, in order that you might be convinced my
friends are with me respected and sacred; that always in me the man will
sacrifice himself to subjects, whilst the king is so often found to sacrifice
men to majesty and power.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;But, sire, how could you
know?&quot;<br>
&quot;How do you yourself know, D'Artagnan?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;By this letter, sire, which
M. d'Herblay, free and out of danger, writes me from Bayonne.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Look here,&quot; said the
king, drawing from a casket placed upon the table closet to the seat upon which
D'Artagnan was leaning, &quot;here is a letter copied exactly from that of M.
d'Herblay.  Here is the very letter,
which Colbert placed in my hands a week before you received yours.  I am well served, you may perceive.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, sire,&quot; murmured the
musketeer, &quot;you were the only man whose star was equal to the task of
dominating the fortune and strength of my two friends.  You have used your power, sire, you will not
abuse it, will you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;D'Artagnan,&quot; said the
king, with a smile beaming with kindness, &quot;I could have M. d'Herblay
carried off from the territories of the king of Spain, and brought here, alive,
to inflict justice upon him.  But, D'Artagnan,
be assured I will not yield to this first and natural impulse.  He is free - let him continue free.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh, sire! you will not always
remain so clement, so noble, so generous as you have shown yourself with
respect to me and M. d'Herblay; you will have about you counselors who will
cure you of that weakness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No, D'Artagnan, you are
mistaken when you accuse my council of urging me to pursue rigorous
measures.  The advice to spare M.
d'Herblay comes from Colbert himself.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh, sire!&quot; said
D'Artagnan, extremely surprised.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;As for you,&quot; continued
the king, with a kindness very uncommon to him, &quot;I have several pieces of
good news to announce to you; but you shall know them, my dear captain, the
moment I have made my accounts all straight. 
I have said that I wish to make, and would make, your fortune; that
promise will soon become reality.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;A thousand times thanks,
sire!  I can wait.  But I implore you, whilst I go and practice
patience, that your majesty will deign to notice those poor people who have for
so long a time besieged your ante-chamber, and come humbly to lay a petition at
your feet.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Who are they?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Enemies of your
majesty.&quot;  The king raised his
head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Friends of M. Fouquet,&quot;
added D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Their names?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;M. Gourville, M. Pélisson,
and a poet, M. Jean de la Fontaine.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king took a moment to
reflect.  &quot;What do they want?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I do not know.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;How do they appear?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In great affliction.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What do they say?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What do they do?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;They weep.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Let them come in,&quot; said
the king, with a serious brow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan turned rapidly on his
heel, raised the tapestry which closed the entrance to the royal chamber, and
directing his voice to the adjoining room, cried, &quot;Enter.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The three men D'Artagnan had named
immediately appeared at the door of the cabinet in which were the king and his
captain.  A profound silence prevailed
in their passage.  The courtiers, at the
approach of the friends of the unfortunate superintendent of finances, drew
back, as if fearful of being affected by contagion with disgrace and
misfortune.  D'Artagnan, with a quick
step, came forward to take by the hand the unhappy men who stood trembling at
the door of the cabinet; he led them in front of the king's <i>fauteuil</i>, who, having placed himself in
the embrasure of a window, awaited the moment of presentation, and was
preparing himself to give the supplicants a rigorously diplomatic reception.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The first of the friends of
Fouquet's to advance was Pélisson.  He did
not weep, but his tears were only restrained that the king might better hear
his voice and prayer.  Gourville bit his
lips to check his tears, out of respect for the king.  La Fontaine buried his face in his handkerchief, and the only
signs of life he gave were the convulsive motions of his shoulders, raised by
his sobs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king preserved his
dignity.  His countenance was
impassible.  He even maintained the
frown which appeared when D'Artagnan announced his enemies.  He made a gesture which signified, &quot;Speak;&quot;
and he remained standing, with his eyes fixed searchingly on these desponding
men.  Pélisson bowed to the ground, and
La Fontaine knelt as people do in churches. 
This dismal silence, disturbed only by sighs and groans, began to excite
in the king, not compassion, but impatience.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur Pélisson,&quot; said
he, in a sharp, dry tone. 
&quot;Monsieur Gourville, and you, Monsieur - &quot; and he did not name
La Fontaine, &quot;I cannot, without sensible displeasure, see you come to plead
for one of the greatest criminals it is the duty of justice to punish.  A king does not allow himself to soften save
at the tears of the innocent, the remorse of the guilty.  I have no faith either in the remorse of M.
Fouquet or the tears of his friends, because the one is tainted to the very
heart, and the others ought to dread offending me in my own palace.  For these reasons, I beg you, Monsieur
Pélisson, Monsieur Gourville, and you, Monsieur - , to say nothing that will
not plainly proclaim the respect you have for my will.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Sire,&quot; replied Pélisson,
trembling at these words, &quot;we are come to say nothing to your majesty that
is not the most profound expression of the most sincere respect and love that
are due to a king from all his subjects. 
Your majesty's justice is redoubtable; every one must yield to the
sentences it pronounces.  We
respectfully bow before it.  Far from us
the idea of coming to defend him who has had the misfortune to offend your
majesty.  He who has incurred your
displeasure may be a friend of ours, but he is an enemy to the state.  We abandon him, but with tears, to the
severity of the king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Besides,&quot; interrupted
the king, calmed by that supplicating voice, and those persuasive words,
&quot;my parliament will decide.  I do
not strike without first having weighed the crime; my justice does not wield
the sword without employing first a pair of scales.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Therefore we have every
confidence in that impartiality of the king, and hope to make our feeble voices
heard, with the consent of your majesty, when the hour for defending an accused
friend strikes.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In that case, messieurs, what
do you ask of me?&quot; said the king, with his most imposing air.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Sire,&quot; continued
Pélisson, &quot;the accused has a wife and family.  The little property he had was scarcely sufficient to pay his debts,
and Madame Fouquet, since her husband's captivity, is abandoned by
everybody.  The hand of your majesty
strikes like the hand of God.  When the
Lord sends the curse of leprosy or pestilence into a family, every one flies
and shuns the abode of the leprous or plague-stricken.  Sometimes, but very rarely, a generous
physician alone ventures to approach the ill-reputed threshold, passes it with
courage, and risks his life to combat death. 
He is the last resource of the dying, the chosen instrument of heavenly
mercy.  Sire, we supplicate you, with
clasped hands and bended knees, as a divinity is supplicated!  Madame Fouquet has no longer any friends, no
longer any means of support; she weeps in her deserted home, abandoned by all
those who besieged its doors in the hour of prosperity; she has neither credit
nor hope left.  At least, the unhappy
wretch upon whom your anger falls receives from you, however culpable he may
be, his daily bread though moistened by his tears.  As much afflicted, more destitute than her husband, Madame
Fouquet - the lady who had the honor to receive your majesty at her table -
Madame Fouquet, the wife of the ancient superintendent of your majesty's
finances, Madame Fouquet has no longer bread.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Here the mortal silence which had
chained the breath of Pélisson's two friends was broken by an outburst of sobs;
and D'Artagnan, whose chest heaved at hearing this humble prayer, turned round
towards the angle of the cabinet to bite his mustache and conceal a groan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king had preserved his eye dry
and his countenance severe; but the blood had mounted to his cheeks, and the
firmness of his look was visibly diminished.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What do you wish?&quot; said
he, in an agitated voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;We come humbly to ask your
majesty,&quot; replied Pélisson, upon whom emotion was fast gaining, &quot;to
permit us, without incurring the displeasure of your majesty, to lend to Madame
Fouquet two thousand pistoles collected among the old friends of her husband,
in order that the widow may not stand in need of the necessaries of life.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>At the word <i>widow</i>, pronounced by Pélisson whilst Fouquet was still alive, the
king turned very pale; - his pride disappeared; pity rose from his heart to his
lips; he cast a softened look upon the men who knelt sobbing at his feet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;God forbid,&quot; said he,
&quot;that I should confound the innocent with the guilty.  They know me but ill who doubt my mercy
towards the weak.  I strike none but the
arrogant.  Do, messieurs, do all that
your hearts counsel you to assuage the grief of Madame Fouquet.  Go, messieurs - go!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The three now rose in silence with
dry eyes.  The tears had been scorched
away by contact with their burning cheeks and eyelids.  They had not the strength to address their
thanks to the king, who himself cut short their solemn reverences by
entrenching himself suddenly behind the <i>fauteuil</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan remained alone with the
king.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well,&quot; said he,
approaching the young prince, who interrogated him with his look.  &quot;Well, my master!  If you had not the device which belongs to
your sun, I would recommend you one which M. Conrart might translate into
eclectic Latin, 'Calm with the lowly; stormy with the strong.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king smiled, and passed into
the next apartment, after having said to D'Artagnan, &quot;I give you the leave
of absence you must want to put the affairs of your friend, the late M. du
Vallon, in order.&quot;</p>

Pierrefonds everything was in mourning. 
The courts were deserted - the stables closed - the parterres
neglected.  In the basins, the
fountains, formerly so jubilantly fresh and noisy, had stopped of
themselves.  Along the roads around the
château came a few grave personages mounted on mules or country nags.  These were rural neighbors, curés and
bailiffs of adjacent estates.  All these
people entered the château silently, handed their horses to a
melancholy-looking groom, and directed their steps, conducted by a huntsman in
black, to the great dining-room, where Mousqueton received them at the
door.  Mousqueton had become so thin in
two days that his clothes moved upon him like an ill-fitting scabbard in which
the sword-blade dances at each motion. 
His face, composed of red and white, like that of the Madonna of
Vandyke, was furrowed by two silver rivulets which had dug their beds in his
cheeks, as full formerly as they had become flabby since his grief began.  At each fresh arrival, Mousqueton found
fresh tears, and it was pitiful to see him press his throat with his fat hand
to keep from bursting into sobs and lamentations.  All these visits were for the purpose of hearing the reading of
Porthos's will, announced for that day, and at which all the covetous friends
of the dead man were anxious to be present, as he had left no relations behind
him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
visitors took their places as they arrived, and the great room had just been
closed when the clock struck twelve, the hour fixed for the reading of the
important document.  Porthos's procureur
- and that was naturally the successor of Master Coquenard - commenced by
slowly unfolding the vast parchment upon which the powerful hand of Porthos had
traced his sovereign will.  The seal
broken - the spectacles put on - the preliminary cough having sounded - every
one pricked up his ears.  Mousqueton had
squatted himself in a corner, the better to weep and the better to hear.  All at once the folding-doors of the great
room, which had been shut, were thrown open as if by magic, and a warlike
figure appeared upon the threshold, resplendent in the full light of the
sun.  This was D'Artagnan, who had come
alone to the gate, and finding nobody to hold his stirrup, had tied his horse
to the knocker and announced himself. 
The splendor of daylight invading the room, the murmur of all present,
and, more than all, the instinct of the faithful dog, drew Mousqueton from his
reverie; he raised his head, recognized the old friend of his master, and,
screaming with grief, he embraced his knees, watering the floor with his
tears.  D'Artagnan raised the poor
intendant, embraced him as if he had been a brother, and, having nobly saluted
the assembly, who all bowed as they whispered to each other his name, he went
and took his seat at the extremity of the great carved oak hall, still holding
by the hand poor Mousqueton, who was suffocating with excess of woe, and sank
upon the steps.  Then the procureur,
who, like the rest, was considerably agitated, commenced.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Porthos,
after a profession of faith of the most Christian character, asked pardon of
his enemies for all the injuries he might have done them.  At this paragraph, a ray of inexpressible
pride beamed from the eyes of D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He
recalled to his mind the old soldier; all those enemies of Porthos brought to
earth by his valiant hand; he reckoned up the numbers of them, and said to
himself that Porthos had acted wisely, not to enumerate his enemies or the
injuries done to them, or the task would have been too much for the
reader.  Then came the following
schedule of his extensive lands:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
possess at this present time, by the grace of God - </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;1.
The domain of Pierrefonds, lands, woods, meadows, waters, and forests,
surrounded by good walls.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;2.
The domain of Bracieux, châteaux, forests, plowed lands, forming three farms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;3.
The little estate Du Vallon, so named because it is in the valley.&quot;  (Brave Porthos!)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;4.
Fifty farms in Touraine, amounting to five hundred acres.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;5.
Three mills upon the Cher, bringing in six hundred livres each.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;6.
Three fish-pools in Berry, producing two hundred livres a year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;As
to my personal or movable property, so called because it can be moved, as is so
well explained by my learned friend the bishop of Vannes - &quot;  (D'Artagnan shuddered at the dismal
remembrance attached to that name) - the procureur continued imperturbably -
&quot;they consist - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;1.
In goods which I cannot detail here for want of room, and which furnish all my
châteaux or houses, but of which the list is drawn up by my intendant.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Every
one turned his eyes towards Mousqueton, who was still lost in grief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;2.
In twenty horses for saddle and draught, which I have particularly at my
château of Pierrefonds, and which are called - Bayard, Roland, Charlemagne,
Pépin, Dunois, La Hire, Ogier, Samson, Milo, Nimrod, Urganda, Armida,
Flastrade, Dalilah, Rebecca, Yolande, Finette, Grisette, Lisette, and Musette.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;3.
In sixty dogs, forming six packs, divided as follows: the first, for the stag;
the second, for the wolf; the third, for the wild boar; the fourth, for the
hare; and the two others, for setters and protection.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;4.
In arms for war and the chase contained in my gallery of arms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;5.
My wines of Anjou, selected for Athos, who liked them formerly; my wines of
Burgundy, Champagne, Bordeaux, and Spain, stocking eight cellars and twelve
vaults, in my various houses.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;6.
My pictures and statues, which are said to be of great value, and which are
sufficiently numerous to fatigue the sight.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;7.
My library, consisting of six thousand volumes, quite new, and have never been
opened.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;8.
My silver plate, which is perhaps a little worn, but which ought to weigh from
a thousand to twelve hundred pounds, for I had great trouble in lifting the
coffer that contained it and could not carry it more than six times round my
chamber.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;9.
All these objects, in addition to the table and house linen, are divided in the
residences I liked the best.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Here
the reader stopped to take breath. 
Every one sighed, coughed, and redoubled his attention.  The procureur resumed:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
have lived without having any children, and it is probable I never shall have
any, which to me is a cutting grief. 
And yet I am mistaken, for I have a son, in common with my other
friends; that is, M. Raoul Auguste Jules de Bragelonne, the true son of M. le
Comte de la Fère.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;This
young nobleman appears to me extremely worthy to succeed the valiant gentleman
of whom I am the friend and very humble servant.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Here a
sharp sound interrupted the reader.  It
was D'Artagnan's sword, which, slipping from his baldric, had fallen on the
sonorous flooring.  Every one turned his
eyes that way, and saw that a large tear had rolled from the thick lid of
D'Artagnan, half-way down to his aquiline nose, the luminous edge of which
shone like a little crescent moon.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;This
is why,&quot; continued the procureur, &quot;I have left all my property,
movable, or immovable, comprised in the above enumerations, to M. le Vicomte
Raoul Auguste Jules de Bragelonne, son of M. le Comte de la Fère, to console
him for the grief he seems to suffer, and enable him to add more luster to his
already glorious name.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                A vague
murmur ran through the auditory.  The
procureur continued, seconded by the flashing eye of D'Artagnan, which,
glancing over the assembly, quickly restored the interrupted silence:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;On
condition that M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne do give to M. le Chevalier
d'Artagnan, captain of the king's musketeers, whatever the said Chevalier
d'Artagnan may demand of my property. 
On condition that M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne do pay a good pension to
M. le Chevalier d'Herblay, my friend, if he should need it in exile.  I leave to my intendant Mousqueton all of my
clothes, of city, war, or chase, to the number of forty-seven suits, in the
assurance that he will wear them till they are worn out, for the love of and in
remembrance of his master.  Moreover, I
bequeath to M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne my old servant and faithful friend
Mousqueton, already named, providing that the said vicomte shall so act that
Mousqueton shall declare, when dying, he has never ceased to be happy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                On
hearing these words, Mousqueton bowed, pale and trembling; his shoulders shook
convulsively; his countenance, compressed by a frightful grief, appeared from
between his icy hands, and the spectators saw him stagger and hesitate, as if,
though wishing to leave the hall, he did not know the way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Mousqueton,
my good friend,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;go and make your
preparations.  I will take you with me
to Athos's house, whither I shall go on leaving Pierrefonds.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Mousqueton
made no reply.  He scarcely breathed, as
if everything in that hall would from that time be foreign.  He opened the door, and slowly disappeared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
procureur finished his reading, after which the greater part of those who had
come to hear the last will of Porthos dispersed by degrees, many disappointed,
but all penetrated with respect.  As for
D'Artagnan, thus left alone, after having received the formal compliments of
the procureur, he was lost in admiration of the wisdom of the testator, who had
so judiciously bestowed his wealth upon the most necessitous and the most
worthy, with a delicacy that neither nobleman nor courtier could have displayed
more kindly.  When Porthos enjoined
Raoul de Bragelonne to give D'Artagnan all that he would ask, he knew well, our
worthy Porthos, that D'Artagnan would ask or take nothing; and in case he did
demand anything, none but himself could say what.  Porthos left a pension to Aramis, who, if he should be inclined
to ask too much, was checked by the example of D'Artagnan; and that word <i>exile</i>, thrown out by the testator,
without apparent intention, was it not the mildest, most exquisite criticism upon
that conduct of Aramis which had brought about the death of Porthos?  But there was no mention of Athos in the
testament of the dead.  Could the latter
for a moment suppose that the son would not offer the best part to the
father?  The rough mind of Porthos had
fathomed all these causes, seized all these shades more clearly than law,
better than custom, with more propriety than taste.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Porthos
had indeed a heart,&quot; said D'Artagnan to himself with a sigh.  As he made this reflection, he fancied he
hard a groan in the room above him; and he thought immediately of poor
Mousqueton, whom he felt it was a pleasing duty to divert from his grief.  For this purpose he left the hall hastily to
seek the worthy intendant, as he had not returned.  He ascended the staircase leading to the first story, and
perceived, in Porthos's own chamber, a heap of clothes of all colors and
materials, upon which Mousqueton had laid himself down after heaping them all
on the floor together.  It was the
legacy of the faithful friend.  Those
clothes were truly his own; they had been given to him; the hand of Mousqueton
was stretched over these relics, which he was kissing with his lips, with all
his face, and covered with his body. 
D'Artagnan approached to console the poor fellow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;My
God!&quot; said he, &quot;he does not stir - he has fainted!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                But
D'Artagnan was mistaken.  Mousqueton was
dead!  Dead, like the dog who, having
lost his master, crawls back to die upon his cloak.</p>

these affairs were separating forever the four musketeers, formerly bound
together in a manner that seemed indissoluble, Athos, left alone after the
departure of Raoul, began to pay his tribute to that foretaste of death which
is called the absence of those we love. 
Back in his house at Blois, no longer having even Grimaud to receive a
poor smile as he passed through the parterre, Athos daily felt the decline of
vigor of a nature which for so long a time had seemed impregnable.  Age, which had been kept back by the
presence of the beloved object, arrived with that <i>cortège</i> of pains and inconveniences, which grows by geometrical
accretion.  Athos had no longer his son
to induce him to walk firmly, with head erect, as a good example; he had no
longer, in those brilliant eyes of the young man, an ever-ardent focus at which
to kindle anew the fire of his looks. 
And then, must it be said, that nature, exquisite in tenderness and
reserve, no longer finding anything to understand its feelings, gave itself up
to grief with all the warmth of common natures when they yield to joy.  The Comte de la Fère, who had remained a
young man to his sixty-second year; the warrior who had preserved his strength
in spite of fatigue; his freshness of mind in spite of misfortune, his mild
serenity of soul and body in spite of Milady, in spite of Mazarin, in spite of
La Vallière; Athos had become an old man in a week, from the moment at which he
lost the comfort of his later youth. 
Still handsome, though bent, noble, but sad, he sought, since his
solitude, the deeper glades where sunshine scarcely penetrated.  He discontinued all the mighty exercises he
had enjoyed through life, when Raoul was no longer with him.  The servants, accustomed to see him stirring
with the dawn at all seasons, were astonished to hear seven o'clock strike
before their master quitted his bed. 
Athos remained in bed with a book under his pillow - but he did not
sleep, neither did he read.  Remaining
in bed that he might no longer have to carry his body, he allowed his soul and
spirit to wander from their envelope and return to his son, or to God. <b><sup>6</sup></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                His
people were sometimes terrified to see him, for hours together, absorbed in
silent reverie, mute and insensible; he no longer heard the timid step of the
servant who came to the door of his chamber to watch the sleeping or waking of
his master.  It often occurred that he
forgot the day had half passed away, that the hours for the two first meals
were gone by.  Then he was
awakened.  He rose, descended to his
shady walk, then came out a little into the sun, as though to partake of its
warmth for a minute in memory of his absent child.  And then the dismal monotonous walk recommenced, until,
exhausted, he regained the chamber and his bed, his domicile by choice.  For several days the comte did not speak a
single word.  He refused to receive the
visits that were paid him, and during the night he was seen to relight his lamp
and pass long hours in writing, or examining parchments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Athos
wrote one of these letters to Vannes, another to Fontainebleau; they remained
without answers.  We know why: Aramis
had quitted France, and D'Artagnan was traveling from Nantes to Paris, from
Paris to Pierrefonds.  His <i>valet de chambre</i> observed that he
shortened his walk every day by several turns. 
The great alley of limes soon became too long for feet that used to
traverse it formerly a hundred times a day. 
The comte walked feebly as far as the middle trees, seated himself upon
a mossy bank that sloped towards a sidewalk, and there waited the return of his
strength, or rather the return of night. 
Very shortly a hundred steps exhausted him.  At length Athos refused to rise at all; he declined all
nourishment, and his terrified people, although he did not complain, although
he wore a smile upon his lips, although he continued to speak with his sweet
voice - his people went to Blois in search of the ancient physician of the late
Monsieur, and brought him to the Comte de la Fère in such a fashion that he
could see the comte without being himself seen.  For this purpose, they placed him in a closet adjoining the
chamber of the patient, and implored him not to show himself, for fear of
displeasing their master, who had not asked for a physician.  The doctor obeyed.  Athos was a sort of model for the gentlemen of the country; the
Blaisois boasted of possessing this sacred relic of French glory.  Athos was a great seigneur compared with
such nobles as the king improvised by touching with his artificial scepter the
parched-up trunks of the heraldic trees of the province.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                People
respected Athos, we say, and they loved him. 
The physician could not bear to see his people weep, to see flock round
him the poor of the canton, to whom Athos had so often given life and
consolation by his kind words and his charities.  He examined, therefore, from the depths of his hiding-place, the
nature of that mysterious malady which bent and aged more mortally every day a
man but lately so full of life and a desire to live.  He remarked upon the cheeks of Athos the hectic hue of fever,
which feeds upon itself; slow fever, pitiless, born in a fold of the heart,
sheltering itself behind that rampart, growing from the suffering it engenders,
at once cause and effect of a perilous situation.  The comte spoke to nobody; he did not even talk to himself.  His thought feared noise; it approached to
that degree of over-excitement which borders upon ecstasy.  Man thus absorbed, though he does not yet belong
to God, already appertains no longer to the earth.  The doctor remained for several hours studying this painful
struggle of the will against superior power; he was terrified at seeing those
eyes always fixed, ever directed on some invisible object; was terrified at the
monotonous beating of that heart from which never a sigh arose to vary the
melancholy state; for often pain becomes the hope of the physician.  Half a day passed away thus.  The doctor formed his resolution like a
brave man; he issued suddenly from his place of retreat, and went straight up
to Athos, who beheld him without evincing more surprise than if he had
understood nothing of the apparition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
le comte, I crave your pardon,&quot; said the doctor, coming up to the patient
with open arms; &quot;but I have a reproach to make you - you shall hear
me.&quot;  And he seated himself by the
pillow of Athos, who had great trouble in rousing himself from his
preoccupation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is the matter, doctor?&quot; asked the comte, after a silence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
matter is, you are ill, monsieur, and have had no advice.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I!
ill!&quot; said Athos, smiling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Fever,
consumption, weakness, decay, monsieur le comte!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Weakness!&quot;
replied Athos; &quot;is it possible?  I
do not get up.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Come,
come! monsieur le comte, no subterfuges; you are a good Christian?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
hope so,&quot; said Athos.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Is
it your wish to kill yourself?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Never,
doctor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!
monsieur, you are in a fair way of doing so. 
Thus to remain is suicide.  Get
well! monsieur le comte, get well!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Of
what?  Find the disease first.  For my part, I never knew myself better;
never did the sky appear more blue to me; never did I take more care of my
flowers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
have a hidden grief.&quot;<br>                &quot;Concealed! - not at
all; the absence of my son, doctor; that is my malady, and I do not conceal
it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
le comte, your son lives, he is strong, he has all the future before him - the
future of men of merit, of his race; live for him - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But
I do live, doctor; oh! be satisfied of that,&quot; added he, with a melancholy
smile; &quot;for as long as Raoul lives, it will be plainly known, for as long
as he lives, I shall live.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
do you say?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;A
very simple thing.  At this moment,
doctor, I leave life suspended within me. 
A forgetful, dissipated, indifferent life would be beyond my strength,
now I have no longer Raoul with me.  You
do not ask the lamp to burn when the match has not illumed the flame; do not
ask me to live amidst noise and merriment. 
I vegetate, I prepare myself, I wait. 
Look, doctor; remember those soldiers we have so often seen together at
the ports, where they were waiting to embark; lying down, indifferent, half on
one element, half on the other; they were neither at the place where the sea
was going to carry them, nor at the place the earth was going to lose them;
baggage prepared, minds on the stretch, arms stacked - they waited.  I repeat it, the word is the one which
paints my present life.  Lying down like
the soldiers, my ear on the stretch for the report that may reach me, I wish to
be ready to set out at the first summons. 
Who will make me that summons? life or death?  God or Raoul?  My baggage
is packed, my soul is prepared, I await the signal - I wait, doctor, I
wait!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
doctor knew the temper of that mind; he appreciated the strength of that body;
he reflected for the moment, told himself that words were useless, remedies
absurd, and left the château, exhorting Athos's servants not to quit him for a
moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
doctor being gone, Athos evinced neither anger nor vexation at having been
disturbed.  He did not even desire that
all letters that came should be brought to him directly.  He knew very well that every distraction
which should arise would be a joy, a hope, which his servants would have paid
with their blood to procure him.  Sleep
had become rare.  By intense thinking,
Athos forgot himself, for a few hours at most, in a reverie most profound, more
obscure than other people would have called a dream.  The momentary repose which this forgetfulness thus gave the body,
still further fatigued the soul, for Athos lived a double life during these wanderings
of his understanding.  One night, he
dreamt that Raoul was dressing himself in a tent, to go upon an expedition
commanded by M. de Beaufort in person. 
The young man was sad; he clasped his cuirass slowly, and slowly he
girded on his sword.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
is the matter?&quot; asked his father, tenderly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
afflicts me is the death of Porthos, ever so dear a friend,&quot; replied
Raoul.  &quot;I suffer here the grief
you soon will feel at home.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And the
vision disappeared with the slumber of Athos. 
At daybreak one of his servants entered his master's apartment, and gave
him a letter which came from Spain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
writing of Aramis,&quot; thought the comte; and he read.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Porthos
is dead!&quot; cried he, after the first lines.  &quot;Oh!  Raoul, Raoul!
thanks! thou keepest thy promise, thou warnest me!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And
Athos, seized with a mortal sweat, fainted in his bed, without any other cause
than weakness.</p>

this fainting of Athos had ceased, the comte, almost ashamed of having given
way before this superior natural event, dressed himself and ordered his horse,
determined to ride to Blois, to open more certain correspondences with either
Africa, D'Artagnan, or Aramis.  In fact,
this letter from Aramis informed the Comte de la Fère of the bad success of the
expedition of Belle-Isle.  It gave him
sufficient details of the death of Porthos to move the tender and devoted heart
of Athos to its innermost fibers.  Athos
wished to go and pay his friend Porthos a last visit.  To render this honor to his companion in arms, he meant to send
to D'Artagnan, to prevail upon him to recommence the painful voyage to
Belle-Isle, to accomplish in his company that sad pilgrimage to the tomb of the
giant he had so much loved, then to return to his dwelling to obey that secret
influence which was conducting him to eternity by a mysterious road.  But scarcely had his joyous servants dressed
their master, whom they saw with pleasure preparing for a journey which might
dissipate his melancholy; scarcely had the comte's gentlest horse been saddled
and brought to the door, when the father of Raoul felt his head become
confused, his legs give way, and he clearly perceived the impossibility of
going one step further.  He ordered
himself to be carried into the sun; they laid him upon his bed of moss where he
passed a full hour before he could recover his spirits.  Nothing could be more natural than this
weakness after then inert repose of the latter days.  Athos took a <i>bouillon</i>,
to give him strength, and bathed his dried lips in a glassful of the wine he
loved the best - that old Anjou wine mentioned by Porthos in his admirable
will.  Then, refreshed, free in mind, he
had his horse brought again; but only with the aid of his servants was he able
painfully to climb into the saddle.  He
did not go a hundred paces; a shivering seized him again at the turning of the
road.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;This
is very strange!&quot; said he to his <i>valet
de chambre</i>, who accompanied him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Let
us stop, monsieur - I conjure you!&quot; replied the faithful servant;
&quot;how pale you are getting!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
will not prevent my pursuing my route, now I have once started,&quot; replied
the comte.  And he gave his horse his
head again.  But suddenly, the animal,
instead of obeying the thought of his master, stopped.  A movement, of which Athos was unconscious,
had checked the bit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Something,&quot;
said Athos, &quot;wills that I should go no further.  Support me,&quot; added he, stretching out his arms; &quot;quick!
come closer!  I feel my muscles relax -
I shall fall from my horse.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
valet had seen the movement made by his master at the moment he received the
order.  He went up to him quickly,
received the comte in his arms, and as they were not yet sufficiently distant
from the house for the servants, who had remained at the door to watch their
master's departure, not to perceive the disorder in the usually regular
proceeding of the comte, the valet called his comrades by gestures and voice,
and all hastened to his assistance. 
Athos had gone but a few steps on his return, when he felt himself
better again.  His strength seemed to
revive and with it the desire to go to Blois. 
He made his horse turn round: but, at the animal's first steps, he sunk
again into a state of torpor and anguish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well!
decidedly,&quot; said he, &quot;it is <i>willed</i>
that I should stay at home.&quot;  His
people flocked around him; they lifted him from his horse, and carried him as
quickly as possible into the house. 
Everything was prepared in his chamber, and they put him to bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
will be sure to remember,&quot; said he, disposing himself to sleep, &quot;that
I expect letters from Africa this very day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
will no doubt hear with pleasure that Blaisois's son is gone on horseback, to
gain an hour over the courier of Blois,&quot; replied his <i>valet de chambre</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Thank
you,&quot; replied Athos, with his placid smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
comte fell asleep, but his disturbed slumber resembled torture rather than
repose.  The servant who watched him saw
several times the expression of internal suffering shadowed on his
features.  Perhaps Athos was dreaming.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The day
passed away.  Blaisois's son returned;
the courier had brought no news.  The
comte reckoned the minutes with despair; he shuddered when those minutes made
an hour.  The idea that he was forgotten
seized him once, and brought on a fearful pang of the heart.  Everybody in the house had given up all
hopes of the courier - his hour had long passed.  Four times the express sent to Blois had repeated his journey,
and there was nothing to the address of the comte.  Athos knew that the courier only arrived once a week.  Here, then, was a delay of eight mortal days
to be endured.  He commenced the night
in this painful persuasion.  All that a
sick man, irritated by suffering, can add of melancholy suppositions to
probabilities already gloomy, Athos heaped up during the early hours of this
dismal night.  The fever rose: it
invaded the chest, where the fire soon caught, according to the expression of
the physician, who had been brought back from Blois by Blaisois at his last
journey.  Soon it gained the head.  The physician made two successive bleedings,
which dislodged it for the time, but left the patient very weak, and without
power of action in anything but his brain. 
And yet this redoubtable fever had ceased.  It besieged with its last palpitations the tense extremities; it
ended by yielding as midnight struck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
physician, seeing the incontestable improvement, returned to Blois, after
having ordered some prescriptions, and declared that the comte was saved.  Then commenced for Athos a strange,
indefinable state.  Free to think, his
mind turned towards Raoul, that beloved son. 
His imagination penetrated the fields of Africa in the environs of
Gigelli, where M. de Beaufort must have landed with his army.  A waste of gray rocks, rendered green in
certain parts by the waters of the sea, when it lashed the shore in storms and
tempest.  Beyond, the shore, strewed
over with these rocks like gravestones, ascended, in form of an amphitheater
among mastic-trees and cactus, a sort of small town, full of smoke, confused
noises, and terrified movements.  All of
a sudden, from the bosom of this smoke arose a flame, which succeeded, creeping
along the houses, in covering the entire surface of the town, and increased by
degrees, uniting in its red and angry vortices tears, screams, and supplicating
arms outstretched to Heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                There
was, for a moment, a frightful <i>pêle-mêle</i>
of timbers falling to pieces, of swords broken, of stones calcined, trees burnt
and disappearing.  It was a strange
thing that in this chaos, in which Athos distinguished raised arms, in which he
heard cries, sobs, and groans, he did not see one human figure.  The cannon thundered at a distance, musketry
madly barked, the sea moaned, flocks made their escape, bounding over the
verdant slope.  But not a soldier to
apply the match to the batteries of cannon, not a sailor to assist in
maneuvering the fleet, not a shepherd in charge of the flocks.  After the ruin of the village, the
destruction of the forts which dominated it, a ruin and destruction magically
wrought without the co-operation of a single human being, the flames were
extinguished, the smoke began to subside, then diminished in intensity, paled
and disappeared entirely.  Night then
came over the scene; night dark upon the earth, brilliant in the firmament.  The large blazing stars which spangled the African
sky glittered and gleamed without illuminating anything.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                A long
silence ensued, which gave, for a moment, repose to the troubled imagination of
Athos; and as he felt that that which he saw was not terminated, he applied
more attentively the eyes of his understanding on the strange spectacle which
his imagination had presented.  This
spectacle was soon continued for him.  A
mild pale moon rose behind the declivities of the coast, streaking at first the
undulating ripples of the sea, which appeared to have calmed after the roaring
it had sent forth during the vision of Athos - the moon, we say, shed its
diamonds and opals upon the briers and bushes of the hills.  The gray rocks, so many silent and attentive
phantoms, appeared to raise their heads to examine likewise the field of battle
by the light of the moon, and Athos perceived that the field, empty during the
combat, was now strewn with fallen bodies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                An
inexpressible shudder of fear and horror seized his soul as he recognized the
white and blue uniforms of the soldiers of Picardy, with their long pikes and
blue handles, and muskets marked with the <i>fleur-de-lis</i>
on the butts.  When he saw all the
gaping wounds, looking up to the bright heavens as if to demand back of them
the souls to which they had opened a passage, - when he saw the slaughtered
horses, stiff, their tongues hanging out at one side of their mouths, sleeping
in the shiny blood congealed around them, staining their furniture and their
manes, - when he saw the white horse of M. de Beaufort, with his head beaten to
pieces, in the first ranks of the dead, Athos passed a cold hand over his brow,
which he was astonished not to find burning. 
He was convinced by this touch that he was present, as a spectator,
without delirium's dreadful aid, the day after the battle fought upon the
shores of Gigelli by the army of the expedition, which he had seen leave the
coast of France and disappear upon the dim horizon, and of which he had saluted
with thought and gesture the last cannon-shot fired by the duke as a signal of
farewell to his country.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Who can
paint the mortal agony with which his soul followed, like a vigilant eye, these
effigies of clay-cold soldiers, and examined them, one after the other, to see
if Raoul slept among them?  Who can
express the intoxication of joy with which Athos bowed before God, and thanked
Him for not having seen him he sought with so much fear among the dead?  In fact, fallen in their ranks, stiff, icy,
the dead, still recognizable with ease, seemed to turn with complacency towards
the Comte de la Fère, to be the better seen by him, during his sad review.  But yet, he was astonished, while viewing
all these bodies, not to perceive the survivors.  To such a point did the illusion extend, that this vision was for
him a real voyage made by the father into Africa, to obtain more exact
information respecting his son.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Fatigued,
therefore, with having traversed seas and continents, he sought repose under
one of the tents sheltered behind a rock, on the top of which floated the white
<i>fleur-de-lised</i> pennon.  He looked for a soldier to conduct him to
the tent of M. de Beaufort.  Then, while
his eye was wandering over the plain, turning on all sides, he saw a white form
appear behind the scented myrtles.  This
figure was clothed in the costume of an officer; it held in its hand a broken
sword; it advanced slowly towards Athos, who, stopping short and fixing his
eyes upon it, neither spoke nor moved, but wished to open his arms, because in
this silent officer he had already recognized Raoul.  The comte attempted to utter a cry, but it was stifled in his
throat.  Raoul, with a gesture, directed
him to be silent, placing his finger on his lips and drawing back by degrees,
without Athos being able to see his legs move. 
The comte, still paler than Raoul, followed his son, painfully
traversing briers and bushes, stones and ditches, Raoul not appearing to touch
the earth, no obstacle seeming to impede the lightness of his march.  The comte, whom the inequalities of the path
fatigued, soon stopped, exhausted. 
Raoul still continued to beckon him to follow him.  The tender father, to whom love restored
strength, made a last effort, and climbed the mountain after the young man, who
attracted him by gesture and by smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At length
he gained the crest of the hill, and saw, thrown out in black, upon the horizon
whitened by the moon, the aerial form of Raoul.  Athos reached forth his hand to get closer to his beloved son
upon the plateau, and the latter also stretched out his; but suddenly, as if
the young man had been drawn away in his own despite, still retreating, he left
the earth, and Athos saw the clear blue sky shine between the feet of his child
and the ground of the hill.  Raoul rose
insensibly into the void, smiling, still calling with gesture: - he departed
towards heaven.  Athos uttered a cry of
tenderness and terror.  He looked below
again.  He saw a camp destroyed, and all
those white bodies of the royal army, like so many motionless atoms.  And, then, raising his head, he saw the
figure of his son still beckoning him to climb the mystic void.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                <span
style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>A</span>thos
was at this part of his marvelous vision, when the charm was suddenly broken by
a great noise rising from the outer gates. 
A horse was heard galloping over the hard gravel of the great alley, and
the sound of noisy and animated conversations ascended to the chamber in which
the comte was dreaming.  Athos did not
stir from the place he occupied; he scarcely turned his head towards the door
to ascertain the sooner what these noises could be.  A heavy step ascended the stairs; the horse, which had recently
galloped, departed slowly towards the stables. 
Great hesitation appeared in the steps, which by degrees approached the
chamber.  A door was opened, and Athos,
turning a little towards the part of the room the noise came from, cried, in a
weak voice:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is a courier from Africa, is it not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,
monsieur le comte,&quot; replied a voice which made the father of Raoul start
upright in his bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Grimaud!&quot;
murmured he.  And the sweat began to
pour down his face.  Grimaud appeared in
the doorway.  It was no longer the Grimaud
we have seen, still young with courage and devotion, when he jumped the first
into the boat destined to convey Raoul de Bragelonne to the vessels of the
royal fleet.  'Twas now a stern and pale
old man, his clothes covered with dust, and hair whitened by old age.  He trembled whilst leaning against the
door-frame, and was near falling on seeing, by the light of the lamps, the
countenance of his master.  These two
men who had lived so long together in a community of intelligence, and whose
eyes, accustomed to economize expressions, knew how to say so many things
silently - these two old friends, one as noble as the other in heart, if they
were unequal in fortune and birth, remained tongue-tied whilst looking at each
other.  By the exchange of a single
glance they had just read to the bottom of each other's hearts.  The old servitor bore upon his countenance
the impression of a grief already old, the outward token of a grim familiarity
with woe.  He appeared to have no longer
in use more than a single version of his thoughts.  As formerly he was accustomed not to speak much, he was now
accustomed not to smile at all.  Athos
read at a glance all these shades upon the visage of his faithful servant, and
in the same tone he would have employed to speak to Raoul in his dream:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Grimaud,&quot;
said he, &quot;Raoul is dead.  <i>Is it not so?</i>&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Behind
Grimaud the other servants listened breathlessly, with their eyes fixed upon
the bed of their sick master.  They
heard the terrible question, and a heart-breaking silence followed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,&quot;
replied the old man, heaving the monosyllable from his chest with a hoarse,
broken sigh.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Then
arose voices of lamentation, which groaned without measure, and filled with
regrets and prayers the chamber where the agonized father sought with his eyes
the portrait of his son.  This was for
Athos like the transition which led to his dream.  Without uttering a cry, without shedding a tear, patient, mild,
resigned as a martyr, he raised his eyes towards Heaven, in order there to see
again, rising above the mountain of Gigelli, the beloved shade that was leaving
him at the moment of Grimaud's arrival. 
Without doubt, while looking towards the heavens, resuming his marvelous
dream, he repassed by the same road by which the vision, at once so terrible
and sweet, had led him before; for after having gently closed his eyes, he
reopened them and began to smile: he had just seen Raoul, who had smiled upon
him.  With his hands joined upon his
breast, his face turned towards the window, bathed by the fresh air of night,
which brought upon its wings the aroma of the flowers and the woods, Athos entered,
never again to come out of it, into the contemplation of that paradise which
the living never see.  God willed, no
doubt, to open to this elect the treasures of eternal beatitude, at this hour
when other men tremble with the idea of being severely received by the Lord,
and cling to this life they know, in the dread of the other life of which they
get but merest glimpses by the dismal murky torch of death.  Athos was spirit-guided by the pure serene
soul of his son, which aspired to be like the paternal soul.  Everything for this just man was melody and
perfume in the rough road souls take to return to the celestial country.  After an hour of this ecstasy, Athos softly
raised his hands as white as wax; the smile did not quit his lips, and he
murmured low, so low as scarcely to be audible, these three words addressed to
God or to Raoul:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;HERE
I AM!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                And his
hands fell slowly, as though he himself had laid them on the bed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Death
had been kind and mild to this noble creature. 
It had spared him the tortures of the agony, convulsions of the last
departure; had opened with an indulgent finger the gates of eternity to that
noble soul.  God had no doubt ordered it
thus that the pious remembrance of this death should remain in the hearts of
those present, and in the memory of other men - a death which caused to be
loved the passage from this life to the other by those whose existence upon
this earth leads them not to dread the last judgment.  Athos preserved, even in the eternal sleep, that placid and
sincere smile - an ornament which was to accompany him to the tomb.  The quietude and calm of his fine features
made his servants for a long time doubt whether he had really quitted
life.  The comte's people wished to
remove Grimaud, who, from a distance, devoured the face now quickly growing
marble-pale, and did not approach, from pious fear of bringing to him the
breath of death.  But Grimaud, fatigued
as he was, refused to leave the room. 
He sat himself down upon the threshold, watching his master with the
vigilance of a sentinel, jealous to receive either his first waking look or his
last dying sigh.  The noises all were
quiet in the house - every one respected the slumber of their lord.  But Grimaud, by anxiously listening,
perceived that the comte no longer breathed. 
He raised himself with his hands leaning on the ground, looked to see if
there did not appear some motion in the body of his master.  Nothing! 
Fear seized him; he rose completely up, and, at the very moment, heard
some one coming up the stairs.  A noise
of spurs knocking against a sword - a warlike sound familiar to his ears -
stopped him as he was going towards the bed of Athos.  A voice more sonorous than brass or steel resounded within three
paces of him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Athos!  Athos! my friend!&quot; cried this voice,
agitated even to tears.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur
le Chevalier d'Artagnan,&quot; faltered out Grimaud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Where
is he?  Where is he?&quot; continued the
musketeer.  Grimaud seized his arm in
his bony fingers, and pointed to the bed, upon the sheets of which the livid
tints of death already showed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                A
choked respiration, the opposite to a sharp cry, swelled the throat of
D'Artagnan.  He advanced on tip-toe,
trembling, frightened at the noise his feet made on the floor, his heart rent
by a nameless agony.  He placed his ear
to the breast of Athos, his face to the comte's mouth.  Neither noise, nor breath!  D'Artagnan drew back.  Grimaud, who had followed him with his eyes,
and for whom each of his movements had been a revelation, came timidly; seated
himself at the foot of the bed, and glued his lips to the sheet which was
raised by the stiffened feet of his master. 
Then large drops began to flow from his red eyes.  This old man in invincible despair, who
wept, bent doubled without uttering a word, presented the most touching
spectacle that D'Artagnan, in a life so filled with emotion, had ever met with.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
captain resumed standing in contemplation before that smiling dead man, who
seemed to have burnished his last thought, to give his best friend, the man he
had loved next to Raoul, a gracious welcome even beyond life.  And for reply to that exalted flattery of
hospitality, D'Artagnan went and kissed Athos fervently on the brow, and with
his trembling fingers closed his eyes. 
Then he seated himself by the pillow without dread of that dead man, who
had been so kind and affectionate to him for five and thirty years.  He was feeding his soul with the
remembrances the noble visage of the comte brought to his mind in crowds - some
blooming and charming as that smile - some dark, dismal, and icy as that visage
with its eyes now closed to all eternity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                All at
once the bitter flood which mounted from minute to minute invaded his heart,
and swelled his breast almost to bursting. 
Incapable of mastering his emotion, he arose, and tearing himself
violently from the chamber where he had just found dead him to whom he came to
report the news of the death of Porthos, he uttered sobs so heart-rending that
the servants, who seemed only to wait for an explosion of grief, answered to it
by their lugubrious clamors, and the dogs of the late comte by their lamentable
howlings.  Grimaud was the only one who
did not lift up his voice.  Even in the
paroxysm of his grief he would not have dared to profane the dead, or for the
first time disturb the slumber of his master. 
Had not Athos always bidden him be dumb?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At
daybreak D'Artagnan, who had wandered about the lower hall, biting his fingers
to stifle his sighs - D'Artagnan went up once more; and watching the moments
when Grimaud turned his head towards him, he made him a sign to come to him,
which the faithful servant obeyed without making more noise than a shadow.  D'Artagnan went down again, followed by
Grimaud; and when he had gained the vestibule, taking the old man's hands,
&quot;Grimaud,&quot; said he, &quot;I have seen how the father died; now let me
know about the son.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Grimaud
drew from his breast a large letter, upon the envelope of which was traced the
address of Athos.  He recognized the
writing of M. de Beaufort, broke the seal, and began to read, while walking
about in the first steel-chill rays of dawn, in the dark alley of old limes,
marked by the still visible footsteps of the comte who had just died.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>&quot;LE DUC DE
BEAUFORT.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
letter contained a relation written by one of the prince's secretaries.  It was the most touching recital, and the
most true, of that dismal episode which unraveled two existences.  D'Artagnan, accustomed to battle emotions,
and with a heart armed against tenderness, could not help starting on reading
the name of Raoul, the name of that beloved boy who had become a shade now -
like his father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
the morning,&quot; said the prince's secretary, &quot;monseigneur commanded the
attack.  Normandy and Picardy had taken
positions in the rocks dominated by the heights of the mountain, upon the
declivity of which were raised the bastions of Gigelli.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
cannon opened the action; the regiments marched full of resolution; the pikemen
with pikes elevated, the musket-bearers with their weapons ready.  The prince followed attentively the march
and movements of the troops, so as to be able to sustain them with a strong
reserve.  With monseigneur were the
oldest captains and his aides-de-camp. 
M. le Vicomte de Bragelonne had received orders not to leave his
highness.  In the meantime the enemy's
cannon, which at first thundered with little success against the masses, began
to regulate their fire, and the balls, better directed, killed several men near
the prince.  The regiments formed in
column, and, advancing against the ramparts, were rather roughly handled.  There was a sort of hesitation in our
troops, who found themselves ill-seconded by the artillery.  In fact, the batteries which had been
established the evening before had but a weak and uncertain aim, on account of
their position.  The upward direction of
the aim lessened the justness of the shots as well as their range.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur,
comprehending the bad effect of this position on the siege artillery, commanded
the frigates moored in the little road to commence a regular fire against the
place.  M. de Bragelonne offered himself
at once to carry this order.  But
monseigneur refused to acquiesce in the vicomte's request.  Monseigneur was right, for he loved and
wished to spare the young nobleman.  He
was quite right, and the event took upon itself to justify his foresight and
refusal; for scarcely had the sergeant charged with the message solicited by M.
de Bragelonne gained the seashore, when two shots from long carbines issued
from the enemy's ranks and laid him low. 
The sergeant fell, dyeing the sand with his blood; observing which, M.
de Bragelonne smiled at monseigneur, who said to him, 'You see, vicomte, I have
saved your life.  Report that, some day,
to M. le Comte de la Fère, in order that, learning it from you, he may thank
me.'  The young nobleman smiled sadly,
and replied to the duke, 'It is true, monseigneur, that but for your kindness I
should have been killed, where the poor sergeant has fallen, and should be at
rest.'  M. de Bragelonne made this reply
in such a tone that monseigneur answered him warmly, '<i>Vrai Dieu!</i>  Young man, one
would say that your mouth waters for death; but, by the soul of Henry IV., I
have promised your father to bring you back alive; and, please the Lord, I mean
to keep my word.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur
de Bragelonne colored, and replied, in a lower voice, 'Monseigneur, pardon me,
I beseech you.  I have always had a
desire to meet good opportunities; and it is so delightful to distinguish
ourselves before our general, particularly when that general is M. le Duc de
Beaufort.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur
was a little softened by this; and, turning to the officers who surrounded him,
gave different orders.  The grenadiers
of the two regiments got near enough to the ditches and intrenchments to launch
their grenades, which had but small effect. 
In the meanwhile, M. d'Estrées, who commanded the fleet, having seen the
attempt of the sergeant to approach the vessels, understood that he must act
without orders, and opened fire.  Then
the Arabs, finding themselves seriously injured by the balls from the fleet,
and beholding the destruction and the ruin of their walls, uttered the most fearful
cries.  Their horsemen descended the
mountain at a gallop, bent over their saddles, and rushed full tilt upon the
columns of infantry, which, crossing their pikes, stopped this mad
assault.  Repulsed by the firm attitude
of the battalion, the Arabs threw themselves with fury towards the <i>état-major</i>, which was not on its guard
at that moment.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
danger was great; monseigneur drew his sword; his secretaries and people
imitated him; the officers of the suite engaged in combat with the furious
Arabs.  It was then M. de Bragelonne was
able to satisfy the inclination he had so clearly shown from the commencement
of the action.  He fought near the
prince with the valor of a Roman, and killed three Arabs with his small
sword.  But it was evident that his
bravery did not arise from that sentiment of pride so natural to all who
fight.  It was impetuous, affected, even
forced; he sought to glut, intoxicate himself with strife and carnage.  He excited himself to such a degree that
monseigneur called to him to stop.  He
must have heard the voice of monseigneur, because we who were close to him
heard it.  He did not, however, stop,
but continued his course to the intrenchments. 
As M. de Bragelonne was a well-disciplined officer, this disobedience to
the orders of monseigneur very much surprised everybody, and M. de Beaufort
redoubled his earnestness, crying, 'Stop, Bragelonne!  Where are you going? 
Stop,' repeated monseigneur, 'I command you!'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;We
all, imitating the gesture of M. le duc, we all raised our hands.  We expected that the cavalier would turn bridle;
but M. de Bragelonne continued to ride towards the palisades.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;'Stop,
Bragelonne!' repeated the prince, in a very loud voice, 'stop! in the name of
your father!'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;At
these words M. de Bragelonne turned round; his countenance expressed a lively
grief, but he did not stop; we then concluded that his horse must have run away
with him.  When M. le duc saw cause to
conclude that the vicomte was no longer master of his horse, and had watched
him precede the first grenadiers, his highness cried, 'Musketeers, kill his
horse!  A hundred pistoles for the man
who kills his horse!'  But who could
expect to hit the beast without at least wounding his rider?  No one dared the attempt.  At length one presented himself; he was a
sharp-shooter of the regiment of Picardy, named Luzerne, who took aim at the
animal, fired, and hit him in the quarters, for we saw the blood redden the
hair of the horse.  Instead of falling,
the cursed jennet was irritated, and carried him on more furiously than
ever.  Every Picard who saw this
unfortunate young man rushing on to meet certain death, shouted in the loudest
manner, 'Throw yourself off, monsieur le vicomte! - off! - off! throw yourself
off!'  M. de Bragelonne was an officer
much beloved in the army.  Already had
the vicomte arrived within pistol-shot of the ramparts, when a discharge was
poured upon him that enshrouded him in fire and smoke.  We lost sight of him; the smoke dispersed;
he was on foot, upright; his horse was killed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
vicomte was summoned to surrender by the Arabs, but he made them a negative
sign with his head, and continued to march towards the palisades.  This was a mortal imprudence.  Nevertheless the entire army was pleased that
he would not retreat, since ill-chance had led him so near.  He marched a few paces further, and the two
regiments clapped their hands.  It was
at this moment the second discharge shook the walls, and the Vicomte de
Bragelonne again disappeared in the smoke; but this time the smoke dispersed in
vain; we no longer saw him standing.  He
was down, with his head lower than his legs, among the bushes, and the Arabs
began to think of leaving their intrenchments to come and cut off his head or
take his body - as is the custom with the infidels.  But Monseigneur le Duc de Beaufort had followed all this with his
eyes, and the sad spectacle drew from him many painful sighs.  He then cried aloud, seeing the Arabs
running like white phantoms among the mastic-trees, 'Grenadiers! lancers! will
you let them take that noble body?'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Saying
these words and waving his sword, he himself rode towards the enemy.  The regiments, rushing in his steps, ran in
their turn, uttering cries as terrible as those of the Arabs were wild.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
combat commenced over the body of M. de Bragelonne, and with such inveteracy
was it fought that a hundred and sixty Arabs were left upon the field, by the
side of at least fifty of our troops. 
It was a lieutenant from Normandy who took the body of the vicomte on
his shoulders and carried it back to the lines.  The advantage was, however, pursued, the regiments took the
reserve with them, and the enemy's palisades were utterly destroyed.  At three o'clock the fire of the Arabs
ceased; the hand-to-hand fight lasted two hours; it was a massacre.  At five o'clock we were victorious at all
points; the enemy had abandoned his positions, and M. le duc ordered the white
flag to be planted on the summit of the little mountain.  It was then we had time to think of M. de
Bragelonne, who had eight large wounds in his body, through which almost all
his blood had welled away.  Still,
however, he had breathed, which afforded inexpressible joy to monseigneur, who
insisted on being present at the first dressing of the wounds and the
consultation of the surgeons.  There
were two among them who declared M. de Bragelonne would live.  Monseigneur threw his arms around their
necks, and promised them a thousand louis each if they could save him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
vicomte heard these transports of joy, and whether he was in despair, or
whether he suffered much from his wounds, he expressed by his countenance a
contradiction, which gave rise to reflection, particularly in one of the
secretaries when he had heard what follows. 
The third surgeon was the brother of Sylvain de Saint-Cosme, the most
learned of them all.  He probed the
wounds in his turn, and said nothing. 
M. de Bragelonne fixed his eyes steadily upon the skillful surgeon, and
seemed to interrogate his every movement. 
The latter, upon being questioned by monseigneur, replied that he saw
plainly three mortal wounds out of eight, but so strong was the constitution of
the wounded, so rich was he in youth, and so merciful was the goodness of God,
that perhaps M. de Bragelonne might recover, particularly if he did not move in
the slightest manner.  Frère Sylvain
added, turning towards his assistants, 'Above everything, do not allow him to
move, even a finger, or you will kill him;' and we all left the tent in very
low spirits.  That secretary I have
mentioned, on leaving the tent, thought he perceived a faint and sad smile
glide over the lips of M. de Bragelonne when the duke said to him, in a
cheerful, kind voice, 'We will save you, vicomte, we will save you yet.'</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;In
the evening, when it was believed the wounded youth had taken some repose, one
of the assistants entered his tent, but rushed out again immediately, uttering
loud cries.  We all ran up in disorder,
M. le duc with us, and the assistant pointed to the body of M. de Bragelonne
upon the ground, at the foot of his bed, bathed in the remainder of his blood.  It appeared that he had suffered some
convulsion, some delirium, and that he had fallen; that the fall had
accelerated his end, according to the prognosis of Frère Sylvain.  We raised the vicomte; he was cold and
dead.  He held a lock of fair hair in his
right hand, and that hand was tightly pressed upon his heart.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Then
followed the details of the expedition, and of the victory obtained over the
Arabs.  D'Artagnan stopped at the
account of the death of poor Raoul. 
&quot;Oh!&quot; murmured he, &quot;unhappy boy! a suicide!&quot;  And turning his eyes towards the chamber of
the château, in which Athos slept in eternal sleep, &quot;They kept their words
with each other,&quot; said he, in a low voice; &quot;now I believe them to be
happy; they must be reunited.&quot;  And
he returned through the parterre with slow and melancholy steps.  All the village - all the neighborhood -
were filled with grieving neighbors relating to each other the double
catastrophe, and making preparations for the funeral.</p>

the morrow, all the <i>noblesse</i> of the
provinces, of the environs, and wherever messengers had carried the news, might
have been seen arriving in detachments. 
D'Artagnan had shut himself up, without being willing to speak to
anybody.  Two such heavy deaths falling
upon the captain, so closely after the death of Porthos, for a long time
oppressed that spirit which had hitherto been so indefatigable and
invulnerable.  Except Grimaud, who
entered his chamber once, the musketeer saw neither servants nor guests.  He supposed, from the noises in the house,
and the continual coming and going, that preparations were being made for the
funeral of the comte.  He wrote to the
king to ask for an extension of his leave of absence.  Grimaud, as we have said, had entered D'Artagnan's apartment, had
seated himself upon a joint-stool near the door, like a man who meditates
profoundly; then, rising, he made a sign to D'Artagnan to follow him.  The latter obeyed in silence.  Grimaud descended to the comte's
bed-chamber, showed the captain with his finger the place of the empty bed, and
raised his eyes eloquently towards Heaven.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,&quot;
replied D'Artagnan, &quot;yes, good Grimaud - now with the son he loved so
much!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Grimaud
left the chamber, and led the way to the hall, where, according to the custom
of the province, the body was laid out, previously to being put away
forever.  D'Artagnan was struck at
seeing two open coffins in the hall.  In
reply to the mute invitation of Grimaud, he approached, and saw in one of them
Athos, still handsome in death, and, in the other, Raoul with his eyes closed,
his cheeks pearly as those of the Palls of Virgil, with a smile on his violet
lips.  He shuddered at seeing the father
and son, those two departed souls, represented on earth by two silent, melancholy
bodies, incapable of touching each other, however close they might be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Raoul
here!&quot; murmured he.  &quot;Oh!  Grimaud, why did you not tell me this?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Grimaud
shook his head, and made no reply; but taking D'Artagnan by the hand, he led
him to the coffin, and showed him, under the thin winding-sheet, the black
wounds by which life had escaped.  The
captain turned away his eyes, and, judging it was useless to question Grimaud,
who would not answer, he recollected that M. de Beaufort's secretary had
written more than he, D'Artagnan, had had the courage to read.  Taking up the recital of the affair which
had cost Raoul his life, he found these words, which ended the concluding
paragraph of the letter:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monseigneur
le duc has ordered that the body of monsieur le vicomte should be embalmed,
after the manner practiced by the Arabs when they wish their dead to be carried
to their native land; and monsieur le duc has appointed relays, so that the
same confidential servant who brought up the young man might take back his
remains to M. le Comte de la Fère.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
so,&quot; thought D'Artagnan, &quot;I shall follow thy funeral, my dear boy -
I, already old - I, who am of no value on earth - and I shall scatter dust upon
that brow I kissed but two months since. 
God has willed it to be so.  Thou
hast willed it to be so, thyself.  I
have no longer the right even to weep. 
Thou hast chosen death; it seemed to thee a preferable gift to
life.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At
length arrived the moment when the chill remains of these two gentlemen were to
be given back to mother earth.  There
was such an affluence of military and other people that up to the place of the
sepulture, which was a little chapel on the plain, the road from the city was
filled with horsemen and pedestrians in mourning.  Athos had chosen for his resting-place the little inclosure of a
chapel erected by himself near the boundary of his estates.  He had had the stones, cut in 1550, brought
from an old Gothic manor-house in Berry, which had sheltered his early
youth.  The chapel, thus rebuilt,
transported, was pleasing to the eye beneath its leafy curtains of poplars and
sycamores.  It was ministered in every
Sunday, by the curé of the neighboring bourg, to whom Athos paid an allowance
of two hundred francs for this service; and all the vassals of his domain, with
their families, came thither to hear mass, without having any occasion to go to
the city.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Behind
the chapel extended, surrounded by two high hedges of hazel, elder and white
thorn, and a deep ditch, the little inclosure - uncultivated, though gay in its
sterility; because the mosses there grew thick, wild heliotrope and ravenelles
there mingled perfumes, while from beneath an ancient chestnut issued a crystal
spring, a prisoner in its marble cistern, and on the thyme all around alighted
thousands of bees from the neighboring plants, whilst chaffinches and
redthroats sang cheerfully among the flower-spangled hedges.  It was to this place the somber coffins were
carried, attended by a silent and respectful crowd.  The office of the dead being celebrated, the last adieux paid to
the noble departed, the assembly dispersed, talking, along the roads, of the
virtues and mild death of the father, of the hopes the son had given, and of
his melancholy end upon the arid coast of Africa.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Little
by little, all noises were extinguished, like the lamps illuminating the humble
nave.  The minister bowed for the last
time to the altar and the still fresh graves; then, followed by his assistant,
he slowly took the road back to the presbytery.  D'Artagnan, left alone, perceived that night was coming on.  He had forgotten the hour, thinking only of
the dead.  He arose from the oaken bench
on which he was seated in the chapel, and wished, as the priest had done, to go
and bid a last adieu to the double grave which contained his two lost friends.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                A woman
was praying, kneeling on the moist earth. 
D'Artagnan stopped at the door of the chapel, to avoid disturbing her,
and also to endeavor to find out who was the pious friend who performed this
sacred duty with so much zeal and perseverance.  The unknown had hidden her face in her hands, which were white as
alabaster.  From the noble simplicity of
her costume, she must be a woman of distinction.  Outside the inclosure were several horses mounted by servants; a
travelling carriage was in waiting for this lady.  D'Artagnan in vain sought to make out what caused her delay.  She continued praying, and frequently
pressed her handkerchief to her face, by which D'Artagnan perceived she was
weeping.  He beheld her strike her
breast with the compunction of a Christian woman.  He heard her several times exclaim as from a wounded heart:
&quot;Pardon! pardon!&quot;  And as she
appeared to abandon herself entirely to her grief, as she threw herself down,
almost fainting, exhausted by complaints and prayers, D'Artagnan, touched by
this love for his so much regretted friends, made a few steps towards the
grave, in order to interrupt the melancholy colloquy of the penitent with the
dead.  But as soon as his step sounded
on the gravel, the unknown raised her head, revealing to D'Artagnan a face
aflood with tears, a well-known face. 
It was Mademoiselle de la Vallière! 
&quot;Monsieur d'Artagnan!&quot; murmured she.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You!&quot;
replied the captain, in a stern voice, &quot;you here! - oh! madame, I should
better have liked to see you decked with flowers in the mansion of the Comte de
la Fère.  You would have wept less - and
they too - and I!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Monsieur!&quot;
said she, sobbing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;For
it was you,&quot; added this pitiless friend of the dead, - &quot;it was you
who sped these two men to the grave.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
spare me!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;God
forbid, madame, that I should offend a woman, or that I should make her weep in
vain; but I must say that the place of the murderer is not upon the grave of
her victims.&quot;  She wished to reply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;What
I now tell you,&quot; added he, coldly, &quot;I have already told the
king.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                She
clasped her hands.  &quot;I know,&quot;
said she, &quot;I have caused the death of the Vicomte de Bragelonne.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
you know it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
news arrived at court yesterday.  I have
traveled during the night forty leagues to come and ask pardon of the comte,
whom I supposed to be still living, and to pray God, on the tomb of Raoul, that
he would send me all the misfortunes I have merited, except a single one.  Now, monsieur, I know that the death of the
son has killed the father; I have two crimes to reproach myself with; I have
two punishments to expect from Heaven.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;I
will repeat to you, mademoiselle,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;what M. de
Bragelonne said of you, at Antibes, when he already meditated death: 'If pride
and coquetry have misled her, I pardon her while despising her.  If love has produced her error, I pardon
her, but I swear that no one could have loved her as I have done.'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
know,&quot; interrupted Louise, &quot;that of my love I was about to sacrifice
myself; you know whether I suffered when you met me lost, dying,
abandoned.  Well! never have I suffered
so much as now; because then I hoped, desired, - now I have no longer anything
to wish for; because this death drags all my joy into the tomb; because I can
no longer dare to love without remorse, and I feel that he whom I love - oh! it
is but just! - will repay me with the tortures I have made others
undergo.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
made no reply; he was too well convinced that she was not mistaken.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Well,
then,&quot; added she, &quot;dear Monsieur d'Artagnan, do not overwhelm me
to-day, I again implore you!  I am like
the branch torn from the trunk, I no longer hold to anything in this world - a
current drags me on, I know not whither. 
I love madly, even to the point of coming to tell it, wretch that I am,
over the ashes of the dead, and I do not blush for it - I have no remorse on
this account.  Such love is a
religion.  Only, as hereafter you will
see me alone, forgotten, disdained; as you will see me punished, as I am destined
to be punished, spare me in my ephemeral happiness, leave it to me for a few
days, for a few minutes.  Now, even at
the moment I am speaking to you, perhaps it no longer exists.  My God! this double murder is perhaps
already expiated!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                While
she was speaking thus, the sound of voices and of horses drew the attention of
the captain.  M. de Saint-Aignan came to
seek La Vallière.  &quot;The king,&quot;
he said, &quot;is a prey to jealousy and uneasiness.&quot;  Saint-Aignan did not perceive D'Artagnan,
half concealed by the trunk of a chestnut-tree which shaded the double
grave.  Louise thanked Saint-Aignan, and
dismissed him with a gesture.  He
rejoined the party outside the inclosure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
see, madame,&quot; said the captain bitterly to the young woman, - &quot;you
see your happiness still lasts.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
young woman raised her head with a solemn air. 
&quot;A day will come,&quot; said she, &quot;when you will repent of
having so misjudged me.  On that day, it
is I who will pray God to forgive you for having been unjust towards me.  Besides, I shall suffer so much that you
yourself will be the first to pity my sufferings.  Do not reproach me with my fleeting happiness, Monsieur
d'Artagnan; it costs me dear, and I have not paid all my debt.&quot;  Saying these words, she again knelt down,
softly and affectionately.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Pardon
me the last time, my affianced Raoul!&quot; said she.  &quot;I have broken our chain; we are both destined to die of
grief.  It is thou who departest first;
fear nothing, I shall follow thee.  See,
only, that I have not been base, and that I have come to bid thee this last
adieu.  The Lord is my witness, Raoul,
that if with my life I could have redeemed thine, I would have given that life
without hesitation.  I could not give my
love.  Once more, forgive me, dearest,
kindest friend.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                She
strewed a few sweet flowers on the freshly sodded earth; then, wiping the tears
from her eyes, the heavily stricken lady bowed to D'Artagnan, and disappeared.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
captain watched the departure of the horses, horsemen, and carriage, then
crossing his arms upon his swelling chest, &quot;When will it be my turn to
depart?&quot; said he, in an agitated voice. 
&quot;What is there left for man after youth, love, glory, friendship,
strength, and wealth have disappeared? 
That rock, under which sleeps Porthos, who possessed all I have named;
this moss, under which repose Athos and Raoul, who possessed much more!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He
hesitated for a moment, with a dull eye; then, drawing himself up,
&quot;Forward! still forward!&quot; said he. 
&quot;When it is time, God will tell me, as he foretold the
others.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He touched
the earth, moistened with the evening dew, with the ends of his fingers, signed
himself as if he had been at the <i>bénitier</i>
in church, and retook alone - ever alone - the road to Paris.</p>

scene we have just described, two horsemen, well mounted, traversed Blois early
in the morning, for the purpose of arranging a hawking party the king had
arranged to make in that uneven plain the Loire divides in two, which borders
on the one side Meung, on the other Amboise. 
These were the keeper of the king's harriers and the master of the
falcons, personages greatly respected in the time of Louis XIII., but rather
neglected by his successor.  The
horsemen, having reconnoitered the ground, were returning, their observations
made, when they perceived certain little groups of soldiers, here and there,
whom the sergeants were placing at distances at the openings of the
inclosures.  These were the king's
musketeers.  Behind them came, upon a
splendid horse, the captain, known by his richly embroidered uniform.  His hair was gray, his beard turning
so.  He seemed a little bent, although
sitting and handling his horse gracefully. 
He was looking about him watchfully.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;M.
d'Artagnan does not get any older,&quot; said the keeper of the harriers to his
colleague the falconer; &quot;with ten years more to carry than either of us,
he has the seat of a young man on horseback.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;That
is true,&quot; replied the falconer. 
&quot;I don't see any change in him for the last twenty years.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                But
this officer was mistaken; D'Artagnan in the last four years had lived a
dozen.  Age had printed its pitiless
claws at each angle of his eyes; his brow was bald; his hands, formerly brown
and nervous, were getting white, as if the blood had half forgotten them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
accosted the officers with the shade of affability which distinguishes
superiors, and received in turn for his courtesy two most respectful bows.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
what a lucky chance to see you here, Monsieur d'Artagnan!&quot; cried the
falconer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;It
is rather I who should say that, messieurs,&quot; replied the captain,
&quot;for nowadays, the king makes more frequent use of his musketeers than of
his falcons.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
it is not as it was in the good old times,&quot; sighed the falconer.  &quot;Do you remember, Monsieur d'Artagnan,
when the late king flew the pie in the vineyards beyond Beaugence?  Ah! <i>dame!</i>
you were not the captain of the musketeers at that time, Monsieur
d'Artagnan.&quot; <b><sup>7</sup></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
you were nothing but under-corporal of the tiercelets,&quot; replied
D'Artagnan, laughing.  &quot;Never mind
that, it was a good time, seeing that it is always a good time when we are
young.  Good day, monsieur the keeper of
the harriers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;You
do me honor, monsieur le comte,&quot; said the latter.  D'Artagnan made no reply.  The title of comte had hardly struck him;
D'Artagnan had been a comte four years.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Are
you not very much fatigued with the long journey you have taken, monsieur le
capitaine?&quot; continued the falconer. 
&quot;It must be full two hundred leagues from hence to Pignerol.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Two
hundred and sixty to go, and as many to return,&quot; said D'Artagnan, quietly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And,&quot;
said the falconer, &quot;is <i>he</i>
well?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who?&quot;
asked D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Why,
poor M. Fouquet,&quot; continued the falconer, in a low voice.  The keeper of the harriers had prudently
withdrawn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;No,&quot;
replied D'Artagnan, &quot;the poor man frets terribly; he cannot comprehend how
imprisonment can be a favor; he says that parliament absolved him by banishing
him, and banishment is, or should be, liberty. 
He cannot imagine that they had sworn his death, and that to save his
life from the claws of parliament was to be under too much obligation to
Heaven.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!
yes; the poor man had a close chance of the scaffold,&quot; replied the
falconer; &quot;it is said that M. Colbert had given orders to the governor of
the Bastile, and that the execution was ordered.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Enough!&quot;
said D'Artagnan, pensively, and with a view of cutting short the conversation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Yes,&quot;
said the keeper of the harriers, drawing towards them, &quot;M. Fouquet is now
at Pignerol; he has richly deserved it. 
He had the good fortune to be conducted there by you; he robbed the king
sufficiently.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
launched at the master of the dogs one of his crossest looks, and said to him,
&quot;Monsieur, if any one told me you had eaten your dogs' meat, not only
would I refuse to believe it; but still more, if you were condemned to the lash
or to jail for it, I should pity you and would not allow people to speak ill of
you.  And yet, monsieur, honest man as
you may be, I assure you that you are not more so than poor M. Fouquet
was.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                After
having undergone this sharp rebuke, the keeper of the harriers hung his head,
and allowed the falconer to get two steps in advance of him nearer to
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;He
is content,&quot; said the falconer, in a low voice, to the musketeer; &quot;we
all know that harriers are in fashion nowadays; if he were a falconer he would
not talk in that way.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
smiled in a melancholy manner at seeing this great political question resolved
by the discontent of such humble interest. 
He for a moment ran over in his mind the glorious existence of the
surintendant, the crumbling of his fortunes, and the melancholy death that
awaited him; and to conclude, &quot;Did M. Fouquet love falconry?&quot; said
he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh,
passionately, monsieur!&quot; repeated the falconer, with an accent of bitter
regret and a sigh that was the funeral oration of Fouquet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
allowed the ill-humor of the one and the regret of the other to pass, and
continued to advance.  They could
already catch glimpses of the huntsmen at the issue of the wood, the feathers
of the outriders passing like shooting stars across the clearings, and the
white horses skirting the bosky thickets looking like illuminated apparitions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;But,&quot;
resumed D'Artagnan, &quot;will the sport last long?  Pray, give us a good swift bird, for I am very tired.  Is it a heron or a swan?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Both,
Monsieur d'Artagnan,&quot; said the falconer; &quot;but you need not be
alarmed; the king is not much of a sportsman; he does not take the field on his
own account, he only wishes to amuse the ladies.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
words &quot;to amuse the ladies&quot; were so strongly accented they set
D'Artagnan thinking.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
said he, looking keenly at the falconer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
keeper of the harriers smiled, no doubt with a view of making it up with the
musketeer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Oh!
you may safely laugh,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;I know nothing of current
news; I only arrived yesterday, after a month's absence.  I left the court mourning the death of the
queen-mother.  The king was not willing
to take any amusement after receiving the last sigh of Anne of Austria; but
everything comes to an end in this world. 
Well! then he is no longer sad? 
So much the better.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;And
everything begins as well as ends,&quot; said the keeper with a coarse laugh. <b><sup>8</sup></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Ah!&quot;
said D'Artagnan, a second time, - he burned to know, but dignity would not
allow him to interrogate people below him, - &quot;there is something
beginning, then, it seems?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
keeper gave him a significant wink; but D'Artagnan was unwilling to learn
anything from this man.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Shall
we see the king early?&quot; asked he of the falconer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;At
seven o'clock, monsieur, I shall fly the birds.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Who
comes with the king?  How is
Madame?  How is the queen?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Better,
monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;Has she been ill, then?&quot;<br>
&quot;Monsieur, since the last chagrin she suffered, her majesty has been
unwell.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>&quot;What chagrin?  You need not fancy your news is old.  I have but just returned.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It appears that the queen, a
little neglected since the death of her mother-in-law, complained to the king,
who answered her, - 'Do I not sleep at home every night, madame?  What more do you expect?'&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah!&quot; said D'Artagnan, -
&quot;poor woman!  She must heartily
hate Mademoiselle de la Vallière.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh, no! not Mademoiselle de
la Vallière,&quot; replied the falconer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Who then - &quot;  The blast of a hunting-horn interrupted this
conversation.  It summoned the dogs and
the hawks.  The falconer and his
companions set off immediately, leaving D'Artagnan alone in the midst of the
suspended sentence.  The king appeared
at a distance, surrounded by ladies and horsemen.  All the troop advanced in beautiful order, at a foot's pace, the
horns of various sorts animating the dogs and horses.  There was an animation in the scene, a mirage of light, of which
nothing now can give an idea, unless it be the fictitious splendor of a theatric
spectacle.  D'Artagnan, with an eye a
little, just a little, dimmed by age, distinguished behind the group three
carriages.  The first was intended for
the queen; it was empty.  D'Artagnan,
who did not see Mademoiselle de la Vallière by the king's side, on looking
about for her, saw her in the second carriage. 
She was alone with two of her women, who seemed as dull as their
mistress.  On the left hand of the king,
upon a high-spirited horse, restrained by a bold and skillful hand, shone a
lady of most dazzling beauty.  The king
smiled upon her, and she smiled upon the king. 
Loud laughter followed every word she uttered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I must know that woman,&quot;
thought the musketeer; &quot;who can she be?&quot;  And he stooped towards his friend, the falconer, to whom he
addressed the question he had put to himself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The falconer was about to reply,
when the king, perceiving D'Artagnan, &quot;Ah, comte!&quot; said he, &quot;you
are amongst us once more then!  Why have
I not seen you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Sire,&quot; replied the
captain, &quot;because your majesty was asleep when I arrived, and not awake
when I resumed my duties this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Still the same,&quot; said
Louis, in a loud voice, denoting satisfaction. 
&quot;Take some rest, comte; I command you to do so.  You will dine with me to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>A murmur of admiration surrounded D'Artagnan
like a caress.  Every one was eager to
salute him.  Dining with the king was an
honor his majesty was not so prodigal of as Henry IV. had been.  The king passed a few steps in advance, and
D'Artagnan found himself in the midst of a fresh group, among whom shone
Colbert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Good-day, Monsieur
d'Artagnan,&quot; said the minister, with marked affability, &quot;have you had
a pleasant journey?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, monsieur,&quot; said
D'Artagnan, bowing to the neck of his horse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I heard the king invite you
to his table for this evening,&quot; continued the minister; &quot;you will
meet an old friend there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;An old friend of mine?&quot;
asked D'Artagnan, plunging painfully into the dark waves of the past, which had
swallowed up for him so many friendships and so many hatreds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;M. le Duc d'Alméda, who is
arrived this morning from Spain.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The Duc d'Alméda?&quot; said
D'Artagnan, reflecting in vain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Here!&quot; cried an old man,
white as snow, sitting bent in his carriage, which he caused to be thrown open
to make room for the musketeer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;<i>Aramis!</i>&quot; cried D'Artagnan, struck with profound
amazement.  And he felt, inert as it
was, the thin arm of the old nobleman hanging round his neck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert, after having observed them
in silence for a few moments, urged his horse forward, and left the two old
friends together.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And so,&quot; said the
musketeer, taking Aramis's arm, &quot;you, the exile, the rebel, are again in
France?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah! and I shall dine with you
at the king's table,&quot; said Aramis, smiling.  &quot;Yes, will you not ask yourself what is the use of fidelity
in this world?  Stop! let us allow poor
La Vallière's carriage to pass.  Look,
how uneasy she is!  How her eyes, dim
with tears, follow the king, who is riding on horseback yonder!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;With whom?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;With Mademoiselle de
Tonnay-Charente, now Madame de Montespan,&quot; replied Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;She is jealous.  Is she then deserted?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Not quite yet, but it will
not be long before she <i>is</i>.&quot;  <b><sup>9</sup></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>They chatted together, while
following the sport, and Aramis's coachman drove them so cleverly that they
arrived at the instant when the falcon, attacking the bird, beat him down, and
fell upon him.  The king alighted;
Madame de Montespan followed his example. 
They were in front of an isolated chapel, concealed by huge trees,
already despoiled of their leaves by the first cutting winds of autumn.  Behind this chapel was an inclosure, closed
by a latticed gate.  The falcon had
beaten down his prey in the inclosure belonging to this little chapel, and the
king was desirous of going in to take the first feather, according to
custom.  The <i>cortège</i> formed a circle round the building and the hedges, too
small to receive so many.  D'Artagnan
held back Aramis by the arm, as he was about, like the rest, to alight from his
carriage, and in a hoarse, broken voice, &quot;Do you know, Aramis,&quot; said
he, &quot;whither chance has conducted us?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No,&quot; replied the duke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Here repose men that we knew
well,&quot; said D'Artagnan, greatly agitated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis, without divining anything,
and with a trembling step, penetrated into the chapel by a little door which
D'Artagnan opened for him.  &quot;Where
are they buried?&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;There, in the inclosure.  There is a cross, you see, beneath yon
little cypress.  The tree of grief is
planted over their tomb; don't go to it; the king is going that way; the heron
has fallen just there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis stopped, and concealed
himself in the shade.  They then saw,
without being seen, the pale face of La Vallière, who, neglected in her
carriage, at first looked on, with a melancholy heart, from the door, and then,
carried away by jealousy, advanced into the chapel, whence, leaning against a
pillar, she contemplated the king smiling and making signs to Madame de
Montespan to approach, as there was nothing to be afraid of.  Madame de Montespan complied; she took the
hand the king held out to her, and he, plucking out the first feather from the
heron, which the falconer had strangled, placed it in his beautiful companion's
hat.  She, smiling in her turn, kissed
the hand tenderly which made her this present. 
The king grew scarlet with vanity and pleasure; he looked at Madame de
Montespan with all the fire of new love.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What will you give me in
exchange?&quot; said he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>She broke off a little branch of
cypress and offered it to the king, who looked intoxicated with hope.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Humph!&quot; said Aramis to D'Artagnan;
&quot;the present is but a sad one, for that cypress shades a tomb.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, and the tomb is that of
Raoul de Bragelonne,&quot; said D'Artagnan aloud; &quot;of Raoul, who sleeps
under that cross with his father.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>A groan resounded - they saw a
woman fall fainting to the ground. 
Mademoiselle de la Vallière had seen all, heard all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Poor woman!&quot; muttered
D'Artagnan, as he helped the attendants to carry back to her carriage the
lonely lady whose lot henceforth in life was suffering.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>That evening D'Artagnan was seated
at the king's table, near M. Colbert and M. le Duc d'Alméda.  The king was very gay.  He paid a thousand little attentions to the
queen, a thousand kindnesses to Madame, seated at his left hand, and very
sad.  It might have been supposed that
time of calm when the king was wont to watch his mother's eyes for the approval
or disapproval of what he had just done.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Of mistresses there was no question
at this dinner.  The king addressed
Aramis two or three times, calling him M. l'ambassadeur, which increased the
surprise already felt by D'Artagnan at seeing his friend the rebel so
marvelously well received at court.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king, on rising from table,
gave his hand to the queen, and made a sign to Colbert, whose eye was on his
master's face.  Colbert took D'Artagnan
and Aramis on one side.  The king began
to chat with his sister, whilst Monsieur, very uneasy, entertained the queen
with a preoccupied air, without ceasing to watch his wife and brother from the
corner of his eye.  The conversation
between Aramis, D'Artagnan, and Colbert turned upon indifferent subjects.  They spoke of preceding ministers; Colbert
related the successful tricks of Mazarin, and desired those of Richelieu to be
related to him.  D'Artagnan could not
overcome his surprise at finding this man, with his heavy eyebrows and low
forehead, display so much sound knowledge and cheerful spirits.  Aramis was astonished at that lightness of
character which permitted this serious man to retard with advantage the moment
for more important conversation, to which nobody made any allusion, although
all three interlocutors felt its imminence. 
It was very plain, from the embarrassed appearance of Monsieur, how much
the conversation of the king and Madame annoyed him.  Madame's eyes were almost red: was she going to complain?  Was she going to expose a little scandal in
open court?  The king took her on one
side, and in a tone so tender that it must have reminded the princess of the time
when she was loved for herself:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Sister,&quot; said he,
&quot;why do I see tears in those lovely eyes?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Why - sire - &quot; said she.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur is jealous, is he
not, sister?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>She looked towards Monsieur, an
infallible sign that they were talking about him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes,&quot; said she.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Listen to me,&quot; said the
king; &quot;if your friends compromise you, it is not Monsieur's fault.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>He spoke these words with so much
kindness that Madame, encouraged, having borne so many solitary griefs so long,
was nearly bursting into tears, so full was her heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Come, come, dear little sister,&quot;
said the king, &quot;tell me your griefs; on the word of a brother, I pity
them; on the word of a king, I will put an end to them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>She raised her glorious eyes and,
in a melancholy tone:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It is not my friends who
compromise me,&quot; said she; &quot;they are either absent or concealed; they
have been brought into disgrace with your majesty; they, so devoted, so good,
so loyal!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You say this on account of De
Guiche, whom I have exiled, at Monsieur's desire?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And who, since that unjust
exile, has endeavored to get himself killed once every day.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Unjust, say you,
sister?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;So unjust, that if I had not
had the respect mixed with friendship that I have always entertained for your
majesty - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well!  I would have asked my brother Charles, upon
whom I can always - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The king started.  &quot;What, then?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I would have asked him to
have had it represented to you that Monsieur and his favorite M. le Chevalier
de Lorraine ought not with impunity to constitute themselves the executioners
of my honor and my happiness.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The Chevalier de
Lorraine,&quot; said the king; &quot;that dismal fellow?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Is my mortal enemy.  Whilst that man lives in my household, where
Monsieur retains him and delegates his power to him, I shall be the most
miserable woman in the kingdom.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;So,&quot; said the king,
slowly, &quot;you call your brother of England a better friend than I am?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Actions speak for themselves,
sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And you would prefer going to
ask assistance there - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;To my own country!&quot; said
she with pride; &quot;yes, sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You are the grandchild of
Henry IV. as well as myself, lady. 
Cousin and brother-in-law, does not that amount pretty well to the title
of brother-germain?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Then,&quot; said Henrietta,
&quot;act!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Let us form an
alliance.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Begin.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I have, you say, unjustly
exiled De Guiche.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! yes,&quot; said she, blushing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;De Guiche shall return.&quot;
<b><sup>10</sup></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;So far, well.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And now you say that I do
wrong in having in your household the Chevalier de Lorraine, who gives Monsieur
ill advice respecting you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Remember well what I tell
you, sire; the Chevalier de Lorraine some day - Observe, if ever I come to a
dreadful end, I beforehand accuse the Chevalier de Lorraine; he has a spirit
that is capable of any crime!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The Chevalier de Lorraine
shall no longer annoy you - I promise you that.&quot; <b><sup>11</sup></b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Then that will be a true preliminary of
alliance, sire, - I sign; but since you have done your part, tell me what shall
be mine.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Instead of embroiling me with
your brother Charles, you must make him a more intimate friend than ever.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is very easy.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! not quite so easy as you
may suppose, for in ordinary friendship people embrace or exercise hospitality,
and that only costs a kiss or a return, profitable expenses; but in political
friendship - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah! it's a political
friendship, is it?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes, my sister; and then,
instead of embraces and feasts, it is soldiers - it is soldiers all alive and
well equipped - that we must serve up to our friends; vessels we must offer,
all armed with cannons and stored with provisions.  It hence results that we have not always coffers in a fit
condition for such friendships.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah! you are quite
right,&quot; said Madame; &quot;the coffers of the king of England have been
sonorous for some time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;But you, my sister, who have
so much influence over your brother, you can secure more than an ambassador
could ever get the promise of.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;To effect that I must go to
London, my dear brother.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I have thought so,&quot;
replied the king, eagerly; &quot;and I have said to myself that such a voyage
would do your health and spirits good.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Only,&quot; interrupted
Madame, &quot;it is possible I should fail. 
The king of England has dangerous counselors.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Counselors, do you say?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Precisely.  If, by chance, your majesty had any
intention - I am only supposing so - of asking Charles II. his alliance in a
war - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;A war?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes; well! then the king's
counselors, who are in number seven - Mademoiselle Stewart, Mademoiselle Wells,
Mademoiselle Gwyn, Miss Orchay, Mademoiselle Zunga, Miss Davies, and the proud
Countess of Castlemaine - will represent to the king that war costs a great
deal of money; that it is better to give balls and suppers at Hampton Court
than to equip ships of the line at Portsmouth and Greenwich.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And then your negotiations
will fail?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! those ladies cause all
negotiations to fall through which they don't make themselves.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Do you know the idea that has
struck me, sister?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No; inform me what it
is.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It is that, searching well
around you, you might perhaps find a female counselor to take with you to your
brother, whose eloquence might paralyze the ill-will of the seven others.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is really an idea, sire,
and I will search.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You will find what you
want.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I hope so.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;A pretty ambassadress is
necessary; an agreeable face is better than an ugly one, is it not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Most assuredly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;An animated, lively,
audacious character.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Nobility; that is, enough to
enable her to approach the king without awkwardness - not too lofty, so as not
to trouble herself about the dignity of her race.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Very true.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And who knows a little English.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;<i>Mon Dieu!</i> why, some one,&quot; cried Madame, &quot;like
Mademoiselle de Kéroualle, for instance!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! why, yes!&quot; said
Louis XIV.; &quot;you have hit the mark, - it is you who have found, my
sister.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I will take her; she will
have no cause to complain, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! no, I will name her <i>séductrice plénipotentiaire</i> at once, and
will add a dowry to the title.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is well.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I fancy you already on your
road, my dear little sister, consoled for all your griefs.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I will go, on two
conditions.  The first is, that I shall
know what I am negotiating about.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is it.  The Dutch, you know, insult me daily in
their gazettes, and by their republican attitude.  I do not like republics.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That may easily be imagined,
sire.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I see with pain that these
kings of the sea - they call themselves so - keep trade from France in the
Indies, and that their vessels will soon occupy all the ports of Europe.  Such a power is too near me, sister.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;They are your allies,
nevertheless.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is why they were wrong
in having the medal you have heard of struck; a medal which represents Holland
stopping the sun, as Joshua did, with this legend: <i>The sun had stopped before me</i>. 
There is not much fraternity in that, <i>is</i> there?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I thought you had forgotten
that miserable episode?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I never forget anything,
sister.  And if my true friends, such as
your brother Charles, are willing to second me - &quot;  The princess remained pensively silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Listen to me; there is the
empire of  the seas to be shared,&quot;
said Louis XIV.  &quot;For this
partition, which England submits to, could I not represent the second party as
well as the Dutch?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;We have Mademoiselle de
Kéroualle to treat that question,&quot; replied Madame.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Your second condition for
going, if you please, sister?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;The consent of Monsieur, my
husband.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;You shall have it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Then consider me already
gone, brother.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>On hearing these words, Louis XIV.
turned round towards the corner of the room in which D'Artagnan, Colbert, and
Aramis stood, and made an affirmative sign to his minister.  Colbert then broke in on the conversation
suddenly, and said to Aramis:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur l'ambassadeur, shall
we talk about business?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan immediately withdrew,
from politeness.  He directed his steps
towards the fireplace, within hearing of what the king was about to say to
Monsieur, who, evidently uneasy, had gone to him.  The face of the king was animated.  Upon his brow was stamped a strength of will, the expression of
which already met no further contradiction in France, and was soon to meet no
more in Europe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said the king
to his brother, &quot;I am not pleased with M. le Chevalier de Lorraine.  You, who do him the honor to protect him,
must advise him to travel for a few months.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>These words fell with the crush of
an avalanche upon Monsieur, who adored his favorite, and concentrated all his
affections in him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In what has the chevalier
been inconsiderate enough to displease your majesty?&quot; cried he, darting a
furious look at Madame.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I will tell you that when he
is gone,&quot; said the king, suavely. 
&quot;And also when Madame, here, shall have crossed over into
England.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Madame! in England!&quot;
murmured Monsieur, in amazement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;In a week, brother,&quot;
continued the king, &quot;whilst <i>we</i>
will go whither I will shortly tell you.&quot; 
And the king turned on his heel, smiling in his brother's face, to
sweeten, as it were, the bitter draught he had given him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>During this time Colbert was
talking with the Duc d'Alméda.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said Colbert
to Aramis, &quot;this is the moment for us to come to an understanding.  I have made your peace with the king, and I
owed that clearly to a man of so much merit; but as you have often expressed
friendship for me, an opportunity presents itself for giving me a proof of it.  You are, besides, more a Frenchman than a Spaniard.  Shall we secure - answer me frankly - the
neutrality of Spain, if we undertake anything against the United
Provinces?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; replied
Aramis, &quot;the interest of Spain is clear. 
To embroil Europe with the Provinces would doubtless be our policy, but
the king of France is an ally of the United Provinces.  You are not ignorant, besides, that it would
infer a maritime war, and that France is in no state to undertake this with
advantage.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert, turning round at this
moment, saw D'Artagnan who was seeking some interlocutor, during this
&quot;aside&quot; of the king and Monsieur. 
He called him, at the same time saying in a low voice to Aramis,
&quot;We may talk openly with D'Artagnan, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh! certainly,&quot; replied
the ambassador.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;We were saying, M. d'Alméda
and I,&quot; said Colbert, &quot;that a conflict with the United Provinces
would mean a maritime war.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That's evident enough,&quot;
replied the musketeer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And what do you think of it,
Monsieur d'Artagnan?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I think that to carry on such
a war successfully, you must have very large land forces.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;What did you say?&quot; said
Colbert, thinking he had ill understood him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Why such a large land
army?&quot; said Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Because the king will be
beaten by sea if he has not the English with him, and that when beaten by sea,
he will soon be invaded, either by the Dutch in his ports, or by the Spaniards
by land.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And Spain neutral?&quot;
asked Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Neutral as long as the king
shall prove stronger,&quot; rejoined D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert admired that sagacity which
never touched a question without enlightening it thoroughly.  Aramis smiled, as he had long known that in
diplomacy D'Artagnan acknowledged no superior. 
Colbert, who, like all proud men, dwelt upon his fantasy with a
certainty of success, resumed the subject, &quot;Who told you, M. d'Artagnan,
that the king had no navy?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh!  I take no heed of these details,&quot; replied the captain.  &quot;I am but an indifferent sailor.  Like all nervous people, I hate the sea; and
yet I have an idea that, with ships, France being a seaport with two hundred
exits, we <i>might</i> have sailors.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert drew from his pocket a
little oblong book divided into two columns. 
On the first were the names of vessels, on the other the figures
recapitulating the number of cannon and men requisite to equip these ships.  &quot;I have had the same idea as you,&quot;
said he to D'Artagnan, &quot;and I have had an account drawn up of the vessels
we have altogether - thirty-five ships.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Thirty-five ships!
impossible!&quot; cried D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Something like two thousand
pieces of cannon,&quot; said Colbert. 
&quot;That is what the king possesses at this moment.  Of five and thirty vessels we can make three
squadrons, but I must have five.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Five!&quot; cried Aramis.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;They will be afloat before
the end of the year, gentlemen; the king will have fifty ship of the line.  We may venture on a contest with them, may
we not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;To build vessels,&quot; said
D'Artagnan, &quot;is difficult, but possible. 
As to arming them, how is that to be done?  In France there are neither foundries nor military docks.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Bah!&quot; replied Colbert,
in a bantering tone, &quot;I have planned all that this year and a half past,
did you not know it?  Do you know M.
d'Imfreville?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;D'Imfreville?&quot; replied
D'Artagnan; &quot;no.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He is a man I have
discovered; he has a specialty; he is a man of genius - he knows how to set men
to work.  It is he who has cast cannon
and cut the woods of Bourgogne.  And
then, monsieur l'ambassadeur, you may not believe what I am going to tell you,
but I have a still further idea.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Oh, monsieur!&quot; said
Aramis, civilly, &quot;I always believe you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Calculating upon the
character of the Dutch, our allies, I said to myself, 'They are merchants, they
are friendly with the king; they will be happy to sell to the king what they
fabricate for themselves; then the more we buy' - Ah!  I must add this: I have Forant - do you know Forant,
D'Artagnan?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert, in his warmth, forgot
himself; he called the captain simply <i>D'Artagnan</i>,
as the king did.  But the captain only
smiled at it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No,&quot; replied he, &quot;I
do not know him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is another man I have
discovered, with a genius for buying. 
This Forant has purchased for me 350,000 pounds of iron in balls,
200,000 pounds of powder, twelve cargoes of Northern timber, matches, grenades,
pitch, tar - I know not what! with a 
saving of seven per cent upon what all those articles would cost me
fabricated in France.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is a capital and quaint
idea,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, &quot;to have Dutch cannon-balls cast which
will return to the Dutch.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Is it not, with loss,
too?&quot;  And Colbert laughed
aloud.  He was delighted with his own
joke.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Still further,&quot; added
he, &quot;these same Dutch are building for the king, at this moment, six
vessels after the model of the best of their name.  Destouches - Ah! perhaps you don't know Destouches?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;No, monsieur.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;He is a man who has a sure
glance to discern, when a ship is launched, what are the defects and qualities
of that ship - that is valuable, observe! 
Nature is truly whimsical.  Well,
this Destouches appeared to me to be a man likely to prove useful in marine
affairs, and he is superintending the construction of six vessels of
seventy-eight guns, which the Provinces are building for his majesty.  It results from this, my dear Monsieur
d'Artagnan, that the king, if he wished to quarrel with the Provinces, would
have a very pretty fleet.  Now, you know
better than anybody else if the land army is efficient.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan and Aramis looked at
each other, wondering at the mysterious labors this man had undertaken in so
short a time.  Colbert understood them,
and was touched by this best of flatteries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;If we, in France, were
ignorant of what was going on,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;out of France still
less must be known.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;That is why I told monsieur
l'ambassadeur,&quot; said Colbert, &quot;that, Spain promising its neutrality,
England helping us - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;If England assists you,&quot;
said Aramis, &quot;I promise the neutrality of Spain.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I take you at your
word,&quot; Colbert hastened to reply with his blunt <i>bonhomie</i>.  &quot;And, <i>à propos</i> of Spain, you have not the
'Golden Fleece,' Monsieur d'Alméda.  I
heard the king say the other day that he should like to see you wear the <i>grand cordon</i> of St. Michael.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Aramis bowed.  &quot;Oh!&quot; thought D'Artagnan,
&quot;and Porthos is no longer here! 
What ells of ribbons would there be for him in these <i>largesses!</i>  Dear Porthos!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur d'Artagnan,&quot;
resumed Colbert, &quot;between us two, you will have, I wager, an inclination
to lead your musketeers into Holland. 
Can you swim?&quot;  And he
laughed like a man in high good humor.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Like an eel,&quot; replied
D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah! but there are some bitter
passages of canals and marshes yonder, Monsieur d'Artagnan, and the best
swimmers are sometimes drowned there.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;It is my profession to die
for his majesty,&quot; said the musketeer. 
&quot;Only, as it is seldom in war that much water is met with without a
little fire, I declare to you beforehand, that I will do my best to choose
fire.  I am getting old; water freezes
me - but fire warms, Monsieur Colbert.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>And D'Artagnan looked so handsome
still in quasi-juvenile strength as he pronounced these words, that Colbert, in
his turn, could not help admiring him. 
D'Artagnan perceived the effect he had produced.  He remembered that the best tradesman is he
who fixes a high price upon his goods, when they are valuable.  He prepared his price in advance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;So, then,&quot; said Colbert,
&quot;we go into Holland?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied
D'Artagnan; &quot;only - &quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Only?&quot; said M. Colbert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Only,&quot; repeated
D'Artagnan, &quot;there lurks in everything the question of interest, the
question of self-love.  It is a very
fine title, that of captain of the musketeers; but observe this: we have now the
king's guards and the military household of the king.  A captain of musketeers ought to command all that, and then he
would absorb a hundred thousand livres a year for expenses.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well! but do you suppose the
king would haggle with you?&quot; said Colbert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Eh! monsieur, you have not
understood me,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, sure of carrying his point.  &quot;I was telling you that I, an old
captain, formerly chief of the king's guard, having precedence of the <i>maréchaux</i> of France - I saw myself one
day in the trenches with two other equals, the captain of the guards and the
colonel commanding the Swiss.  Now, at
no price will I suffer that.  I have old
habits, and I will stand or fall by them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Colbert felt this blow, but he was
prepared for it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I have been thinking of what
you said just now,&quot; replied he.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;About what, monsieur?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;We were speaking of canals
and marshes in which people are drowned.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Well! if they are drowned, it
is for want of a boat, a plank, or a stick.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Of a stick, however short it
may be,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Exactly,&quot; said
Colbert.  &quot;And, therefore, I never
heard of an instance of a <i>maréchal</i> of
France being drowned.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan became very pale with
joy, and in a not very firm voice, &quot;People would be very proud of me in my
country,&quot; said he, &quot;if I were a <i>maréchal</i>
of France; but a man must have commanded an expedition in chief to obtain the <i>bâton</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur!&quot; said Colbert,
&quot;here is in this pocket-book which you will study, a plan of campaign you
will have to lead a body of troops to carry out in the next spring.&quot; <b><sup>12</sup></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>D'Artagnan took the book,
tremblingly, and his fingers meeting those of Colbert, the minister pressed the
hand of the musketeer loyally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Monsieur,&quot; said he,
&quot;we had both a revenge to take, one over the other.  I have begun; it is now your turn!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;I will do you justice,
monsieur,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, &quot;and implore you to tell the king that
the first opportunity that shall offer, he may depend upon a victory, or to
behold me dead - <i>or both</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Then I will have the <i>fleurs-de-lis</i> for your <i>maréchal's bâton</i> prepared
immediately,&quot; said Colbert.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>On the morrow, Aramis, who was
setting out for Madrid, to negotiate the neutrality of Spain, came to embrace
D'Artagnan at his hotel.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Let us love each other for
four,&quot; said D'Artagnan.  &quot;We
are now but two.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;And you will, perhaps, never
see me again, dear D'Artagnan,&quot; said Aramis; &quot;if you knew how I have
loved you!  I am old, I am extinct - ah,
I am almost dead.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;My friend,&quot; said
D'Artagnan, &quot;you will live longer than I shall: diplomacy commands you to
live; but, for my part, honor condemns me to die.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Bah! such men as we are,
monsieur le maréchal,&quot; said Aramis, &quot;only die satisfied with joy in
glory.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>&quot;Ah!&quot; replied D'Artagnan,
with a melancholy smile, &quot;I assure you, monsieur le duc, I feel very
little appetite for either.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>They once more embraced, and, two
hours after, separated - forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;'>The Death of D'Artagnan.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;'>            </span><span style='font-size:20.0pt;font-family:Black-Chance'>C</span>ontrary to that
which generally happens, whether in politics or morals, each kept his promises,
and did honor to his engagements.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
king recalled M. de Guiche, and banished M. le Chevalier de Lorraine; so that
Monsieur became ill in consequence. 
Madame set out for London, where she applied herself so earnestly to
make her brother, Charles II., acquire a taste for the political counsels of
Mademoiselle de Kéroualle, that the alliance between England and France was
signed, and the English vessels, ballasted by a few millions of French gold,
made a terrible campaign against the fleets of the United Provinces.  Charles II. had promised Mademoiselle de
Kéroualle a little gratitude for her good counsels; he made her Duchess of
Portsmouth.  Colbert had promised the
king vessels, munitions, victories.  He
kept his word, as is well known.  At
length Aramis, upon whose promises there was least dependence to be placed,
wrote Colbert the following letter, on the subject of the negotiations which he
had undertaken at Madrid:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;MONSIEUR
COLBERT, - I have the honor to expedite to you the R. P. Oliva, general <i>ad interim</i> of the Society of Jesus, my
provisional successor.  The reverend
father will explain to you, Monsieur Colbert, that I preserve to myself the
direction of all the affairs of the order which concern France and Spain; but
that I am not willing to retain the title of general, which would throw too
high a side-light on the progress of the negotiations with which His Catholic
Majesty wishes to intrust me.  I shall
resume that title by the command of his majesty, when the labors I have
undertaken in concert with you, for the great glory of God and His Church,
shall be brought to a good end.  The R.
P. Oliva will inform you likewise, monsieur, of the consent His Catholic
Majesty gives to the signature of a treaty which assures the neutrality of
Spain in the event of a war between France and the United Provinces.  This consent will be valid even if England,
instead of being active, should satisfy herself with remaining neutral.  As for Portugal, of which you and I have
spoken, monsieur, I can assure you it will contribute with all its resources to
assist the Most Christian King in his war. 
I beg you, Monsieur Colbert, to preserve your friendship and also to
believe in my profound attachment, and to lay my respect at the feet of His
Most Christian Majesty.  Signed,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>&quot;LE DUC D'ALMÉDA.&quot;
<b><sup>13</sup></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Aramis
had performed more than he had promised; it remained to be seen how the king,
M. Colbert, and D'Artagnan would be faithful to each other.  In the spring, as Colbert had predicted, the
land army entered on its campaign.  It
preceded, in magnificent order, the court of Louis XIV., who, setting out on
horseback, surrounded by carriages filled with ladies and courtiers, conducted
the <i>élite</i> of his kingdom to this
sanguinary <i>fête</i>.  The officers of the army, it is true, had no
other music save the artillery of the Dutch forts; but it was enough for a
great number, who found in this war honor, advancement, fortune - or death.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                M.
d'Artagnan set out commanding a body of twelve thousand men, cavalry, and
infantry, with which he was ordered to take the different places which form
knots of that strategic network called La Frise.  Never was an army conducted more gallantly to an expedition.  The officers knew that their leader, prudent
and skillful as he was brave, would not sacrifice a single man, nor yield an
inch of ground without necessity.  He
had the old habits of war, to live upon the country, keeping his soldiers
singing and the enemy weeping.  The
captain of the king's musketeers well knew his business.  Never were opportunities better chosen, <i>coups-de-main</i> better supported, errors
of the besieged more quickly taken advantage of.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                The
army commanded by D'Artagnan took twelve small places within a month.  He was engaged in besieging the thirteenth,
which had held out five days. 
D'Artagnan caused the trenches to be opened without appearing to suppose
that these people would ever allow themselves to be taken.  The pioneers and laborers were, in the army
of this man, a body full of ideas and zeal, because their commander treated
them like soldiers, knew how to render their work glorious, and never allowed
them to be killed if he could help it. 
It should have been seen with what eagerness the marshy glebes of
Holland were turned over.  Those
turf-heaps, mounds of potter's clay, melted at the word of the soldiers like
butter in the frying-pans of Friesland housewives.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                M.
d'Artagnan dispatched a courier to the king to give him an account of the last
success, which redoubled the good humor of his majesty and his inclination to
amuse the ladies.  These victories of M.
d'Artagnan gave so much majesty to the prince, that Madame de Montespan no
longer called him anything but Louis the Invincible.  So that Mademoiselle de la Vallière, who only called the king
Louis the Victorious, lost much of his majesty's favor.  Besides, her eyes were frequently red, and
to an Invincible nothing is more disagreeable than a mistress who weeps while
everything is smiling round her.  The
star of Mademoiselle de la Vallière was being drowned in clouds and tears.  But the gayety of Madame de Montespan
redoubled with the successes of the king, and consoled him for every other
unpleasant circumstance.  It was to
D'Artagnan the king owed this; and his majesty was anxious to acknowledge these
services; he wrote to M. Colbert:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;MONSIEUR
COLBERT, - We have a promise to fulfil with M. d'Artagnan, who so well keeps
his.  This is to inform you that the
time is come for performing it.  All
provisions for this purpose you shall be furnished with in due time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>LOUIS.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                In
consequence of this, Colbert, detaining D'Artagnan's envoy, placed in the hands
of that messenger a letter from himself, and a small coffer of ebony inlaid
with gold, not very important in appearance, but which, without doubt, was very
heavy, as a guard of five men was given to the messenger, to assist him in
carrying it.  These people arrived
before the place which D'Artagnan was besieging towards daybreak, and presented
themselves at the lodgings of the general. 
They were told that M. d'Artagnan, annoyed by a sortie which the
governor, an artful man, had made the evening before, and in which the works
had been destroyed and seventy-seven men killed, and the reparation of the
breaches commenced, had just gone with twenty companies of grenadiers to
reconstruct the works.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                M.
Colbert's envoy had orders to go and seek M. d'Artagnan, wherever he might be,
or at whatever hour of the day or night. 
He directed his course, therefore, towards the trenches, followed by his
escort, all on horseback.  They
perceived M. d'Artagnan in the open plain, with his gold-laced hat, his long
cane, and gilt cuffs.  He was biting his
white mustache, and wiping off, with his left hand, the dust which the passing
balls threw up from the ground they plowed so near him.  They also saw, amidst this terrible fire,
which filled the air with whistling hisses, officers handling the shovel,
soldiers rolling barrows, and vast fascines, rising by being either carried or
dragged by from ten to twenty men, cover the front of the trench reopened to
the center by this extraordinary effort of the general.  In three hours, all was reinstated.  D'Artagnan began to speak more mildly; and
he became quite calm when the captain of the pioneers approached him, hat in
hand, to tell him that the trench was again in proper order.  This man had scarcely finished speaking,
when a ball took off one of his legs, and he fell into the arms of
D'Artagnan.  The latter lifted up his
soldier, and quietly, with soothing words, carried him into the trench, amidst
the enthusiastic applause of the regiments. 
From that time it was no longer a question of valor - the army was
delirious; two companies stole away to the advanced posts, which they instantly
destroyed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                When
their comrades, restrained with great difficulty by D'Artagnan, saw them lodged
upon the bastions, they rushed forward likewise; and soon a furious assault was
made upon the counterscarp, upon which depended the safety of the place.  D'Artagnan perceived there was only one
means left of checking his army - to take the place.  He directed all his force to the two breaches, where the besieged
were busy in repairing.  The shock was
terrible; eighteen companies took part in it, and D'Artagnan went with the
rest, within half cannon-shot of the place, to support the attack by <i>échelons</i>.  The cries of the Dutch, who were being poniarded upon their guns
by D'Artagnan's grenadiers, were distinctly audible.  The struggle grew fiercer with the despair of the governor, who
disputed his position foot by foot. 
D'Artagnan, to put an end to the affair, and to silence the fire, which
was unceasing, sent a fresh column, which penetrated like a very wedge; and he
soon perceived upon the ramparts, through the fire, the terrified flight of the
besieged, pursued by the besiegers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                At this
moment the general, breathing feely and full of joy, heard a voice behind him,
saying, &quot;Monsieur, if you please, from M. Colbert.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                He
broke the seal of the letter, which contained these words:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;MONSIEUR
D'ARTAGNAN: - The king commands me to inform you that he has nominated you
maréchal of France, as a reward for your magnificent services, and the honor
you do to his arms.  The king is highly
pleased, monsieur, with the captures you have made; he commands you, in
particular, to finish the siege you have commenced, with good fortune to you,
and success for him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
was standing with a radiant countenance and sparkling eye.  He looked up to watch the progress of his
troops upon the walls, still enveloped in red and black volumes of smoke.  &quot;I have finished,&quot; replied he to
the messenger; &quot;the city will have surrendered in a quarter of an
hour.&quot;  He then resumed his
reading:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;The
<i>coffret</i>, Monsieur d'Artagnan, is my
own present.  You will not be sorry to
see that, whilst you warriors are drawing the sword to defend the king, I am
moving the pacific arts to ornament a present worthy of you.  I commend myself to your friendship,
monsieur le maréchal, and beg you to believe in mine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=right style='text-align:right'>COLBERT&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan,
intoxicated with joy, made a sign to the messenger, who approached, with his <i>coffret</i> in his hands.  But at the moment the <i>maréchal</i> was going to look at it, a loud explosion resounded from
the ramparts, and called his attention towards the city.  &quot;It is strange,&quot; said D'Artagnan,
&quot;that I don't yet see the king's flag on the walls, or hear the drums beat
the <i>chamade</i>.&quot;  He launched three hundred fresh men, under a
high-spirited officer, and ordered another breach to be made.  Then, more tranquilly, he turned towards the
<i>coffret</i>, which Colbert's envoy held
out to him. - It was his treasure - he had won it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                D'Artagnan
was holding out his hand to open the <i>coffret</i>,
when a ball from the city crushed the <i>coffret</i>
in the arms of the officer, struck D'Artagnan full in the chest, and knocked
him down upon a sloping heap of earth, whilst the <i>fleur-de-lised bâton</i>, escaping from the broken box, came rolling
under the powerless hand of the <i>maréchal</i>.  D'Artagnan endeavored to raise himself.  It was thought he had been knocked down
without being wounded.  A terrible cry
broke from the group of terrified officers; the <i>maréchal</i> was covered with blood; the pallor of death ascended
slowly to his noble countenance. 
Leaning upon the arms held out on all sides to receive him, he was able
once more to turn his eyes towards the place, and to distinguish the white flag
at the crest of the principal bastion; his ears, already deaf to the sounds of
life, caught feebly the rolling of the drum which announced the victory.  Then, clasping in his nerveless hand the <i>bâton</i>, ornamented with its <i>fleurs-de-lis</i>, he cast on it his eyes,
which had no longer the power of looking upwards towards Heaven, and fell back,
murmuring strange words, which appeared to the soldiers cabalistic - words
which had formerly represented so many things on earth, and which none but the
dying man any longer comprehended:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                &quot;Athos
- Porthos, farewell till we meet again! 
Aramis, adieu forever!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                Of the
four valiant men whose history we have related, there now remained but
one.  Heaven had taken to itself three
noble souls. <b><sup>14</sup></b></p>
