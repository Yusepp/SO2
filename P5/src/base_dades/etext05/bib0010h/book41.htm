<h1>Book 41 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark</h1>

<p>41:001:001 The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</p>

<p>41:001:002 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>

<p>41:001:003 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>

<p>41:001:004 John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repentance for the remission of sins.</p>

<p>41:001:005 And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>

<p>41:001:006 And John was clothed with camel's hair, and with a girdle of a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</p>

<p>41:001:007 And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and unloose.</p>

<p>41:001:008 I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you with the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>41:001:009 And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</p>

<p>41:001:010 And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</p>

<p>41:001:011 And there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>

<p>41:001:012 And immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</p>

<p>41:001:013 And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him.</p>

<p>41:001:014 Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</p>

<p>41:001:015 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</p>

<p>41:001:016 Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fishers.</p>

<p>41:001:017 And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you to become fishers of men.</p>

<p>41:001:018 And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</p>

<p>41:001:019 And when he had gone a little farther thence, he saw James the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ship mending their nets.</p>

<p>41:001:020 And straightway he called them: and they left their father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>41:001:021 And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</p>

<p>41:001:022 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</p>

<p>41:001:023 And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he cried out,</p>

<p>41:001:024 Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;art, the Holy One of God.</p>

<p>41:001:025 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>41:001:026 And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loud voice, he came out of him.</p>

<p>41:001:027 And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spirits, and they do obey him.</p>

<p>41:001:028 And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;region round about Galilee.</p>

<p>41:001:029 And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John.</p>

<p>41:001:030 But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell him of her.</p>

<p>41:001:031 And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</p>

<p>41:001:032 And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</p>

<p>41:001:033 And all the city was gathered together at the door.</p>

<p>41:001:034 And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they knew him.</p>

<p>41:001:035 And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prayed.</p>

<p>41:001:036 And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</p>

<p>41:001:037 And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for thee.</p>

<p>41:001:038 And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</p>

<p>41:001:039 And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cast out devils.</p>

<p>41:001:040 And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make me clean.</p>

<p>41:001:041 And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth his hand, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</p>

<p>41:001:042 And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from him, and he was cleansed.</p>

<p>41:001:043 And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</p>

<p>41:001:044 And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them.</p>

<p>41:001:045 But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they came to him from every quarter.</p>

<p>41:002:001 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was noised that he was in the house.</p>

<p>41:002:002 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the door: and he preached the word unto them.</p>

<p>41:002:003 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was borne of four.</p>

<p>41:002:004 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</p>

<p>41:002:005 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</p>

<p>41:002:006 But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasoning in their hearts,</p>

<p>41:002:007 Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but God only?</p>

<p>41:002:008 And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye these things in your hearts?</p>

<p>41:002:009 Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walk?</p>

<p>41:002:010 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)</p>

<p>41:002:011 I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into thine house.</p>

<p>41:002:012 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</p>

<p>41:002:013 And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resorted unto him, and he taught them.</p>

<p>41:002:014 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arose and followed him.</p>

<p>41:002:015 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</p>

<p>41:002:016 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners?</p>

<p>41:002:017 When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>

<p>41:002:018 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</p>

<p>41:002:019 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</p>

<p>41:002:020 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</p>

<p>41:002:021 No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rent is made worse.</p>

<p>41:002:022 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bottles.</p>

<p>41:002:023 And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pluck the ears of corn.</p>

<p>41:002:024 And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sabbath day that which is not lawful?</p>

<p>41:002:025 And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him?</p>

<p>41:002:026 How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him?</p>

<p>41:002:027 And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man for the sabbath:</p>

<p>41:002:028 Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</p>

<p>41:003:001 And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there which had a withered hand.</p>

<p>41:003:002 And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day; that they might accuse him.</p>

<p>41:003:003 And he saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forth.</p>

<p>41:003:004 And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill? But they held<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their peace.</p>

<p>41:003:005 And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grieved for the hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his hand was restored whole as the other.</p>

<p>41:003:006 And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</p>

<p>41:003:007 But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,</p>

<p>41:003:008 And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had heard what great things he did, came unto him.</p>

<p>41:003:009 And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.</p>

<p>41:003:010 For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for to touch him, as many as had plagues.</p>

<p>41:003:011 And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</p>

<p>41:003:012 And he straitly charged them that they should not make him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known.</p>

<p>41:003:013 And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would: and they came unto him.</p>

<p>41:003:014 And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he might send them forth to preach,</p>

<p>41:003:015 And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:</p>

<p>41:003:016 And Simon he surnamed Peter;</p>

<p>41:003:017 And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:</p>

<p>41:003:018 And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simon the Canaanite,</p>

<p>41:003:019 And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into an house.</p>

<p>41:003:020 And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not so much as eat bread.</p>

<p>41:003:021 And when his friends heard of it, they went out to lay hold on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him: for they said, He is beside himself.</p>

<p>41:003:022 And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casteth he out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devils.</p>

<p>41:003:023 And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can Satan cast out Satan?</p>

<p>41:003:024 And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot stand.</p>

<p>41:003:025 And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stand.</p>

<p>41:003:026 And if Satan rise up against himself, and be divided, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot stand, but hath an end.</p>

<p>41:003:027 No man can enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;goods, except he will first bind the strong man; and then he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will spoil his house.</p>

<p>41:003:028 Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blaspheme:</p>

<p>41:003:029 But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation.</p>

<p>41:003:030 Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.</p>

<p>41:003:031 There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without, sent unto him, calling him.</p>

<p>41:003:032 And the multitude sat about him, and they said unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</p>

<p>41:003:033 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brethren?</p>

<p>41:003:034 And he looked round about on them which sat about him, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</p>

<p>41:003:035 For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother, and my sister, and mother.</p>

<p>41:004:001 And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ship, and sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sea on the land.</p>

<p>41:004:002 And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his doctrine,</p>

<p>41:004:003 Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</p>

<p>41:004:004 And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</p>

<p>41:004:005 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth:</p>

<p>41:004:006 But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no root, it withered away.</p>

<p>41:004:007 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it, and it yielded no fruit.</p>

<p>41:004:008 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sixty, and some an hundred.</p>

<p>41:004:009 And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear.</p>

<p>41:004:010 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twelve asked of him the parable.</p>

<p>41:004:011 And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mystery of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all these things are done in parables:</p>

<p>41:004:012 That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.</p>

<p>41:004:013 And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will ye know all parables?</p>

<p>41:004:014 The sower soweth the word.</p>

<p>41:004:015 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away the word that was sown in their hearts.</p>

<p>41:004:016 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with gladness;</p>

<p>41:004:017 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;word's sake, immediately they are offended.</p>

<p>41:004:018 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the word,</p>

<p>41:004:019 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it becometh unfruitful.</p>

<p>41:004:020 And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thirtyfold, some sixty, and some an hundred.</p>

<p>41:004:021 And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</p>

<p>41:004:022 For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abroad.</p>

<p>41:004:023 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p>41:004:024 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that hear shall more be given.</p>

<p>41:004:025 For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</p>

<p>41:004:026 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seed into the ground;</p>

<p>41:004:027 And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</p>

<p>41:004:028 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</p>

<p>41:004:029 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sickle, because the harvest is come.</p>

<p>41:004:030 And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with what comparison shall we compare it?</p>

<p>41:004:031 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</p>

<p>41:004:032 But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.</p>

<p>41:004:033 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were able to hear it.</p>

<p>41:004:034 But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</p>

<p>41:004:035 And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us pass over unto the other side.</p>

<p>41:004:036 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;little ships.</p>

<p>41:004:037 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ship, so that it was now full.</p>

<p>41:004:038 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we perish?</p>

<p>41:004:039 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;calm.</p>

<p>41:004:040 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye have no faith?</p>

<p>41:004:041 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him?</p>

<p>41:005:001 And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country of the Gadarenes.</p>

<p>41:005:002 And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</p>

<p>41:005:003 Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, no, not with chains:</p>

<p>41:005:004 Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.</p>

<p>41:005:005 And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones.</p>

<p>41:005:006 But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him,</p>

<p>41:005:007 And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, that thou torment me not.</p>

<p>41:005:008 For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spirit.</p>

<p>41:005:009 And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Legion: for we are many.</p>

<p>41:005:010 And he besought him much that he would not send them away out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the country.</p>

<p>41:005:011 Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swine feeding.</p>

<p>41:005:012 And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swine, that we may enter into them.</p>

<p>41:005:013 And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two thousand;) and were choked in the sea.</p>

<p>41:005:014 And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done.</p>

<p>41:005:015 And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his right mind: and they were afraid.</p>

<p>41:005:016 And they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possessed with the devil, and also concerning the swine.</p>

<p>41:005:017 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.</p>

<p>41:005:018 And when he was come into the ship, he that had been possessed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the devil prayed him that he might be with him.</p>

<p>41:005:019 Howbeit Jesus suffered him not, but saith unto him, Go home to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy friends, and tell them how great things the Lord hath done<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.</p>

<p>41:005:020 And he departed, and began to publish in Decapolis how great<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things Jesus had done for him: and all men did marvel.</p>

<p>41:005:021 And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;side, much people gathered unto him: and he was nigh unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sea.</p>

<p>41:005:022 And, behold, there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</p>

<p>41:005:023 And besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lieth at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the point of death: I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her, that she may be healed; and she shall live.</p>

<p>41:005:024 And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thronged him.</p>

<p>41:005:025 And a certain woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years,</p>

<p>41:005:026 And had suffered many things of many physicians, and had spent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worse,</p>

<p>41:005:027 When she had heard of Jesus, came in the press behind, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;touched his garment.</p>

<p>41:005:028 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole.</p>

<p>41:005:029 And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.</p>

<p>41:005:030 And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;touched my clothes?</p>

<p>41:005:031 And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</p>

<p>41:005:032 And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.</p>

<p>41:005:033 But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truth.</p>

<p>41:005:034 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.</p>

<p>41:005:035 While he yet spake, there came from the ruler of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;synagogue's house certain which said, Thy daughter is dead:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why troublest thou the Master any further?</p>

<p>41:005:036 As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he saith unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ruler of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.</p>

<p>41:005:037 And he suffered no man to follow him, save Peter, and James,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and John the brother of James.</p>

<p>41:005:038 And he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeth the tumult, and them that wept and wailed greatly.</p>

<p>41:005:039 And when he was come in, he saith unto them, Why make ye this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ado, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.</p>

<p>41:005:040 And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out, he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them that were with him, and entereth in where the damsel was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lying.</p>

<p>41:005:041 And he took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arise.</p>

<p>41:005:042 And straightway the damsel arose, and walked; for she was of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the age of twelve years. And they were astonished with a great<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;astonishment.</p>

<p>41:005:043 And he charged them straitly that no man should know it; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commanded that something should be given her to eat.</p>

<p>41:006:001 And he went out from thence, and came into his own country;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his disciples follow him.</p>

<p>41:006:002 And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;synagogue: and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whence hath this man these things? and what wisdom is this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is given unto him, that even such mighty works are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrought by his hands?</p>

<p>41:006:003 Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James, and Joses, and of Juda, and Simon? and are not his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.</p>

<p>41:006:004 But Jesus, said unto them, A prophet is not without honour,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house.</p>

<p>41:006:005 And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands upon a few sick folk, and healed them.</p>

<p>41:006:006 And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about the villages, teaching.</p>

<p>41:006:007 And he called unto him the twelve, and began to send them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spirits;</p>

<p>41:006:008 And commanded them that they should take nothing for their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;journey, save a staff only; no scrip, no bread, no money in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their purse:</p>

<p>41:006:009 But be shod with sandals; and not put on two coats.</p>

<p>41:006:010 And he said unto them, In what place soever ye enter into an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house, there abide till ye depart from that place.</p>

<p>41:006:011 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than for that city.</p>

<p>41:006:012 And they went out, and preached that men should repent.</p>

<p>41:006:013 And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were sick, and healed them.</p>

<p>41:006:014 And king Herod heard of him; (for his name was spread abroad:)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he said, That John the Baptist was risen from the dead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</p>

<p>41:006:015 Others said, That it is Elias. And others said, That it is a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prophet, or as one of the prophets.</p>

<p>41:006:016 But when Herod heard thereof, he said, It is John, whom I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beheaded: he is risen from the dead.</p>

<p>41:006:017 For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bound him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wife: for he had married her.</p>

<p>41:006:018 For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have thy brother's wife.</p>

<p>41:006:019 Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him, and would have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;killed him; but she could not:</p>

<p>41:006:020 For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man and an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;holy, and observed him; and when he heard him, he did many<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things, and heard him gladly.</p>

<p>41:006:021 And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made a supper to his lords, high captains, and chief estates<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Galilee;</p>

<p>41:006:022 And when the daughter of the said Herodias came in, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;danced, and pleased Herod and them that sat with him, the king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will give it thee.</p>

<p>41:006:023 And he sware unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give it thee, unto the half of my kingdom.</p>

<p>41:006:024 And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.</p>

<p>41:006:025 And she came in straightway with haste unto the king, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asked, saying, I will that thou give me by and by in a charger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the head of John the Baptist.</p>

<p>41:006:026 And the king was exceeding sorry; yet for his oath's sake, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for their sakes which sat with him, he would not reject her.</p>

<p>41:006:027 And immediately the king sent an executioner, and commanded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his head to be brought: and he went and beheaded him in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prison,</p>

<p>41:006:028 And brought his head in a charger, and gave it to the damsel:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the damsel gave it to her mother.</p>

<p>41:006:029 And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</p>

<p>41:006:030 And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;told him all things, both what they had done, and what they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had taught.</p>

<p>41:006:031 And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they had no leisure so much as to eat.</p>

<p>41:006:032 And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.</p>

<p>41:006:033 And the people saw them departing, and many knew him, and ran<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;afoot thither out of all cities, and outwent them, and came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together unto him.</p>

<p>41:006:034 And Jesus, when he came out, saw much people, and was moved<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with compassion toward them, because they were as sheep not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having a shepherd: and he began to teach them many things.</p>

<p>41:006:035 And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passed:</p>

<p>41:006:036 Send them away, that they may go into the country round about,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and into the villages, and buy themselves bread: for they have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing to eat.</p>

<p>41:006:037 He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say unto him, Shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bread, and give them to eat?</p>

<p>41:006:038 He saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when they knew, they say, Five, and two fishes.</p>

<p>41:006:039 And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the green grass.</p>

<p>41:006:040 And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.</p>

<p>41:006:041 And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the loaves, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gave them to his disciples to set before them; and the two<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fishes divided he among them all.</p>

<p>41:006:042 And they did all eat, and were filled.</p>

<p>41:006:043 And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments, and of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fishes.</p>

<p>41:006:044 And they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men.</p>

<p>41:006:045 And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ship, and to go to the other side before unto Bethsaida, while<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he sent away the people.</p>

<p>41:006:046 And when he had sent them away, he departed into a mountain to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pray.</p>

<p>41:006:047 And when even was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he alone on the land.</p>

<p>41:006:048 And he saw them toiling in rowing; for the wind was contrary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them: and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>41:006:049 But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had been a spirit, and cried out:</p>

<p>41:006:050 For they all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talked with them, and saith unto them, Be of good cheer: it is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I; be not afraid.</p>

<p>41:006:051 And he went up unto them into the ship; and the wind ceased:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wondered.</p>

<p>41:006:052 For they considered not the miracle of the loaves: for their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart was hardened.</p>

<p>41:006:053 And when they had passed over, they came into the land of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gennesaret, and drew to the shore.</p>

<p>41:006:054 And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him,</p>

<p>41:006:055 And ran through that whole region round about, and began to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was.</p>

<p>41:006:056 And whithersoever he entered, into villages, or cities, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they might touch if it were but the border of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.</p>

<p>41:007:001 Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</p>

<p>41:007:002 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fault.</p>

<p>41:007:003 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</p>

<p>41:007:004 And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not. And many other things there be, which they have received<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of tables.</p>

<p>41:007:005 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bread with unwashen hands?</p>

<p>41:007:006 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</p>

<p>41:007:007 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commandments of men.</p>

<p>41:007:008 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like things ye do.</p>

<p>41:007:009 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</p>

<p>41:007:010 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</p>

<p>41:007:011 But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;profited by me; he shall be free.</p>

<p>41:007:012 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mother;</p>

<p>41:007:013 Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</p>

<p>41:007:014 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:</p>

<p>41:007:015 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are they that defile the man.</p>

<p>41:007:016 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>

<p>41:007:017 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples asked him concerning the parable.</p>

<p>41:007:018 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;</p>

<p>41:007:019 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</p>

<p>41:007:020 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the man.</p>

<p>41:007:021 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</p>

<p>41:007:022 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</p>

<p>41:007:023 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</p>

<p>41:007:024 And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know it: but he could not be hid.</p>

<p>41:007:025 For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</p>

<p>41:007:026 The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daughter.</p>

<p>41:007:027 But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the dogs.</p>

<p>41:007:028 And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</p>

<p>41:007:029 And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gone out of thy daughter.</p>

<p>41:007:030 And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</p>

<p>41:007:031 And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Decapolis.</p>

<p>41:007:032 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon him.</p>

<p>41:007:033 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</p>

<p>41:007:034 And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</p>

<p>41:007:035 And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</p>

<p>41:007:036 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it;</p>

<p>41:007:037 And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speak.</p>

<p>41:008:001 In those days the multitude being very great, and having<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples unto him, and saith<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them,</p>

<p>41:008:002 I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with me three days, and have nothing to eat:</p>

<p>41:008:003 And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.</p>

<p>41:008:004 And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these men with bread here in the wilderness?</p>

<p>41:008:005 And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven.</p>

<p>41:008:006 And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people.</p>

<p>41:008:007 And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to set them also before them.</p>

<p>41:008:008 So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;broken meat that was left seven baskets.</p>

<p>41:008:009 And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them away.</p>

<p>41:008:010 And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came into the parts of Dalmanutha.</p>

<p>41:008:011 And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.</p>

<p>41:008:012 And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, Why doth this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall no sign be given unto this generation.</p>

<p>41:008:013 And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other side.</p>

<p>41:008:014 Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they in the ship with them more than one loaf.</p>

<p>41:008:015 And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</p>

<p>41:008:016 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have no bread.</p>

<p>41:008:017 And when Jesus knew it, he saith unto them, Why reason ye,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?</p>

<p>41:008:018 Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye not remember?</p>

<p>41:008:019 When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baskets full of fragments took ye up? They say unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twelve.</p>

<p>41:008:020 And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.</p>

<p>41:008:021 And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not understand?</p>

<p>41:008:022 And he cometh to Bethsaida; and they bring a blind man unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, and besought him to touch him.</p>

<p>41:008:023 And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, he asked him if he saw ought.</p>

<p>41:008:024 And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.</p>

<p>41:008:025 After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly.</p>

<p>41:008:026 And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;town, nor tell it to any in the town.</p>

<p>41:008:027 And Jesus went out, and his disciples, into the towns of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caesarea Philippi: and by the way he asked his disciples,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying unto them, Whom do men say that I am?</p>

<p>41:008:028 And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elias; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others, One of the prophets.</p>

<p>41:008:029 And he saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am? And Peter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the Christ.</p>

<p>41:008:030 And he charged them that they should tell no man of him.</p>

<p>41:008:031 And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again.</p>

<p>41:008:032 And he spake that saying openly. And Peter took him, and began<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to rebuke him.</p>

<p>41:008:033 But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rebuked Peter, saying, Get thee behind me, Satan: for thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be of men.</p>

<p>41:008:034 And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</p>

<p>41:008:035 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall save it.</p>

<p>41:008:036 For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world, and lose his own soul?</p>

<p>41:008:037 Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</p>

<p>41:008:038 Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Father with the holy angels.</p>

<p>41:009:001 And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some of them that stand here, which shall not taste of death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.</p>

<p>41:009:002 And after six days Jesus taketh with him Peter, and James, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John, and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves: and he was transfigured before them.</p>

<p>41:009:003 And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow; so as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no fuller on earth can white them.</p>

<p>41:009:004 And there appeared unto them Elias with Moses: and they were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;talking with Jesus.</p>

<p>41:009:005 And Peter answered and said to Jesus, Master, it is good for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</p>

<p>41:009:006 For he wist not what to say; for they were sore afraid.</p>

<p>41:009:007 And there was a cloud that overshadowed them: and a voice came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</p>

<p>41:009:008 And suddenly, when they had looked round about, they saw no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man any more, save Jesus only with themselves.</p>

<p>41:009:009 And as they came down from the mountain, he charged them that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son of man were risen from the dead.</p>

<p>41:009:010 And they kept that saying with themselves, questioning one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with another what the rising from the dead should mean.</p>

<p>41:009:011 And they asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elias<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must first come?</p>

<p>41:009:012 And he answered and told them, Elias verily cometh first, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restoreth all things; and how it is written of the Son of man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he must suffer many things, and be set at nought.</p>

<p>41:009:013 But I say unto you, That Elias is indeed come, and they have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done unto him whatsoever they listed, as it is written of him.</p>

<p>41:009:014 And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about them, and the scribes questioning with them.</p>

<p>41:009:015 And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.</p>

<p>41:009:016 And he asked the scribes, What question ye with them?</p>

<p>41:009:017 And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought unto thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit;</p>

<p>41:009:018 And wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gnasheth with his teeth, and pineth away: and I spake to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy disciples that they should cast him out; and they could<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not.</p>

<p>41:009:019 He answereth him, and saith, O faithless generation, how long<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto me.</p>

<p>41:009:020 And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wallowed foaming.</p>

<p>41:009:021 And he asked his father, How long is it ago since this came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him? And he said, Of a child.</p>

<p>41:009:022 And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compassion on us, and help us.</p>

<p>41:009:023 Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible to him that believeth.</p>

<p>41:009:024 And straightway the father of the child cried out, and said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with tears, Lord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.</p>

<p>41:009:025 When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rebuked the foul spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spirit, I charge thee, come out of him, and enter no more into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>41:009:026 And the spirit cried, and rent him sore, and came out of him:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, He is dead.</p>

<p>41:009:027 But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up; and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arose.</p>

<p>41:009:028 And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;privately, Why could not we cast him out?</p>

<p>41:009:029 And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but by prayer and fasting.</p>

<p>41:009:030 And they departed thence, and passed through Galilee; and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would not that any man should know it.</p>

<p>41:009:031 For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him; and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.</p>

<p>41:009:032 But they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>41:009:033 And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way?</p>

<p>41:009:034 But they held their peace: for by the way they had disputed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among themselves, who should be the greatest.</p>

<p>41:009:035 And he sat down, and called the twelve, and saith unto them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and servant of all.</p>

<p>41:009:036 And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he had taken him in his arms, he said unto them,</p>

<p>41:009:037 Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me, receiveth not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, but him that sent me.</p>

<p>41:009:038 And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devils in thy name, and he followeth not us: and we forbad<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, because he followeth not us.</p>

<p>41:009:039 But Jesus said, Forbid him not: for there is no man which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>41:009:040 For he that is not against us is on our part.</p>

<p>41:009:041 For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name, because ye belong to Christ, verily I say unto you, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not lose his reward.</p>

<p>41:009:042 And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.</p>

<p>41:009:043 And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to enter into life maimed, than having two hands to go into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:</p>

<p>41:009:044 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>

<p>41:009:045 And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is better for thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to enter halt into life, than having two feet to be cast into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched:</p>

<p>41:009:046 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>

<p>41:009:047 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out: it is better for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having two eyes to be cast into hell fire:</p>

<p>41:009:048 Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>

<p>41:009:049 For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be salted with salt.</p>

<p>41:009:050 Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his saltness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;peace one with another.</p>

<p>41:010:001 And he arose from thence, and cometh into the coasts of Judaea<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the farther side of Jordan: and the people resort unto him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again; and, as he was wont, he taught them again.</p>

<p>41:010:002 And the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, Is it lawful for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a man to put away his wife? tempting him.</p>

<p>41:010:003 And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you?</p>

<p>41:010:004 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to put her away.</p>

<p>41:010:005 And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your heart he wrote you this precept.</p>

<p>41:010:006 But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;female.</p>

<p>41:010:007 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cleave to his wife;</p>

<p>41:010:008 And they twain shall be one flesh: so then they are no more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twain, but one flesh.</p>

<p>41:010:009 What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asunder.</p>

<p>41:010:010 And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matter.</p>

<p>41:010:011 And he saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marry another, committeth adultery against her.</p>

<p>41:010:012 And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;another, she committeth adultery.</p>

<p>41:010:013 And they brought young children to him, that he should touch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.</p>

<p>41:010:014 But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased, and said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>41:010:015 Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.</p>

<p>41:010:016 And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blessed them.</p>

<p>41:010:017 And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;running, and kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?</p>

<p>41:010:018 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;none good but one, that is, God.</p>

<p>41:010:019 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honour thy father and mother.</p>

<p>41:010:020 And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observed from my youth.</p>

<p>41:010:021 Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come, take up the cross, and follow me.</p>

<p>41:010:022 And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had great possessions.</p>

<p>41:010:023 And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of God!</p>

<p>41:010:024 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God!</p>

<p>41:010:025 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</p>

<p>41:010:026 And they were astonished out of measure, saying among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves, Who then can be saved?</p>

<p>41:010:027 And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but not with God: for with God all things are possible.</p>

<p>41:010:028 Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have followed thee.</p>

<p>41:010:029 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sake, and the gospel's,</p>

<p>41:010:030 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life.</p>

<p>41:010:031 But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.</p>

<p>41:010:032 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them what things should happen unto him,</p>

<p>41:010:033 Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deliver him to the Gentiles:</p>

<p>41:010:034 And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again.</p>

<p>41:010:035 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatsoever we shall desire.</p>

<p>41:010:036 And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?</p>

<p>41:010:037 They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.</p>

<p>41:010:038 But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baptism that I am baptized with?</p>

<p>41:010:039 And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized:</p>

<p>41:010:040 But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared.</p>

<p>41:010:041 And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with James and John.</p>

<p>41:010:042 But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authority upon them.</p>

<p>41:010:043 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among you, shall be your minister:</p>

<p>41:010:044 And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all.</p>

<p>41:010:045 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</p>

<p>41:010:046 And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.</p>

<p>41:010:047 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me.</p>

<p>41:010:048 And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>41:010:049 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rise; he calleth thee.</p>

<p>41:010:050 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus.</p>

<p>41:010:051 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might receive my sight.</p>

<p>41:010:052 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus in the way.</p>

<p>41:011:001 And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, unto Bethphage and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples,</p>

<p>41:011:002 And saith unto them, Go your way into the village over against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you: and as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;colt tied, whereon never man sat; loose him, and bring him.</p>

<p>41:011:003 And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord hath need of him; and straightway he will send him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hither.</p>

<p>41:011:004 And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.</p>

<p>41:011:005 And certain of them that stood there said unto them, What do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye, loosing the colt?</p>

<p>41:011:006 And they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded: and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let them go.</p>

<p>41:011:007 And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him; and he sat upon him.</p>

<p>41:011:008 And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.</p>

<p>41:011:009 And they that went before, and they that followed, cried,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord:</p>

<p>41:011:010 Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that cometh in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.</p>

<p>41:011:011 And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he had looked round about upon all things, and now the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eventide was come, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.</p>

<p>41:011:012 And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hungry:</p>

<p>41:011:013 And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.</p>

<p>41:011:014 And Jesus answered and said unto it, No man eat fruit of thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.</p>

<p>41:011:015 And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of them that sold doves;</p>

<p>41:011:016 And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through the temple.</p>

<p>41:011:017 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have made it a den of thieves.</p>

<p>41:011:018 And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people was astonished at his doctrine.</p>

<p>41:011:019 And when even was come, he went out of the city.</p>

<p>41:011:020 And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dried up from the roots.</p>

<p>41:011:021 And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.</p>

<p>41:011:022 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.</p>

<p>41:011:023 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatsoever he saith.</p>

<p>41:011:024 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</p>

<p>41:011:025 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your trespasses.</p>

<p>41:011:026 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven forgive your trespasses.</p>

<p>41:011:027 And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the elders,</p>

<p>41:011:028 And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and who gave thee this authority to do these things?</p>

<p>41:011:029 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authority I do these things.</p>

<p>41:011:030 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.</p>

<p>41:011:031 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?</p>

<p>41:011:032 But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.</p>

<p>41:011:033 And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;authority I do these things.</p>

<p>41:012:001 And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;husbandmen, and went into a far country.</p>

<p>41:012:002 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vineyard.</p>

<p>41:012:003 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.</p>

<p>41:012:004 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shamefully handled.</p>

<p>41:012:005 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others; beating some, and killing some.</p>

<p>41:012:006 Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.</p>

<p>41:012:007 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our's.</p>

<p>41:012:008 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vineyard.</p>

<p>41:012:009 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others.</p>

<p>41:012:010 And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;builders rejected is become the head of the corner:</p>

<p>41:012:011 This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</p>

<p>41:012:012 And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they left him, and went their way.</p>

<p>41:012:013 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herodians, to catch him in his words.</p>

<p>41:012:014 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</p>

<p>41:012:015 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I may see it.</p>

<p>41:012:016 And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar's.</p>

<p>41:012:017 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's. And they marvelled at him.</p>

<p>41:012:018 Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resurrection; and they asked him, saying,</p>

<p>41:012:019 Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man's brother die, and leave<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p>

<p>41:012:020 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dying left no seed.</p>

<p>41:012:021 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the third likewise.</p>

<p>41:012:022 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;died also.</p>

<p>41:012:023 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</p>

<p>41:012:024 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</p>

<p>41:012:025 For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven.</p>

<p>41:012:026 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob?</p>

<p>41:012:027 He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore do greatly err.</p>

<p>41:012:028 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, Which is the first commandment of all?</p>

<p>41:012:029 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</p>

<p>41:012:030 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strength: this is the first commandment.</p>

<p>41:012:031 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than these.</p>

<p>41:012:032 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</p>

<p>41:012:033 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strength, and to love his neighbour as himself, is more than<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</p>

<p>41:012:034 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after that durst ask him any question.</p>

<p>41:012:035 And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?</p>

<p>41:012:036 For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;footstool.</p>

<p>41:012:037 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.</p>

<p>41:012:038 And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marketplaces,</p>

<p>41:012:039 And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at feasts:</p>

<p>41:012:040 Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</p>

<p>41:012:041 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cast in much.</p>

<p>41:012:042 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mites, which make a farthing.</p>

<p>41:012:043 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than all they which have cast into the treasury:</p>

<p>41:012:044 For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.</p>

<p>41:013:001 And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples saith<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are here!</p>

<p>41:013:002 And Jesus answering said unto him, Seest thou these great<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buildings? there shall not be left one stone upon another,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that shall not be thrown down.</p>

<p>41:013:003 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;privately,</p>

<p>41:013:004 Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?</p>

<p>41:013:005 And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deceive you:</p>

<p>41:013:006 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deceive many.</p>

<p>41:013:007 And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be yet.</p>

<p>41:013:008 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of sorrows.</p>

<p>41:013:009 But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;councils; and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten: and ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;testimony against them.</p>

<p>41:013:010 And the gospel must first be published among all nations.</p>

<p>41:013:011 But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thought beforehand what ye shall speak, neither do ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;premeditate: but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that speak ye: for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ghost.</p>

<p>41:013:012 Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father the son; and children shall rise up against their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.</p>

<p>41:013:013 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</p>

<p>41:013:014 But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that readeth understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the mountains:</p>

<p>41:013:015 And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house:</p>

<p>41:013:016 And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take up his garment.</p>

<p>41:013:017 But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suck in those days!</p>

<p>41:013:018 And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter.</p>

<p>41:013:019 For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the beginning of the creation which God created unto this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time, neither shall be.</p>

<p>41:013:020 And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chosen, he hath shortened the days.</p>

<p>41:013:021 And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lo, he is there; believe him not:</p>

<p>41:013:022 For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the elect.</p>

<p>41:013:023 But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.</p>

<p>41:013:024 But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,</p>

<p>41:013:025 And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven shall be shaken.</p>

<p>41:013:026 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with great power and glory.</p>

<p>41:013:027 And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth to the uttermost part of heaven.</p>

<p>41:013:028 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:</p>

<p>41:013:029 So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors.</p>

<p>41:013:030 Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;till all these things be done.</p>

<p>41:013:031 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away.</p>

<p>41:013:032 But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.</p>

<p>41:013:033 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is.</p>

<p>41:013:034 For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.</p>

<p>41:013:035 Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or in the morning:</p>

<p>41:013:036 Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.</p>

<p>41:013:037 And what I say unto you I say unto all, Watch.</p>

<p>41:014:001 After two days was the feast of the passover, and of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how they might take him by craft, and put him to death.</p>

<p>41:014:002 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the people.</p>

<p>41:014:003 And being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ointment of spikenard very precious; and she brake the box,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and poured it on his head.</p>

<p>41:014:004 And there were some that had indignation within themselves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?</p>

<p>41:014:005 For it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have been given to the poor. And they murmured against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her.</p>

<p>41:014:006 And Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrought a good work on me.</p>

<p>41:014:007 For ye have the poor with you always, and whensoever ye will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.</p>

<p>41:014:008 She hath done what she could: she is come aforehand to anoint<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my body to the burying.</p>

<p>41:014:009 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preached throughout the whole world, this also that she hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</p>

<p>41:014:010 And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went unto the chief<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priests, to betray him unto them.</p>

<p>41:014:011 And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</p>

<p>41:014:012 And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover?</p>

<p>41:014:013 And he sendeth forth two of his disciples, and saith unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them, Go ye into the city, and there shall meet you a man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bearing a pitcher of water: follow him.</p>

<p>41:014:014 And wheresoever he shall go in, say ye to the goodman of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house, The Master saith, Where is the guestchamber, where I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall eat the passover with my disciples?</p>

<p>41:014:015 And he will shew you a large upper room furnished and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prepared: there make ready for us.</p>

<p>41:014:016 And his disciples went forth, and came into the city, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passover.</p>

<p>41:014:017 And in the evening he cometh with the twelve.</p>

<p>41:014:018 And as they sat and did eat, Jesus said, Verily I say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, One of you which eateth with me shall betray me.</p>

<p>41:014:019 And they began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one, Is it I? and another said, Is it I?</p>

<p>41:014:020 And he answered and said unto them, It is one of the twelve,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that dippeth with me in the dish.</p>

<p>41:014:021 The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for that man if he had never been born.</p>

<p>41:014:022 And as they did eat, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and brake<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it, and gave to them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</p>

<p>41:014:023 And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to them: and they all drank of it.</p>

<p>41:014:024 And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is shed for many.</p>

<p>41:014:025 Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God.</p>

<p>41:014:026 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Olives.</p>

<p>41:014:027 And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the sheep shall be scattered.</p>

<p>41:014:028 But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>

<p>41:014:029 But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will not I.</p>

<p>41:014:030 And Jesus saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt deny me thrice.</p>

<p>41:014:031 But he spake the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said they all.</p>

<p>41:014:032 And they came to a place which was named Gethsemane: and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saith to his disciples, Sit ye here, while I shall pray.</p>

<p>41:014:033 And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be sore amazed, and to be very heavy;</p>

<p>41:014:034 And saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death: tarry ye here, and watch.</p>

<p>41:014:035 And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>41:014:036 And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take away this cup from me: nevertheless not what I will, but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what thou wilt.</p>

<p>41:014:037 And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest not thou watch one hour?</p>

<p>41:014:038 Watch ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. The spirit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truly is ready, but the flesh is weak.</p>

<p>41:014:039 And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words.</p>

<p>41:014:040 And when he returned, he found them asleep again, (for their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes were heavy,) neither wist they what to answer him.</p>

<p>41:014:041 And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now, and take your rest: it is enough, the hour is come;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>

<p>41:014:042 Rise up, let us go; lo, he that betrayeth me is at hand.</p>

<p>41:014:043 And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.</p>

<p>41:014:044 And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him away safely.</p>

<p>41:014:045 And as soon as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saith, Master, master; and kissed him.</p>

<p>41:014:046 And they laid their hands on him, and took him.</p>

<p>41:014:047 And one of them that stood by drew a sword, and smote a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</p>

<p>41:014:048 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?</p>

<p>41:014:049 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not: but the scriptures must be fulfilled.</p>

<p>41:014:050 And they all forsook him, and fled.</p>

<p>41:014:051 And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cloth cast about his naked body; and the young men laid hold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on him:</p>

<p>41:014:052 And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.</p>

<p>41:014:053 And they led Jesus away to the high priest: and with him were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scribes.</p>

<p>41:014:054 And Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high priest: and he sat with the servants, and warmed himself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the fire.</p>

<p>41:014:055 And the chief priests and all the council sought for witness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against Jesus to put him to death; and found none.</p>

<p>41:014:056 For many bare false witness against him, but their witness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agreed not together.</p>

<p>41:014:057 And there arose certain, and bare false witness against him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying,</p>

<p>41:014:058 We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands, and within three days I will build another made without<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands.</p>

<p>41:014:059 But neither so did their witness agree together.</p>

<p>41:014:060 And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against thee?</p>

<p>41:014:061 But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priest asked him, and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son of the Blessed?</p>

<p>41:014:062 And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heaven.</p>

<p>41:014:063 Then the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What need we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any further witnesses?</p>

<p>41:014:064 Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;condemned him to be guilty of death.</p>

<p>41:014:065 And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the servants<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did strike him with the palms of their hands.</p>

<p>41:014:066 And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the maids of the high priest:</p>

<p>41:014:067 And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked upon him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<p>41:014:068 But he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand I what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crew.</p>

<p>41:014:069 And a maid saw him again, and began to say to them that stood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by, This is one of them.</p>

<p>41:014:070 And he denied it again. And a little after, they that stood by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them: for thou art<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Galilaean, and thy speech agreeth thereto.</p>

<p>41:014:071 But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man of whom ye speak.</p>

<p>41:014:072 And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the word that Jesus said unto him, Before the cock crow twice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou shalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wept.</p>

<p>41:015:001 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him to Pilate.</p>

<p>41:015:002 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answering said unto them, Thou sayest it.</p>

<p>41:015:003 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered nothing.</p>

<p>41:015:004 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold how many things they witness against thee.</p>

<p>41:015:005 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</p>

<p>41:015:006 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whomsoever they desired.</p>

<p>41:015:007 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the insurrection.</p>

<p>41:015:008 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had ever done unto them.</p>

<p>41:015:009 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you the King of the Jews?</p>

<p>41:015:010 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</p>

<p>41:015:011 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;release Barabbas unto them.</p>

<p>41:015:012 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jews?</p>

<p>41:015:013 And they cried out again, Crucify him.</p>

<p>41:015:014 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</p>

<p>41:015:015 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, to be crucified.</p>

<p>41:015:016 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</p>

<p>41:015:017 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thorns, and put it about his head,</p>

<p>41:015:018 And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</p>

<p>41:015:019 And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</p>

<p>41:015:020 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crucify him.</p>

<p>41:015:021 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his cross.</p>

<p>41:015:022 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interpreted, The place of a skull.</p>

<p>41:015:023 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;received it not.</p>

<p>41:015:024 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</p>

<p>41:015:025 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</p>

<p>41:015:026 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KING OF THE JEWS.</p>

<p>41:015:027 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand, and the other on his left.</p>

<p>41:015:028 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numbered with the transgressors.</p>

<p>41:015:029 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it in three days,</p>

<p>41:015:030 Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</p>

<p>41:015:031 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</p>

<p>41:015:032 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reviled him.</p>

<p>41:015:033 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whole land until the ninth hour.</p>

<p>41:015:034 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>

<p>41:015:035 And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold, he calleth Elias.</p>

<p>41:015:036 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether Elias will come to take him down.</p>

<p>41:015:037 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</p>

<p>41:015:038 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the bottom.</p>

<p>41:015:039 And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man was the Son of God.</p>

<p>41:015:040 There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Salome;</p>

<p>41:015:041 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him unto Jerusalem.</p>

<p>41:015:042 And now when the even was come, because it was the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</p>

<p>41:015:043 Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</p>

<p>41:015:044 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dead.</p>

<p>41:015:045 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph.</p>

<p>41:015:046 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</p>

<p>41:015:047 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he was laid.</p>

<p>41:016:001 And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they might come and anoint him.</p>

<p>41:016:002 And very early in the morning the first day of the week, they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.</p>

<p>41:016:003 And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stone from the door of the sepulchre?</p>

<p>41:016:004 And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for it was very great.</p>

<p>41:016:005 And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were affrighted.</p>

<p>41:016:006 And he saith unto them, Be not affrighted: Ye seek Jesus of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nazareth, which was crucified: he is risen; he is not here:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold the place where they laid him.</p>

<p>41:016:007 But go your way, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto you.</p>

<p>41:016:008 And they went out quickly, and fled from the sepulchre; for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they trembled and were amazed: neither said they any thing to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any man; for they were afraid.</p>

<p>41:016:009 Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven devils.</p>

<p>41:016:010 And she went and told them that had been with him, as they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mourned and wept.</p>

<p>41:016:011 And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seen of her, believed not.</p>

<p>41:016:012 After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they walked, and went into the country.</p>

<p>41:016:013 And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they them.</p>

<p>41:016:014 Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they believed not them which had seen him after he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;risen.</p>

<p>41:016:015 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gospel to every creature.</p>

<p>41:016:016 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believeth not shall be damned.</p>

<p>41:016:017 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</p>

<p>41:016:018 They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sick, and they shall recover.</p>

<p>41:016:019 So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God.</p>

<p>41:016:020 And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;working with them, and confirming the word with signs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following. Amen.</p>
