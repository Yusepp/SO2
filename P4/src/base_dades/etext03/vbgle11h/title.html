<p align="justify">This second edition is dedicated with grateful
pleasure, as an acknowledgment that the chief part of whatever
scientific merit this journal and the other works of the author may
possess, has been derived from studying the well-known and
admirable</p>

<center>PRINCIPLES OF GEOLOGY.</center>

<center><b>PREFATORY NOTICE TO THE ILLUSTRATED
EDITION.</b></center>

<p align="justify">This work was described, on its first
appearance, by a writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> as "One of
the most interesting narratives of voyaging that it has fallen to
our lot to take up, and one which must always occupy a
distinguished place in the history of scientific navigation.</p>

<p align="justify">This prophecy has been amply verified by
experience; the extraordinary minuteness and accuracy of Mr.
Darwin's observations, combined with the charm and simplicity of
his descriptions, have ensured the popularity of this book with all
classes of readers&mdash;and that popularity has even increased in
recent years. No attempt, however, has hitherto been made to
produce an illustrated edition of this valuable work: numberless
places and objects are mentioned and described, but the difficulty
of obtaining authentic and original representations of them drawn
for the purpose has never been overcome until now.</p>

<p align="justify">Most of the views given in this work are from
sketches made on the spot by Mr. Pritchett, with Mr. Darwin's book
by his side. Some few of the others are taken from engravings which
Mr. Darwin had himself selected for their interest as illustrating
his voyage, and which have been kindly lent by his son.</p>

<p align="justify">Mr. Pritchett's name is well known in connection
with the voyages of the <i>Sunbeam</i> and <i>Wanderer</i>, and it
is believed that the illustrations, which have been chosen and
verified with the utmost care and pains, will greatly add to the
value and interest of the "V<small>OYAGE OF A</small>
N<small>ATURALIST</small>."</p>

<center><b>AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</b></center>

<p align="justify">I have stated in the preface to the first
Edition of this work, and in the <i>Zoology of the Voyage of the
Beagle</i>, that it was in consequence of a wish expressed by
Captain Fitz Roy, of having some scientific person on board,
accompanied by an offer from him of giving up part of his own
accommodations, that I volunteered my services, which received,
through the kindness of the hydrographer, Captain Beaufort, the
sanction of the Lords of the Admiralty. As I feel that the
opportunities which I enjoyed of studying the Natural History of
the different countries we visited have been wholly due to Captain
Fitz Roy, I hope I may here be permitted to repeat my expression of
gratitude to him; and to add that, during the five years we were
together, I received from him the most cordial friendship and
steady assistance. Both to Captain Fitz Roy and to all the Officers
of the <i>Beagle</i><sup>1</sup> I shall ever feel most thankful
for the undeviating kindness with which I was treated during our
long voyage.</p>

<p align="justify">This volume contains, in the form of a Journal,
a history of our voyage, and a sketch of those observations in
Natural History and Geology, which I think will possess some
interest for the general reader. I have in this edition largely
condensed and corrected some parts, and have added a little to
others, in order to render the volume more fitted for popular
reading; but I trust that naturalists will remember that they must
refer for details to the larger publications which comprise the
scientific results of the Expedition. The <i>Zoology of the Voyage
of the Beagle</i> includes an account of the Fossil Mammalia, by
Professor Owen; of the Living Mammalia, by Mr. Waterhouse; of the
Birds, by Mr. Gould; of the Fish, by the Reverend L. Jenyns; and of
the Reptiles, by Mr. Bell. I have appended to the descriptions of
each species an account of its habits and range. These works, which
I owe to the high talents and disinterested zeal of the above
distinguished authors, could not have been undertaken had it not
been for the liberality of the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's
Treasury, who, through the representation of the Right Honourable
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, have been pleased to grant a sum
of one thousand pounds towards defraying part of the expenses of
publication.</p>

<p align="justify">I have myself published separate volumes on the
<i>Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs</i>; on the <i>
Volcanic Islands visited during the Voyage of the Beagle</i>; and
on the <i>Geology of South America.</i> The sixth volume of the <i>
Geological Transactions</i> contains two papers of mine on the
Erratic Boulders and Volcanic Phenomena of South America. Messrs.
Waterhouse, Walker, Newman, and White, have published several able
papers on the Insects which were collected, and I trust that many
others will hereafter follow. The plants from the southern parts of
America will be given by Dr. J. Hooker, in his great work on the
Botany of the Southern Hemisphere. The Flora of the Galapagos
Archipelago is the subject of a separate memoir by him, in the <i>
Linnean Transactions.</i> The Reverend Professor Henslow has
published a list of the plants collected by me at the Keeling
Islands; and the Reverend J. M. Berkeley has described my
cryptogamic plants.</p>

<p align="justify">I shall have the pleasure of acknowledging the
great assistance which I have received from several other
naturalists in the course of this and my other works; but I must be
here allowed to return my most sincere thanks to the Reverend
Professor Henslow, who, when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge,
was one chief means of giving me a taste for Natural
History,&mdash;who, during my absence, took charge of the
collections I sent home, and by his correspondence directed my
endeavours,&mdash;and who, since my return, has constantly rendered
me every assistance which the kindest friend could offer.</p>

opportunity of returning my sincere thanks to Mr. Bynoe, the
surgeon of the <i>Beagle</i>, for his very kind attention to me
when I was ill at Valparaiso.</font></small></p>
