<p >**Etexts Readable By Both Humans and By Computers, Since 1971** <br /></p>*These Etexts Prepared By Hundreds of Volunteers and Donations* <br />
<p >December, 1975 [Etext #5] <br /></p>*****The Project Gutenberg Etext of The U. S. Constitution***** ******This file should be named const11.txt or const11.zip***** <br />
<p >Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, const12.txt VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, const10a.txt <br /></p>We apologize for the fact that the legal small print is longer, and more complicated, than the Etext itself; our legal beagles, of whom there are now a half dozen or so, insist this must be a part of any Project Gutenberg Etext we post, for our protection from the rest of the legal beagles out there. The US has twice as many lawyers as the rest of the world combined! <br />
<p >You are free to delete the headers and just keep the Etexts, we are not free not to post it this way. Again my apologies. The normal Project Gutenberg blurb has been deleted, you can get it in this location in most Project Gutenberg Etexts. Thanks, mh <br /></p><br />

<p >All of the original Project Gutenberg Etexts from the 1970's were produced in ALL CAPS, no lower case. The computers we used then didn't have lower case at all. <br /></p>*** <br />
<p >These original Project Gutenberg Etexts will be compiled into a file containing them all, in order to improve the content ratios of Etext to header material. <br /></p>*** <br />
<p ><br /></p>The following edition of The Consitution of the United States of America has been based on many hours of study of a variety of editions, and will include certain variant spellings, punctuation, and captialization as we have been able to reasonable ascertain belonged to the orginal. In case of internal discrepancies in these matters, most or all have been left. <br />
<p >In our orginal editions the letters were all CAPITALS, and we did not do anything about capitalization, consistent or otherwise, nor with most of the punctuation, since we had limited punctionation in those days. <br /></p>This document does NOT include the amendments, as the Bill of Rights was one of our earlier Project Gutenberg Etexts, and the others will be sent in a separate posting. <br />
