<h1>Book 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Samuel</h1>

<p>10:001:001 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abode two days in Ziklag;</p>

<p>10:001:002 It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</p>

<p>10:001:003 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</p>

<p>10:001:004 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</p>

<p>10:001:005 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</p>

<p>10:001:006 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</p>

<p>10:001:007 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I answered, Here am I.</p>

<p>10:001:008 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amalekite.</p>

<p>10:001:009 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in me.</p>

<p>10:001:010 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have brought them hither unto my lord.</p>

<p>10:001:011 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likewise all the men that were with him:</p>

<p>10:001:012 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sword.</p>

<p>10:001:013 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amalekite.</p>

<p>10:001:014 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?</p>

<p>10:001:015 And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</p>

<p>10:001:016 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD's anointed.</p>

<p>10:001:017 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan his son:</p>

<p>10:001:018 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)</p>

<p>10:001:019 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mighty fallen!</p>

<p>10:001:020 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</p>

<p>10:001:021 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as though he had not been anointed with oil.</p>

<p>10:001:022 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returned not empty.</p>

<p>10:001:023 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eagles, they were stronger than lions.</p>

<p>10:001:024 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon your apparel.</p>

<p>10:001:025 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.</p>

<p>10:001:026 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the love of women.</p>

<p>10:001:027 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</p>

<p>10:002:001 And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.</p>

<p>10:002:002 So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.</p>

<p>10:002:003 And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.</p>

<p>10:002:004 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.</p>

<p>10:002:005 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>10:002:006 And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing.</p>

<p>10:002:007 Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah have anointed me king over them.</p>

<p>10:002:008 But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;</p>

<p>10:002:009 And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all Israel.</p>

<p>10:002:010 Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah followed David.</p>

<p>10:002:011 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah was seven years and six months.</p>

<p>10:002:012 And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.</p>

<p>10:002:013 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other side of the pool.</p>

<p>10:002:014 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.</p>

<p>10:002:015 Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the servants of David.</p>

<p>10:002:016 And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gibeon.</p>

<p>10:002:017 And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.</p>

<p>10:002:018 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.</p>

<p>10:002:019 And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</p>

<p>10:002:020 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he answered, I am.</p>

<p>10:002:021 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following of him.</p>

<p>10:002:022 And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</p>

<p>10:002:023 Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.</p>

<p>10:002:024 Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.</p>

<p>10:002:025 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hill.</p>

<p>10:002:026 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return from following their brethren?</p>

<p>10:002:027 And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then in the morning the people had gone up every one from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following his brother.</p>

<p>10:002:028 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.</p>

<p>10:002:029 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came to Mahanaim.</p>

<p>10:002:030 And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servants nineteen men and Asahel.</p>

<p>10:002:031 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.</p>

<p>10:002:032 And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.</p>

<p>10:003:001 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</p>

<p>10:003:002 And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</p>

<p>10:003:003 And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</p>

<p>10:003:004 And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shephatiah the son of Abital;</p>

<p>10:003:005 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to David in Hebron.</p>

<p>10:003:006 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the house of Saul.</p>

<p>10:003:007 And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gone in unto my father's concubine?</p>

<p>10:003:008 Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this woman?</p>

<p>10:003:009 So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sworn to David, even so I do to him;</p>

<p>10:003:010 To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Beersheba.</p>

<p>10:003:011 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>10:003:012 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto thee.</p>

<p>10:003:013 And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comest to see my face.</p>

<p>10:003:014 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</p>

<p>10:003:015 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phaltiel the son of Laish.</p>

<p>10:003:016 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returned.</p>

<p>10:003:017 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:</p>

<p>10:003:018 Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their enemies.</p>

<p>10:003:019 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benjamin.</p>

<p>10:003:020 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.</p>

<p>10:003:021 And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in peace.</p>

<p>10:003:022 And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gone in peace.</p>

<p>10:003:023 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</p>

<p>10:003:024 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him away, and he is quite gone?</p>

<p>10:003:025 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that thou doest.</p>

<p>10:003:026 And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but David knew it not.</p>

<p>10:003:027 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother.</p>

<p>10:003:028 And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Ner:</p>

<p>10:003:029 Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.</p>

<p>10:003:030 So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</p>

<p>10:003:031 And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.</p>

<p>10:003:032 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wept.</p>

<p>10:003:033 And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fool dieth?</p>

<p>10:003:034 Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people wept again over him.</p>

<p>10:003:035 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.</p>

<p>10:003:036 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.</p>

<p>10:003:037 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.</p>

<p>10:003:038 And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</p>

<p>10:003:039 And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the doer of evil according to his wickedness.</p>

<p>10:004:001 And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.</p>

<p>10:004:002 And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.</p>

<p>10:004:003 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until this day.)</p>

<p>10:004:004 And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.</p>

<p>10:004:005 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.</p>

<p>10:004:006 And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.</p>

<p>10:004:007 For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all night.</p>

<p>10:004:008 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.</p>

<p>10:004:009 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</p>

<p>10:004:010 When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his tidings:</p>

<p>10:004:011 How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth?</p>

<p>10:004:012 And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.</p>

<p>10:005:001 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</p>

<p>10:005:002 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;captain over Israel.</p>

<p>10:005:003 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they anointed David king over Israel.</p>

<p>10:005:004 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reigned forty years.</p>

<p>10:005:005 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel and Judah.</p>

<p>10:005:006 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.</p>

<p>10:005:007 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the city of David.</p>

<p>10:005:008 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into the house.</p>

<p>10:005:009 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And David built round about from Millo and inward.</p>

<p>10:005:010 And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was with him.</p>

<p>10:005:011 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house.</p>

<p>10:005:012 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people Israel's sake.</p>

<p>10:005:013 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daughters born to David.</p>

<p>10:005:014 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</p>

<p>10:005:015 Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</p>

<p>10:005:016 And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.</p>

<p>10:005:017 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.</p>

<p>10:005:018 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Rephaim.</p>

<p>10:005:019 And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philistines into thine hand.</p>

<p>10:005:020 And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place Baalperazim.</p>

<p>10:005:021 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>10:005:022 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the valley of Rephaim.</p>

<p>10:005:023 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over against the mulberry trees.</p>

<p>10:005:024 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the host of the Philistines.</p>

<p>10:005:025 And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.</p>

<p>10:006:001 Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thirty thousand.</p>

<p>10:006:002 And David arose, and went with all the people that were with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that dwelleth between the cherubims.</p>

<p>10:006:003 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.</p>

<p>10:006:004 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ark.</p>

<p>10:006:005 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cymbals.</p>

<p>10:006:006 And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shook it.</p>

<p>10:006:007 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God.</p>

<p>10:006:008 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this day.</p>

<p>10:006:009 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ark of the LORD come to me?</p>

<p>10:006:010 So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Obededom the Gittite.</p>

<p>10:006:011 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his household.</p>

<p>10:006:012 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the house of Obededom into the city of David with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gladness.</p>

<p>10:006:013 And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.</p>

<p>10:006:014 And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was girded with a linen ephod.</p>

<p>10:006:015 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.</p>

<p>10:006:016 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her heart.</p>

<p>10:006:017 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the LORD.</p>

<p>10:006:018 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name of the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>10:006:019 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.</p>

<p>10:006:020 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!</p>

<p>10:006:021 And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore will I play before the LORD.</p>

<p>10:006:022 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of, of them shall I be had in honour.</p>

<p>10:006:023 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day of her death.</p>

<p>10:007:001 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;</p>

<p>10:007:002 That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;curtains.</p>

<p>10:007:003 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart; for the LORD is with thee.</p>

<p>10:007:004 And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto Nathan, saying,</p>

<p>10:007:005 Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build me an house for me to dwell in?</p>

<p>10:007:006 Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.</p>

<p>10:007:007 In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ye not me an house of cedar?</p>

<p>10:007:008 Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:</p>

<p>10:007:009 And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth.</p>

<p>10:007:010 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them any more, as beforetime,</p>

<p>10:007:011 And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house.</p>

<p>10:007:012 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</p>

<p>10:007:013 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throne of his kingdom for ever.</p>

<p>10:007:014 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stripes of the children of men:</p>

<p>10:007:015 But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saul, whom I put away before thee.</p>

<p>10:007:016 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.</p>

<p>10:007:017 According to all these words, and according to all this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>

<p>10:007:018 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought me hitherto?</p>

<p>10:007:019 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?</p>

<p>10:007:020 And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowest thy servant.</p>

<p>10:007:021 For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>10:007:022 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we have heard with our ears.</p>

<p>10:007:023 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to make him a name, and to do for you great things and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gods?</p>

<p>10:007:024 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God.</p>

<p>10:007:025 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do as thou hast said.</p>

<p>10:007:026 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David be established before thee.</p>

<p>10:007:027 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.</p>

<p>10:007:028 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</p>

<p>10:007:029 Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</p>

<p>10:008:001 And after this it came to pass that David smote the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the hand of the Philistines.</p>

<p>10:008:002 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.</p>

<p>10:008:003 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.</p>

<p>10:008:004 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chariots.</p>

<p>10:008:005 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand men.</p>

<p>10:008:006 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>

<p>10:008:007 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>10:008:008 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David took exceeding much brass.</p>

<p>10:008:009 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;host of Hadadezer,</p>

<p>10:008:010 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vessels of brass:</p>

<p>10:008:011 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subdued;</p>

<p>10:008:012 Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son of Rehob, king of Zobah.</p>

<p>10:008:013 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.</p>

<p>10:008:014 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>

<p>10:008:015 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and justice unto all his people.</p>

<p>10:008:016 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Ahilud was recorder;</p>

<p>10:008:017 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;</p>

<p>10:008:018 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.</p>

<p>10:009:001 And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?</p>

<p>10:009:002 And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.</p>

<p>10:009:003 And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feet.</p>

<p>10:009:004 And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ammiel, in Lodebar.</p>

<p>10:009:005 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.</p>

<p>10:009:006 Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant!</p>

<p>10:009:007 And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my table continually.</p>

<p>10:009:008 And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?</p>

<p>10:009:009 Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saul and to all his house.</p>

<p>10:009:010 Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fifteen sons and twenty servants.</p>

<p>10:009:011 Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as one of the king's sons.</p>

<p>10:009:012 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mephibosheth.</p>

<p>10:009:013 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.</p>

<p>10:010:001 And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.</p>

<p>10:010:002 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.</p>

<p>10:010:003 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to overthrow it?</p>

<p>10:010:004 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.</p>

<p>10:010:005 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.</p>

<p>10:010:006 And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand men.</p>

<p>10:010:007 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mighty men.</p>

<p>10:010:008 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the field.</p>

<p>10:010:009 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and put them in array against the Syrians:</p>

<p>10:010:010 And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the children of Ammon.</p>

<p>10:010:011 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, then I will come and help thee.</p>

<p>10:010:012 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seemeth him good.</p>

<p>10:010:013 And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.</p>

<p>10:010:014 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem.</p>

<p>10:010:015 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they gathered themselves together.</p>

<p>10:010:016 And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.</p>

<p>10:010:017 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;themselves in array against David, and fought with him.</p>

<p>10:010:018 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;died there.</p>

<p>10:010:019 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of Ammon any more.</p>

<p>10:011:001 And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;still at Jerusalem.</p>

<p>10:011:002 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was very beautiful to look upon.</p>

<p>10:011:003 And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Hittite?</p>

<p>10:011:004 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.</p>

<p>10:011:005 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;am with child.</p>

<p>10:011:006 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joab sent Uriah to David.</p>

<p>10:011:007 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.</p>

<p>10:011:008 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;followed him a mess of meat from the king.</p>

<p>10:011:009 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.</p>

<p>10:011:010 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?</p>

<p>10:011:011 And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.</p>

<p>10:011:012 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the morrow.</p>

<p>10:011:013 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his house.</p>

<p>10:011:014 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.</p>

<p>10:011:015 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he may be smitten, and die.</p>

<p>10:011:016 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were.</p>

<p>10:011:017 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uriah the Hittite died also.</p>

<p>10:011:018 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;war;</p>

<p>10:011:019 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of telling the matters of the war unto the king,</p>

<p>10:011:020 And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?</p>

<p>10:011:021 Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.</p>

<p>10:011:022 So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had sent him for.</p>

<p>10:011:023 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon them even unto the entering of the gate.</p>

<p>10:011:024 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hittite is dead also.</p>

<p>10:011:025 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.</p>

<p>10:011:026 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dead, she mourned for her husband.</p>

<p>10:011:027 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.</p>

<p>10:012:001 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the other poor.</p>

<p>10:012:002 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:</p>

<p>10:012:003 But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a daughter.</p>

<p>10:012:004 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.</p>

<p>10:012:005 And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this thing shall surely die:</p>

<p>10:012:006 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing, and because he had no pity.</p>

<p>10:012:007 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;</p>

<p>10:012:008 And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given unto thee such and such things.</p>

<p>10:012:009 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.</p>

<p>10:012:010 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.</p>

<p>10:012:011 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy wives in the sight of this sun.</p>

<p>10:012:012 For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all Israel, and before the sun.</p>

<p>10:012:013 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sin; thou shalt not die.</p>

<p>10:012:014 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is born unto thee shall surely die.</p>

<p>10:012:015 And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.</p>

<p>10:012:016 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.</p>

<p>10:012:017 And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bread with them.</p>

<p>10:012:018 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child is dead?</p>

<p>10:012:019 But when David saw that his servants whispered, David<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.</p>

<p>10:012:020 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.</p>

<p>10:012:021 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eat bread.</p>

<p>10:012:022 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the child may live?</p>

<p>10:012:023 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</p>

<p>10:012:024 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solomon: and the LORD loved him.</p>

<p>10:012:025 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</p>

<p>10:012:026 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;took the royal city.</p>

<p>10:012:027 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.</p>

<p>10:012:028 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it be called after my name.</p>

<p>10:012:029 And David gathered all the people together, and went to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.</p>

<p>10:012:030 And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city in great abundance.</p>

<p>10:012:031 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the people returned unto Jerusalem.</p>

<p>10:013:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David loved her.</p>

<p>10:013:002 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to do anything to her.</p>

<p>10:013:003 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.</p>

<p>10:013:004 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.</p>

<p>10:013:005 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at her hand.</p>

<p>10:013:006 So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sight, that I may eat at her hand.</p>

<p>10:013:007 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amnon's house, and dress him meat.</p>

<p>10:013:008 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his sight, and did bake the cakes.</p>

<p>10:013:009 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they went out every man from him.</p>

<p>10:013:010 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother.</p>

<p>10:013:011 And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.</p>

<p>10:013:012 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.</p>

<p>10:013:013 And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from thee.</p>

<p>10:013:014 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.</p>

<p>10:013:015 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.</p>

<p>10:013:016 And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he would not hearken unto her.</p>

<p>10:013:017 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.</p>

<p>10:013:018 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;door after her.</p>

<p>10:013:019 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and went on crying.</p>

<p>10:013:020 And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her brother Absalom's house.</p>

<p>10:013:021 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wroth.</p>

<p>10:013:022 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tamar.</p>

<p>10:013:023 And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absalom invited all the king's sons.</p>

<p>10:013:024 And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his servants go with thy servant.</p>

<p>10:013:025 And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.</p>

<p>10:013:026 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee?</p>

<p>10:013:027 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sons go with him.</p>

<p>10:013:028 Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.</p>

<p>10:013:029 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him up upon his mule, and fled.</p>

<p>10:013:030 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there is not one of them left.</p>

<p>10:013:031 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.</p>

<p>10:013:032 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he forced his sister Tamar.</p>

<p>10:013:033 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only is dead.</p>

<p>10:013:034 But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the way of the hill side behind him.</p>

<p>10:013:035 And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as thy servant said, so it is.</p>

<p>10:013:036 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wept very sore.</p>

<p>10:013:037 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.</p>

<p>10:013:038 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years.</p>

<p>10:013:039 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.</p>

<p>10:014:001 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was toward Absalom.</p>

<p>10:014:002 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:</p>

<p>10:014:003 And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joab put the words in her mouth.</p>

<p>10:014:004 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king.</p>

<p>10:014:005 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.</p>

<p>10:014:006 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other, and slew him.</p>

<p>10:014:007 And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor remainder upon the earth.</p>

<p>10:014:008 And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will give charge concerning thee.</p>

<p>10:014:009 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his throne be guiltless.</p>

<p>10:014:010 And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, and he shall not touch thee any more.</p>

<p>10:014:011 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth.</p>

<p>10:014:012 Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.</p>

<p>10:014:013 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;home again his banished.</p>

<p>10:014:014 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expelled from him.</p>

<p>10:014:015 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.</p>

<p>10:014:016 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the inheritance of God.</p>

<p>10:014:017 Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be with thee.</p>

<p>10:014:018 Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.</p>

<p>10:014:019 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thine handmaid:</p>

<p>10:014:020 To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.</p>

<p>10:014:021 And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.</p>

<p>10:014:022 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.</p>

<p>10:014:023 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem.</p>

<p>10:014:024 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not the king's face.</p>

<p>10:014:025 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</p>

<p>10:014:026 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two hundred shekels after the king's weight.</p>

<p>10:014:027 And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.</p>

<p>10:014:028 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king's face.</p>

<p>10:014:029 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second time, he would not come.</p>

<p>10:014:030 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absalom's servants set the field on fire.</p>

<p>10:014:031 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?</p>

<p>10:014:032 And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.</p>

<p>10:014:033 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absalom.</p>

<p>10:015:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</p>

<p>10:015:002 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of one of the tribes of Israel.</p>

<p>10:015:003 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.</p>

<p>10:015:004 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, and I would do him justice!</p>

<p>10:015:005 And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him.</p>

<p>10:015:006 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel.</p>

<p>10:015:007 And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.</p>

<p>10:015:008 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then I will serve the LORD.</p>

<p>10:015:009 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Hebron.</p>

<p>10:015:010 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.</p>

<p>10:015:011 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not any thing.</p>

<p>10:015:012 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increased continually with Absalom.</p>

<p>10:015:013 And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men of Israel are after Absalom.</p>

<p>10:015:014 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edge of the sword.</p>

<p>10:015:015 And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appoint.</p>

<p>10:015:016 And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house.</p>

<p>10:015:017 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tarried in a place that was far off.</p>

<p>10:015:018 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king.</p>

<p>10:015:019 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.</p>

<p>10:015:020 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee.</p>

<p>10:015:021 And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy servant be.</p>

<p>10:015:022 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that were with him.</p>

<p>10:015:023 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wilderness.</p>

<p>10:015:024 And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passing out of the city.</p>

<p>10:015:025 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:</p>

<p>10:015:026 But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.</p>

<p>10:015:027 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</p>

<p>10:015:028 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come word from you to certify me.</p>

<p>10:015:029 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</p>

<p>10:015:030 And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the people that was with him covered every man his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</p>

<p>10:015:031 And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</p>

<p>10:015:032 And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:</p>

<p>10:015:033 Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt be a burden unto me:</p>

<p>10:015:034 But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</p>

<p>10:015:035 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</p>

<p>10:015:036 Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send unto me every thing that ye can hear.</p>

<p>10:015:037 So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into Jerusalem.</p>

<p>10:016:001 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fruits, and a bottle of wine.</p>

<p>10:016:002 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.</p>

<p>10:016:003 And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of my father.</p>

<p>10:016:004 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.</p>

<p>10:016:005 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.</p>

<p>10:016:006 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right hand and on his left.</p>

<p>10:016:007 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bloody man, and thou man of Belial:</p>

<p>10:016:008 The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bloody man.</p>

<p>10:016:009 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, and take off his head.</p>

<p>10:016:010 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so?</p>

<p>10:016:011 And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.</p>

<p>10:016:012 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.</p>

<p>10:016:013 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;threw stones at him, and cast dust.</p>

<p>10:016:014 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weary, and refreshed themselves there.</p>

<p>10:016:015 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.</p>

<p>10:016:016 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king, God save the king.</p>

<p>10:016:017 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?</p>

<p>10:016:018 And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with him will I abide.</p>

<p>10:016:019 And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presence, so will I be in thy presence.</p>

<p>10:016:020 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we shall do.</p>

<p>10:016:021 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.</p>

<p>10:016:022 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all Israel.</p>

<p>10:016:023 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absalom.</p>

<p>10:017:001 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this night:</p>

<p>10:017:002 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall flee; and I will smite the king only:</p>

<p>10:017:003 And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in peace.</p>

<p>10:017:004 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel.</p>

<p>10:017:005 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us hear likewise what he saith.</p>

<p>10:017:006 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after his saying? if not; speak thou.</p>

<p>10:017:007 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given is not good at this time.</p>

<p>10:017:008 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;man of war, and will not lodge with the people.</p>

<p>10:017:009 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.</p>

<p>10:017:010 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men.</p>

<p>10:017:011 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;person.</p>

<p>10:017:012 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall not be left so much as one.</p>

<p>10:017:013 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until there be not one small stone found there.</p>

<p>10:017:014 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absalom.</p>

<p>10:017:015 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.</p>

<p>10:017:016 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are with him.</p>

<p>10:017:017 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they went and told king David.</p>

<p>10:017:018 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;down.</p>

<p>10:017:019 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known.</p>

<p>10:017:020 And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had sought and could not find them, they returned to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem.</p>

<p>10:017:021 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hath Ahithophel counselled against you.</p>

<p>10:017:022 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of them that was not gone over Jordan.</p>

<p>10:017:023 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.</p>

<p>10:017:024 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he and all the men of Israel with him.</p>

<p>10:017:025 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.</p>

<p>10:017:026 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.</p>

<p>10:017:027 And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gileadite of Rogelim,</p>

<p>10:017:028 Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and parched pulse,</p>

<p>10:017:029 And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wilderness.</p>

<p>10:018:001 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.</p>

<p>10:018:002 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surely go forth with you myself also.</p>

<p>10:018:003 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us out of the city.</p>

<p>10:018:004 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out by hundreds and by thousands.</p>

<p>10:018:005 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charge concerning Absalom.</p>

<p>10:018:006 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;battle was in the wood of Ephraim;</p>

<p>10:018:007 Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twenty thousand men.</p>

<p>10:018:008 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sword devoured.</p>

<p>10:018:009 And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him went away.</p>

<p>10:018:010 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saw Absalom hanged in an oak.</p>

<p>10:018:011 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a girdle.</p>

<p>10:018:012 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;touch the young man Absalom.</p>

<p>10:018:013 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.</p>

<p>10:018:014 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.</p>

<p>10:018:015 And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smote Absalom, and slew him.</p>

<p>10:018:016 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.</p>

<p>10:018:017 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel fled every one to his tent.</p>

<p>10:018:018 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absalom's place.</p>

<p>10:018:019 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enemies.</p>

<p>10:018:020 And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.</p>

<p>10:018:021 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.</p>

<p>10:018:022 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no tidings ready?</p>

<p>10:018:023 But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.</p>

<p>10:018:024 And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.</p>

<p>10:018:025 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;apace, and drew near.</p>

<p>10:018:026 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.</p>

<p>10:018:027 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.</p>

<p>10:018:028 And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.</p>

<p>10:018:029 And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.</p>

<p>10:018:030 And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned aside, and stood still.</p>

<p>10:018:031 And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rose up against thee.</p>

<p>10:018:032 And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is.</p>

<p>10:018:033 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!</p>

<p>10:019:001 And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Absalom.</p>

<p>10:019:002 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people: for the people heard say that day how the king was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grieved for his son.</p>

<p>10:019:003 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.</p>

<p>10:019:004 But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!</p>

<p>10:019:005 And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concubines;</p>

<p>10:019:006 In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee well.</p>

<p>10:019:007 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;youth until now.</p>

<p>10:019:008 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every man to his tent.</p>

<p>10:019:009 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.</p>

<p>10:019:010 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?</p>

<p>10:019:011 And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.</p>

<p>10:019:012 Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then are ye the last to bring back the king?</p>

<p>10:019:013 And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;host before me continually in the room of Joab.</p>

<p>10:019:014 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return thou, and all thy servants.</p>

<p>10:019:015 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jordan.</p>

<p>10:019:016 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.</p>

<p>10:019:017 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king.</p>

<p>10:019:018 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;</p>

<p>10:019:019 And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perversely the day that my lord the king went out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.</p>

<p>10:019:020 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.</p>

<p>10:019:021 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anointed?</p>

<p>10:019:022 And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know that I am this day king over Israel?</p>

<p>10:019:023 Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king sware unto him.</p>

<p>10:019:024 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day he came again in peace.</p>

<p>10:019:025 And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with me, Mephibosheth?</p>

<p>10:019:026 And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.</p>

<p>10:019:027 And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good in thine eyes.</p>

<p>10:019:028 For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any more unto the king?</p>

<p>10:019:029 And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.</p>

<p>10:019:030 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own house.</p>

<p>10:019:031 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.</p>

<p>10:019:032 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.</p>

<p>10:019:033 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.</p>

<p>10:019:034 And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?</p>

<p>10:019:035 I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burden unto my lord the king?</p>

<p>10:019:036 Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?</p>

<p>10:019:037 Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee.</p>

<p>10:019:038 And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.</p>

<p>10:019:039 And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returned unto his own place.</p>

<p>10:019:040 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people of Israel.</p>

<p>10:019:041 And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all David's men with him, over Jordan?</p>

<p>10:019:042 And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he given us any gift?</p>

<p>10:019:043 And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men of Israel.</p>

<p>10:020:001 And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and said, We have no part in David, neither have we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel.</p>

<p>10:020:002 So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.</p>

<p>10:020:003 And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;living in widowhood.</p>

<p>10:020:004 Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;within three days, and be thou here present.</p>

<p>10:020:005 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;longer than the set time which he had appointed him.</p>

<p>10:020:006 And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and escape us.</p>

<p>10:020:007 And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</p>

<p>10:020:008 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fell out.</p>

<p>10:020:009 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.</p>

<p>10:020:010 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bichri.</p>

<p>10:020:011 And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joab.</p>

<p>10:020:012 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.</p>

<p>10:020:013 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.</p>

<p>10:020:014 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;together, and went also after him.</p>

<p>10:020:015 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wall, to throw it down.</p>

<p>10:020:016 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee.</p>

<p>10:020:017 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.</p>

<p>10:020:018 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ended the matter.</p>

<p>10:020:019 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?</p>

<p>10:020:020 And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should swallow up or destroy.</p>

<p>10:020:021 The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shall be thrown to thee over the wall.</p>

<p>10:020:022 Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the king.</p>

<p>10:020:023 Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:</p>

<p>10:020:024 And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahilud was recorder:</p>

<p>10:020:025 And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:</p>

<p>10:020:026 And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.</p>

<p>10:021:001 Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slew the Gibeonites.</p>

<p>10:021:002 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;children of Israel and Judah.)</p>

<p>10:021:003 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bless the inheritance of the LORD?</p>

<p>10:021:004 And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do for you.</p>

<p>10:021:005 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in any of the coasts of Israel,</p>

<p>10:021:006 Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;did choose. And the king said, I will give them.</p>

<p>10:021:007 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.</p>

<p>10:021:008 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:</p>

<p>10:021:009 And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all seven together, and were put to death in the days of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;harvest.</p>

<p>10:021:010 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the field by night.</p>

<p>10:021:011 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concubine of Saul, had done.</p>

<p>10:021:012 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gilboa:</p>

<p>10:021:013 And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were hanged.</p>

<p>10:021:014 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after that God was intreated for the land.</p>

<p>10:021:015 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Philistines: and David waxed faint.</p>

<p>10:021:016 And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slain David.</p>

<p>10:021:017 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou quench not the light of Israel.</p>

<p>10:021:018 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.</p>

<p>10:021:019 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a weaver's beam.</p>

<p>10:021:020 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the giant.</p>

<p>10:021:021 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brother of David slew him.</p>

<p>10:021:022 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</p>

<p>10:022:001 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:</p>

<p>10:022:002 And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deliverer;</p>

<p>10:022:003 The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;saviour; thou savest me from violence.</p>

<p>10:022:004 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I be saved from mine enemies.</p>

<p>10:022:005 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men made me afraid;</p>

<p>10:022:006 The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prevented me;</p>

<p>10:022:007 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enter into his ears.</p>

<p>10:022:008 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moved and shook, because he was wroth.</p>

<p>10:022:009 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p>

<p>10:022:010 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under his feet.</p>

<p>10:022:011 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wings of the wind.</p>

<p>10:022:012 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and thick clouds of the skies.</p>

<p>10:022:013 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</p>

<p>10:022:014 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;voice.</p>

<p>10:022:015 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discomfited them.</p>

<p>10:022:016 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blast of the breath of his nostrils.</p>

<p>10:022:017 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;</p>

<p>10:022:018 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me: for they were too strong for me.</p>

<p>10:022:019 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my stay.</p>

<p>10:022:020 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because he delighted in me.</p>

<p>10:022:021 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>

<p>10:022:022 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;departed from my God.</p>

<p>10:022:023 For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not depart from them.</p>

<p>10:022:024 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iniquity.</p>

<p>10:022:025 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.</p>

<p>10:022:026 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.</p>

<p>10:022:027 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.</p>

<p>10:022:028 And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.</p>

<p>10:022:029 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;darkness.</p>

<p>10:022:030 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leaped over a wall.</p>

<p>10:022:031 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.</p>

<p>10:022:032 For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God?</p>

<p>10:022:033 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.</p>

<p>10:022:034 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high places.</p>

<p>10:022:035 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by mine arms.</p>

<p>10:022:036 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gentleness hath made me great.</p>

<p>10:022:037 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slip.</p>

<p>10:022:038 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not again until I had consumed them.</p>

<p>10:022:039 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</p>

<p>10:022:040 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.</p>

<p>10:022:041 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might destroy them that hate me.</p>

<p>10:022:042 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he answered them not.</p>

<p>10:022:043 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abroad.</p>

<p>10:022:044 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knew not shall serve me.</p>

<p>10:022:045 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear, they shall be obedient unto me.</p>

<p>10:022:046 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their close places.</p>

<p>10:022:047 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God of the rock of my salvation.</p>

<p>10:022:048 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;under me.</p>

<p>10:022:049 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hast delivered me from the violent man.</p>

<p>10:022:050 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.</p>

<p>10:022:051 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.</p>

<p>10:023:001 Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,</p>

<p>10:023:002 The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tongue.</p>

<p>10:023:003 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.</p>

<p>10:023:004 And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.</p>

<p>10:023:005 Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it not to grow.</p>

<p>10:023:006 But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away, because they cannot be taken with hands:</p>

<p>10:023:007 But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fire in the same place.</p>

<p>10:023:008 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred, whom he slew at one time.</p>

<p>10:023:009 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the three mighty men with David, when they defied the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the men of Israel were gone away:</p>

<p>10:023:010 He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great victory that day; and the people returned after him only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to spoil.</p>

<p>10:023:011 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Philistines.</p>

<p>10:023:012 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.</p>

<p>10:023:013 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.</p>

<p>10:023:014 And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philistines was then in Bethlehem.</p>

<p>10:023:015 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!</p>

<p>10:023:016 And the three mighty men brake through the host of the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unto the LORD.</p>

<p>10:023:017 And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;these three mighty men.</p>

<p>10:023:018 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.</p>

<p>10:023:019 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.</p>

<p>10:023:020 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in time of snow:</p>

<p>10:023:021 And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with his own spear.</p>

<p>10:023:022 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among three mighty men.</p>

<p>10:023:023 He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the first three. And David set him over his guard.</p>

<p>10:023:024 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</p>

<p>10:023:025 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,</p>

<p>10:023:026 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,</p>

<p>10:023:027 Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,</p>

<p>10:023:028 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,</p>

<p>10:023:029 Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,</p>

<p>10:023:030 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,</p>

<p>10:023:031 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,</p>

<p>10:023:032 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,</p>

<p>10:023:033 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,</p>

<p>10:023:034 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,</p>

<p>10:023:035 Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,</p>

<p>10:023:036 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,</p>

<p>10:023:037 Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joab the son of Zeruiah,</p>

<p>10:023:038 Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,</p>

<p>10:023:039 Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.</p>

<p>10:024:001 And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judah.</p>

<p>10:024:002 For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the number of the people.</p>

<p>10:024:003 And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king delight in this thing?</p>

<p>10:024:004 Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people of Israel.</p>

<p>10:024:005 And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gad, and toward Jazer:</p>

<p>10:024:006 Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,</p>

<p>10:024:007 And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;south of Judah, even to Beersheba.</p>

<p>10:024:008 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</p>

<p>10:024:009 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hundred thousand men.</p>

<p>10:024:010 And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</p>

<p>10:024:011 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</p>

<p>10:024:012 Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</p>

<p>10:024:013 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>10:024:014 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let me not fall into the hand of man.</p>

<p>10:024:015 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.</p>

<p>10:024:016 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Araunah the Jebusite.</p>

<p>10:024:017 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;house.</p>

<p>10:024:018 And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jebusite.</p>

<p>10:024:019 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commanded.</p>

<p>10:024:020 And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the king on his face upon the ground.</p>

<p>10:024:021 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the people.</p>

<p>10:024:022 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instruments of the oxen for wood.</p>

<p>10:024:023 All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.</p>

<p>10:024:024 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silver.</p>

<p>10:024:025 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.</p>
