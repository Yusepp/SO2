<p>THAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They
hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one
watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern door.
Nobody entered the alley or left it; nobody resembling the
Spaniard entered or left the tavern door. The night promised to
be a fair one; so Tom went home with the understanding that if a
considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck was to come and
"maow," whereupon he would slip out and try the keys. But the
night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to
bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.</p>

<br><br>

<br><br><br><br>  

<p>Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But
Thursday night promised better. Tom slipped out in good season
with his aunt's old tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold
it with. He hid the lantern in Huck's sugar hogshead and the
watch began. An hour before midnight the tavern closed up and its
lights (the only ones thereabouts) were put out. No Spaniard had
been seen. Nobody had entered or left the alley. Everything was
auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned, the perfect
stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of
distant thunder.</p>

<p>Tom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it
closely in the towel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom
toward the tavern. Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into
the alley. Then there was a season of waiting anxiety that
weighed upon Huck's spirits like a mountain. He began to wish he
could see a flash from the lantern&mdash;it would frighten him,
but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive yet. It seemed
hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have fainted;
maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and
excitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer
and closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things,
and momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would
take away his breath. There was not much to take away, for he
seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would
soon wear itself out, the way it was beating. Suddenly there was
a flash of light and Tom came tearing by him: "Run!" said he;
"run, for your life!"</p>

<p>He needn't have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making
thirty or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered.
The boys never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted
slaughter-house at the lower end of the village. Just as they got
within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down. As
soon as Tom got his breath he said:</p>

<p>"Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as
I could; but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I
couldn't hardly get my breath I was so scared. They wouldn't turn
in the lock, either. Well, without noticing what I was doing, I
took hold of the knob, and open comes the door! It warn't locked!
I hopped in, and shook off the towel, and, GREAT CAESAR'S
GHOST!"</p>

<br><br><br><br>  

<p>"What!&mdash;what'd you see, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe's hand!"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his
old patch on his eye and his arms spread out."</p>

<p>"Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?"</p>

<p>"No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel
and started!"</p>

<p>"I'd never 'a' thought of the towel, I bet!"</p>

<p>"Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost
it."</p>

<p>"Say, Tom, did you see that box?"</p>

<p>"Huck, I didn't wait to look around. I didn't see the box, I
didn't see the cross. I didn't see anything but a bottle and a
tin cup on the floor by Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and
lots more bottles in the room. Don't you see, now, what's the
matter with that ha'nted room?"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Why, it's ha'nted with whiskey! Maybe ALL the Temperance
Taverns have got a ha'nted room, hey, Huck?"</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon maybe that's so. Who'd 'a' thought such a
thing? But say, Tom, now's a mighty good time to get that box, if
Injun Joe's drunk."</p>

<p>"It is, that! You try it!"</p>

<p>Huck shuddered.</p>

<p>"Well, no&mdash;I reckon not."</p>

<p>"And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun
Joe ain't enough. If there'd been three, he'd be drunk enough and
I'd do it."</p>

<p>There was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:</p>

<p>"Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we
know Injun Joe's not in there. It's too scary. Now, if we watch
every night, we'll be dead sure to see him go out, some time or
other, and then we'll snatch that box quicker'n lightning."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm agreed. I'll watch the whole night long, and I'll
do it every night, too, if you'll do the other part of the
job."</p>

<p>"All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper
Street a block and maow&mdash;and if I'm asleep, you throw some
gravel at the window and that'll fetch me."</p>

<p>"Agreed, and good as wheat!"</p>

<p>"Now, Huck, the storm's over, and I'll go home. It'll begin to
be daylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that
long, will you?"</p>

<p>"I said I would, Tom, and I will. I'll ha'nt that tavern every
night for a year! I'll sleep all day and I'll stand watch all
night."</p>

<p>"That's all right. Now, where you going to sleep?"</p>

<p>"In Ben Rogers' hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap's
nigger man, Uncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he
wants me to, and any time I ask him he gives me a little
something to eat if he can spare it. That's a mighty good nigger,
Tom. He likes me, becuz I don't ever act as if I was above him.
Sometime I've set right down and eat WITH him. But you needn't
tell that. A body's got to do things when he's awful hungry he
wouldn't want to do as a steady thing."</p>

<p>"Well, if I don't want you in the daytime, I'll let you sleep.
I won't come bothering around. Any time you see something's up,
in the night, just skip right around and maow."</p>

<p>THE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece
of news&mdash; Judge Thatcher's family had come back to town the
night before. Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into
secondary importance for a moment, and Becky took the chief
place in the boy's interest. He saw her and they had an
exhausting good time playing "hispy" and "gully-keeper" with a
crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in
a peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to
appoint the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed
picnic, and she consented. The child's delight was boundless; and
Tom's not more moderate. The invitations were sent out before
sunset, and straightway the young folks of the village were
thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation.
Tom's excitement enabled him to keep awake until a pretty late
hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck's "maow," and of
having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers with,
next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that
night.</p>

<p>Morning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy
and rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher's, and
everything was ready for a start. It was not the custom for
elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence. The
children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few
young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of
twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was
chartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the
main street laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to
miss the fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last
thing Mrs. Thatcher said to Becky, was:</p>

<p>"You'll not get back till late. Perhaps you'd better stay all
night with some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing,
child."</p>

<p>"Then I'll stay with Susy Harper, mamma."</p>

<p>"Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don't be any
trouble."</p>

<p>Presently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;I'll tell you what we'll do. 'Stead of going to Joe
Harper's we'll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow
Douglas'. She'll have ice-cream! She has it most every
day&mdash;dead loads of it. And she'll be awful glad to have
us."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be fun!"</p>

<p>Then Becky reflected a moment and said:</p>

<p>"But what will mamma say?"</p>

<p>"How'll she ever know?"</p>

<p>The girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said
reluctantly:</p>

<p>"I reckon it's wrong&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But shucks! Your mother won't know, and so what's the harm?
All she wants is that you'll be safe; and I bet you she'd 'a'
said go there if she'd 'a' thought of it. I know she would!"</p>

<p>The Widow Douglas' splendid hospitality was a tempting bait.
It and Tom's persuasions presently carried the day. So it was
decided to say nothing anybody about the night's programme.
Presently it occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might come this very
night and give the signal. The thought took a deal of the spirit
out of his anticipations. Still he could not bear to give up the
fun at Widow Douglas'. And why should he give it up, he
reasoned&mdash;the signal did not come the night before, so why
should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of
the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he
determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow
himself to think of the box of money another time that day.</p>

<p>Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a
woody hollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the
forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with
shoutings and laughter. All the different ways of getting hot and
tired were gone through with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled
back to camp fortified with responsible appetites, and then the
destruction of the good things began. After the feast there was a
refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading
oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:</p>

<p>"Who's ready for the cave?"</p>

<p>Everybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and
straightway there was a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of
the cave was up the hillside&mdash;an opening shaped like a
letter A. Its massive oaken door stood unbarred. Within was a
small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled by Nature with
solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was romantic
and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon
the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of
the situation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The
moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the
owner of it; a struggle and a gallant defence followed, but the
candle was soon knocked down or blown out, and then there was a
glad clamor of laughter and a new chase. But all things have an
end. By-and-by the procession went filing down the steep descent
of the main avenue, the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing
the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty
feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than eight or ten
feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower
crevices branched from it on either hand&mdash;for McDougal's
cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into
each other and out again and led nowhere. It was said that one
might wander days and nights together through its intricate
tangle of rifts and chasms, and never find the end of the cave;
and that he might go down, and down, and still down, into the
earth, and it was just the same&mdash;labyrinth under labyrinth,
and no end to any of them. No man "knew" the cave. That was an
impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and
it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion.
Tom Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one.</p>

<br><br>

</center>
<br><br><br><br>  

<p>The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters
of a mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into
branch avenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each
other by surprise at points where the corridors joined again.
Parties were able to elude each other for the space of half an
hour without going beyond the "known" ground.</p>

<p>By-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the
mouth of the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot
with tallow drippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted
with the success of the day. Then they were astonished to find
that they had been taking no note of time and that night was
about at hand. The clanging bell had been calling for half an
hour. However, this sort of close to the day's adventures was
romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat with her
wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for
the wasted time but the captain of the craft.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="29-221"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="29-221.jpg (52K)" src="29-221.jpg" height="497" width="352">
</center>
<br><br><br><br>  

<p>Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat's lights
went glinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the
young people were as subdued and still as people usually are who
are nearly tired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why
she did not stop at the wharf&mdash;and then he dropped her out
of his mind and put his attention upon his business. The night
was growing cloudy and dark. Ten o'clock came, and the noise of
vehicles ceased, scattered lights began to wink out, all
straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village betook itself
to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence
and the ghosts. Eleven o'clock came, and the tavern lights were
put out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a
weary long time, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening.
Was there any use? Was there really any use? Why not give it up
and turn in?</p>

<p>A noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant.
The alley door closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the
brick store. The next moment two men brushed by him, and one
seemed to have something under his arm. It must be that box! So
they were going to remove the treasure. Why call Tom now? It
would be absurd&mdash;the men would get away with the box and
never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow
them; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery.
So communing with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along
behind the men, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep
just far enough ahead not to be invisible.</p>

<p>They moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to
the left up a crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until
they came to the path that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took.
They passed by the old Welshman's house, halfway up the hill,
without hesitating, and still climbed upward. Good, thought
Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry. But they never stopped
at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit. They plunged into
the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and were at once
hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his distance,
now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along
awhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast;
moved on a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound;
none, save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart.
The hooting of an owl came over the hill&mdash;ominous sound! But
no footsteps. Heavens, was everything lost! He was about to
spring with winged feet, when a man cleared his throat not four
feet from him! Huck's heart shot into his throat, but he
swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as if a dozen
agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he
thought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was.
He knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow
Douglas' grounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there;
it won't be hard to find.</p>

<p>Now there was a voice&mdash;a very low voice&mdash;Injun
Joe's:</p>

<p>"Damn her, maybe she's got company&mdash;there's lights, late
as it is."</p>

<p>"I can't see any."</p>

<p>This was that stranger's voice&mdash;the stranger of the
haunted house. A deadly chill went to Huck's heart&mdash;this,
then, was the "revenge" job! His thought was, to fly. Then he
remembered that the Widow Douglas had been kind to him more than
once, and maybe these men were going to murder her. He wished he
dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn't dare&mdash;they
might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in the
moment that elapsed between the stranger's remark and Injun Joe's
next&mdash;which was&mdash;</p>

<p>"Because the bush is in your way. Now&mdash;this way&mdash;now
you see, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, there IS company there, I reckon. Better give it
up."</p>

<p>"Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it
up and maybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I've
told you before, I don't care for her swag&mdash;you may have it.
But her husband was rough on me&mdash;many times he was rough on
me&mdash;and mainly he was the justice of the peace that jugged
me for a vagrant. And that ain't all. It ain't a millionth part
of it! He had me HORSEWHIPPED!&mdash; horsewhipped in front of
the jail, like a nigger!&mdash;with all the town looking on!
HORSEWHIPPED!&mdash;do you understand? He took advantage of me
and died. But I'll take it out of HER."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't kill her! Don't do that!"</p>

<p>"Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill HIM if he
was here; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman
you don't kill her &mdash;bosh! you go for her looks. You slit
her nostrils&mdash;you notch her ears like a sow!"</p>

<p>"By God, that's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you.
I'll tie her to the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my
fault? I'll not cry, if she does. My friend, you'll help me in
this thing&mdash;for MY sake&mdash; that's why you're
here&mdash;I mightn't be able alone. If you flinch, I'll kill
you. Do you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I'll kill
her&mdash;and then I reckon nobody'll ever know much about who
done this business."</p>

<p>"Well, if it's got to be done, let's get at it. The quicker
the better &mdash;I'm all in a shiver."</p>

<p>"Do it NOW? And company there? Look here&mdash;I'll get
suspicious of you, first thing you know. No&mdash;we'll wait till
the lights are out&mdash; there's no hurry."</p>

<p>Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue&mdash;a thing
still more awful than any amount of murderous talk; so he held
his breath and stepped gingerly back; planted his foot carefully
and firmly, after balancing, one-legged, in a precarious way and
almost toppling over, first on one side and then on the other. He
took another step back, with the same elaboration and the same
risks; then another and another, and&mdash;a twig snapped under
his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no
sound&mdash;the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was
measureless. Now he turned in his tracks, between the walls of
sumach bushes&mdash;turned himself as carefully as if he were a
ship&mdash;and then stepped quickly but cautiously along. When he
emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and so he picked up his
nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he reached the
Welshman's. He banged at the door, and presently the heads of the
old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.</p>

<p>"What's the row there? Who's banging? What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Let me in&mdash;quick! I'll tell everything."</p>

<p>"Why, who are you?"</p>

<p>"Huckleberry Finn&mdash;quick, let me in!"</p>

<p>"Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain't a name to open many doors,
I judge! But let him in, lads, and let's see what's the
trouble."</p>

<p>"Please don't ever tell I told you," were Huck's first words
when he got in. "Please don't&mdash;I'd be killed, sure&mdash;but
the widow's been good friends to me sometimes, and I want to
tell&mdash;I WILL tell if you'll promise you won't ever say it
was me."</p>

<p>"By George, he HAS got something to tell, or he wouldn't act
so!" exclaimed the old man; "out with it and nobody here'll ever
tell, lad."</p>

<p>Three minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were
up the hill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their
weapons in their hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid
behind a great bowlder and fell to listening. There was a
lagging, anxious silence, and then all of a sudden there was an
explosion of firearms and a cry.</p>

<p>Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down
the hill as fast as his legs could carry him.</p>

<p>AS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning,
Huck came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old
Welshman's door. The inmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that
was set on a hair-trigger, on account of the exciting episode of
the night. A call came from a window:</p>

<p>"Who's there!"</p>

<p>Huck's scared voice answered in a low tone:</p>

<p>"Please let me in! It's only Huck Finn!"</p>

<p>"It's a name that can open this door night or day,
lad!&mdash;and welcome!"</p>

<p>These were strange words to the vagabond boy's ears, and the
pleasantest he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the
closing word had ever been applied in his case before. The door
was quickly unlocked, and he entered. Huck was given a seat and
the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed
themselves.</p>

<p>"Now, my boy, I hope you're good and hungry, because breakfast
will be ready as soon as the sun's up, and we'll have a piping
hot one, too&mdash; make yourself easy about that! I and the
boys hoped you'd turn up and stop here last night."</p>

<p>"I was awful scared," said Huck, "and I run. I took out when
the pistols went off, and I didn't stop for three mile. I've come
now becuz I wanted to know about it, you know; and I come before
daylight becuz I didn't want to run across them devils, even if
they was dead."</p>

<p>"Well, poor chap, you do look as if you'd had a hard night of
it&mdash;but there's a bed here for you when you've had your
breakfast. No, they ain't dead, lad&mdash;we are sorry enough for
that. You see we knew right where to put our hands on them, by
your description; so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within
fifteen feet of them&mdash;dark as a cellar that sumach path
was&mdash;and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the
meanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use&mdash;
'twas bound to come, and it did come! I was in the lead with my
pistol raised, and when the sneeze started those scoundrels
a-rustling to get out of the path, I sung out, 'Fire boys!' and
blazed away at the place where the rustling was. So did the boys.
But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and we after them,
down through the woods. I judge we never touched them. They fired
a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by and
didn't do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet
we quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables.
They got a posse together, and went off to guard the river bank,
and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to
beat up the woods. My boys will be with them presently. I wish we
had some sort of description of those rascals&mdash;'twould help
a good deal. But you couldn't see what they were like, in the
dark, lad, I suppose?"</p>


<br><br>
<a name="30-227"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="30-227.jpg (48K)" src="30-227.jpg" height="488" width="356">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 


<p>"Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them."</p>

<p>"Splendid! Describe them&mdash;describe them, my boy!"</p>

<p>"One's the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that's ben around here
once or twice, and t'other's a mean-looking, ragged&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the
woods back of the widow's one day, and they slunk away. Off with
you, boys, and tell the sheriff&mdash;get your breakfast
tomorrow morning!"</p>

<p>The Welshman's sons departed at once. As they were leaving the
room Huck sprang up and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't tell ANYbody it was me that blowed on them!
Oh, please!"</p>

<p>"All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the
credit of what you did."</p>

<p>"Oh no, no! Please don't tell!"</p>

<p>When the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:</p>

<p>"They won't tell&mdash;and I won't. But why don't you want it
known?"</p>

<p>Huck would not explain, further than to say that he already
knew too much about one of those men and would not have the man
know that he knew anything against him for the whole
world&mdash;he would be killed for knowing it, sure.</p>

<p>The old man promised secrecy once more, and said:</p>

<p>"How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they
looking suspicious?"</p>

<p>Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he
said:</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I'm a kind of a hard lot,&mdash;least
everybody says so, and I don't see nothing agin it&mdash;and
sometimes I can't sleep much, on account of thinking about it
and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing. That was the
way of it last night. I couldn't sleep, and so I come along
upstreet 'bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I got
to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I
backed up agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then
along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me, with
something under their arm, and I reckoned they'd stole it. One
was a-smoking, and t'other one wanted a light; so they stopped
right before me and the cigars lit up their faces and I see that
the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard, by his white whiskers
and the patch on his eye, and t'other one was a rusty,
ragged-looking devil."</p>

<p>"Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?"</p>

<p>This staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:</p>


<br><br>
<a name="30-229"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="30-229.jpg (55K)" src="30-229.jpg" height="508" width="344">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>"Well, I don't know&mdash;but somehow it seems as if I
did."</p>

<p>"Then they went on, and you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Follered 'em&mdash;yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was
up&mdash;they sneaked along so. I dogged 'em to the widder's
stile, and stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the
widder, and the Spaniard swear he'd spile her looks just as I
told you and your two&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What! The DEAF AND DUMB man said all that!"</p>

<p>Huck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best
to keep the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the
Spaniard might be, and yet his tongue seemed determined to get
him into trouble in spite of all he could do. He made several
efforts to creep out of his scrape, but the old man's eye was
upon him and he made blunder after blunder. Presently the
Welshman said:</p>

<p>"My boy, don't be afraid of me. I wouldn't hurt a hair of your
head for all the world. No&mdash;I'd protect you&mdash;I'd
protect you. This Spaniard is not deaf and dumb; you've let that
slip without intending it; you can't cover that up now. You know
something about that Spaniard that you want to keep dark. Now
trust me&mdash;tell me what it is, and trust me&mdash;I won't
betray you."</p>

<p>Huck looked into the old man's honest eyes a moment, then bent
over and whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>"'Tain't a Spaniard&mdash;it's Injun Joe!"</p>

<p>The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he
said:</p>

<p>"It's all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching
ears and slitting noses I judged that that was your own
embellishment, because white men don't take that sort of revenge.
But an Injun! That's a different matter altogether."</p>

<p>During breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the
old man said that the last thing which he and his sons had done,
before going to bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile
and its vicinity for marks of blood. They found none, but
captured a bulky bundle of&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of WHAT?"</p>

<p>If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped
with a more stunning suddenness from Huck's blanched lips. His
eyes were staring wide, now, and his breath
suspended&mdash;waiting for the answer. The Welshman
started&mdash;stared in return&mdash;three seconds&mdash;five
seconds&mdash; ten&mdash;then replied:</p>

<p>"Of burglar's tools. Why, what's the MATTER with you?"</p>

<p>Huck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably
grateful. The Welshman eyed him gravely, curiously&mdash;and
presently said:</p>

<p>"Yes, burglar's tools. That appears to relieve you a good
deal. But what did give you that turn? What were YOU expecting
we'd found?"</p>

<p>Huck was in a close place&mdash;the inquiring eye was upon
him&mdash;he would have given anything for material for a
plausible answer&mdash;nothing suggested itself&mdash;the
inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper&mdash;a senseless
reply offered&mdash;there was no time to weigh it, so at a
venture he uttered it&mdash;feebly:</p>

<p>"Sunday-school books, maybe."</p>

<p>Poor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed
loud and joyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head
to foot, and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in
a-man's pocket, because it cut down the doctor's bill like
everything. Then he added:</p>

<p>"Poor old chap, you're white and jaded&mdash;you ain't well a
bit&mdash;no wonder you're a little flighty and off your balance.
But you'll come out of it. Rest and sleep will fetch you out all
right, I hope."</p>

<p>Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and
betrayed such a suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the
idea that the parcel brought from the tavern was the treasure, as
soon as he had heard the talk at the widow's stile. He had only
thought it was not the treasure, however&mdash;he had not known
that it wasn't&mdash;and so the suggestion of a captured bundle
was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole he felt
glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all
question that that bundle was not THE bundle, and so his mind was
at rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed
to be drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure
must be still in No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that
day, and he and Tom could seize the gold that night without any
trouble or any fear of interruption.</p>

<p>Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door.
Huck jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be
connected even remotely with the late event. The Welshman
admitted several ladies and gentlemen, among them the Widow
Douglas, and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the
hill&mdash;to stare at the stile. So the news had spread. The
Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the visitors. The
widow's gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.</p>

<p>"Don't say a word about it, madam. There's another that you're
more beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he
don't allow me to tell his name. We wouldn't have been there but
for him."</p>

<p>Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost
belittled the main matter&mdash;but the Welshman allowed it to
eat into the vitals of his visitors, and through them be
transmitted to the whole town, for he refused to part with his
secret. When all else had been learned, the widow said:</p>

<p>"I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all
that noise. Why didn't you come and wake me?"</p>

<p>"We judged it warn't worth while. Those fellows warn't likely
to come again&mdash;they hadn't any tools left to work with, and
what was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death? My
three negro men stood guard at your house all the rest of the
night. They've just come back."</p>

<p>More visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold
for a couple of hours more.</p>

<p>There was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but
everybody was early at church. The stirring event was well
canvassed. News came that not a sign of the two villains had been
yet discovered. When the sermon was finished, Judge Thatcher's
wife dropped alongside of Mrs. Harper as she moved down the aisle
with the crowd and said:</p>

<p>"Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she
would be tired to death."</p>

<p>"Your Becky?"</p>

<p>"Yes," with a startled look&mdash;"didn't she stay with you
last night?"</p>

<br><br>
<a name="30-232"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="30-232.jpg (59K)" src="30-232.jpg" height="512" width="362">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>"Why, no."</p>

<p>Mrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt
Polly, talking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly
said:</p>

<p>"Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I've
got a boy that's turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at
your house last night&mdash;one of you. And now he's afraid to
come to church. I've got to settle with him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than
ever.</p>

<p>"He didn't stay with us," said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look
uneasy. A marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly's face.</p>

<p>"Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?"</p>

<p>"No'm."</p>

<p>"When did you see him last?"</p>

<p>Joe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The
people had stopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along,
and a boding uneasiness took possession of every countenance.
Children were anxiously questioned, and young teachers. They
all said they had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on board
the ferryboat on the homeward trip; it was dark; no one thought
of inquiring if any one was missing. One young man finally
blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave! Mrs.
Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her
hands.</p>

<p>The alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from
street to street, and within five minutes the bells were wildly
clanging and the whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank
into instant insignificance, the burglars were forgotten,
horses were saddled, skiffs were manned, the ferryboat ordered
out, and before the horror was half an hour old, two hundred men
were pouring down highroad and river toward the cave.</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many
women visited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort
them. They cried with them, too, and that was still better than
words. All the tedious night the town waited for news; but when
the morning dawned at last, all the word that came was, "Send
more candles&mdash;and send food." Mrs. Thatcher was almost
crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher sent messages of
hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed no real
cheer.</p>

<p>The old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with
candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found
Huck still in the bed that had been provided for him, and
delirious with fever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the
Widow Douglas came and took charge of the patient. She said she
would do her best by him, because, whether he was good, bad, or
indifferent, he was the Lord's, and nothing that was the Lord's
was a thing to be neglected. The Welshman said Huck had good
spots in him, and the widow said:</p>

<p>"You can depend on it. That's the Lord's mark. He don't leave
it off. He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that
comes from his hands."</p>

<p>Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle
into the village, but the strongest of the citizens continued
searching. All the news that could be gained was that
remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had never
been visited before; that every corner and crevice was going to
be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered through the
maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither and
thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent
their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In
one place, far from the section usually traversed by tourists,
the names "BECKY &amp; TOM" had been found traced upon the rocky
wall with candle-smoke, and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of
ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it.
She said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child;
and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious,
because this one parted latest from the living body before the
awful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a
far-away speck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout
would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing
aisle&mdash;and then a sickening disappointment always followed;
the children were not there; it was only a searcher's light.</p>

</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours
along, and the village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had
heart for anything. The accidental discovery, just made, that
the proprietor of the Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his
premises, scarcely fluttered the public pulse, tremendous as the
fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck feebly led up to the subject
of taverns, and finally asked&mdash;dimly dreading the
worst&mdash;if anything had been discovered at the Temperance
Tavern since he had been ill.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the widow.</p>

<p>Huck started up in bed, wildeyed:</p>

<p>"What? What was it?"</p>

<p>"Liquor!&mdash;and the place has been shut up. Lie down,
child&mdash;what a turn you did give me!"</p>

<p>"Only tell me just one thing&mdash;only just one&mdash;please!
Was it Tom Sawyer that found it?"</p>

<br><br>
<a name="30-235"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="30-235.jpg (58K)" src="30-235.jpg" height="513" width="349">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>The widow burst into tears. "Hush, hush, child, hush! I've
told you before, you must NOT talk. You are very, very sick!"</p>

<p>Then nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been
a great powwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone
forever&mdash;gone forever! But what could she be crying about?
Curious that she should cry.</p>

<p>These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind, and
under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said
to herself:</p>

<p>"There&mdash;he's asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity
but somebody could find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain't many left,
now, that's got hope enough, or strength enough, either, to go on
searching."</p>

<p>NOW to return to Tom and Becky's share in the picnic. They
tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company,
visiting the familiar wonders of the cave&mdash;wonders dubbed
with rather over-descriptive names, such as "The Drawing-Room,"
"The Cathedral," "Aladdin's Palace," and so on. Presently the
hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky engaged in it
with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome;
then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles
aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates, postoffice
addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been
frescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking,
they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave
whose walls were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under
an overhanging shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place
where a little stream of water, trickling over a ledge and
carrying a limestone sediment with it, had, in the slow-dragging
ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and
imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind it in
order to illuminate it for Becky's gratification. He found that
it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed
between narrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a
discoverer seized him.

<p>

Becky responded to his call, and they made
a smoke-mark for future guidance, and started upon their quest.
They wound this way and that, far down into the secret depths of
the cave, made another mark, and branched off in search of
novelties to tell the upper world about. In one place they found
a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a multitude of
shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a man's
leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and
presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened
into it. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose
basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it
was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by many
fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great
stalactites and stalagmites together, the result of the ceaseless
water-drip of centuries. Under the roof vast knots of bats had
packed themselves together, thousands in a bunch; the lights
disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds,
squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their
ways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky's
hand and hurried her into the first corridor that offered; and
none too soon, for a bat struck Becky's light out with its wing
while she was passing out of the cavern. The bats chased the
children a good distance; but the fugitives plunged into every
new passage that offered, and at last got rid of the perilous
things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly, which stretched
its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows. He
wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would be
best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time,
the deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the
spirits of the children. Becky said:</p>

<p>"Why, I didn't notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard
any of the others."</p>

<br><br><br><br> 

<p>"Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them&mdash;and I
don't know how far away north, or south, or east, or whichever it
is. We couldn't hear them here."</p>

<p>Becky grew apprehensive.</p>

<p>"I wonder how long we've been down here, Tom? We better start
back."</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon we better. P'raps we better."</p>

<p>"Can you find the way, Tom? It's all a mixed-up crookedness to
me."</p>

<p>"I reckon I could find it&mdash;but then the bats. If they put
our candles out it will be an awful fix. Let's try some other
way, so as not to go through there."</p>

<p>"Well. But I hope we won't get lost. It would be so awful!"
and the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful
possibilities.</p>

<p>They started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a
long way, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was
anything familiar about the look of it; but they were all
strange. Every time Tom made an examination, Becky would watch
his face for an encouraging sign, and he would say cheerily:</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right. This ain't the one, but we'll come to it
right away!"</p>

<p>But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and
presently began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer
random, in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted. He
still said it was "all right," but there was such a leaden dread
at his heart that the words had lost their ring and sounded just
as if he had said, "All is lost!" Becky clung to his side in an
anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears, but they
would come. At last she said:</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let's go back that way! We seem
to get worse and worse off all the time."</p>

<p>"Listen!" said he.</p>

<p>Profound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings
were conspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing
down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint
sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't do it again, Tom, it is too horrid," said
Becky.</p>

<p>"It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you
know," and he shouted again.</p>

<p>The "might" was even a chillier horror than the ghostly
laughter, it so confessed a perishing hope. The children stood
still and listened; but there was no result. Tom turned upon the
back track at once, and hurried his steps. It was but a little
while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed
another fearful fact to Becky&mdash;he could not find his way
back!</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom, you didn't make any marks!"</p>

<p>"Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we
might want to come back! No&mdash;I can't find the way. It's all
mixed up."</p>

<p>"Tom, Tom, we're lost! we're lost! We never can get out of
this awful place! Oh, why DID we ever leave the others!"</p>

<br><br>
<a name="31-240"></a>
<br><br>

<img alt="31-240.jpg (50K)" src="31-240.jpg" height="495" width="363">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying
that Tom was appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose
her reason. He sat down by her and put his arms around her; she
buried her face in his bosom, she clung to him, she poured out
her terrors, her unavailing regrets, and the far echoes turned
them all to jeering laughter. Tom begged her to pluck up hope
again, and she said she could not. He fell to blaming and abusing
himself for getting her into this miserable situation; this had a
better effect. She said she would try to hope again, she would
get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not
talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she,
she said.</p>

<p>So they moved on again&mdash;aimlessly&mdash;simply at
random&mdash;all they could do was to move, keep moving. For a
little while, hope made a show of reviving&mdash;not with any
reason to back it, but only because it is its nature to revive
when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and
familiarity with failure.</p>

<p>By-and-by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out. This
economy meant so much! Words were not needed. Becky understood,
and her hope died again. She knew that Tom had a whole candle and
three or four pieces in his pockets&mdash;yet he must
economize.</p>

<p>By-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children
tried to pay attention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting
down when time was grown to be so precious, moving, in some
direction, in any direction, was at least progress and might bear
fruit; but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its
pursuit.</p>

<p>At last Becky's frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She
sat down. Tom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the
friends there, and the comfortable beds and, above all, the
light! Becky cried, and Tom tried to think of some way of
comforting her, but all his encouragements were grown
thread-bare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore so
heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was
grateful. He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow
smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams; and
by-and-by a smile dawned and rested there. The peaceful face
reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit, and
his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories.
While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a breezy
little laugh&mdash;but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a
groan followed it.</p>

<p>"Oh, how COULD I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No!
No, I don't, Tom! Don't look so! I won't say it again."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've slept, Becky; you'll feel rested, now, and
we'll find the way out."</p>

<p>"We can try, Tom; but I've seen such a beautiful country in my
dream. I reckon we are going there."</p>

<p>"Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let's go on
trying."</p>

<p>They rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless.
They tried to estimate how long they had been in the cave, but
all they knew was that it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was
plain that this could not be, for their candles were not gone
yet. A long time after this&mdash;they could not tell how
long&mdash;Tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping
water&mdash;they must find a spring. They found one presently,
and Tom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired,
yet Becky said she thought she could go a little farther. She was
surprised to hear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They
sat down, and Tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of
them with some clay. Thought was soon busy; nothing was said for
some time. Then Becky broke the silence:</p>

<p>"Tom, I am so hungry!"</p>

<p>Tom took something out of his pocket.</p>

<br><br>
<a name="31-242"></a>
<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="31-242.jpg (57K)" src="31-242.jpg" height="496" width="354">
</center>
<br><br><br><br> 

<p>"Do you remember this?" said he.</p>

<p>Becky almost smiled.</p>

<p>"It's our wedding-cake, Tom."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it's all
we've got."</p>

<p>"I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way
grownup people do with wedding-cake&mdash;but it'll be
our&mdash;"</p>

<p>She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake
and Becky ate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his
moiety. There was abundance of cold water to finish the feast
with. By-and-by Becky suggested that they move on again. Tom was
silent a moment. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?"</p>

<p>Becky's face paled, but she thought she could.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there's water to
drink. That little piece is our last candle!"</p>

<p>Becky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could
to comfort her, but with little effect. At length Becky said:</p>

<p>"Tom!"</p>

<p>"Well, Becky?"</p>

<p>"They'll miss us and hunt for us!"</p>

<p>"Yes, they will! Certainly they will!"</p>

<p>"Maybe they're hunting for us now, Tom."</p>

<p>"Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are."</p>

<p>"When would they miss us, Tom?"</p>

<p>"When they get back to the boat, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Tom, it might be dark then&mdash;would they notice we hadn't
come?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon
as they got home."</p>

<p>A frightened look in Becky's face brought Tom to his senses
and he saw that he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone
home that night! The children became silent and thoughtful. In a
moment a new burst of grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing
in his mind had struck hers also&mdash;that the Sabbath morning
might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher discovered that Becky
was not at Mrs. Harper's.</p>

<p>The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and
watched it melt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of
wick stand alone at last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall,
climb the thin column of smoke, linger at its top a moment, and
then&mdash;the horror of utter darkness reigned!</p>

<p>How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow
consciousness that she was crying in Tom's arms, neither could
tell. All that they knew was, that after what seemed a mighty
stretch of time, both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep and
resumed their miseries once more. Tom said it might be Sunday,
now&mdash;maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but her
sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said
that they must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search
was going on. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He
tried it; but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so
hideously that he tried it no more.</p>

<p>The hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the
captives again. A portion of Tom's half of the cake was left;
they divided and ate it. But they seemed hungrier than before.
The poor morsel of food only whetted desire.</p>

<p>By-and-by Tom said:</p>

<p>"SH! Did you hear that?"</p>

<p>Both held their breath and listened. There was a sound like
the faintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and
leading Becky by the hand, started groping down the corridor in
its direction. Presently he listened again; again the sound was
heard, and apparently a little nearer.</p>

<p>"It's them!" said Tom; "they're coming! Come along,
Becky&mdash;we're all right now!"</p>

<p>The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed
was slow, however, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had
to be guarded against. They shortly came to one and had to stop.
It might be three feet deep, it might be a hundred&mdash;there
was no passing it at any rate. Tom got down on his breast and
reached as far down as he could. No bottom. They must stay there
and wait until the searchers came. They listened; evidently the
distant shoutings were growing more distant! a moment or two more
and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking misery of it! Tom
whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He talked
hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no
sounds came again.</p>

<p>The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary
time dragged on; they slept again, and awoke famished and
woe-stricken. Tom believed it must be Tuesday by this time.</p>

<p>Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at
hand. It would be better to explore some of these than bear the
weight of the heavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from
his pocket, tied it to a projection, and he and Becky started,
Tom in the lead, unwinding the line as he groped along. At the
end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a "jumping-off place."
Tom got down on his knees and felt below, and then as far around
the corner as he could reach with his hands conveniently; he made
an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right, and at
that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding a
candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious
shout, and instantly that hand was followed by the body it
belonged to&mdash;Injun Joe's! Tom was paralyzed; he could not
move. He was vastly gratified the next moment, to see the
"Spaniard" take to his heels and get himself out of sight. Tom
wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come over and
killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have
disguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned.
Tom's fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to
himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring
he would stay there, and nothing should tempt him to run the risk
of meeting Injun Joe again. He was careful to keep from Becky
what it was he had seen. He told her he had only shouted "for
luck."</p>

<br><br><br><br> 

<p>But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long
run. Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep
brought changes. The children awoke tortured with a raging
hunger. Tom believed that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or
even Friday or Saturday, now, and that the search had been given
over. He proposed to explore another passage. He felt willing to
risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But Becky was very weak.
She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be roused. She
said she would wait, now, where she was, and die&mdash;it would
not be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if
he chose; but she implored him to come back every little while
and speak to her; and she made him promise that when the awful
time came, he would stay by her and hold her hand until all was
over.</p>

<p>Tom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and
made a show of being confident of finding the searchers or an
escape from the cave; then he took the kite-line in his hand and
went groping down one of the passages on his hands and knees,
distressed with hunger and sick with bodings of coming doom.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
