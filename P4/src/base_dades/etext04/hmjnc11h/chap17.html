<br>
<p class="first">Having arranged the collections (amounting to
eighty loads) made during 1848, they were conveyed by coolies to
the foot of the hills, where carts were provided to carry them five
days&rsquo; journey to the Mahanuddy river, which flows into the
Ganges, whence they were transported by water to Calcutta.</p>

<p>On the 27th of February, I left Dorjiling to join Mr. Hodgson,
at Titalya on the plains. The weather was raw, cold, and
threatening: snow lay here and there at 7000 feet, and all
vegetation was very backward, and wore a wintry garb. The laurels,
maples, and deciduous-leaved oaks, hydrangea and cherry, were
leafless, but the abundance of chesnuts and evergreen oaks,
rhododendrons, <i>Aucuba, Linonia,</i> and other shrubs, kept the
forest well clothed. The oaks had borne a very unusual number of
acorns during</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 374">[ 374 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the last season, which were now falling, and
strewing the road in some places so abundantly, that it was hardly
safe to ride down hill.</p>

<p>The plains of Bengal were all but obscured by a dense haze,
partly owing to a peculiar state of the atmosphere that prevails in
the dry months, and partly to the fires raging in the Terai forest,
from which white wreaths of smoke ascended, stretching obliquely
for miles to the eastward, and filling the air with black particles
of grass-stems, carried 4000 feet aloft by the heated ascending
currents that impinge against the flanks of the mountains.</p>

<p>In the tropical region the air was scented with the white
blossoms of the <i>Vitex Agnus-castus,</i> which grew in profusion
by the road-side; but the forest, which had looked so gigantic on
my arrival at the mountains the previous year, appeared small after
the far more lofty and bulky oaks and pines of the upper regions of
the Himalaya.</p>

<p>The evening was sultry and close, the heated surface of the
earth seemed to load the surrounding atmosphere with warm vapours,
and the sensation, as compared with the cool pure air of Dorjiling,
was that of entering a confined tropical harbour after a long
sea-voyage.</p>

<p>I slept in the little bungalow of Punkabaree, and was wakened
next morning by sounds to which I had long been a stranger, the
voices of innumerable birds, and the humming of great bees that
bore large holes for their dwellings in the beams and rafters of
houses: never before had I been so forcibly struck with the absence
of animal life in the regions of the upper Himalaya.</p>

<p>Breakfasting early, I pursued my way in the so-called cool of
the morning, but this was neither bright nor fresh; the night
having been hazy, there had been no terrestrial radiation, and the
earth was dusty and parched; while the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 375">[ 375 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">sun rose through a murky yellowish atmosphere with
ill-defined orb. Thick clouds of smoke pressed upon the plains, and
the faint easterly wind wafted large flakes of grass charcoal
sluggishly through the air.</p>

<p>Vegetation was in great beauty, though past its winter prime.
The tropical forest of India has two flowering seasons; one in
summer, of the majority of plants; and the other in winter, of <i>
Acanthace&aelig;, Bauhinia, Dillenia, Bombax,</i> etc. Of these the
former are abundant, and render the jungle gay with large and
delicate white, red, and purple blossoms. Coarse, ill-favoured
vultures wheeled through the air, languid Bengalees had replaced
the active mountaineers, jackal-like curs of low degree teemed at
every village, and ran howling away from the onslaught of my
mountain dog; and the tropics, with all their beauty of flower and
genial warmth, looked as forbidding and unwholesome as they felt
oppressive to a frame that had so long breathed the fresh mountain
air.</p>

<p>Mounted on a stout pony, I enjoyed my scamper of sixteen miles
over the wooded plains and undulating gravelly slopes of the Terai,
intervening between the foot of the mountains and Siligoree
bungalow, where I rested for an hour. In the afternoon I rode on
leisurely to Titalya, sixteen miles further, along the banks of the
Mahanuddy, the atmosphere being so densely hazy, that objects a few
miles off were invisible, and the sun quite concealed, though its
light was so powerful that no part of the sky could be steadily
gazed upon. This state of the air is very curious, and has met with
various attempts at explanation,*</p>

<p class="fnote">* Dr. M&lsquo;Lelland (&ldquo;Calcutta Journal of
Natural History,&rdquo; vol. i, p. 52), attributes the haze of the
atmosphere during the north-west winds of this season, wholly to
suspended earthy particles. But the haze is present even in the
calmest weather, and extreme dryness is in all parts of the world
usually accompanied by an obscure horizon. Captain Campbell
(&ldquo;Calcutta Journal of Natural History,&rdquo; vol. ii, p.
44.) also objects to Dr. M&lsquo;Clelland&rsquo;s theory, citing
those parts of Southern India which are least likely to be visited
by dust-storms, as possessing an equally hazy atmosphere; and
further denies its being influenced by the hygrometric state of the
atmosphere.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 376">[ 376 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">all unsatisfactory to me: it accompanies great
heat, dryness, and elasticity of the suspended vapours, and is not
affected by wind. During the afternoon the latter blew with
violence, but being hot and dry, brought no relief to my still
unacclimated frame. My pony alone enjoyed the freedom of the
boundless plains, and the gallop or trot being fatiguing in the
heat, I tried in vain to keep him at a walk; his spirits did not
last long, however, for he flagged after a few days&rsquo; tropical
heat. My little dog had run thirty miles the day before, exclusive
of all the detours he had made for his own enjoyment, and he
flagged so much after twenty more this day, that I had to take him
on my saddle-bow, where, after licking his hot swollen feet, he
fell fast asleep, in spite of the motion.</p>

<p>After leaving the wooded Terai at Siligoree, trees became
scarce, and clumps of bamboos were the prevalent features; these,
with an occasional banyan, peepul, or betel-nut palm near the
villages, were the only breaks on the distant horizon. A powerfully
scented <i>Clerodendron,</i> and an <i>0sbeckia</i> gay with
blossoms like dog-roses, were abundant; the former especially under
trees, where the seeds are dropped by birds.</p>

<p>At Titalya bungalow, I received a hearty welcome from Mr.
Hodgson, and congratulations on the success of my Nepal journey,
which afforded a theme for many conversations.</p>

<p>In the evening we had three sharp jerking shocks of an
earthquake in quick succession, at 9.8 p.m., appearing to come up
from the southward: they were accompanied by a hollow rumbling
sound like that of a waggon passing over a wooden bridge. The shock
was felt strongly at Dorjiling, and registered by Mr. Muller at
9.10 p.m.: we had</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 377">[ 377 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">accurately adjusted our watches (chronometers) the
previous morning, and the motion may therefore fairly be assumed to
have been transmitted northwards through the intervening distance
of forty miles, in two minutes. Both Mr. Muller and Mr. Hodgson had
noted a much more severe shock at 6.10 p.m. the previous evening,
which I, who was walking down the mountain, did not experience;
this caused a good deal of damage at Dorjiling, in cracking
well-built walls. Earthquakes are frequent all along the Himalaya,
and are felt far in Tibet; they are, however, most common towards
the eastern and western extremities of India; owing in the former
case to the proximity of the volcanic forces in the bay of Bengal.
Cutch and Scinde, as is well known, have suffered severely on many
occasions, and in several of them the motion has been propagated
through Affghanistan and Little Tibet, to the heart of Central
Asia.*</p>

<p>On the morning of the 1st of March, Dr. Campbell arrived at the
bungalow, from his tour of inspection along the frontier of Bhotan
and the Rungpore district; and we accompanied him hence along the
British and Sikkim frontier, as far west as the Mechi river, which
bounds Nepal on the east.</p>

<p>Terai is a name loosely applied to a tract of country at the
very foot of the Himalaya: it is Persian, and signifies damp.
Politically, the Terai generally belongs to the hill-states beyond
it; geographically, it should appertain to the plains of India; and
geologically, it is a sort of neutral country, being composed
neither of the alluvium of the plains, nor of the rocks of the
hills, but for the most part of alternating beds of sand, gravel,
and boulders brought from the mountains. Botanically it is readily
defined as the region of forest-trees; amongst which the Sal, the
most valuable</p>

<p class="fnote">* See &ldquo;Wood&rsquo;s Travels to the
Oxus.&rdquo;</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 378">[ 378 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">of Indian timber, is conspicuous in most parts,
though not now in Sikkim, where it has been destroyed. The Terai
soil is generally light, dry, and gravelly (such as the Sal always
prefers), and varies in breadth, from ten miles, along the Sikkim
frontier, to thirty and more on the Nepalese. In the latter country
it is called the Morung, and supplies Sal and Sissoo timber for the
Calcutta market, the logs being floated down the Konki and Cosi
rivers to the Ganges. The gravel-beds extend uninterruptedly upon
the plains for fully twenty miles south of the Sikkim mountains,
the gravel becoming smaller as the distance increases, and large
blocks of stone not being found beyond a few miles from the rocks
of the Himalaya itself, even in the beds of rivers, however large
and rapid. Throughout its breadth this formation is conspicuously
cut into flat-topped terraces, flanking the spurs of the mountains,
at elevations varying from 250 to nearly 1000 feet above the sea.
These terraces are of various breadth and length, the smallest
lying uppermost, and the broadest flanking the rivers below. The
isolated hills beyond are also flat-topped and terraced. This
deposit contains no fossils; and its general appearance and mineral
constituents are the only evidence of its origin, which is no doubt
due to a retiring ocean that washed the base of the Sikkim
Himalaya, received the contents of its rivers, and, wearing away
its bluff spurs, spread a talus upwards of 1000 feet thick along
its shores. It is not at first sight evident whether the terracing
is due to periodic retirements of the ocean, or to the levelling
effects of rivers that have cut channels through the deposit. In
many places, especially along the banks of the great streams, the
gravel is smaller, obscurely interstratified with sand, and the
flattened pebbles over-lap rudely, in a manner characteristic of
the effects of running water; but such is</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 379">[ 379 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">not the case with the main body of the deposit,
which is unstratified, and much coarser.</p>

<p>The alluvium of the Gangetic valley is both interstratified with
the gravel, and passes into it, and was no doubt deposited in deep
water, whilst the coarser matter* was accumulating at the foot of
the mountains.</p>

<p>This view is self-evident, and has occurred, I believe, to
almost every observer, at whatever part of the base of the Himalaya
he may have studied this deposit. Its position, above the
sandstones of the Sewalik range in the north-west Himalaya, and
those of Sikkim, which appear to be modern fossiliferous rocks,
indicates its being geologically of recent formation; but it still
remains a subject of the utmost importance to discover the extent
and nature of the ocean to whose agency it is referred. I have
elsewhere remarked that the alluvium of the Gangetic valley may to
a great degree be the measure of the denudation which the Himalaya
has suffered along its Indian watershed. It was, no doubt, during
the gradual rise of that chain from the ocean, that the gravel and
alluvium were deposited; and in the terraces and alternation of
these, there is evidence that there have been many subsidences and
elevations of the coast-line, during which the gravel has suffered
greatly from denudation.</p>

<p>I have never looked at the Sikkim Himalaya from the plains
without comparing its bold spurs enclosing sinuous river gorges, to
the weather-beaten front of a mountainous coast; and in following
any of its great rivers, the scenery</p>

<p class="fnote">* This, too, is non-fossiliferous, and is of
unknown depth, except at Calcutta, where the sand and clay beds
have been bored through, to the depth of 120 feet, below which the
first pebbles were met with. Whence these pebbles were derived is a
curious problem. The great Himalayan rivers convey pebbles but a
very few miles from the mountains on to the plains of India; and
there is no rock <i>in situ</i> above the surface, within many
miles of Calcutta, in any direction.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 380">[ 380 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">of its deep valleys no less strikingly resembles
that of such narrow arms of the sea (or fiords) as characterize
every mountainous coast, of whatever geological formation: such as
the west coast of Scotland and Norway, of South Chili and Fuegia,
of New Zealand and Tasmania. There are too in these Himalayan
valleys, at all elevations below 600 feet, terraced pebble-beds,
rising in some cases eighty feet above the rivers, which I believe
could only have been deposited by them when they debouched into
deep water; and both these, and the beds of the rivers, are
strewed, down to 1000 feet, with masses of rock. Such accumulations
and transported blocks are seen on the raised beaches of our narrow
Scottish salt water lochs, exposed by the rising of the land, and
they are yet forming of immense thickness on many coasts by the
joint action of tides and streams.</p>

<p>I have described meeting with ancient moraines in every
Himalayan valley I ascended, at or about 7000 or 8000 feet
elevation, proving, that at one period, the glaciers descended
fully so much below the position they now occupy: this can only be
explained by a change of climate,* or by a depression of the
mountain mass equal to 8000 feet, since the formation of these
moraines.</p>

<p>The country about Titalya looks desert, from that want of trees
and cultivation, so characteristic of the upper level throughout
this part of the plains, which is covered with</p>

<p class="fnote">* Such a change of temperature, without any
depression or elevation of the mountains, has been thought by Capt.
R. Strachey (&ldquo;Journal of Geological Society&rdquo;), an able
Himalayan observer, to be the necessary consequence of an ocean at
the foot of these mountains; for the amount of perpetual snow, and
consequent descent of the glaciers, increasing indirectly in
proportion to the humidity of the climate, and the snow-fall, he
conjectured that the proximity of the ocean would prodigiously
increase such a deposition of snow.&mdash;To me, this argument
appears inconclusive; for the first effect of such a vast body of
water would be to raise the temperature of winter; and as it is the
rain, rather than the sun of summer, which removes the Sikkim snow,
so would an increase of this rain elevate, rather than depress, the
level of perpetual snow.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 381">[ 381 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">short, poor pasture-grass. The bungalow stands
close to the Mahanuddy, on a low hill, cut into an escarpment
twenty feet high, which exposes a section of river-laid sand and
gravel, alternating with thick beds of rounded pebbles.</p>

<p>Shortly after Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s arrival, the meadows about
the bungalow presented a singular appearance, being dotted over
with elephants, brought for purchase by Government. It was curious
to watch the arrival of these enormous animals, which were visible
nearly two miles across the flat plains; nor less interesting was
it to observe the wonderful docility of these giants of the animal
kingdom, often only guided by naked boys, perched on their necks,
scolding, swearing, and enforcing their orders with the iron goad.
There appeared as many tricks in elephant-dealers as in
horse-jockeys, and of many animals brought, but few were purchased.
Government limits the price to about 75 pounds, and the height to
the shoulder must not be under seven feet, which, incredible as it
appears, may be estimated within a fraction as being three times
the circumference of the forefoot. The pedigree is closely inquired
into, the hoofs are examined for cracks, the teeth for age, and
many other points attended to.</p>

<p>The Sikkim frontier, from the Mahanuddy westward to the Mechi,
is marked out by a row of tall posts. The country is undulating;
and though fully 400 miles from the ocean, and not sixty from the
top of the loftiest mountain on the globe, its average level is not
300 feet above that of the sea. The upper levels are gravelly, and
loosely covered with scattered thorny jujube bushes, occasionally
tenanted by the <i>Florican,</i> which scours these downs like a
bustard. Sometimes a solitary fig, or a thorny acacia, breaks the
horizon, and there are a few gnarled trees of the scarlet <i>Butea
frondosa.</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 382">[ 382 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On our route I had a good opportunity of examining the line of
junction between the alluvial plains that stretch south to the
Ganges, and the gravel deposit flanking the hills. The rivers
always cut broad channels with scarped terraced sides, and their
low banks are very fertile, from the mud annually spread by the
ever-shifting streams that meander within their limits; there are,
however, few shrubs and no trees. The houses, which are very few
and scattered, are built on the gravelly soil above, the lower
level being very malarious.</p>

<p>Thirty miles south of the mountains, numerous isolated
flat-topped hills, formed of stratified gravel and sand with large
water-worn pebbles, rise from 80 to 200 feet above the mean level,
which is about 250 feet above the sea; these, too, have always
scarped sides, and the channels of small streams completely
encircle them.</p>

<p>At this season few insects but grasshoppers are to be seen, even
mosquitos being rare. Birds, however, abound, and we noticed the
common sparrow, hoopoe, water-wagtail, skylark, osprey, and several
egrets.</p>

<p>We arrived on the third day at the Mechi river, to the west of
which the Nepal Terai (or Morung) begins, whose belt of Sal forest
loomed on the horizon, so raised by refraction as to be visible as
a dark line, from the distance of many miles. It is, however, very
poor, all the large trees having been removed. We rode for several
miles into it, and found the soil dry and hard, but supporting a
prodigious undergrowth of gigantic harsh grasses that reached to
our heads, though we were mounted on elephants. Besides Sal there
was abundance of <i>Butea, Diospyros, Terminalia,</i> and <i>
Symplocos,</i> with the dwarf <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i> palm, and
occasionally <i>Cycas.</i> Tigers, wild elephants, and the
rhinoceros, are said to be found here; but we saw none.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 383">[ 383 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The old and new Mechi rivers are several miles apart, but flow
in the same depression, a low swamp many miles broad, which is
grazed at this season, and cultivated during the rains. The grass
is very rich, partly owing to the moisture of the climate, and
partly to the retiring waters of the rivers; both circumstances
being the effects of proximity to the Himalaya. Hence cattle
(buffalos and the common humped cow of India) are driven from the
banks of the Ganges 300 miles to these feeding grounds, for the use
of which a trifling tax is levied on each animal. The cattle are
very carelessly herded, and many are carried off by tigers.</p>

<p>Having returned to Titalya, Mr. Hodgson and I set off in an
eastern direction for the Teesta river, whose embouchure from the
mountains to the plains I was anxious to visit. Though the weather
is hot, and oppressively so in the middle of the day, there are few
climates more delicious than that of these grassy savannahs from
December to March. We always started soon after daybreak on ponies,
and enjoyed a twelve to sixteen miles&rsquo; gallop in the cool of
the morning before breakfast, which we found prepared on our
arrival at a tent sent on ahead the night before. The road led
across an open country, or followed paths through interminable
rice-fields, now dry and dusty. On poor soil a white-flowered <i>
Leucas</i> monopolized the space, like our charlock and poppy: it
was apparently a pest to the agriculturist, covering the surface in
some places like a sprinkling of snow. Sometimes the river-beds
exposed fourteen feet of pure stratified sand, with only an inch of
vegetable soil above. At this season the mornings are very hazy,
with the thermometer at sunrise 60&deg;; one laid on grass during
the night falling 7&deg; below that temperature: dew forms,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 384">[ 384 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">but never copiously: by 10 a.m. the temperature
has risen to 75&deg;, and the faint easterly morning breezes die
away; the haze thickens, and covers the sky with a white veil, the
thermometer rising to 82&deg; at noon, and the west wind succeeding
in parching tornados and furious gusts, increasing with the
temperature, which attains its maximum in the afternoon, and
falling again with its decline at sunset. The evenings are calm;
but the earth is so heated, that the thermometer stands at 10 p.m.
at 66&deg;, and the minimum at night is not below 55&deg;: great
drought accompanies the heat at this season, but not to such a
degree as in North-west India, or other parts of this meridian
further removed from the hills. In the month of March, and during
the prevalence of west winds, the mean temperature was 79&deg;, and
the dew-point 22&deg; lower, indicating great drought. The
temperature at Calcutta was 7&deg; warmer, and the atmosphere very
much damper.</p>

<p>On the second day we arrived at Jeelpigoree, a large straggling
village near the banks of the Teesta, a good way south of the
forest: here we were detained for several days, waiting for
elephants with which to proceed northwards. The natives are
Cooches, a Mogul (Mongolian) race, who inhabit the open country of
this district, replacing the Mechis of the Terai forest. They are a
fine athletic people, not very dark, and formed the once-powerful
house of Cooch Behar. Latterly the upper classes have adopted the
religion of the Brahmins, and have had caste conferred upon them;
while the lower orders have turned Mahomedans: these, chiefly
agriculturists, are a timid, oppressed class, who everywhere fled
before us, and were with difficulty prevailed upon even to direct
us along our road. A rude police is established by the British
Government all over the country, and to it the traveller
applies</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 385">[ 385 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">for guides and assistance; but the Conches were so
shy and difficult to deal with, that we were generally left to our
own resources.</p>

<p>Grass is the prevailing feature of the country, as there are few
shrubs, and still fewer trees. Goats and the common Indian cow are
plentiful; but it is not swampy enough for the buffalo; and sheep
are scarce, on account of the heat of the climate. This uniformity
of feature over so immense an area is, however, due to the agency
of man, and is of recent introduction; as all concur in affirming,
that within the last hundred years the face of the country was
covered with the same long jungle-grasses which abound in the Terai
forest; and the troops cantoned at Titalya (a central position in
these plains) from 1816 to 1828, confirm this statement as far as
their immediate neighbourhood is concerned.</p>

<p>These gigantic <i>Gramine&aelig;</i> seem to be destroyed by
fire with remarkable facility at one season of the year; and it is
well that this is the case; for, whether as a retainer of miasma, a
shelter for wild beasts, both carnivorous and herbivorous, alike
dangerous to man, or from their liability to ignite, and spread
destruction far and wide, the grass-jungles are most serious
obstacles to civilization. Next to the rapidity with which it can
be cleared, the adaptation of a great part of the soil to
irrigation during the rains, has greatly aided the bringing of it
under cultivation.</p>

<p>By far the greater proportion of this universal short turf grass
is formed of <i>Andropogon acicularis, Cynodon Dactylon,</i>* and
in sandy places, <i>Imperata cylindrica</i>;</p>

<p class="fnote">* Called &ldquo;Dhob.&rdquo; This is the best
pasture grass in the plains of India, and the only one to be found
over many thousands of square miles.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 386">[ 386 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">where the soil is wetter, <i>Ameletia Indica</i>
is abundant, giving a heather-like colour to the turf, with its
pale purple flowers: wherever there is standing water, its surface
is reddened by the <i>Azolla,</i> and <i>Salvinia</i> is also
common.</p>

<p>At Jeelpigoree we were waited upon by the Dewan, who governs the
district for the Rajah, a boy about ten years old, whose estates
are locked up during the trial of an interminable suit for the
succession, that has been instituted against him by a natural son
of the late Rajah: we found the Dewan to be a man of intelligence,
who promised us elephants as soon as the great Hooli festival, now
commenced, should be over.</p>

<p>The large village, at the time of our visit, was gay with
holiday dresses. It is surrounded by trees, chiefly of banyan,
jack, mango, peepul, and tamarind: interminable rice-fields extend
on all sides, and except bananas, slender betel-nut palms, and
sometimes pawn, or betel-pepper, there is little other extensive
cultivation. The rose-apple, orange, and pine-apple are rare, as
are cocoa-nuts: there are few date or fan-palms, and only
occasionally poor crops of castor-oil and sugar-cane. In the
gardens I noticed jasmine, <i>Justicia Adhatoda, Hibiscus,</i> and
others of the very commonest Indian ornamental plants; while for
food were cultivated <i>Chenopodium,</i> yams, sweet potatos, and
more rarely peas, beans, and gourds. Bamboos were planted round the
little properties and smaller clusters of houses, in oblong
squares, the ridge on which the plants grew being usually bounded
by a shallow ditch. The species selected was not the most graceful
of its family; the stems, or culms, being densely crowded, erect,
as thick at the base as the arm, copiously branching, and very
feathery throughout their whole length of sixty feet.</p>

<p>A gay-flowered <i>0sbeckia</i> was common along the
roadsides,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 387">[ 387 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and, with a <i>Clerodendron,</i>* whose strong,
sweet odour was borne far through the air, formed a low undershrub
beneath every tree, generally intermixed with three ferns (a <i>
Polypodium, Pteris,</i> and <i>Goniopteris</i>).</p>

<p>The cottages are remarkable, and have a very neat appearance,
presenting nothing but a low white-washed platform of clay, and an
enormous high, narrow, black, neatly thatched roof, so arched along
the ridge, that its eaves nearly touch the ground at each gable;
and looking at a distance like a gigantic round-backed elephant.
The walls are of neatly-platted bamboo: each window (of which there
are two) is crossed by slips of bamboo, and wants only glass to
make it look European; they have besides shutters of wattle, that
open upwards, projecting during the day like the port-hatches of a
ship, and let down at night. Within, the rooms are airy and clean:
one end contains the machans (bedsteads), the others some raised
clay benches, the fire, frequently an enormous Hookah, round
wattled stools, and various implements. The inhabitants appeared
more than ordinarily well-dressed; the men in loose flowing robes
of fine cotton or muslin, the women in the usual garb of a simple
thick cotton cloth, drawn tight immediately above the breast, and
thence falling perpendicularly to the knee; the colour of this is a
bright blue in stripes, bordered above and below with red.</p>

<p>I anticipated some novelty from a visit to a Durbar (court) so
distant from European influence as that of the Rajah of
Jeelpigoree. All Eastern courts, subject to the Company, are,
however, now shorn of much of their glory;</p>

<p class="fnote">* <i>Clerodendron</i> leaves, bruised, are used to
kill vermin, fly-blows, etc., in cattle; and the twigs form
toothpicks. The flowers are presented to Mahadeo, as a god of
peace; milk, honey, flowers, fruit, amrit (ambrosia), etc., being
offered to the pacific gods, as Vishnu, Krishna, etc.; while Mudar
(<i>Asclepias</i>), Bhang (<i>Cannabis sativa</i>), <i>Datura,</i>
flesh, blood, and spirituous liquors, are offered to Siva, Doorga,
Kali, and other demoniacal deities.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 388">[ 388 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and the condition of the upper classes is greatly
changed. Under the Mogul rule, the country was farmed out to
Zemindars, some of whom assumed the title of Rajah: they collected
the revenue for the Sovereign, retaining by law ten per cent. on
all that was realized: there was no intermediate class, the peasant
paying directly to the Zemindar, and he into the royal treasury.
Latterly the Zemindars have become farmers under the
Company&rsquo;s rule; and in the adjudication of their claims, Lord
Cornwallis (then Governor-General) made great sacrifices in their
favour, levying only a small tribute in proportion to their often
great revenues, in the hope that they would be induced to devote
their energies, and some of their means, to the improvement of the
condition of the peasantry. This expectation was not realized: the
younger Zemindars especially, subject to no restraint (except from
aggressions on their neighbours), fell into slothful habits, and
the collecting of the revenue became a trading speculation,
entrusted to &ldquo;middle men.&rdquo; The Zemindar selects a
number, who again are at liberty to collect through the medium of
several sub-renting classes. Hence the peasant suffers, and except
a generally futile appeal to the Rajah, he has no redress. The law
secures him tenure as long as he can pay his rent, and to do this
he has recourse to the usurer; borrowing in spring (at 50, and
oftener 100 per cent.) the seed, plough, and bullocks: he reaps in
autumn, and what is then not required for his own use, is sold to
pay off part of his original debt, the rest standing over till the
next season; and thus it continues to accumulate, till, overwhelmed
with difficulties, he is ejected, or flees to a neighbouring
district. The Zemindar enjoys the same right of tenure as the
peasant: the amount of impost laid on his property</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 389">[ 389 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">was fixed for perpetuity; whatever his revenue be,
he must pay so much to the Company, or he forfeits his estates, and
they are put up for auction.</p>

<p>One evening we visited the young Rajah at his residence, which
has rather a good appearance at a distance, its white walls
gleaming through a dark tope of mango, betel, and cocoa-nut. A
short rude avenue leads to the entrance gate, under the trees of
which a large bazaar was being held; stocked with cloths, simple
utensils, ornaments, sweetmeats, five species of fish from the
Teesta, and the betel-nut.</p>

<p>We entered through a guard-house, where were some of the
Rajah&rsquo;s Sepoys in the European costume, and a few of the
Company&rsquo;s troops, lent to the Rajah as a security against
some of the turbulent pretenders to his title. Within was a large
court-yard, flanked by a range of buildings, some of good
stone-work, some of wattle, in all stages of disrepair. A great
crowd of people occupied one end of the court, and at the other we
were received by the Dewan, and seated on chairs under a canopy
supported by slender silvered columns. Some slovenly Natch-girls
were dancing before us, kicking up clouds of dust, and singing or
rather bawling through their noses, the usual indelicate hymns in
honour of the Hooli festival; there were also fiddlers, cutting
uncouth capers in rhythm with the dancers. Anything more deplorable
than the music, dancing, and accompaniments, cannot well be
imagined; yet the people seemed vastly pleased, and extolled the
performers.</p>

<p>The arrival of the Rajah and his brothers was announced by a
crash of tom-toms and trumpets, while over their heads were carried
great gilt canopies. With them came a troop of relations, of all
ages; and amongst them a poor little black girl, dressed in honour
of us in an old-fashioned</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 390">[ 390 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">English chintz frock and muslin cap, in which she
cut the drollest figure imaginable; she was carried about for our
admiration, like a huge Dutch doll, crying lustily all the
time.</p>

<p>The festivities of the evening commenced by handing round trays
full of pith-balls, the size of a nutmeg, filled with a mixture of
flour, sand, and red lac-powder; with these each pelted his
neighbour, the thin covering bursting as it struck any object, and
powdering it copiously with red dust. A more childish and
disagreeable sport cannot well be conceived; and when the balls
were expended, the dust itself was resorted to, not only fresh, but
that which had already been used was gathered up, with whatever
dirt it might have become mixed. One rude fellow, with his hand
full, sought to entrap his victims into talking, when he would
stuff the nasty mixture into their mouths.</p>

<p>At the end attar of roses was brought, into which little pieces
of cotton, fixed on slips of bamboo, were dipped, and given to each
person. The heat, dust, stench of the unwashed multitude, noise,
and increasing familiarity of the lower orders, warned us to
retire, and we effected our retreat with precipitancy.</p>

<p>The Rajah and his brother were very fine boys, lively, frank,
unaffected, and well disposed: they have evidently a good guide in
the old Dewan; but it is melancholy to think how surely, should
they grow up in possession of their present rank, they will lapse
into slothful habits, and take their place amongst the imbeciles
who now represent the once powerful Rajahs of Bengal.</p>

<p>We rode back to our tents by a bright moonlight, very dusty and
tired, and heartily glad to breathe the cool fresh air, after the
stifling ordeal we had undergone.</p>

<p>On the following evening the elephants were again in waiting to
conduct us to the Rajah. He and his relations</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 391">[ 391 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">were assembled outside the gates, mounted upon
elephants, amid a vast concourse of people. The children and Dewan
were seated in a sort of cradle; the rest were some in howdahs, and
some astride on elephants&rsquo; backs, six or eight together. All
the idols were paraded before them, and powdered with red dust; the
people howling, shouting, and sometimes quarrelling. Our elephants
took their places amongst those of the Rajah; and when the mob had
sufficiently pelted one another with balls and dirty red powder, a
torchlight procession was formed, the idols leading the way, to a
very large tank, bounded by a high rampart, within which was a
broad esplanade round the water.</p>

<p>The effect of the whole was very striking, the glittering cars
and barbaric gaud of the idols showing best by torchlight; while
the white robes and turbans of the undulating sea of people, and
the great black elephants picking their way with matchless care and
consideration, contrasted strongly with the quiet moonbeams
sleeping on the still broad waters of the tank.</p>

<p>Thence the procession moved to a field, where the idols were
placed on the ground, and all dismounted: the Dewan then took the
children by the hand, and each worshipped his tutelary deity in a
short prayer dictated by the attendant Brahmin, and threw a handful
of red dust in its face. After another ordeal of powder, singing,
dancing, and suffocation, our share in the Hooli ended; and having
been promised elephants for the following morning, we bade a
cordial farewell to our engaging little hosts and their staid old
governor.</p>

<p>On the 10th of March we were awakened at an early hour by a
heavy thunder-storm from the south-west. The sunrise was very fine,
through an arch 10&deg; high of bright blue sky, above which the
whole firmament was mottled with cirrus. It continued cloudy, with
light winds,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 392">[ 392 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">throughout the day, but clear on the horizon. From
this tinge such storms became frequent, ushering in the equinox;
and the less hazy sky and rising hygrometer predicted an accession
of moisture in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>We left for Rangamally, a village eight miles distant in a
northerly direction, our course lying along the west bank of the
Teesta.</p>

<p>The river is here navigated by canoes, thirty to forty feet
long, some being rudely cut out of a solid log of Sal, while others
are built, the planks, of which there are but few, being sewed
together, or clamped with iron, and the seams caulked with the
fibres of the root of Dhak (<i>Butea frondosa</i>), and afterwards
smeared with the gluten of <i>Diospyros embryopteris.</i> The bed
of the river is here threequarters of a mile across, of which the
stream does not occupy one-third; its banks are sand-cliffs,
fourteen feet in height. A few small fish and water-snakes swarm in
the pools.</p>

<p>The whole country improved in fertility as we advanced towards
the mountains: the grass became greener, and more trees, shrubs,
herbs, and birds appeared. In front, the dark boundary-line of the
Sal forest loomed on the horizon, and to the east rose the low
hills of Bhotan, both backed by the outer ranges of the
Himalaya.</p>

<p>Flocks of cranes were abundant over-head, flying in wedges, or
breaking up into &ldquo;open order,&rdquo; preparing for their
migration northwards, which takes place in April, their return
occurring in October; a small quail was also common on the ground.
Tamarisk (&ldquo;Jhow&rdquo;) grew in the sandy bed of the river;
its flexible young branches are used in various parts of India for
wattling and basket-making.</p>

<p>In the evening we walked to the skirts of the Sal forest.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 393">[ 393 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">The great trunks of the trees were often scored by
tigers&rsquo; claws, this animal indulging in the cat-like
propensity of rising and stretching itself against such objects.
Two species of <i>Dillenia</i> were common in the forest, with long
grass, <i>Symplocos, Emblica,</i> and <i>Cassia Fistula,</i> now
covered with long pods. Several parasitical air-plants grew on the
dry trees, as <i>Oberonia, Vanda,</i> and <i>&AElig;rides.</i></p>

<p>At Rangamally, the height of the sandy banks of the Teesta
varies from fifteen to twenty feet. The bed is a mile across, and
all sand;* the current much divided, and opaque green, from the
glacial origin of most of its head-streams. The west bank was
covered with a small Sal forest, mixed with <i>Acacia Catechu,</i>
and brushwood, growing in a poor vegetable loam, over very dry
sand.</p>

<p>The opposite (or Bhotan) bank is much lower, and always flooded
during the rains, which is not the case on the western side, where
the water rises to ten feet below the top of the bank, or from
seven to ten feet above its height in the dry season, and it then
fills its whole bed. This information we had from a police Jemadar,
who has resided many years on this unhealthy spot, and annually
suffers from fever. The Sal forest has been encroached upon from
the south, for many miles, within the memory of man, by clearing in
patches, and by indiscriminate felling.</p>

<p>About ten miles north of Rangamally, we came to an extensive
flat, occupying a recess in the high west bank, the site of the old
capital (Bai-kant-pore) of the Jeelpigoree Rajah. Hemmed in as it
is on three sides by a dense forest, and on all by many miles of
malarious Terai, it appears sufficiently secure from ordinary
enemies, during a great part of the year. The soil is sandy,
overlying gravel,</p>

<p class="fnote">* Now covered with <i>Anthistiria</i> grass,
fifteen feet high, a little <i>Sissoo,</i> and <i>Bombax.</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 394">[ 394 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and covered with a thick stratum of fine mud or
silt, which is only deposited on these low flats; on it grew many
naturalized plants, as hemp, tobacco, jack, mango, plantain, and
orange.</p>

<p>About eight miles on, we left the river-bed, and struck westerly
through a dense forest, to a swampy clearance occupied by the
village of Rummai, which appeared thoroughly malarious; and we
pitched the tent on a narrow, low ridge, above the level of the
plain.</p>

<p>It was now cool and pleasant, partly due, no doubt, to a
difference in the vegetation, and the proximity of swamp and
forest, and partly also to a change in the weather, which was
cloudy and threatening; much rain, too, had fallen here on the
preceding day.</p>

<p>Brahmins and priests of all kinds are few in this miserable
country: near the villages, and under the large trees, are, every
here and there, a few immature thatched cottages, four to six feet
high, in which the tutelary deities of the place are kept; they are
idols of the very rudest description, of Vishnu as an ascetic
(Bai-kant Nath), a wooden doll, gilt and painted, standing, with
the hands raised as if in exhortation, and one leg crossed over the
other. Again, Kartik, the god of war, is represented sitting
astride on a peacock, with the right hand elevated and holding a
small flat cup.</p>

<p>Some fine muscular Cooches were here brought for Mr.
Hodgson&rsquo;s examination, but we found them unable or unwilling
to converse, in the Cooch tongue, which appears to be fast giving
place to Bengalee.</p>

<p>We walked to a stream, which flows at the base of the retiring
sand-cliffs, and nourishes a dense and richly-varied jungle,
producing many plants, as beautiful <i>Acanthace&aelig;,</i> Indian
horse-chesnut, loaded with white racemes of flowers,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 395">[ 395 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">gay <i>Convolvuli,</i> laurels, terrestrial and
parasitic <i>Orchide&aelig;, Dillenia,</i> casting its enormous
flowers as big as two fists, pepper, figs, and, in strange
association with these, a hawthorn, and the yellow-flowered Indian
strawberry, which ascends 7,500 feet on the mountains, and <i>
Hodgsonia,</i> a new <i>Cucurbitaceous</i> genus, clinging in
profusion to the trees, and also found 5000 feet high on the
mountains.</p>

<p>In the evening we rode into the forest (which was dry and very
unproductive), and thence along the river-banks, through <i>Acacia
Catechu,</i> belted by <i>Sissoo,</i> which often fringes the
stream, always occupying the lowest flats. The foliage at this
season is brilliantly green; and as the evening advanced, a yellow
convolvulus burst into flower like magic, adorning the bushes over
which it climbed.</p>

<p>It rained on the following morning; after which we left for the
exit of the Teesta, proceeding northwards, sometimes through a
dense forest of Sal timber, sometimes dipping into marshy
depressions, or riding through grassy savannahs, breast-high. The
coolness of the atmosphere was delicious, and the beauty of the
jungle seemed to increase the further we penetrated these
prim&aelig;val forests.</p>

<p>Eight miles from Rummai we came on a small river from the
mountains, with a Cooch village close by, inhabited during the dry
season by timber-cutters from Jeelpigoree it is situated upon a
very rich black soil, covered with <i>Saccharum</i> and various
gigantic grasses, but no bamboo. These long grasses replace the
Sal, of which we did not see one good tree.</p>

<p>We here mounted the elephants, and proceeded several miles
through the prairie, till we again struck upon the high Sal
forest-bank, continuous with that of Rummai and Rangamally, but
much loftier: it formed one of many terraces which stretch along
the foot of the hills, from</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 396">[ 396 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Punkabaree to the Teesta, but of which none are
said to occur for eight miles eastwards along the Bhotan Dooars: if
true, this is probably due in part to the alteration of the course
of the Teesta, which is gradually working to the westward, and
cutting away these lofty banks.</p>

<p>The elephant-drivers appeared to have taken us by mistake to the
exit of the Chawa, a small stream which joins the Teesta further to
the eastward. The descent to the bed of this rivulet, round the
first spur of rock we met with, was fully eighty feet, through a
very irregular depression, probably the old bed of the stream; it
runs southwards from the hills, and was covered from top to bottom
with slate-pebbles. We followed the river to its junction with the
Teesta, along a flat, broad gulley, bounded by densely-wooded,
steep banks of clay slate on the north, and the lofty bank on the
south: between these the bed was strewed with great boulders of
gneiss and other rocks, luxuriantly clothed with long grass, and
trees of wild plantain, <i>Erythrina</i> and <i>Bauhinia,</i> the
latter gorgeously in flower.</p>

<p>The Sal bank formed a very fine object: it was quite
perpendicular, and beautifully stratified with various coloured
sands and gravel: it tailed off abruptly at the junction of the
rivers, and then trended away south-west, forming the west bank of
the Teesta. The latter river is at its outlet a broad and rapid,
but hardly impetuous stream, now fifty yards across, gushing from
between two low, forest-clad spurs: it appeared about five feet
deep, and was beautifully fringed on both sides with green <i>
Sisso.</i></p>

<p>Some canoes were here waiting for us, formed of hollowed trunks
of trees, thirty feet long: two were lashed together with bamboos,
and the boatmen sat one at the head and one at the stern of each:
we lay along the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 397">[ 397 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">bottom of the vessels, and in a second we were
darting down the river, at the rate of at least ten or fifteen
miles an hour, the bright waters leaping up on all sides, and
bounding in <i>jets-d&rsquo;eau</i> between prows and sterns of the
coupled vessels. Sometimes we glided along without perceptible
motion, and at others jolted down bubbling rapids, the steersmen
straining every nerve to keep their bark&rsquo;s head to the
current, as she impatiently swerved from side to side in the
eddies. To our jaded and parched frames, after the hot
forenoon&rsquo;s ride on the elephants, the effect was delicious:
the fresh breeze blew on our heated foreheads and down our open
throats and chests; we dipped our hands into the clear, cool
stream, and there was &ldquo;music in the waters&rdquo; to our
ears. Fresh verdure on the banks, clear pebbles, soft sand, long
English river-reaches, forest glades, and deep jungles, followed in
rapid succession; and as often as we rounded a bend or shot a
rapid, the scene changed from bright to brighter still; so
continuing until dusk, when we were slowly paddling along the then
torpid current opposite Rangamally.*</p>

<p>The absence of large stones or boulders of rock in the bed of
the Teesta is very remarkable, considering the great volume and
rapidity of the current, and that it shoots directly from the rocky
hills to the gravelly plains. At the</p>

Teesta were taken at intervals during our passage from its exit to
Rangamally, a distance of fifteen linear miles, and thirty miles
following the bends:&mdash;</p>

<p class="first"><i>embouchure</i> there are boulders as big as the
head, and in the stream, four miles below the exit, the boatmen
pointed out a stone as large as the body as quite a marvel.</p>

<p>They assured us that the average rise at the mouth of the river,
in the rains, was not more than five feet: the mean breadth of the
stream is from seventy to ninety yards. From the point where it
leaves the mountains, to its junction with the Megna, is at this
season thirteen days&rsquo; voyage, the return occupying from
twenty to twenty-five days, with the boats unladen. The name
&ldquo;Teesta&rdquo; signifies &ldquo;quiet,&rdquo; this river
being so in comparison with other Himalayan torrents further west,
the Cosi, Konki, etc., which are devastators of all that bounds
their course.</p>

<p>We passed but two crossing-places: at one the river is divided
by an island, covered with the rude chaits and flags of the
Boodhists. We also saw some Cooch fishermen, who throw the net much
as we do: a fine &ldquo;Mahaser&rdquo; (a very large carp) was the
best fish they had. Of cultivation there was very little, and the
only habitations were a few grass-huts of the boatmen or buffalo
herdsmen, a rare Cooch village of Catechu and Sal cutters, or the
shelter of timber-floaters, who seem to pass the night in nests of
long dry grass.</p>

<p>Our servants not having returned with the elephants from Rummai,
we spent the following day at Rangamally shooting and botanizing. I
collected about 100 species in a couple of hours, and observed
perhaps twice that number: the more common I have repeatedly
alluded to, and excepting some small terrestrial <i>Orchids,</i> I
added nothing of particular interest to my collection.*</p>

<p class="fnote">* The following is a list of the principal genera,
most of which are English:&mdash;<i>Polygonum, Quercus, Sonchus,
Gnaphalium, Cratagus, Lobelia, Lactuca, Hydrocotyle, Saponaria,

<p class="first">On the 14th of March we proceeded west to
Siligoree, along the skirts of the ragged Sal forest. Birds are
certainly the most conspicuous branch of the natural history of
this country, and we saw many species, interesting either from
their habits, beauty, or extensive distribution. We noticed no less
than sixteen kinds of swimming birds, several of which are
migratory and English. The Shoveller, white-eyed and common wild
ducks; Merganser, Brahminee, and Indian goose (<i>Anser
Indica</i>); common and Gargany teal; two kinds of gull; one of
Shearwater (<i>Rhynchops ablacus</i>); three of tern, and one of
cormorant. Besides these there were three egrets, the large crane,
stork, green heron, and the demoiselle; the English sand-martin,
kingfisher, peregrine-falcon, sparrow-hawk, kestrel, and the
European vulture: the wild peacock, and jungle-fowl. There were at
least 100 peculiarly Indian birds in addition, of which the more
remarkable were several kinds of mina, of starling, vulture,
kingfisher, magpie, quail, and lapwing.</p>

<p>The country gradually became quite beautiful, much undulated and
diversified by bright green meadows, sloping lawns, and deeply
wooded nullahs, which lead from the Sal forest and meander through
this varied landscape. More beautiful sites for fine mansions could
not well be, and it is difficult to suppose so lovely a country
should be so malarious as it is before and after the rains,
excessive heat probably diffusing widely the miasma from small
stagnant surfaces. We noticed a wild hog, absolutely the first wild
beast of any size I saw on the plains, except the hispid hare
(<i>Lepus hispidus</i>) and the barking deer (<i>Stylocerus
ratna</i>). The hare we found to be the best game of this part of
India, except the teal. The pheasants of Dorjiling are poor, the
deer all but uneatable, and the</p>

<p class="first">florican, however dressed, I considered a far from
excellent bird.</p>

<p>A good many plants grow along the streams, the sandy beds of
which are everywhere covered with the marks of tigers&rsquo; feet.
The only safe way of botanizing is by pushing through the jungle on
elephants; an uncomfortable method, from the quantity of ants and
insects which drop from the foliage above, and from the risk of
disturbing pendulous bees&rsquo; and ants&rsquo; nests.</p>

<p>A peculiar species of willow (<i>Salix tetrasperma</i>) is
common here; which is a singular fact, as the genus is
characteristic of cold and arctic latitudes; and no species is
found below 5000 feet elevation on the Sikkim mountain, where it
grows on the inner Himalaya only, some kinds ascending to 16,000
feet.</p>

<p>East of Siligoree the plains are unvaried by tree or shrub, and
are barren wastes of short turf or sterile sand, with the
dwarf-palm (<i>Ph&oelig;nix acaulis</i>), a sure sign of a most
hungry soil.</p>

<p>The latter part of the journey I performed on elephants during
the heat of the day, and a more uncomfortable mode of conveyance
surely never was adopted; the camel&rsquo;s pace is more fatiguing,
but that of the elephant is extremely trying after a few miles, and
is so injurious to the human frame that the Mahouts (drivers) never
reach an advanced age, and often succumb young to spine-diseases,
brought on by the incessant motion of the vertebral column. The
broiling heat of the elephant&rsquo;s black back, and the odour of
its oily driver, are disagreeable accompaniments, as are its habits
of snorting water from its trunk over its parched skin, and the
consequences of the great bulk of green food which it consumes.</p>

<p>From Siligoree I made a careful examination of the</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">gravel beds that occur on the road north to the
foot of the hills, and thence over the tertiary sandstone to
Punkabaree. At the Rukti river, which flows south-west, the road
suddenly rises, and crosses the first considerable hill, about two
miles south of any rock <i>in situ.</i> This river cuts a cliff
from 60 to 100 feet high, composed of stratified sand and
water-worn gravel: further south, the spur declines into the
plains, its course marked by the Sal that thrives on its gravelly
soil. The road then runs north-west over a plain to an isolated
hill about 200 feet high, also formed of sand and gravel. We
ascended to the top of this, and found it covered with blocks of
gneiss, and much angular detritus. Hence the road gradually
ascends, and becomes clayey. Argillaceous rocks, and a little
ochreous sandstone appeared in highly-inclined strata, dipping
north, and covered with great water-worn blocks of gneiss. Above, a
flat terrace, flanked to the eastward by a low wooded hill, and
another rise of sandstone, lead on to the great Baisarbatti
terrace.</p>

<p><i>Bombax, Erythrina,</i> and <i>Duabanga</i>
(<i>Lag&aelig;rstr&aelig;mia grandiflora</i>), were in full flower,
and with the profusion of <i>Bauhinia,</i> rendered the tree-jungle
gay: the two former are leafless when flowering. The Duabanga is
the pride of these forests. Its trunk, from eight to fifteen feet
in girth, is generally forked from the base, and the long pendulous
branches which clothe the trunk for 100 feet, are thickly leafy,
and terminated by racemes of immense white flowers, which,
especially when in bud, smell most disagreeably of
assaf&oelig;tida. The magnificent Apocyneous climber, <i>
Beaumontia,</i> was in full bloom, ascending the loftiest trees,
and clothing their trunks with its splendid foliage and festoons of
enormous funnel-shaped white flowers.</p>

<p>The report of a bed of iron-stone eight or ten miles west</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">of Punkabaree determined our visiting the spot;
and the locality being in a dense jungle, the elephants were sent
on ahead.</p>

<p>We descended to the terraces flanking the Balasun river, and
struck west along jungle-paths to a loosely-timbered flat. A sudden
descent of 150 feet landed us on a second terrace. Further on, a
third dip of about twenty feet (in some places obliterated) flanks
the bed of the Balasun; the river itself being split into many
channels at this season. The west bank, which is forty feet high,
is of stratified sand and gravel, with vast slightly-worn blocks of
gneiss: from the top of this we proceeded south-west for three
miles to some Mechi villages, the inhabitants of which flocked to
meet us, bringing milk and refreshments.</p>

<p>The Lohar-ghur, or &ldquo;iron hill,&rdquo; lies in a dense dry
forest. Its plain-ward flanks are very steep, and covered with
scattered weather-worn masses of ochreous and black iron-stone,
many of which are several yards long: it fractures with faint
metallic lustre, and is very earthy in parts: it does not affect
the compass. There are no pebbles of iron-stone, nor water-worn
rocks of any kind found with it.</p>

<p>The sandstones, close by, cropped out in thick beds (dip north
70&deg;): they are very soft, and beds of laminated clay, and of a
slaty rock, are intercalated with them; also an excessively tough
conglomerate, formed of an indurated blue or grey paste, with
nodules of harder clay. There are no traces of metal in the rock,
and the lumps of ore are wholly superficial.</p>

<p>Below Punkabaree the Baisarbatti stream cuts through banks of
gravel overlying the sandstone (dip north 65&deg;). The sandstone
is gritty and micaceous, intercalated with beds of indurated shale
and clay; in which I found the shaft (apparently) of a bone; there
were also beds of the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 403">[ 403 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">same clay conglomerate which I had seen at
Lohar-ghur, and thin seams of brown lignite; with a rhomboidal
cleavage. In the bed of the stream were carbonaceous shales, with
obscure impressions of fern leaves, of <i>Trizygia,</i> and <i>
Vertebraria</i>: both fossils characteristic of the Burdwan
coal-fields (see <a href="chap1.html#page 8">page 8</a>), but too
imperfect to justify any conclusion as to the relation between
these formations.*</p>

<p>Ascending the stream, these shales are seen <i>in situ,</i>
overlain by the metamorphic clay-slate of the mountains, and
dipping inwards (northwards) like them. This is at the foot of the
Punkabaree spur, and close to the bungalow, where a stream and
land-slip expose good sections. The carbonaceous beds dip north
60&deg; and 70&deg;, and run east and west; much quartz rock is
intercalated with them, and soft white and pink micaceous
sandstones. The coal-seams are few in number, six to twelve inches
thick, very confused and distorted, and full of elliptic nodules,
or spheroids of quartzy slate, covered with concentric scaly layers
of coal: they overlie the sandstones mentioned above. These scanty
notices of superposition being collected in a country clothed with
the densest tropical forest, where a geologist pursues his
fatiguing investigations under disadvantages that can hardly be
realized in England, will I fear long remain unconfirmed.</p>

<p class="fnote">* These traces of fossils are not sufficient to
identify the formation with that of the sewalik hills of North-west
India; but its contents, together with its strike, dip, and
position relatively to the mountains, and its mineralogical
character, incline me to suppose it may be similar. Its appearance
in such small quantities in Sikkim (where it rises but a few
hundred feet above the level of the sea, whereas in Kumaon it
reaches 4000 feet), may be attributed to the greater amount of
wearing which it must have undergone; the plains from which it
rises being 1000 feet lower than those of Kumaon, and the sea
having consequently retired later, exposing the Sikkim sandstone to
the effects of denudation for a much longer period. Hitherto no
traces of this rock, or of any belonging to a similar geological
epoch, have been found in the valleys of Sikkim; but when the
narrowness of these is considered, it will not appear strange that
such may have been removed from their surfaces: first, by the
action of a tidal ocean; and afterwards, by that of tropical
rains.</p>

been observed in the Alleghany chain, and I believe in the
Alps.*</p>

cut in the cage, and a mouse-trap entrance formed: the cage is
placed in the current with the open end upwards, where the fish get
in, and though little bigger than minnows, cannot find their way
out.</p>

<p>On the 20th we had a change in the weather: a violent storm from
the south-west occurred at noon, with hail of a strange form, the
stones being sections of hollow spheres, half an inch across and
upwards, formed of cones with truncated apices and convex bases;
these cones were aggregated together with their bases outwards. The
large masses were followed by a shower of the separate conical
pieces, and that by heavy rain. On the mountains this storm was
most severe: the stones lay at Dorjiling for seven days, congealed
into masses of ice several feet long and a foot thick in sheltered
places: at Purneah, fifty miles south, stones one and two inches
across fell, probably as whole spheres.</p>

<p>Ascending to Khersiong, I found the vegetation very backward by
the road-sides. The rain had cleared the atmosphere, and the view
over the plains was brilliant. On the top of the Khersiong spur a
tremendous gale set in with a cold west wind: the storm cleared off
at night, which at 10 p.m. was beautiful, with forked and sheet
lightning over the plains far below us. The equinoctial gales had
now fairly set in, with violent south-east gales, heavy thunder,
lightning, and rain.</p>

<p>Whilst at Khersiong I took advantage of the very fair section
afforded by the road from Punkabaree, to examine the structure of
the spur, which seems to be composed of very highly inclined
contorted beds (dip north) of metamorphic rocks, gneiss,
mica-slate, clay-slate, and quartz; the foliation of which beds is
parallel to the dip of the strata. Over all reposes a bed of clay,
capped with a layer of</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 406">[ 406 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">vegetable mould, nowhere so thick and rich as in
the more humid regions of 7000 feet elevation. The rocks appeared
in the following succession in descending. Along the top are found
great blocks of very compact gneiss buried in clay. Half a mile
lower the same rock appears, dipping north-north-east 50&deg;.
Below this, beds of saccharine quartz, with seams of mica, dip
north-north-west 20&deg;. Some of these quartz beds are folded on
themselves, and look like flattened trunks of trees, being composed
of concentric layers, each from two to four inches thick: we
exposed twenty-seven feet of one fold running along the side of the
road, which was cut parallel to the strike. Each layer of quartz
was separated from its fellows, by one of mica scales; and was
broken up into cubical fragments, whose surfaces are no doubt
cleavage and jointing places. I had previously seen, but not
understood, such flexures produced by metamorphic action on masses
of quartz when in a pasty state, in the Falkland Islands, where
they have been perfectly well described by Mr. Darwin;* in whose
views of the formation of these rocks I entirely concur.</p>

<p>The flexures of the gneiss are incomparably more irregular and
confused than those of the quartz, and often contain flattened
spheres of highly crystalline felspar, that cleave perpendicularly
to the shorter axis. These spheres are disposed in layers parallel
to the foliation of the gneiss: and are the result of a metamorphic
action of great intensity, effecting a complete rearrangement and
crystallization of the quartz and mica in parallel planes, whilst
the felspar is aggregated in spheres; just as in the rearrangement
of the mineral constituents of mica-schists, the alumina is
crystallized in the garnets, and in the clay-slates the iron into
pyrites.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The quartz below this dips north-north-west 45&deg; to 50&deg;,
and alternates with a very hard slaty schist, dipping north-west
45&deg;, and still lower is a blue-grey clay-slate, dipping
north-north-west 30&deg;. These rest on beds of slate, folded like
the quartz mentioned above, but with cleavage-planes, forming lines
radiating from the axis of each flexure, and running through all
the concentric folds. Below this are the plumbago and clay slates
of Punkabaree, which alternate with beds of mica-schist with
garnets, and appear to repose immediately upon the carboniferous
strata and sandstone; but there is much disturbance at the
junction.</p>

<p>On re-ascending from Punkabaree, the rocks gradually appear more
and more dislocated, the clay-slate less so than the quartz and
mica-schist, and that again far less than the gneiss, which is so
shattered and bent, that it is impossible to say what is <i>in
situ,</i> and what not. Vast blocks lie superficially on the
ridges; and the tops of all the outer mountains, as of Khersiong
spur, of Tonglo, Sinchul, and Dorjiling, appear a pile of such
masses. Injected veins of quartz are rare in the lower beds of
schist and clay-slate, whilst the gneiss is often full of them; and
on the inner and loftier ranges, these quartz veins are replaced by
granite with tourmaline.</p>

<p>Lime is only known as a stalactitic deposit from various
streams, at elevations from 1000 to 7000 feet; one such stream
occurs above Punkabaree, which I have not seen; another within the
Sinchul range, on the great Rungeet river, above the exit of the
Rummai; a third wholly in the great central Himalayan range,
flowing into the Lachen river. The total absence of any calcareous
rock in Sikkim, and the appearance of the deposit in isolated
streams at such distant localities, probably indicates a very
remote origin of the lime-charged waters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>From Khersiong to Dorjiling, gneiss is the only rock, and is
often decomposed into clay-beds, 20 feet deep, in which the narrow,
often zigzag folia of quartz remain quite entire and undisturbed,
whilst every trace of the foliation of the softer mineral is
lost.</p>

<p>At Pacheem, Dorjiling weather, with fog and drizzle, commenced,
and continued for two days: we, reached Dorjiling on the 24th of
March, and found that the hail which had fallen on the 20th was
still lying in great masses of crumbling ice in sheltered spots.
The fall had done great damage to the gardens, and Dr.
Campbell&rsquo;s tea-plants were cut to pieces.</p>
