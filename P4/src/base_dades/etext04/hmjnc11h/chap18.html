<p class="first">After my return from the Terai, I was occupied
during the month of April in preparations for an expedition to the
loftier parts of Sikkim. The arrangements were the same as for my
former journey, except with regard to food, which it was necessary
should be sent out to me at intervals; for we had had ample proof
that the resources of the country were not equal to provisioning a
party of from forty to fifty men, even had the Dewan been
favourable to my travelling, which was clearly not the case.</p>

<p>Dr. Campbell communicated to the Rajah my intention of starting
early in May for the upper Teesta valley, and,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 2">[ 2 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">in the Governor-General&rsquo;s name, requested
that he would facilitate my visiting the frontier of Sikkim,
north-east of Kinchinjunga. The desired permission was, after a
little delay, received; which appeared to rouse the Dewan to
institute a series of obstructions to my progress, which caused so
many delays that my exploration of the country was not concluded
till October, and I was prevented returning to Dorjiling before the
following Christmas.</p>

<p>Since our visit to the Rajah in December, no Vakeel (agent) had
been sent by the Durbar to Dorjiling, and consequently we could
only communicate indirectly with his Highness, while we found it
impossible to ascertain the truth of various reports promulgated by
the Dewan, and meant to deter me from entering the country. In
April, the Lassoo Kajee was sent as Vakeel, but, having on a
previous occasion been dismissed for insolence and incapacity, and
again rejected when proposed by the Dewan at Bhomsong, he was
refused an audience; and he encamped at the bottom of the Great
Rungeet valley, where he lost some of his party through fever. He
retired into Sikkim, exasperated, pretending that he had orders to
delay my starting, in consequence of the death of the heir
apparent; and that he was prepared to use strong measures should I
cross the frontier.</p>

<p>No notice was taken of these threats: the Rajah was again
informed of my intended departure, unless his own orders to the
contrary were received through a proper accredited agent, and I
left Dorjiling on the 3rd of May, accompanied by Dr. Campbell, who
insisted on seeing me fairly over the frontier at the Great Rungeet
river.</p>

<p>Arrangements were made for supplies of rice following me by
instalments; our daily consumption being 80 lbs., a man&rsquo;s
load. After crossing into Sikkim, I mustered my</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 3">[ 3 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">party at the Great Rungeet river. I had forty-two
in all, of whom the majority were young Lepchas, or Sikkim-born
people of Tibetan races: all were active and cheerful looking
follows; only one was goitred, and he had been a salt-trader. I was
accompanied by a guard of five Sepoys, and had a Lepcha and Tibetan
interpreter. I took but one personal servant, a Portuguese
half-caste (John Hoffman by name), who cooked for me: he was a
native of Calcutta, and though hardy, patient, and long-suffering,
and far better-tempered, was, in other respects, very inferior to
Clamanze, who had been my servant the previous year, and who,
having been bred to the sea, was as handy as he was clever; but
who, like all other natives of the plains, grew intolerably weary
of the hills, and left me.</p>

<p>The first part of my route lay over Tendong, a very fine
mountain, which rises 8,613 feet, and is a conspicuous feature from
Dorjiling, where it is known as Mount Ararat. The Lepchas have a
curious legend of a man and woman having saved themselves on its
summit, during a flood that once deluged Sikkim. The coincidence of
this story with the English name of Ararat suggests the probability
of the legend being fabulous; but I am positively assured that it
is not so, but that it was current amongst the Lepchas before its
English name was heard of, and that the latter was suggested from
the peculiar form of its summit resembling that given in
children&rsquo;s books as the resting-place of the ark.</p>

<p>The ascent from the Great Rungeet (alt. 818 feet) is through dry
woods of Sal and Pines (<i>P. longifolia</i>). I camped the first
night at the village of Mikk (alt. 3,900 feet), and on the
following day ascended to Namtc (alt. 5,600 feet).</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 4">[ 4 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the route I was met by the Lama of Silokfoke Goompa. Though a
resident on the Lassoo Kajee&rsquo;s estates, he politely brought
me a present, at the same time apologising for not waiting till I
had encamped, owing to his excessive fat, which prevented his
climbing. I accepted his excuses, though well aware that his real
reason was that he wished to pay his respects, and show his good
feeling, in private. Besides his ordinary canonicals, he carried a
tall crozier-headed staff, and had a curious horn slung round his
neck, full of amulets; it was short, of a transparent red colour,
and beautifully carved, and was that of the small cow of Lhassa,
which resembles the English species, and is not a yak (it is called
&ldquo;Tundro&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Namtchi was once a place of considerable importance; and still
possesses a mendong, with six rows of inscribed slabs; a temple,
and a Lama attached thereto: the latter waited on me soon after I
had encamped, but he brought no present, and I was not long kept in
suspense as to his motives. These people are poor dissemblers; if
they intend to obstruct, they do it clumsily and hesitatingly: in
this instance the Lama first made up to my people, and, being
coolly received, kept gradually edging up to my tent-door, where,
after an awkward salute, he delivered himself with a very bad grace
of his mission, which was from the Lassoo Kajee to stop my
progress. I told him I knew nothing of the Lassoo Kajee or his
orders, and should proceed on the following morning: he then urged
the bad state of the roads, and advised me to wait two days till he
should receive orders from the Rajah; upon which I dismissed
him.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, as I sat at my tent-door, looking along the
narrow bushy ridge that winds up the mountain, I saw twenty or
thirty men rapidly descending the rocky</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 5">[ 5 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">path: they were Lepchas, with blue and white
striped garments, bows and quivers, and with their long knives
gleaming in the sun: they seemed to be following a figure in red
Lama costume, with a scarlet silk handkerchief wound round his
head, its ends streaming behind him. Though expecting this
apparition to prove the renowned Kajee and his myrmidons, coming to
put a sudden termination to my progress, I could not help admiring
the exceeding picturesqueness of the scenery and party. My fears
were soon dissipated by my men joyfully shouting, &ldquo;The Tchebu
Lama! the Tchebu Lama!&rdquo; and I soon recognised the rosy face
and twinkling eyes of my friend of Bhomsong, the only man of
intelligence about the Rajah&rsquo;s court, and the one whose
services as Vakeel were particularly wanted at Dorjiling.</p>

<p>He told me that the Lassoo Kajee had orders (from whom, he would
not say) to stop my progress, but that I should proceed
nevertheless, and that there was no objection to my doing so; and
he despatched a messenger to the Rajah, announcing my progress, and
requesting him to send me a guide, and to grant me every facility,
asserting that he had all along fully intended doing so.</p>

<p>On the following morning the Lama proceeded to Dorjiling, and I
continued the ascent of Tendong, sending my men round the shoulder
to Temi in the Teesta valley, where I proposed to pass the night.
The road rapidly ascends by a narrow winding path, covered with a
loose forest of oaks, rhododendrons, and various shrubs, not found
at equal elevations on the wetter Dorjiling ranges: amongst, them
the beautiful laburnum-like <i>Piptanthus Nepalensis,</i> with
golden blossoms, was conspicuous. Enormous blocks of white and red
stratified quartz, and slate, some 20 and even 40 yards long, rest
on the narrow</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 6">[ 6 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">ridge at 7000 feet elevation. The last ascent is
up a steep rounded cone with a broad flat top, covered with dwarf
bamboo, a few oaks, laurels, magnolias, and white-flowered
rhododendron trees (<i>R. argenteum</i>), which obstructed the
view. I hung the barometers near one of the many chaits on the
summit, where there is also a rude temple, in which worship is
performed once a year. The elevation is 8,671 feet by my
observations.* The geological formation of Tendong in some measure
accounts for its peculiar form. On the conical summit are hard
quartzoze porphyries, which have apparently forced up the gneiss
and slates, which dip in all directions from the top, and are full
of injected veins of quartz. Below 7000 feet, mica-schist prevails,
always inclined at a very high angle; and I found jasper near
Namtchi, with other indications of Plutonic action.</p>

<p>The descent on the north side was steep, through a rank
vegetation, very different from that of the south face. The oaks
are very grand, and I measured one (whose trunk was decayed, and
split into three, however), which I found to be 49 feet in girth at
5 feet from the ground. Near Temi (alt. 4,770 feet) I gathered the
fruit of <i>Kadsura,</i> a climbing plant allied to Magnolia,
bearing round heads of large fleshy red drupes, which are
pleasantly acid and much eaten; the seeds are very aromatic.</p>

<p>From Temi the road descends to the Teesta, the course of which
it afterwards follows. The valley was fearfully hot, and infested
with mosquitos and peepsas. Many fine plants grew in it:&dagger; I
especially noticed <i>Aristolochia saccata,</i></p>

<p class="fnote">* 8,663 by Col. Waugh&rsquo;s trigonometrical
observations.<br>
&dagger; Especially upon the broad terraces of gravel, some of
which are upwards of a mile long, and 200 feet above the stream:
they are covered with boulders of rock, and are generally opposite
feeders of the river.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 7">[ 7 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">which climbs the loftiest trees, bearing its
curious pitcher-shaped flowers near the ground only; its leaves are
said to be good food for cattle. <i>Houttuynia,</i> a curious herb
allied to pepper, grew on the banks, which, from the profusion of
its white flowers, resembled strawberry-beds; the leaves are eaten
by the Lepchas. But the most magnificent plant of these jungles is
<i>Hodgsonia,</i> (a genus I have dedicated to my friend, Mr.
Hodgson), a gigantic climber allied to the gourd, bearing immense
yellowish-white pendulous blossoms, whose petals have a fringe of
buff-coloured curling threads, several inches long. The fruit is of
a rich brown, like a small melon in form, and contains six large
nuts, whose kernels (called &ldquo;Katior-pot&rdquo; by the
Lepchas) are eaten. The stem, when cut, discharges water profusely
from whichever end is held downwards. The &ldquo;Took&rdquo;
(<i>Hydnocarpus</i>) is a beautiful evergreen tree, with tufts of
yellow blossoms on the trunk: its fruit is as large as an orange,
and is used to poison fish, while from the seeds an oil is
expressed. Tropical oaks and Terminalias are the giants of these
low forests, the latter especially, having buttressed trunks,
appear truly gigantic; one, of a kind called
&ldquo;Sung-lok,&rdquo; measured 47 feet in girth, at 5 feet, and
21 at 15 feet from the ground, and was fully 200 feet high. I could
only procure the leaves by firing a ball into the crown. Some of
their trunks lay smouldering on the ground, emitting a curious
smell from the mineral matter in their ashes, of whose constituents
an account will be found in the Appendix.</p>

<p>Birds are very rare, as is all animal life but insects, and a
small fresh-water crab, <i>Thelphusa,</i> (&ldquo;Ti-hi&rdquo; of
the Lepchas). Shells, from the absence of lime, are extremely
scarce, and I scarcely picked up a single specimen: the most common
are species of <i>Cyclostoma.</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 8">[ 8 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rains commenced on the 10th of May, greatly increasing the
discomforts of travelling, but moderating the heat by drenching
thunder-storms, which so soaked the men&rsquo;s loads, that I was
obliged to halt a day in the Teesta valley to have waterproof
covers made of platted bamboo-work, enclosing Phrynium leaves. I
was delighted to find that my little tent was impervious to water,
though its thickness was but of one layer of blanket: it was a
single ridge with two poles, 7 feet high, 8 feet long, and 8 feet
broad at the base, forming nearly an equilateral triangle in
front.</p>

<p>Bhomsong was looking more beautiful than ever in its rich summer
clothing of tropical foliage. I halted during an hour of heavy rain
on the spot where I had spent the previous Christmas, and could not
help feeling doubly lonely in a place where every rock and tree
reminded me of that pleasant time. The isolation of my position,
the hostility of the Dewan, and consequent uncertainty of the
success of a journey that absorbed all my thoughts, the prevalence
of fevers in the valleys I was traversing, and the many
difficulties that beset my path, all crowded on the imagination
when fevered by exertion and depressed by gloomy weather, and my
spirits involuntarily sank as I counted the many miles and months
intervening between me and my home.</p>

<p>The little flat on which I had formerly encamped was now covered
with a bright green crop of young rice. The house then occupied by
the Dewan was now empty and unroofed; but the suspension bridge had
been repaired, and its light framework of canes, spanning the
boiling flood of the Teesta, formed a graceful object in this most
beautiful landscape. The temperature of the river was 58&deg;, only
7&deg; above that of mid-winter, owing to the now melting
snows.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 9">[ 9 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">I had rather expected to meet either with a guide,
or with some further obstruction here, but as none appeared, I
proceeded onwards as soon as the weather moderated.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images2/fig1.jpg" width="241" height="336" alt=
"Pandanus. Sikkim screw-pine"></center>

<p>Higher up, the scenery resembles that of Tchintam on the Tambur:
the banks are so steep as to allow of no road, and the path ascends
from the river, at 1000 feet, to Lathiang village, at 4,800 feet,
up a wild, rocky torrent that descends from Mainom to the Teesta.
The cliffs here are covered with wild plantains and screw-pines
(<i>Pandanus</i>),</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 10">[ 10 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">50 feet high, that clasp the rocks with cable-like
roots, and bear one or two crowns of drooping leaves, 5 feet long:
two palms, Rattan (<i>Calamus</i>) and <i>Areca gracilis,</i>
penetrate thus far up the Teesta valley, but are scarcely found
further.</p>

<p>From the village the view was superb, embracing the tropical
gulley below, with the flat of Bhomsong deep down in the gorge, its
bright rice-fields gleaming like emeralds amid the dark vegetation
that surrounded it; the Teesta winding to the southward, the
pine-clad rocky top of Mainom, 10,613 feet high, to the south-west,
the cone of Mount Ararat far to the south, to the north black
mountains tipped with snow, and to the east the magnificent snowy
range of Chola, girdling the valley of the Ryott with a diadem of
frosted silver. The coolies, each carrying upwards of 80 lb. load,
had walked twelve hours that day, and besides descending 2000 feet,
they had ascended nearly 4000 feet, and gone over innumerable ups
and downs besides.</p>

<p>Beyond Lathiang, a steep and dangerous path runs along the east
flank of Mainom, sometimes on narrow ledges of dry rock, covered
with long grass, sometimes dipping into wooded gullies, full of <i>
Edgeworthia Gardneri</i> and small trees of Andromeda and
rhododendron, covered with orchids* of great beauty.</p>

<p>Descending to Gorh (4,100 feet), I was met by the Lama of that
district, a tall, disagreeable-looking fellow, who informed me that
the road ahead was impassable. The day being spent, I was obliged
to camp at any rate; after which he visited me in full canonicals,
bringing me a handsome present, but assuring me that he had no</p>

<p class="fnote">* Especially some species of <i>Sunipia</i> and
<i>Cirrhopetalum,</i> whicb have not yet been introduced into
England.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 11">[ 11 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">authority to let me advance. I treated him with
civility, and regretted my objects being so imperative, and my
orders so clear, that I was obliged to proceed on the following
morning: on which he abruptly decamped, as I suspected, in order to
damage the paths and bridges. He came again at daylight, and
expostulated further; but finding it of no use, he volunteered to
accompany me, officiously offering me the choice of two roads. I
asked for the coolest, knowing full well that it was useless to try
and out-wit him in such matters. At the first stream the bridge was
destroyed, but seeing the planks peeping through the bushes in
which they had been concealed, I desired the Lama to repair it,
which he did without hesitation. So it was at every point: the path
was cumbered with limbs of trees, crossing-stones were removed from
the streams, and all natural difficulties were increased. I kept
constantly telling the Lama that as he had volunteered to show me
the road, I felt sure he intended to remove all obstacles, and
accordingly I put him to all the trouble I possibly could, which he
took with a very indifferent grace. When I arrived at the swinging
bridge across the Teesta, I found that the canes were loosened, and
that slips of bamboo, so small as nearly to escape observation,
were ingeniously placed low down over the single bamboo that formed
the footing, intended to trip up the unwary passenger, and overturn
him into the river, which was deep, and with a violent current.
Whilst the Lama was cutting these, one of my party found a charcoal
writing on a tree, announcing the speedy arrival from the Rajah of
my old guide, Meepo; and he shortly afterwards appeared, with
instructions to proceed with me, though not to the Tibetan
frontier. The lateness of the season, the violence of the rains,
and the fears, on the Rajah&rsquo;s part, that I might</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 12">[ 12 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">suffer from fever or accident, were all urged to
induce me to return, or at least only to follow the west branch of
the Teesta to Kinchinjunga. These reasons failing, I was threatened
with Chinese interference on the frontier. All these objections I
overruled, by refusing to recognise any instructions that were not
officially communicated to the Superintendent of Dorjiling.</p>

<p>The Gorh Lama here took leave of me: he was a friend of the
Dewan, and was rather surprised to find that the Rajah had sent me
a guide, and now attempted to pass himself off as my friend,
pompously charging Meepo with the care of me, and bidding me a very
polite farewell. I could not help telling him civilly, but plainly,
what I thought of him; and so we parted.</p>

<p>Meepo was very glad to join my party again: he is a thorough
Lepcha in heart, a great friend of his Rajah and of Tchebu Lama,
and one who both fears and hates the Dewan. He assured me of the
Rajah&rsquo;s good wishes and intentions, but spoke with great
doubt as to the probability of a successful issue to my journey: he
was himself ignorant of the road, but had brought a guide, whose
appearance, however, was against him, and who turned out to be sent
as a spy on us both.</p>

<p>Instead of crossing the Teesta here, we kept on for two days up
its west bank, to a cane bridge at Lingo, where the bed of the
river is still only 2000 feet above the sea, though 45 miles
distant from the plains, and flowing in a valley bounded by
mountains 12,000 to 16,000 feet high. The heat was oppressive, from
the closeness of the atmosphere, the great power of the sun, now
high at noon-day, and the reflection from the rocks. Leeches began
to swarm as the damp increased, and stinging flies of various
kinds. My clothes were drenched with perspiration during five</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 13">[ 13 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">hours of every day, and the crystallising salt
irritated the skin. On sitting down to rest, I was overcome with
languor and sleep, and, but for the copious supply of fresh water
everywhere, travelling would have been intolerable. The Coolies
were all but naked, and were constantly plunging into the pools of
the rivers; for, though filthy in their persons, they revel in cold
water in summer. They are powerful swimmers, and will stem a very
strong current, striking out with each arm alternately. It is an
animated sight when twenty or thirty of these swarthy children of
nature are disporting their muscular figures in the water, diving
after large fish, and sometimes catching them by tickling them
under the stones.</p>

<p>Of plants I found few not common at similar elevations below
Dorjiling, except another kind of Tree-fern,* whose pith is eaten
in times of scarcity. The India-rubber fig penetrates thus far
amongst the mountains, but is of small size. A Gentian, <i>
Arenaria,</i> and some sub-alpine plants are met with, though the
elevation is only 2000 feet, and the whole climate thoroughly
tropical: they were annuals usually found at 7000 to 10,000 feet
elevation, and were growing here on mossy rocks, cooled by the
spray of the river, whose temperature was only 56&middot;3&deg;. My
servant having severely sprained his wrist by a fall, the Lepchas
wanted to apply a moxa, which they do by lighting a piece of
puff-ball, or Nepal paper that burns like tinder, laying it on the
skin, and blowing it till a large open sore is produced: they shook
their heads at my treatment, which consisted in transferring some
of the leeches from our persons to the inflamed part.</p>

<p class="fnote">* <i>Alsophila spinulosa,</i> the
&ldquo;Pugjik&rdquo; of the Lepchas, who eat the soft watery pith:
it is abundant in East Bengal and the Peninsula of India. The other
Sikkim Tree-fern, <i>A. gigantea,</i> is far more common from the
level of the plains to 6,500 elevation, and is found as far south
as Java.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 14">[ 14 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After crossing the Teesta by the cane bridge of Lingo, our route
lay over a steep and lofty spur, round which the river makes a
great sweep. On the ascent of this ridge we passed large villages
on flats cultivated with buckwheat. The saddle is 5,500 feet high,
and thence a rapid descent leads to the village of Singtam, which
faces the north, and is 300 feet lower, and 3000 feet above the
river, which is here no longer called the Teesta, but is known as
the Lachen-Lachoong, from its double origin in the rivers of these
names, which unite at Choongtam, twenty miles higher up. Of these,
the source of the Lachen is in the Cholamoo lakes in Tibet; while
the Lachoong rises on the south flank of Donkia mountain, both many
marches north of my present position. At Singtam the
Lacben-Lachoong runs westward, till joined by the Rihi from the
north, and the Rinoong from the west, after receiving which it
assumes the name of Teesta: of these affluents, the Rinoong is the
largest, and drains the south-east face of Kinchinjunga and Pundim,
and the north of Nursing: all which mountains are seen to the
north-north-west of Singtam. The Rinoong valley is cultivated for
several miles up, and has amongst others the village and Lamasery
of Bah. Beyond this the view of black, rugged precipices with snowy
mountains towering above them, is one of the finest in Sikkim.
There is a pass in that direction, from Bah over the Tckonglah to
the Thlonok valley, and thence to the province of Jigatzi in Tibet,
but it is almost impracticable.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images2/plate6.jpg" width="278" height="452" alt=
"View of Kinchinjunga from Singtam, looking north-westward">
</center>

<p>A race of wild men, called &ldquo;Harrum-mo,&rdquo; are said to
inhabit the head of the valley, living in the woods of a district
called Mund-po, beyond Bah; tbey shun habitations, speak an
unintelligible tongue, have more hair on the face than Lepchas, and
do not plait that of their heads, but</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 15">[ 15 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">wear it in a knot; they use the bow and arrow, and
eat snakes and vermin, which the Lepchas will not touch. Such is
the account I have heard, and which is certainly believed in
Sikkim: similar stories are very current in half civilized
countries; and if this has any truth, it possibly refers to the
Chepangs,* a very remarkable race, of doubtful affinity and origin,
inhabiting the Nepal forests.</p>

<p>At Singtam I was waited on by the Soubah of the district, a tall
portly Bhoteea, who was destined to prove a most active enemy to my
pursuits. He governs the country between Gorh and the Tibet
frontier, for the Maha-Raanee (wife of the Rajah), whose dowry it
is; and she being the Dewan&rsquo;s relative, I had little
assistance to expect from her agent. His conduct was very polite,
and he brought me a handsome offering for myself; but after
delaying me a day on the pretext of collecting food for my people,
of which I was in want, I was obliged to move on with no addition
to my store, and trust to obtaining some at the next village, or
from Dorjiling. Owing, however, to the increasing distance, and the
destruction of the roads by the rains, my supplies from that place
were becoming irregular: I therefore thought it prudent to reduce
my party, by sending back my guard of Sepoys, who could be of no
further use.</p>

<p>From this point the upper portion of the course of the Teesta
(Lachen-Lachoong) is materially different from what it is lower
down; becoming a boisterous torrent, as suddenly as the Tambur does
above Mywa Guola. Its bed is narrower, large masses of rock impede
its course, nor is there any place where it is practicable for
rafts at any season; the only means of passing it being by cane
bridges that are thrown across, high above the stream.</p>

Society&rsquo;s Journal&rdquo; for 1848.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">The slope on either side of the valley is very
steep; that on the north, in particular, appearing too precipitous
for any road, and being only frequented by honey seekers, who scale
the rocks by cane ladders, and thus reach the pendulous
bees&rsquo;-nests, which are so large as in some instances to be
conspicuous features at the distance of a mile. This pursuit
appeared extremely perilous, the long thread-like canes in many
places affording the only footing, over many yards of cliff: the
procuring of this honey, however, is the only means by which many
of the idle poor raise the rent which they must pay to the
Rajah.</p>

<p>The most prominent effect of the steepness of the valleys is the
prevalence of land-slips, which sometimes descend for 3000 feet,
carrying devastation along their course: they are caused either by
the melting of the snow-beds on the mountains, or by the action of
the rains on the stratified rocks, and are much increased in effect
and violence by the heavy timber-trees which, swaying forwards,
loosen the earth at their roots, and give impetus to the mass. This
phenomenon is as frequent and destructive as in Switzerland, where,
however, more lives are lost; from the country being more populous,
and from the people recklessly building in places particularly
exposed to such accidents. A most destructive one had, however,
occurred here the previous year, by which a village was destroyed,
together with twelve of its inhabitants, and all the cattle. The
fragments of rock precipitated are sometimes of enormous size, but
being a soft mica-schist, are soon removed by weathering. It is in
the rainy season that landslips are most frequent, and shortly
after rain they are pretty sure to be heard far or near. I crossed
the d&eacute;bris of the great one alluded to, on the first march
beyond Singtam: the whole face of the mountain appeared more or
less torn up for fully</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 17">[ 17 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">a mile, presenting a confused mass of white
micaceous clay, full of angular masses of rock. The path was very
difficult and dangerous, being carried along the steep slope, at an
angle, in some places, of 35&deg;; and it was constantly shifting,
from the continued downward sliding, and from the action of
streams, some of which are large, and cut deep channels. In one I
had the misfortune to lose my only sheep, which was carried away by
the torrent. These streams were crossed by means of sticks and
ricketty bamboos, and the steep sides (sometimes twenty or thirty
feet high), were ascended by notched poles.</p>

<p>The weather continued very hot for the elevation (4000 to 5000
feet), the rain brought no coolness, and for the greater part of
the three marches between Singtam and Chakoong, we were either
wading through deep mud, or climbing over rocks. Leeches swarmed in
incredible profusion in the streams and damp grass, and among the
bushes: they got into my hair, hung on my eyelids, and crawled up
my legs and down my back. I repeatedly took upwards of a hundred
from my legs, where the small ones used to collect in clusters on
the instep: the sores which they produced were not healed for five
months afterwards, and I retain the scars to the present day. Snuff
and tobacco leaves are the best antidote, but when marching in the
rain, it is impossible to apply this simple remedy to any
advantage. The best plan I found to be rolling the leaves over the
feet, inside the stockings, and powdering the legs with snuff.</p>

<p>Another pest is a small midge, or sand-fly, which causes
intolerable itching, and subsequent irritation, and is in this
respect the most insufferable torment in Sikkim; the minutest rent
in one&rsquo;s clothes is detected by the acute senses of this
insatiable bloodsucker, which is itself so</p>

<p class="first">small as to be barely visible without a
microscope. We daily arrived at our camping-ground, streaming with
blood, and mottled with the bites of peepsas, gnats, midges, and
mosquitos, besides being infested with ticks.</p>

<p>As the rains advanced, insects seemed to be called into
existence in countless swarms; large and small moths, cockchafers,
glow-worms, and cockroaches, made my tent a Noah&rsquo;s ark by
night, when the candle was burning; together with winged ants,
May-flies, flying earwigs, and many beetles, while a very large
species of <i>Tipula</i> (daddy-long-legs) swept its long legs
across my face as I wrote my journal, or plotted off my map. After
retiring to rest and putting out the light, they gradually
departed, except a few which could not find the way out, and
remained to disturb my slumbers.</p>

<p>Chakoong is a remarkable spot in the bottom of the valley, at an
angle of the Lachen-Lachoong, which here receives an affluent from
Gnarem, a mountain 17,557 feet high, on the Chola range to the
east.* There is no village, but some grass huts used by travellers,
which are built close to the river on a very broad flat, fringed
with alder, hornbeam, and birch: the elevation is 4,400 feet, and
many European genera not found about Dorjiling, and belonging to
the temperate Himalaya, grow intermixed with tropical plants that
are found no further north. The birch, willow, alder, and walnut
grow side by side with wild plantain, <i>Erythrina, Wallichia</i>
palm, and gigantic bamboos: the <i>Cedrela Toona,</i> figs, <i>
Melastoma, Scitamine&aelig;,</i> balsams, <i>Pothos,</i> peppers,
and gigantic climbing vines, grow mixed with brambles, speedwell,
<i>Paris,</i> forget-me-not, and nettles</p>

<p class="fnote">* This is called Black Rock in Col. Waugh&rsquo;s
map. I doubt Gnarem being a generally known name: the people hardly
recognise the mountain as sufficiently conspicuous to bear a
name.</p>

<p class="first">that sting like poisoned arrows. The wild English
strawberry is common, but bears a tasteless fruit: its inferiority
is however counterbalanced by the abundance of a grateful yellow
raspberry. Parasitical Orchids (<i>Dendrobium nobile,</i> and <i>
densiflorum,</i> etc.), cover the trunks of oaks, while <i>
Thalictrum</i> and <i>Geranium</i> grow under their shade. <i>
Monotropa</i> and <i>Balanophora,</i> both parasites on the roots
of trees (the one a native of north Europe and the other of a
tropical climate), push their leafless stems and heads of flowers
through the soil together: and lastly, tree-ferns grow associated
with the <i>Pteris aquilina</i> (brake) and <i>Lycopodium
clavatum</i> of our British moors; and amongst mosses, the superb
Himalayan <i>Lyellia crispa,</i>* with the English <i>Funaria
hygrometrica.</i></p>

<p>The dense jungles of Chakoong completely cover the beautiful
flat terraces of stratified sand and gravel, which rise in three
shelves to 150 feet above the river, and whose edges appear as
sharply cut as if the latter had but lately retired from them. They
are continuous with a line of quartzy cliffs, covered with scarlet
rhododendrons, and in the holes of which a conglomerate of pebbles
is found, 150 feet above the river. Everywhere immense boulders are
scattered about, some of which are sixty yards long: their surfaces
are water-worn into hollows, proving the river to have cut through
nearly 300 feet of deposit, which once floored its valley. Lower
down the valley, and fully 2000 feet above the river, I had passed
numerous angular blocks resting on gentle slopes where no landslips
could possibly have deposited them; and which I therefore refer to
ancient glacial action: one of these,</p>

<p class="fnote">* This is one of the most remarkable mosses in the
Himalaya mountains, and derives additional interest from having
been named after the late Charles Lyell, Esq., of Kinnordy, the
father of the most eminent geologist of the present day.</p>

<p class="first">near the village of Niong, was nearly square,
eighty feet long, and ten high.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable fact, that this hot, damp gorge is never
malarious; this is attributable to the coolness of the river, and
to the water on the flats not stagnating; for at Choongtam, a march
further north, and 1,500 feet higher, fevers and ague prevail in
summer on similar flats, but which have been cleared of jungle, and
are therefore exposed to the sun.</p>

<p>I had had constant headache for several mornings on waking,
which I did not fail to attribute to coming fever, or to the
unhealthiness of the climate; till I accidentally found it to arise
from the wormwood, upon a thick couch of the cut branches of which
I was accustomed to sleep, and which in dry weather produced no
such effects.*</p>

<p>From Chakoong to Choongtam the route lay northwards, following
the course of the river, or crossing steep spurs of vertical strata
of mica-schist, that dip into the valley, and leave no space
between their perpendicular sides and the furious torrent. Immense
landslips seamed the steep mountain flanks; and we crossed with
precipitation one that extended fully 4000 feet (and perhaps much
more) up a mountain 12,000 feet high, on the east bank: it moves
every year, and the mud and rocks shot down by it were strewn with
the green leaves and twigs of shrubs, some of the flowers on which
were yet fresh and bright, while others were crushed: these were
mixed with gigantic trunks of pines, with ragged bark and scored
timbers. The talus which had lately been poured into the valley
formed a gently sloping bank, twenty feet high, over which the
Lachen-</p>

<p class="fnote">* This wormwood (<i>Artemisia Indaca</i>) is one
of the most common Sikkim plants at 2000 to 6000 feet elevation,

<p class="first">Lachoong rolled, from a pool above, caused by the
damming up of its waters. On either side of the pool were
cultivated terraces of stratified sand and pebbles, fifty feet
high, whose alder-fringed banks, joined by an elegant cane bridge,
were reflected in the placid water; forming a little spot of
singular quiet and beauty, that contrasted with the savage grandeur
of the surrounding mountains, and the headstrong course of the
foaming torrent below, amid whose deafening roar it was impossible
to speak and be heard.</p>

<p>The mountain of Choongtam is about 10,000 feet high; it divides
the Lachen from the Lachoong river, and terminates a lofty range
that runs for twenty-two miles south from the lofty mountain of
Kinchinjhow. Its south exposed face is bare of trees, except clumps
of pines towards the top, and is</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 22">[ 22 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">very steep, grassy, and rocky, without water. It
is hence quite unlike the forest-clad mountains further south, and
indicates a drier and more sunny climate. The scenery much
resembles that of Switzerland, and of the north-west Himalaya,
especially in the great contrast between the southern and northern
exposures, the latter being always clothed with a dense vegetation.
At the foot of this very steep mountain is a broad triangular flat,
5,270 feet above the sea, and 300 feet above the river, to which it
descends by three level cultivated shelves. The village, consisting
of a temple and twenty houses, is placed on the slope of the hill.
I camped on the flat in May, before it became very swampy, close to
some great blocks of gneiss, of which many lie on its surface: it
was covered with tufts of sedge (like <i>Carex stellulata</i>), and
fringed with scarlet rhododendron, walnut, <i>Andromeda,
El&aelig;agnus</i> (now bearing pleasant acid fruit), and small
trees of a <i>Photinia,</i> a plant allied to hawthorn, of the
leaves of which the natives make tea (as they do of <i>Gualtheria,
Andromeda, Vaccinium,</i> and other allied plants). Rice,
cultivated* in pools surrounded by low banks, was just peeping
above ground; and scanty crops of millet, maize, and buckwheat
flourished on the slopes around.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Choongtam are of Tibetan origin; few of them
had seen an Englishman before, and they flocked out, displaying the
most eager curiosity: the Lama and Phipun (or superior officer) of
the Lachoong valley came to pay their respects with a troop of
followers, and there was lolling out of tongues, and scratching of
ears, at every sentence spoken, and every object of admiration.</p>

<p class="fnote">* Choongtam is in position and products analogous
to Lelyp, on the Tambur (<a href="chap9.html#page 204">vol. i, page
204</a>). Rice cultivation advances thus high up each valley, and
at either place Bhoteeas replace the natives of the lower
valleys.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 23">[ 23 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">This extraordinary Tibetan salute at first puzzled
me excessively, nor was it until reading MM. Huc and Gabet&rsquo;s
travels on my return to England, that I knew of its being the <i>
ton</i> at Lhassa, and in all civilised parts of Tibet.</p>

<p>As the valley was under the Singtam Soubah&rsquo;s authority, I
experienced a good deal of opposition; and the Lama urged the wrath
of the gods against my proceeding. This argument, I said, had been
disposed of the previous year, and I was fortunate in recognising
one of my Changachelling friends, who set forth my kindly offices
to the Lamas of that convent, and the friendship borne me by its
monks, and by those of Pemiongchi. Many other modes of dissuading
me were attempted, but with Meepo&rsquo;s assistance I succeeded in
gaining my point. The difficulty and delays in remittance of food,
caused by the landslips having destroyed the road, had reduced our
provisions to a very low ebb; and it became not only impossible to
proceed, but necessary to replenish my stores on the spot. At first
provisions enough were brought to myself, for the Rajah had issued
orders for my being cared for, and having some practice among the
villagers in treating rheumatism and go&icirc;tres, I had the power
of supplying my own larder; but I found it impossible to buy food
for my people. At last, the real state of the case came out; that
the Rajah having gone to Choombi, his usual summer-quarters in
Tibet, the Dewan had issued orders that no food should be sold or
given to my people, and that no roads were to be repaired during my
stay in the country; thus cutting off my supplies from Dorjiling,
and, in short, attempting to starve me out. At this juncture, Meepo
received a letter from the Durbar purporting to be from the Rajah,
commanding my immediate return, on the grounds that I had been long
enough in the country for my objects: it was not</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 24">[ 24 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">addressed to me, and I refused to receive it as an
official communication; following up my refusal by telling Meepo
that if he thought his orders required it, he had better leave me
and return to the Rajah, as I should not stir without directions
from Dr. Campbell, except forwards. He remained, however, and said
he had written to the Rajah, urging him to issue stringent orders
for my party being provisioned.</p>

<p>We were reduced to a very short allowance before the
long-expected supplies came, by which time our necessities had
almost conquered my resolution not to take by force of the
abundance I might see around, however well I might afterwards pay.
It is but fair to state that the improvident villagers throughout
Sikkim are extremely poor in vegetable food at this season, when
the winter store is consumed, and the crops are still green. They
are consequently obliged to purchase rice from the lower valleys,
which, owing to the difficulties of transport, is very dear; and to
obtain it they barter wool, blankets, musk, and Tibetan produce of
all kinds. Still they had cattle, which they would willingly have
sold to me, but for the Dewan&rsquo;s orders.</p>

<p>There is a great difference between the vegetation of Dorjiling
and that of similar elevations near Choongtam situated far within
the Himalaya: this is owing to the steepness and dryness of the
latter locality, where there is an absence of dense forest, which
is replaced by a number of social grasses clothing the mountain
sides, many new and beautiful kinds of rhododendrons, and a variety
of European genera,* which (as I have elsewhere noticed) are
either</p>

<p class="fnote">* <i>Deutzia, Saxifraga caliata, Thalictrum,
Euphorbia,</i> yellow violet, <i>Labiat&aelig;, Androsace,
Leguminos&aelig;, Coriaria, Delphinium,</i> currant, <i>
Umbellifer&aelig;,</i> primrose, <i>Anemone, Convallaria,
Rosc&oelig;a, Mitella, Herminium, Drosera.</i></p>

<p class="first">wholly absent from the damper ranges of Dorjiling,
or found there several thousand feet higher up. On the hill above
Choongtam village, I gathered, at 5000 to 6000 feet, <i>
Rhododendron arboreum</i> and <i>Dalhousi&aelig;,</i> which do not
generally grow at Dorjiling below 7,500 feet.* The yew appears at
7000 feet, whilst, on the outer ranges (as on Tonglo), it is only
found at 9,500 to 10,000 feet; and whereas on Tonglo it forms an
immense tall tree, with long sparse branches and slender drooping
twigs, growing amongst gigantic magnolias and oaks, at Choongtam it
is small and rigid, and much resembling in appearance our
churchyard yew.&dagger; At 8000 feet the <i>Abies Brunoniana</i> is
found; a tree quite unknown further south; but neither the larch
nor the <i>Albies Smithiana</i> (Khutrow) accompanied it, they
being confined to still more northern regions.</p>

<p>I have seldom had occasion to allude to snakes, which are rare
and shy in most parts of the Himalaya; I, however, found an
extremely venomous one at Choongtam; a small black viper, a variety
of the cobra di capello,&Dagger;</p>

<p class="fnote">* I collected here ten kinds of rhododendron,
which, however, are not the social plants that they become at
greater elevations. Still, in the delicacy and beauty of their
flowers, four of them, perhaps, excel any others; they are, <i>R.
Aucklandii,</i> whose flowers are five inches and a half in
diameter; <i>R. Maddeni, R. Dalhousi&aelig;,</i> and <i>R.
Edgeworthii,</i> all white-flowered bushes, of which the two first
rise to the height of small trees.<br>
&dagger; The yew spreads east from Kashmir to the Assam Himalaya
and the Khasia mountains; and the Japan, Philippine Island,
Mexican, and other North American yews, belong to the same
widely-diffused species. In the Khasia (its most southern limit) it
is found as low as 5000 feet above the sea-level.<br>
&Dagger; Dr. Gray, to whom I am indebted for the following
information, assures me that this reptile is not specifically
distinct from the common Cobra of India; though all the mountain
specimens of it which he has examined retain the same small size
and dark colour. Of the other Sikkim reptiles which I procured
seven are <i>Colubrid&aelig;</i> and innocuous; five <i>
Crotalid&aelig;</i> are venomous, three of which are new species
belonging to the genera <i>Parias</i> and <i>Trimesurus.</i>
Lizards are not abundant, but I found at Choongtam a highly curious
one, <i>Plestiodon Sikkimensis,</i> Gray; a kind of Skink, whose
only allies are two North American congeners; and a species of <i>
Agama</i> (a chameleon-like lizard) which in many important points
more resembled an allied American genus than an Asiatic one. The
common immense earth-worm of Sikkim, <i>Ichthyophis glutinosus,</i>
is a native of the Khasia mountains, Singapore, Ceylon and Java. It
is a most remarkable fact, that whereas seven out of the twelve
Sikkim snakes are poisonous, the sixteen species I procured in the
Khasia mountains are innocuous.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 26">[ 26 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">which it replaces in the drier grassy parts of the
interior of Sikkim, the large cobra not inhabiting in the mountain
regions. Altogether I only collected about twelve species in
Sikkim, seven of which are venomous, and all are dreaded by the
Lepchas. An enormous hornet (<i>Vespa magnifica,</i> Sm.), nearly
two inches long, was here brought to me alive in a cleft-stick,
lolling out its great thorn-like sting, from which drops of a milky
poison distilled: its sting is said to produce fatal fevers in men
and cattle, which may very well be the case, judging from that of a
smaller kind, which left great pain in my hand for two days, while
a feeling of numbness remained in the arm for several weeks. It is
called Vok by the Lepchas, a common name for any bee: its
larv&aelig; are said to be greedily eaten, as are those of various
allied insects.</p>

<p>Choongtam boasts a profusion of beautiful insects, amongst which
the British swallow-tail butterfly (<i>Papilio Machaon</i>)
disports itself in company with magnificent black, gold, and
scarlet-winged butterflies, of the Trojan group, so typical of the
Indian tropics. At night my tent was filled with small
water-beetles (<i>Berosi</i>) that quickly put out the candle; and
with lovely moths came huge cockchafers (<i>Encerris
Griffithii</i>), and enormous and f&oelig;tid flying-bugs (of the
genus <i>Derecterix</i>), which bear great horns on the thorax. The
irritation of mosquito and midge bites, and the disgusting insects
that clung with spiny legs to the blankets of my tent and bed, were
often as effectual in banishing sleep, as were my anxious thoughts
regarding the future.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 27">[ 27 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The temple at Choongtam is a poor wooden building, but contains
some interesting drawings of Lhassa, with its extensive Lamaseries
and temples; they convey the idea of a town, gleaming, like Moscow,
with gilded and copper roofs; but on a nearer aspect it is found to
consist of a mass of stone houses, and large religious edifices
many stories high, the walls of which are regularly pierced with
small square ornamented windows.*</p>

<p>There is nothing remarkable in the geology of Choongtam: the
base of the hill consists of the clay and mica slates overlain by
gneiss, generally dipping to the eastward; in the latter are
granite veins, containing fine tourmalines. Actinolites are found
in some highly metamorphic gneisses, brought by landslips from the
neighbouring heights. The weather in May was cloudy and showery,
but the rain which fell was far less in amount than that at
Dorjiling: during the day the sun&rsquo;s power was great; but
though it rose between five and six a.m., it never appeared above
the lofty peaked mountains that girdle the valley till eight
a.m.</p>

<p class="fnote">* MM. Huc and Gabet&rsquo;s account of Lhassa is,
I do not doubt, excellent as to particulars; but the trees which
they describe as magnificent, and girdling the city, have uniformly
been represented to me as poor stunted willows, apricots, poplars,
and walnuts, confined to the gardens of the rich. No doubt the
impression left by these objects on the minds of travellers from
tree-less Tartary, and of Sikkimites reared amidst stupendous
forests, must be widely different. The information concerning
Lhassa collected by Timkowski, &ldquo;Travels of the Russian
Mission to China&rdquo; (in 1821) is greatly exaggerated, though
containing much that is true and curious. The dyke to protect the
city from inundations I never heard of; but there is a current
story in Sikkim that Lhassa is built in a lake-bed, which was dried
up by a miracle of the Lamas, and that in heavy rain the earth
trembles, and the waters bubble through the soil: a Dorjiling
rain-fall, I have been assured, would wash away the whole city.
Ermann (Travels in Siberia, i., p. 186), mentions a town (Klinchi,
near Perm), thus built over subterraneous springs, and in constant
danger of being washed away. MM. Huc and Gabet allude to the same
tradition under another form. They say that the natives of the
banks of the Koko-nor affirm that the waters of that lake once
occupied a subterranean position beneath Lhassa, and that the
waters sapped the foundations of the temples as soon as they were
built, till withdrawn by supernatural agency.</p>
