<br>
 

<p class="first">Continuing the ascent of Tonglo, we left
cultivation and the poor groves of peaches at 4000 to 5000 feet
(and this on the eastern exposure, which is by far the sunniest),
the average height which agriculture reaches in Sikkim.</p>

<p>Above Simonbong, the path up Tonglo is little frequented: it is
one of the many routes between Nepal and Sikkim, which cross the
Singalelah spur of Kinchinjunga at various elevations between 7000
and 15,000 feet. As usual, the track runs along ridges, wherever
these are to be found, very steep, and narrow at the top, through
deep humid forests of oaks and Magnolias, many laurels, both 1 <i>
Tetranthera</i> and <i>Cinnamomum,</i> one species of the latter
ascending to 8,500 feet, and one of <i>Tetranthera</i> to 9000.
Chesnut and walnut here appeared, with some leguminous trees, which
however did not ascend to 6000 feet. Scarlet flowers of <i>
Vaccinium serpens,</i> an epiphytical species, were strewed about,
and the great blossoms of <i>Rhododendron Dalhousi&aelig;</i> and
of a Magnolia (<i>Talaunaa Hodgsoni</i>) lay together on the
ground. The latter forms a large tree,</p>

<br>
 

<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 163">[ 163 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">with very dense foliage, and deep shining green
leaves, a foot to eighteen inches long. Most of its flowers drop
unexpanded from the tree, and diffuse a very aromatic smell; they
are nearly as large as the fist, the outer petals purple, the inner
pure white.</p>

<p>Heavy rain came on at 3 p.m., obliging us to take insufficient
shelter under the trees, and finally to seek the nearest
camping-ground. For this purpose we ascended to a spring, called
Simsibong, at an elevation of 6000 feet. The narrowness of the
ridge prevented our pitching the tent, small as it was; but the
Lepchas rapidly constructed a house, and thatched it with bamboo
and the broad leaves of the wild plantain. A table was then raised
in the middle, of four posts and as many cross pieces of wood,
lashed with strips of bamboo. Across these, pieces of bamboo were
laid, ingeniously flattened, by selecting cylinders, crimping them
all round, and then slitting each down one side, so that it opens
into a flat slab. Similar but longer and lower erections, one on
each side the table, formed bed or chair; and in one hour, half a
dozen men, with only long knives and active hands, had provided us
with a tolerably water-tight furnished house. A thick flooring of
bamboo leaves kept the feet dry, and a screen of that and other
foliage all round rendered the habitation tolerably warm.</p>

<p>At this elevation we found great scandent trees twisting around
the trunks of others, and strangling them: the latter gradually
decay, leaving the sheath of climbers as one of the most remarkable
vegetable phenomena of these mountains. These climbers belong to
several orders, and may be roughly classified in two
groups.&mdash;(1.) Those whose sterns merely twine, and by
constricting certain parts of their support, induce
death.&mdash;(2.) Those which form a</p>

"Clasping roots of Wightia"></center>

<p class="first">network round the trunk, by the coalescence of
their lateral branches and aerial roots, etc.: these wholly envelop
and often conceal the tree they enclose, whose branches appear
rising far above those of its destroyer. To the first of these
groups belong many natural orders, of which the most prominent
are&mdash;<i>Leguminos&aelig;,</i> ivies, hydrangea, vines, <i>
Pothos,</i> etc. The inosculating ones are almost all figs and</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 165">[ 165 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first"><i>Wightia</i>: the latter is the most remarkable,
and I add a cut of its grasping roots, sketched at our
encampment.</p>

<p>Except for the occasional hooting of an owl, the night was
profoundly still during several hours after dark&mdash;the cicadas
at this season not ascending so high on the mountain. A dense mist
shrouded every thing, and the rain pattered on the leaves of our
hut. At midnight a tree-frog (&ldquo;Simook,&rdquo; Lepcha) broke
the silence with his curious metallic clack, and others quickly
joined the chorus, keeping up their strange music till morning.
Like many Batrachians, this has a voice singularly unlike that of
any other organised creature. The cries of beasts, birds, and
insects are all explicable to our senses, and we can recognise most
of them as belonging to such or such an order of animal; but the
voices of many frogs are like nothing else, and allied species
utter totally dissimilar noises. In some, as this, the sound is
like the concussion of metals; in others, of the vibration of wires
or cords; anything but the natural effects of lungs, larynx, and
muscles.*</p>

<p><i>May 21.</i>&mdash;Early this morning we proceeded upwards,
our prospect more gloomy than ever. The path, which still lay up
steep ridges, was very slippery, owing to the rain upon the clayey
soil, and was only passable from the hold afforded by interlacing
roots of trees. At 8000 feet, some enormous detached masses of
micaceous gneiss rose abruptly from the ridge, they were covered
with mosses and ferns, and from their summit, 7000 feet, a good
view of the surrounding vegetation is obtained. The mast of the
forest is formed of:&mdash;(1) Three species of oak, of which <i>Q.
annulata ?</i> with immense lamellated acorns, and leaves</p>

<p class="fnote">* A very common Tasmanian species utters a sound
that appears to ring in an underground vaulted chamber, beneath the
feet.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 166">[ 166 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">sixteen inches long, is the tallest and the most
abundant.&mdash;(2) Chesnut.&mdash;(3) <i>Laurine&aelig;</i> of
several species, all beautiful forest-trees, straight-holed, and
umbrageous above.&mdash;(4) Magnolias.*&mdash;(5) Arborescent
rhododendrons, which commence here with the <i>R. arboreum.</i> At
8000 and 9000 feet, a considerable change is found in the
vegetation; the gigantic purple <i>Magnolia Campbellii</i>
replacing the white; chesnut disappears, and several laurels: other
kinds of maple are seen, with <i>Rhododendron argenteum,</i> and
<i>Stauntonia,</i> a handsome climber, which has beautiful pendent
clusters of lilac blossoms.</p>

<p>At 9000 feet we arrived on a long flat covered with lofty trees,
chiefly purple magnolias, with a few oaks, great <i>Pyri</i> and
two rhododendrons, thirty to forty feet high (<i>R. barbatum,</i>
and <i>R. arboreum,</i> var. <i>roseum</i>): <i>Skimmia</i> and <i>
Symplocos</i> were the common shrubs. A beautiful orchid with
purple flowers (<i>C&aelig;logyne Wallichii</i>) grew on the trunks
of all the great trees, attaining a higher elevation than most
other epiphytical species, for I have seen it at 10,000 feet.</p>

<p>A large tick infests the small bamboo, and a more hateful insect
I never encountered. The traveller cannot avoid these insects
coming on his person (sometimes in great numbers) as he brushes
through the forest; they get inside his dress, and insert the
proboscis deeply without pain. Buried head and shoulders, and
retained by a barbed lancet, the tick is only to be extracted by
force, which is very painful. I</p>

<p class="fnote">* Other trees were <i>Pyrus, Saurauja</i> (both an
erect and climbing species), <i>Olea,</i> cherry, birch, alder,
several maples, <i>Hydrangea,</i> one species of fig, holly, and
several <i>Araliaceous</i> trees. Many species of <i>
Magnoliace&aelig;</i> (including the genera <i>Magnolia,
Michelia,</i> and <i>Talauma</i>) are found in Sikkim: <i>Magnolia
Campbellii,</i> of 10,000 feet, is the most superb species known.
In books on botanical geography, the magnolias are considered as
most abounding in North America, east of the Rocky Mountains; but
this is a great mistake, the Indian mountains and islands being the
centre of this natural order.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 167">[ 167 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">have devised many tortures, mechanical and
chemical, to induce these disgusting intruders to withdraw the
proboscis, but in vain. Leeches* also swarm below 7000 feet; a
small black species above 3000 feet, and a large yellow-brown
solitary one below that elevation.</p>

<p>Our ascent to the summit was by the bed of a watercourse, now a
roaring torrent, from the heavy and incessant rain. A small <i>
Anagallis</i> (like <i>tenella</i>), and a beautiful purple
primrose, grew by its bank. The top of the mountain is another flat
ridge, with depressions and broad pools. The number of additional
species of plants found here was great, and all betokened a rapid
approach to the alpine region of the Himalaya. In order of
prevalence the trees were,&mdash;the scarlet <i>Rhododendron
arboreum</i> and <i>barbatum,</i> as large bushy trees, both loaded
with beautiful flowers and luxuriant foliage; <i>R. Falconeri,</i>
in point of foliage the most superb of all the Himalayan species,
with trunks thirty feet high, and branches bearing at their ends
only leaves eighteen inches long: these are deep green above, and
covered beneath with a rich brown down. Next in abundance to these
were shrubs of <i>Skimmia Laureola,</i>&dagger; <i>Symplocos,</i>
and Hydrangea; and there were still a few purple magnolias, very
large <i>Pyri,</i> like mountain ash, and the common English</p>

<p class="fnote">* I cannot but think that the extraordinary
abundance of these <i>Anelides</i> in Sikkim may cause the death of
many animals. Some marked murrains have followed very wet seasons,
when the leeches appear in incredible numbers; and the disease in
the cattle, described to me by the Lepchas as in the stomach, in no
way differs from what leeches would produce. It is a well-known
fact, that these creatures have lived for days in the fauces,
nares, and stomachs of the human subject, causing dreadful
sufferings, and death. I have seen the cattle feeding in places
where the leeches so abounded, that fifty or sixty were frequently
together on my ankles; and ponies are almost maddened by their
biting the fetlocks.<br>
&dagger; This plant has been lately introduced into English
gardens, from the north-west Himalaya, and is greatly admired for
its aromatic, evergreen foliage, and clusters of scarlet berries.
It is a curious fact, that this plant never bears scarlet berries
in Sikkim, apparently owing to the want of sun; the fruit ripens,
but is of a greenish-red or purplish colour.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 168">[ 168 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">yew, eighteen feet in circumference, the red bark
of which is used as a dye, and for staining the foreheads of
Brahmins in Nepal. An erect white-flowered rose (<i>R. sericea,</i>
the only species occurring in Southern Sikkim) was very abundant:
its numerous inodorous flowers are pendent, apparent as a
protection from the rain; and it is remarkable as being the only
species having four petals instead of five.</p>

<p>A currant was common, always growing epiphytically on the trunks
of large trees. Two or three species of Berberry, a cherry,
Andromeda, <i>Daphne,</i> and maple, nearly complete, I think, the
list of woody plants. Amongst the herbs were many of great
interest, as a rhubarb, and <i>Aconitum palmatum,</i> which yields
one of the celebrated &ldquo;Bikh&rdquo; poisons.* Of European
genera I found <i>Thalictrum, Anemone, Fumaria,</i> violets, <i>
Stellaria, Hypericum,</i> two geraniums, balsams, <i>Epilobium,
Potentilla, Paris</i> and <i>Convallari&aelig;,</i> one of the
latter has verticillate leaves, and its root also called
&ldquo;bikh,&rdquo; is considered a very virulent poison.</p>

<p>Still, the absence or rarity at this elevation of several very
large natural families,&dagger; which have numerous representatives
at and much below the same level in the inner ranges, and on the
outer of the Western Himalaya, indicate a certain peculiarity in
Sikkim. On the other hand, certain tropical genera are more
abundant in the temperate zone of the Sikkim mountains, and ascend
much higher there than in the Western Himalaya: of this fact I have
cited conspicuous examples in the palms, plantains, and tree-ferns.
This</p>

<p class="fnote">* &ldquo;Bikh&rdquo; is yielded by various <i>
Aconita.</i> All the Sikkim kinds are called &ldquo;gniong&rdquo;
by Lepchas and Bhoteeas, who do not distinguish them. The <i>A.
Napellus</i> is abundant in the north-west Himalaya, and is perhaps
as virulent a Bikh as any species.<br>
 &dagger; <i>Ranunculace&aelig;, Fumari&aelig;, Crucifer&aelig;,
Alsine&aelig;, Geranic&aelig;, Leguminos&aelig;, Potentilla,
Epilobium, Crassulace&aelig;, Saxifrage&aelig;, Umbellifer&aelig;,
Lonicera, Valeriane&aelig;, Dipsace&aelig;,</i> various genera of
<i>Composit&aelig;, Campanulace&aelig;, Lobeliace&aelig;,
Gentiane&aelig;, Boragine&aelig;, Scrophularine&aelig;,
Primulace&aelig;, Gramine&aelig;.</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 169">[ 169 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">ascent and prevalence of tropical species is due
to the humidity and equability of the climate in this temperate
zone, and is, perhaps, the direct consequence of these conditions.
An application of the same laws accounts for the extension of
similar features far beyond the tropical limit in the Southern
Ocean, where various natural orders, which do not cross the 30th
and 40th parallels of N. latitude, are extended to the 55th of S.
latitude, and found in Tasmania, New Zealand, the so-called
Antarctic Islands south of that group, and at Cape Horn itself.</p>

<p>The rarity of Pines is perhaps the most curious feature in the
botany of Tonglo, and on the outer ranges of Sikkim; for, between
the level of 2,500 feet (the upper limit of <i>P. longifolia</i>)
and 10,000 feet (that of the <i>Taxus</i>), there is no coniferous
tree whatever in Southern Sikkim.</p>

<p>We encamped amongst Rhododendrons, on a spongy soil of black
vegetable matter, so oozy, that it was difficult to keep the feet
dry. The rain poured in torrents all the evening, and with the
calm, and the wetness of the wood, prevented our enjoying a fire.
Except a transient view into Nepal, a few miles west of us, nothing
was to be seen, the whole mountain being wrapped in dense masses of
vapour. Gusts of wind, not felt in the forest, whistled through the
gnarled and naked tree-tops; and though the temperature was
50&deg;, this wind produced cold to the feelings. Our poor Lepchas
were miserably off, but always happy: under four posts and a
bamboo-leaf thatch, with no covering but a single thin cotton
garment, they crouched on the sodden turf, joking with the Hindoos
of our party, who, though supplied with good clothing and shelter,
were doleful companions.</p>

<p>I made a shed for my instruments under a tree; Mr. Barnes, ever
active and ready, floored the tent with logs</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 170">[ 170 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">of wood, and I laid a &ldquo;corduroy road&rdquo;
of the same to my little observatory.</p>

<p>During the night the rain did not abate; and the tent-roof
leaked in such torrents, that we had to throw pieces of wax-cloth
over our shoulders as we lay in bed. There was no improvement
whatever in the weather on the following morning. Two of the
Hindoos had crawled into the tent during the night, attacked with
fever and ague.* The tent being too sodden to be carried, we had to
remain where we were, and with abundance of novelty in the botany
around, I found no difficulty in getting through the day. Observing
the track of sheep, we sent two Lepchas to follow them, who
returned at night from some miles west in Nepal, bringing two. The
shepherds were Geroongs of Nepal, who were grazing their flocks on
a grassy mountain top, from which the woods had been cleared,
probably by fire. The mutton was a great boon to the Lepchas, but
the Hindoos would not touch it, and several more sickening during
the day, we had the tent most uncomfortably full.</p>

<p>During the whole of the 22nd, from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., the
thermometer never varied 6&middot;5&deg;, ranging from 47&middot;5
in the morning to 54&deg;, its maximum, at 1 p.m., and 50&middot;75
at night. At seven the following morning it was the same. One, sunk
two feet six inches in mould and clay, stood constantly at
50&middot;75. The dew-point was always below the temperature, at
which I was surprised, for more drenching weather could not well
be. The mean dew-point was 50&middot;25, and consequent humidity,
0&middot;973.</p>

<p class="fnote">* It is a remarkable fact, that both the natives
of the plains, under many circumstances, and the Lepchas when
suffering from protracted cold and wet, take fever and ague in
sharp attacks. The disease is wholly unknown amongst Europeans
residing above 4000 feet, similar exposure in whom brings on
rheumatism and cold.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 171">[ 171 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These observations, and those of the barometer,
were taken 60 feet below the summit, to which I moved the
instruments on the morning of the 23rd. At a much more exposed spot
the results would no doubt have been different, for a thermometer,
there sunk to the same depth as that below, stood at 49&middot;75
(or one degree colder than 60 feet lower down). My barometrical
observations, taken simultaneously with those of Calcutta, give the
height of Tonglo, 10,078&middot;3 feet; Colonel Waugh&rsquo;s, by
trigonometry, 10,079&middot;4 feet,&mdash;a remarkable and unusual
coincidence.</p>

<p><i>May 23.</i>&mdash;We spent a few hours of alternate fog and
sunshine on the top of the mountain, vainly hoping for the most
modest view; our inability to obtain it was extremely
disappointing, for the mountain commands a superb prospect, which I
enjoyed fully in the following November, from a spot a few miles
further west. The air, which was always foggy, was alternately
cooled and heated, as it blew over the trees, or the open space we
occupied; sometimes varying 5&deg; and 6&deg; in a quarter of an
hour.</p>

<p>Having partially dried the tent in the wind, we commenced the
descent, which owing to the late torrents of rain, was most
fatiguing and slippery; it again commenced to drizzle at noon, nor
was it till we had descended to 6000 feet that we emerged from the
region of clouds. By dark we arrived at Simonbong, having descended
5000 feet, at the rate of 1000 feet an hour; and were kindly
received by the Lama, who gave us his temple for the accommodation
of the whole party. We were surprised at this, both because the
Sikkim authorities had represented the Lamas as very averse to
Europeans, and because he might well have hesitated before
admitting a promiscuous horde of thirty people into a sacred
building, where the little valuables on the altar, etc., were</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 172">[ 172 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">quite at our disposal. A better tribute could not
well have been paid to the honesty of my Lepcha followers. Our host
only begged us not to disturb his people, nor to allow the Hindoos
of our party to smoke inside.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images/fig14.jpg" width="282" height="206" alt=
"Simonbong Temple"></center>

<p>Simonbong is one of the smallest and poorest Gumpas, or temples,
in Sikkim: unlike the better class, it is built of wood only. It
consisted of one large room, with small sliding shutter windows,
raised on a stone foundation, and roofed with shingles of wood;
opposite the door a wooden altar was placed, rudely chequered with
black, white, and red; to the right and left were shelves, with a
few Tibetan books, wrapped in silk; a model of Symbonath temple in
Nepal, a praying-cylinder,* and some implements for common
purposes, bags of juniper, English wine-bottles and</p>

<p class="fnote">* It consisted of a leathern cylinder placed
upright in a frame; a projecting piece of iron strikes a little
bell at each revolution, the revolution being caused by an elbowed
axle and string. Within the cylinder are deposited written prayers,
and whoever pulls the string properly is considered to have
repeated his prayers as often as the bell rings. Representations of
these implements will be found in other parts of these volumes.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 173">[ 173 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">glasses, with tufts of <i>Abies Webbiana,</i>
rhododendron flowers, and peacock&rsquo;s feathers, besides various
trifles, clay ornaments and offerings, and little Hindoo idols. On
the altar were ranged seven little brass cups, full of water; a
large conch shell, carved with the sacred lotus; a brass jug from
Lhassa, of beautiful design, and a human thigh-bone, hollow, and
perforated through both condyles.*</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images/fig15.jpg" width="168" height="127" alt=
"rumpet made of a human thigh-bone"></center>

<p>Facing the altar was a bench and a chair, and on one side a huge
tambourine, with two curved iron drum-sticks. The bench was covered
with bells, handsomely carved with idols, and censers with
juniper-ashes; and on it lay the <i>dorge,</i> or double-headed
thunderbolt, which the Lama holds in his hand during service. Of
all these articles, the human thigh-bone is by much the most
curious; it is very often that of a Lama, and is valuable in
proportion to its length.&dagger; As, however, the Sikkim Lamas are
burned, the relics are generally procured from Tibet, where the</p>

<p class="fnote">* To these are often added a double-headed rattle,
or small drum, formed of two crowns of human skulls, cemented back
to back; each face is then covered with parchment, and encloses
some pebbles. Sometimes this instrument is provided with a
handle.<br>
&dagger; It is reported at Dorjiling, that one of the first
Europeans buried at this station, being a tall man, was disinterred
by the resurrectionist Bhoteeas for his <i>trumpet-bones.</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 174">[ 174 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">corpses are cut in pieces and thrown to the kites,
or into the water.</p>

<p>Two boys usually reside in the temple, and their beds were given
up to us, which being only rough planks laid on the floor, proved
clean in one sense, but contrasted badly with the springy couch of
bamboo the Lepcha makes, which renders carrying a mattress or aught
but blankets superfluous.</p>

<p><i>May 24.</i>&mdash;We were awakened at daylight by the
discordant orisons of the Lama; these commenced by the boys beating
the great tambourine, then blowing the conch-shells, and finally
the trumpets and thigh-bone. Shortly the Lama entered, clad in
scarlet, shorn and barefooted, wearing a small red silk mitre, a
loose gown girt round the middle, and an under-garment of
questionable colour, possibly once purple. He walked along, slowly
muttering his prayers, to the end of the apartment, whence he took
a brass bell and dorge, and, sitting down cross-legged, commenced
matins, counting his beads, or ringing the bell, and uttering most
dismal prayers. After various disposals of the cups, a larger bell
was violently rung for some minutes, himself snapping his fingers
and uttering most unearthly sounds. Finally, incense was brought,
of charcoal with juniper-sprigs; it was swung about, and concluded
the morning service to our great relief, for the noises were quite
intolerable. Fervid as the devotions appeared, to judge by their
intonation, I fear the Lama felt more curious about us than was
proper under the circumstances; and when I tried to sketch him, his
excitement knew no bounds; he fairly turned round on the settee,
and, continuing his prayers and bell-accompaniment, appeared to be
exorcising me, or some spirit within me.</p>

<p>After breakfast the Lama came to visit us, bringing rice,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 175">[ 175 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">a few vegetables, and a large bamboo-work bowl,
thickly varnished with india-rubber, and waterproof, containing
half-fermented millet. This mixture, called <i>Murwa,</i> is
invariably offered to the traveller, either in the state of
fermented grain, or more commonly in a bamboo jug, filled quite up
with warm water; when the fluid, sucked through a reed, affords a
refreshing drink. He gratefully accepted a few rupees and trifles
which we had to spare.</p>

<p>Leaving Simonbong, we descended to the Little Rungeet, where the
heat of the valley was very great; 80&deg; at noon, and that of the
stream 69&deg;; the latter was an agreeable temperature for the
coolies, who plunged, teeming with perspiration, into the water,
catching fish with their hands. We reached Dorjiling late in the
evening, again drenched with rain; our people, Hindoo and Lepcha,
imprudently remaining for the night in the valley. Owing probably
as much to the great exposure they had lately gone through, as to
the sudden transition from a mean temperature of 50&deg; in a
bracing wind, to a hot close jungly valley at 75&deg;, no less than
