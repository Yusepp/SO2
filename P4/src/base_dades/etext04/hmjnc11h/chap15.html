<br>
<p class="first">I left Yoksun on an expedition to Kinchinjunga on
the 7th of January. It was evident that at this season I could not
attain any height; but I was most anxious to reach the lower limit
of that mass of perpetual snow which descends in one continuous
sweep from 28,000 to 15,000 feet, and radiates from the summit of
Kinchin, along every spur and shoulder for ten to fifteen miles,
towards each point of the compass.</p>

<p>The route lay for the first mile over the Yoksun flat, and then
wound along the almost precipitous east flank of the Ratong, 1000
feet above its bed, leading through thick forest. It was often
difficult, crossing torrents by calms of bamboo, and leading up
precipices by notched poles and roots of trees. I wondered what
could have induced the frequenting of such a route to Nepal, when
there were so many better ones over Singalelah, till I found from
my guide that he had habitually smuggled salt over this pass to
avoid the oppressive duty levelled by the Dewan on all imports from
Tibet by the eastern passes: he further told</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 341">[ 341 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">me that it took five days to reach Yalloong in
Nepal front Yoksun, on the third of which the Kanglanamo pass is
crossed, which is open from April to November, but is always
heavily snowed. Owing to this duty, and the remoteness of the
eastern passes, the people on the west side of the Great Rungeet
were compelled to pay an enormous sum for salt; and the Lamas of
Changachelling and Pemiongchi petitioned Dr. Campbell to use his
influence with the Nepal Court to have the Kanglanamo pass
re-opened, and the power of trading with the Tibetans of
Wallanchoon, Yangma, and Kambachen, restored to them: the pass
having been closed since the Nepalese war, to prevent the Sikkim
people from kidnapping children and slaves, as was alleged to be
their custom.*</p>

<p>We passed some immense landslips, which had swept the forest
into the torrent, and exposed white banks of angular detritus of
gneiss and granite: we crossed one 200 yards long, by a narrow
treacherous path, on a slope of 35&deg;: the subjacent gneiss was
nearly vertical, striking north-east. We camped at 6,670 feet,
amongst a vegetation I little expected to find so close to the
snows of Kinchin; it consisted of oak, maple, birch, laurel,
rhododendron, white <i>Daphne,</i> jessamine, <i>Arum, Begonia,
Cyrtandrace&aelig;,</i> pepper, fig, <i>Menispermum,</i> wild
cinnamon, <i>Scitamine&aelig;,</i> several epiphytic orchids,
vines, and ferns in great abundance.</p>

<p>On the following day, I proceeded north-west up the Ratong
river, here a furious torrent; which we crossed,</p>

<p class="fnote">* An accusation in which there was probably some
truth; for the Sikkim Dingpun, who guided Dr. Campbell and myself
to Mainom, Tassiding, etc., since kidnapped, or caused to be
abducted, a girl of Brahmin parents, from the Mai valley of Nepal,
a transaction which cost him some 300 rupees. The Nepal Durbar was
naturally furious, the more so as the Dingpun had no caste, and was
therefore abhorred by all Brahmins. Restitution was demanded
through Dr. Campbell, who caused the incensed Dingpun to give up
his paramour and her jewels. He vowed vengeance against Dr.
Campbell, and found means to gratify it, as I shall hereafter
show.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 342">[ 342 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and then ascended a very steep mountain called
&ldquo;Mon Lepcha.&rdquo; Immense detached masses of gneiss, full
of coarse garnets, lay on the slope, some of which were curiously
marked with a series of deep holes, large enough to put one&rsquo;s
fist in, and said to be the footprints of the sacred cow. They
appeared to me to have been caused by the roots of trees, which
spread over the rocks in these humid regions, and wear channels in
the hardest material, especially when they follow the direction of
its lamination or stratification.</p>

<p>I encamped at a place called Buckeem (alt. 8,650 ft.), in a
forest of <i>Abies Brunoniana</i> and <i>Webbiana,</i> yew, oak,
various rhododendrons, and small bamboo. Snow lay in patches at
8000 feet, and the night was cold and clear. On the following
morning I continued the ascent, alternately up steeps and along
perfectly level shelves, on which were occasionally frozen pools,
surrounded with dwarf juniper and rhododendrons. Across one I
observed the track of a yak in the snow; it presented two ridges,
probably from the long hair of this animal, which trails on the
ground, sweeping the snow from the centre of its path. At 11,000
feet the snow lay deep and soft in the woods of silver fir, and the
coolies waded through it with difficulty.</p>

<p>Enormous fractured boulders of gneiss were frequent over the
whole of Mon Lepcha, from 7000 to 11,000 feet: they were of the
same material as the rock <i>in situ,</i> and as unaccountable in
their origin as the loose blocks on Dorjiling and Sinchul spurs at
similar elevations, often cresting narrow ridges. I measured one
angular detached block, forty feet high, resting on a steep narrow
shoulder of the spur, in a position to which it was impossible it
could have rolled; and it is equally difficult to suppose that
glacial ice deposited it 4000 feet above the bottom of the
gorge,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 343">[ 343 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">except we conclude the valley to have been filled
with ice to that depth. A glance at the map will show that Mon
Lepcha is remarkably situated, opposite the face of Kinchinjunga,
and at the great bend of the Ratong. Had that valley ever been
filled with water during a glacial period, Mon Lepcha would have
formed a promontory, and many floating bergs from Kinchin would
have been stranded on its flank: but I nowhere observed these rocks
to be of so fine a granite as I believe the upper rocks of Kinchin
to be, and I consequently cannot advance even that far-fetched
solution with much plausibility.</p>

<p>As I ascended, the rocks became more granitic, with large
crystals of mica. The summit was another broad bare flat, elevated
13,080 feet, and fringed by a copse of rose, berberry, and very
alpine rhododendrons: the Himalayan heather (<i>Adromeda
fastigiata</i>) grew abundantly here, affording us good fuel.</p>

<p>The toilsome ascent through the soft snow and brushwood delayed
the coolies, who scarcely accomplished five miles in the day. Some
of them having come up by dark, I prepared to camp on the
mountain-top, strewing thick masses of <i>Andromeda</i> and moss
(which latter hung in great tufts from the bushes) on the snow; my
blankets bad not arrived, but there was no prospect of a
snow-storm.</p>

<p>The sun was powerful when I reached the summit, and I was so
warm that I walked about barefoot on the frozen snow without
inconvenience, preferring it to continuing in wet stockings: the
temperature at the time was 29&middot;5&deg;, with a brisk
south-east moist wind, and the dew point 22&middot;8&deg;.</p>

<p>The night was magnificent, brilliant starlight, with a pale mist
over the mountains: the thermometer fell to 15&middot;5&deg; at
7.30 p.m., and one laid upon wood with its bulb freely exposed,
sank to 7&middot;5&deg;: the snow sparkled with broad</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 344">[ 344 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">flakes of hoar-frost in the full moon, which was
so bright, that I recorded my observations by its light. Owing to
the extreme cold of radiation, I passed a very uncomfortable night.
The minimum thermometer fell to 1&deg; in shade.* The sky was
clear; and every rock, leaf, twig, blade of grass, and the snow
itself, were covered with broad rhomboidal plates of hoar-frost,
nearly one-third of an inch across: while the metal scale of the
thermometer instantaneously blistered my tongue. As the sun rose,
the light reflected from these myriads of facets had a splendid
effect.</p>

<p>Before sunrise the atmosphere was still, and all but cloudless.
To the south-east were visible the plains of India, at least 140
miles distant; where, as usual, horizontal layers of leaden purple
vapour obscured the horizon: behind these the sun rose
majestically, instantly dispersing them, while a thin haze spread
over all the intervening mountains, from its slanting beams
reaching me through otherwise imperceptible vapours: these, as the
sun mounted higher, again became invisible, though still giving
that transparency to the atmosphere and brilliant definition of the
distances, so characteristic of a damp, yet clear day.</p>

<p>Mon Lepcha commands a most extensive view of Sikkim, southward
to Dorjiling. At my feet lay the great and profound valley of the
Ratong, a dark gulf of vegetation. Looking northward, the eye
followed that river to the summit of Kinchinjunga (distant eighteen
miles), which fronts the beholder as Mont Blanc does when seen from
the mountains on the opposite side of the valley of Chamouni. To
the east are the immense precipices and</p>

<p class="fnote">* At sunrise the temperature was 11&middot;5&deg;;
that of grass, cleared on the previous day from snow, and exposed
to the sky, 6&middot;5&deg;; that on wool, 2&middot;2&deg;; and
that on the surface of the snow, 0&middot;7&deg;.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 345">[ 345 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">glaciers of Pundim, and on the west those of
Kubra, forming great supporters to the stupendous mountain between
them. Mon Lepcha itself is a spur running south-east from the Kubra
shoulder: it is very open, and covered with rounded hills for
several miles further north, terminating in a conspicuous conical
black hummock* called Gubroo, of 15,000 feet elevation, which
presents a black cliff to the south.</p>

<p>Kinchinjunga rises in three heads, of nearly equal
height,&dagger; which form a line running north-west. It exposes
many white or grey rocks, bare of snow, and disposed in
strata&Dagger; sloping to the west; the colour of all which above
20,000 feet, and the rounded knobbed form of the summit, suggest a
granitic formation. Lofty snowed ridges project from Kubra into the
Ratong valley, presenting black precipices of stratified rocks to
the southward. Pundim has a very grand appearance; being eight
miles distant, and nearly 9000 feet above Mon Lepcha, it subtends
an angle of 12&deg;; while Kinchin top, though 15,000 feet higher
than Mon Lepcha, being eighteen miles distant, rises only 9&deg; 30
minutes above the true horizon: these angular heights are too small
to give much grandeur and</p>

<p class="fnote">* This I have beau told is the true Kubra; and the
great snowy mountain behind it, which I here, in conformity with
the Dorjiling nomenclature, call Kubra, has no name, being
considered a part of Kinchin.<br>
&dagger; The eastern and western tops, are respectively 27,826 and
28,177 feet above the level of the sea.<br>
&Dagger; I am aware that the word strata is inappropriate here; the
appearance of stratification or bedding, if it indicate any
structure of the rock, being, I cannot doubt, due to that action
which gives parallel cleavage planes to granite in many parts of
the world, and to which the so-called lamination or foliation of
slate and gneiss is supposed by many geologists to be due. It is
not usual to find this structure so uniformly and conspicuously
developed through large masses of granite, as it appeared to me to
be on the sides of Kinchinjunga and on the top of Junnoo, as seen
from the Choonjerma pass (<a href="images/plate5.jpg">p.264,
plate</a>); but it is sometimes very conspicuous, and nowhere more
than in the descent of the Grimsel towards Meyringen, where the
granite on the east flank of that magnificent gorge seems cleft
into parallel nearly vertical strata.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 346">[ 346 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">apparent elevation to mountains, however lofty;
nor would they do so in this case, were it not that the Ratong
valley which intervenes, is seen to be several thousand feet lower,
and many degrees below the real horizon.</p>

<br>
 

<center><img src="images/fig40.jpg" width="294" height="180" alt=
"Kinchinjunga and Pundim from Mon Lepcha"></center>

<p>Pundim has a tremendous precipice to the south, which, to judge
from its bareness of snow, must be nearly perpendicular; and it
presented a superb geological section. The height of this precipice
I found by angles with a pocket sextant to be upwards of 3,400
feet, and that of its top to be 21,300 above the sea, and
consequently only 715 feet less than that of the summit of Pundim
itself (which is 22,015 feet). This cliff is of black stratified
rocks, sloping to the west, and probably striking north-west;
permeated from top to bottom by veins of white granite, disposed in
zigzag lines, which produce a contortion of the gneiss, and give it
a marbled appearance. The same structure may be seen in miniature
on the transported blocks which abound in the Sikkim rivers; where
veins of finely grained granite are forced in</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 347">[ 347 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">all directions through the gneiss, and form
parallel seams or beds between the lamin&aelig; of that rock,
united by transverse seams, and crumpling up the gneiss itself,
like the crushed leaves of a book. The summit of Pundim itself is
all of white rock, rounded in shape, and forming a cap to the
gneiss, which weathers into precipices.</p>

<p>A succession of ridges, 14,000 to 18,000 feet high, presented a
line of precipices running south from Pundim for several miles:
immense granite veins are exposed on their surfaces, and they are
capped by stratified rocks, sloping to the east, and apparently
striking to the north-west, which, being black, contrast strongly
with the white granite beneath them: these ridges, instead of being
round-topped, are broken into splintered crags, behind which rises
the beautiful conical peak of Nursing, 19,139 feet above the sea,
eight miles distant, and subtending an angle of 8&deg;
30&prime;.</p>

<p>At the foot of these precipices was a very conspicuous series of
lofty moraines, round whose bases the Ratong wound; these appeared
of much the same height, rising several hundred feet above the
valley: they were comparatively level-topped, and had steep
shelving rounded sides.</p>

<p>I have been thus particular in describing the upper Ratong
valley, because it drains the south face of the loftiest mountain
on the globe; and I have introduced angular heights, and been
precise in my details, because the vagueness with which all terms
are usually applied to the apparent altitude and steepness of
mountains and precipices, is apt to give false impressions. It is
essential to attend to such points where scenery of real interest
and importance is to be described. It is customary to speak of
peaks as towering in the air, which yet subtend an angle of very
few degrees; of almost precipitous ascents,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 348">[ 348 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">which, when measured, are found to be slopes of
18&deg; or 20&deg;; and of cliffs as steep and stupendous, which
are inclined at a very moderate angle.</p>

<p>The effect of perspective is as often to deceive in details as
to give truth to general impressions; and those accessories are
sometimes wanting in nature, which, when supplied by art, give
truth to the landscape. Thus, a streak of clouds adds height to a
peak which should appear lofty, but which scarcely rises above the
true horizon; and a belt of mist will sunder two snowy mountains
which, though at very different distances, for want of a play of
light and shade on their dazzling surfaces, and from the extreme
transparency of the air in lofty regions, appear to be at the same
distance from the observer.</p>

<p>The view to the southward from Mon Lepcha, including the country
between the sea-like plains of India and the loftiest mountain on
the globe, is very grand, and neither wanting in variety nor in
beauty. From the deep valleys choked with tropical luxuriance to
the scanty yak pasturage on the heights above, seems but a step at
the first <i>coup-d&rsquo;oceil,</i> but resolves itself on a
closer inspection into five belts: 1, palm and plantain; 2, oak and
laurel; 3, pine; 4, rhododendron and grass; and 5, rock and snow.
From the bed of the Ratong, in which grow palms with screw-pine and
plantain, it is only seven miles in a direct line to the perpetual
ice. From the plains of India, or outer Himalaya, one may behold
snowy peaks rise in the distance behind a foreground of tropical
forest; here, on the contrary, all the intermediate phases of
vegetation are seen at a glance. Except in the Himalaya this is no
common phenomenon, and is owing to the very remarkable depth of the
river-beds. That part of the valley of the Ratong where tropical
vegetation ceases, is but 4000</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 349">[ 349 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">feet above the sea, and though fully fifty miles
as the crow flies (and perhaps 200 by the windings of the river)
from the plains of India, is only eight in a straight line (and
forty by the windings) from the snows which feed that river. In
other words, the descent is so rapid, that in eight miles the
Ratong waters every variety of vegetation, from the lichen of the
poles to the palm of the tropics; whilst throughout the remainder
of its mountain course, it falls from 4000 to 300 feet, flowing
amongst tropical scenery, through a valley whose flanks rise from
5000 to 12,000 feet above its bed.</p>

<p>From Mon Lepcha we proceeded north-west towards Jongri, along a
very open rounded bare mountain, covered with enormous boulders of
gneiss, of which the subjacent rock is also composed. The soil is a
thick clay full of angular stones, everywhere scooped out into
little depressions which are the dry beds of pools, and are often
strewed with a thin layer of pebbles. Black tufts of alpine
aromatic rhododendrons of two kinds (<i>R. anthopogon</i> and <i>
setosum</i>), with dwarf juniper, comprised all the conspicuous
vegetation at this season.</p>

<p>After a two hours&rsquo; walk, keeping at 13,000 feet elevation,
we sighted Jongri.* There were two stone huts on the bleak face of
the spur, scarcely distinguishable at the distance of half a mile
from the great blocks around</p>

<p class="fnote">* I am assured by Capt. Sherwill, who, in 1852,
proceeded along and surveyed the Nepal frontier beyond this point
to Gubroo, that this is not Jongri, but Yangpoong. The difficulty
of getting precise information, especially as to the names of
seldom-visited spots, is very great. I was often deceived myself,
undesignedly, I am sure, on the part of my informants; but in this
case I have Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s assurance, who has kindly
investigated the subject, that there is no mistake on my part.
Captain Sherwill has also kindly communicated to me a map of the
head waters of the Rungbee, Yungya, and Yalloong rivers, of which,
being more correct than my own, I have gladly availed myself for my
map. Gubroo, he informs me, is 15,000 feet in altitude, and dips in
a precipice 1000 feet high, facing Kubra, which prevented his
exploring further north.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 350">[ 350 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">them. To the north Gubroo rose in dismal grandeur,
backed by the dazzling snows of Kubra, which now seemed quite near,
its lofty top (alt. 24,005 feet) being only eight miles distant.
Much snow lay on the ground in patches, and there were few remains
of herbaceous vegetation; those I recognised were chiefly of poppy,
<i>Potentilla,</i> gentian, geranium, fritillary, <i>
Umbellifer&aelig;,</i> grass, and sedges.</p>

<p>On our arrival at the huts the weather was still fine, with a
strong north-west wind, which meeting the warm moist current from
the Ratong valley, caused much precipitation of vapour. As I hoped
to be able to visit the surrounding glaciers from this spot, I made
arrangements for a stay of some days: giving up the only habitable
hut to my people, I spread my blankets in a slope from its roof to
the ground, building a little stone dyke round the skirts of my
dwelling, and a fire-place in front.</p>

<p>Hence to Yalloong in Nepal, by the Kanglanamo pass, is two
days&rsquo; march: the route crosses the Singalelah range at an
elevation of about 15,000 feet, south of Kubra, and north of a
mountain that forms a conspicuous feature south-west from Jongri,
as a crest of black fingered peaks, tipped with snow.</p>

<p>It is difficult to conceive the amount of labour expended upon
every pound of salt imported into this part of Sikkim from Tibet,
and as an enumeration of the chief features of the routes it must
follow, will give some idea of what the circuit of the loftiest
mountain in the globe involves, I shall briefly allude to them;
premising that the circuit of Mont Blanc may be easily accomplished
in four days. The shortest route to Yoksun (the first village south
of Kinchin) from the nearest Tibetan village north of that
mountain, involves a detour of one-third of the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 351">[ 351 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">circumference of Kinchin. It is evident that the
most direct way must be that nearest the mountain-top, and
therefore that which reaches the highest accessible elevation on
its shoulders, and which, at the same time, dips into the
shallowest valleys between those shoulders. The actual distance in
a straight line is about fifty miles, from Yoksun to the mart at or
near Tashirukpa.</p>

<p>The marches between them are as follows:&mdash;<br>
1. To Yalloong two days; crossing Kanglanamo pass, 15,000 feet
high.<br>
3. To foot of Choonjerma pass, descending to 10,000 feet.<br>
4. Cross Choonjerma pass, 15,260 feet, and proceed to Kambachen,
11,400 feet.<br>
5. Cross Nango pass, 15,770, and camp on Yangma river, 11,000
feet.<br>
6. Ascend to foot of Kanglachem pass, and camp at 15,000 feet.<br>
7. Cross Kanglachem pass, probably 16,500 feet; and<br>
8-10. It is said to be three marches hence to the Tibetan
custom-house, and that two more snowy passes are crossed.</p>

<p>This allows no day of rest, and gives only five miles&mdash;as
the crow flies&mdash;to be accomplished each day, but I assume
fully fourteen of road distance; the labour spent in which would
accomplish fully thirty over good roads. Four snowed passes at
least are crossed, all above 15,000 feet, and after the first day
the path does not descend below 10,000 feet. By this route about
one-third of the circuit of Kinchinjunga is accomplished. Supposing
the circuit were to be completed by the shortest practicable route,
that is, keeping as near the summit as possible, the average time
required for a man with his load would be upwards of a month.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 352">[ 352 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To reach Tashirukpa by the eastern route from Yoksun, being a
journey of about twenty-five days, requires a long detour to the
southward and eastward, and afterwards the ascent of the Teesta
valley, to Kongra Lama, and so north to the Tibetan Arun.</p>

<p>My first operation after encamping and arranging my instruments,
was to sink the ground thermometer; but the earth being frozen for
sixteen inches, it took four men several hours&rsquo; work with
hammer and chisel, to penetrate so deep. There was much vegetable
matter for the first eight or ten inches, and below that a fine red
clay. I spent the afternoon, which was fine, in botanising. When
the sun shone, the smell of the two rhododendrons was oppressive,
especially as a little exertion at this elevation brings on
headache. There were few mosses; but crustaceous lichens were
numerous, and nearly all of them of Scotch, Alpine, European, and
Arctic kinds. The names of these, given by the classical
Linn&aelig;us and Wahlenberg, tell in some cases of their
birth-places, in others of their hardihood, their lurid colours and
weather-beaten aspects; such as <i>tristis, gelida, glacialis,
arctica, alpina, saxatilis, polaris, frigida,</i> and numerous
others equally familiar to the Scotch botanist. I recognised many
as natives of the wild mountains of Cape Horn, and the rocks of the
stormy Antarctic ocean; since visiting which regions I had not
gathered them. The lichen called <i>geographicus</i> was most
abundant, and is found to indicate a certain degree of cold in
every latitude; descending to the level of the sea in latitude
52&deg; north, and 50&deg; south, but in lower latitudes only to be
seen on mountains. It flourishes at 10,000 feet on the Himalaya,
ascending thence to 18,000 feet. Its name, however, was not
intended to indicate its wide range, but the curious</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 353">[ 353 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">maplike patterns which its yellow crust forms on
the rocks.</p>

<p>Of the blocks of gneiss scattered over the Jongri spur, many are
twenty feet in diameter. The ridge slopes gently south-west to the
Choroong river, and more steeply north-east to the Ratong, facing
Kinchin: it rises so very gradually to a peaked mountain between
Jongri and Kubra, that it is not possible to account for the
transport and deposit of these boulders by glaciers of the ordinary
form, viz., by a stream of ice following the course of a valley;
and we are forced to speculate upon the possibility of ice having
capped the whole spur, and moved downwards, transporting blocks
from the prominences on various parts of the spur.</p>

<p>The cutting up of the whole surface of this rounded mountain
into little pools, now dry, of all sizes, from ten to about one
hundred yards in circumference, is a very striking phenomenon. The
streams flow in shallow transverse valleys, each passing through a
succession of such pools, accompanying a step-like character of the
general surface. The beds are stony, becoming more so where they
enter the pools, upon several of the larger of which I observed
curving ridges of large stones, radiating outwards on to their beds
from either margin of the entering stream: more generally large
stones were deposited opposite every embouchure.</p>

<p>This superficial sculpturing must have been a very recent
operation; and the transport of the heavy stones opposite the
entrance of the streams has been effected by ice, and perhaps by
snow; just as the arctic ice strews the shores of the Polar ocean
with rocks.</p>

<p>The weather had been threatening all day, northern and westerly
currents contending aloft with the south-east</p>

<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">trade-wind of Sikkim, and meeting in strife over
the great upper valley of the Ratong. Stately masses of white
cumuli wheeled round that gulf of glaciers, partially dissipating
in an occasional snow-storm, but on the whole gradually
accumulating.</p>

<p>On my arrival the thermometer was 32&deg;, with a powerful sun
shining, and it fell to 28&deg; at 4 p.m., when the north wind set
in. At sunset the moon rose through angry masses of woolly cirrus;
its broad full orb threw a flood of yellow light over the serried
tops south of Pundim; thence advancing obliquely towards Nursing,
&ldquo;it stood tip-toe&rdquo; for a few minutes on that beautiful
pyramid of snow, whence it seemed to take flight and mount
majestically into mid-air, illuminating Kinchin, Pundim, and
Kubra.</p>

<p>I sat at the entrance of my gipsy-like hut, anxiously watching
the weather, and absorbed in admiration of the moonrise, from which
my thoughts were soon diverted by its fading light as it entered a
dense mass of mare&rsquo;s-tail cirrus. It was very cold, and the
stillness was oppressive. I had been urged not to attempt such an
ascent in January, my provisions were scanty, firewood only to be
obtained from some distance, the open undulating surface of Jongri
was particularly exposed to heavy snow-drifts, and the path was, at
the best, a scarcely perceptible track. I followed every change of
the wind, every fluctuation of the barometer and thermometer, each
accession of humidity, and the courses of the clouds aloft. At 7
p.m., the wind suddenly shifted to the west, and the thermometer
instantly rose from 20&deg; to 30&deg;. After 8 p.m., the
temperature fell again, and the wind drew round from west by south
to north-east, when the fog cleared off. The barometer rose no more
than it usually does towards 10 p.m., and though it clouded again,
with the temperature at 17&deg;, the wind</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 355">[ 355 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">seemed steady, and I went to bed with a relieved
mind.</p>

<p><i>Jan. 10.</i>&mdash;During the night the temperature fell to
11&middot;2&deg;, and at 6 a.m. was 19&middot;8&deg;, falling again
to 17&deg; soon after. Though clouds were rapidly coming up from
the west and south-west, the wind remained northerly till 8 a.m.,
when it shifted to south-west, and the temperature rose to 25&deg;.
As it continued fine, with the barometer high, I ventured on a walk
towards Gubroo, carefully taking bearings of my position. I found a
good many plants in a rocky valley close to that mountain, which I
in vain attempted to ascend. The air was 30&deg;, with a strong and
damp south-west wind, and the cold was so piercing, that two lads
who were with me, although walking fast, became benumbed, and could
not return without assistance. At 11 a.m., a thick fog obliged us
to retrace our steps: it was followed by snow in soft round pellets
like sago, that swept across the hard ground. During the afternoon
it snowed unceasingly, the wind repeatedly veering round the
compass, always from west to east by south, and so by north to west
again. The flakes were large, soft, and moist with the south wind,
and small, hard, and dry with the north. Glimpses of blue sky were
constantly seen to the south, under the gloomy canopy above, but
they augured no change. As darkness came on, the temperature fell
to 15&deg;, and it snowed very hard; at 6 p.m., it was 11&deg;, but
rose afterwards to 18&deg;.</p>

<p>The night was very cold and wintry: I sat for some hours behind
a blanket screen (which had to be shifted every few minutes) at my
tent-door, keeping up a sulky fire, and peering through the snow
for signs of improvement, but in vain. The clouds were not dense,
for the moon&rsquo;s light was distinct, shining on the glittering
snow-flakes</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 356">[ 356 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">that fell relentlessly: my anxiety was great, and
I could not help censuring myself severely for exposing a party to
so great danger at such a season. I found comfort in the belief
that no idle curiosity had prompted me, and that with a good motive
and a strong prestige of success, one can surmount a host of
difficulties. Still the snow fell; and my heart sank, as my fire
declined, and the flakes sputtered on the blackening embers; my
little puppy, who had gambolled all day amongst the drifting white
pellets, now whined, and crouched under my thick woollen cloak; the
inconstant searching wind drifted the snow into the tent, whose
roof so bagged in with the accumulation that I had to support it
with sticks, and dreaded being smothered, if the weight should
cause it to sink upon my bed during my sleep. The increasing cold
drove me, however, to my blankets, and taking the precaution of
stretching a tripod stand over my head, so as to leave a breathing
hole, by supporting the roof if it fell in, I slept soundly, with
my dog at my feet.</p>

<p>At sunrise the following morning the sky was clear, with a light
north wind; about two feet of snow had fallen, the drifts were
deep, and all trace of the path obliterated. The minimum
thermometer had fallen to 3&middot;7&deg;, the temperature rose to
27&deg; at 9 a.m., after which the wind fell, and with it the
thermometer to 18&deg;. Soon, however, southerly breezes set in,
bringing up heavy masses of clouds.</p>

<p>My light-hearted companions cheerfully prepared to leave the
ground; they took their appointed loads without a murmur, and
sought protection for their eyes from the glare of the newly fallen
snow, some with as much of my crape veil as I could spare, others
with shades of brown paper, or of hair from the yaks&rsquo; tails,
whilst a few had spectacle-shades of woven hair; and the Lepchas
loosened their</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 357">[ 357 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">pigtails, and combed their long hair over their
eyes and faces. It is from fresh-fallen snow alone that much
inconvenience is felt; owing, I suppose, to the light reflected
from the myriads of facets which the crystals of snow present. I
have never suffered inconvenience in crossing beds of old snow, or
glaciers with weathered surfaces, which absorb a great deal of
light, and reflect comparatively little, and that little coloured
green or blue.</p>

<p>The descent was very laborious, especially through the several
miles of bush and rock which lie below the summit: so that,
although we started at 10 a.m., it was dark by the time we reached
Buckeem, where we found two lame coolies, whom we had left on our
way up, and who were keeping up a glorious fire for our
reception.</p>
