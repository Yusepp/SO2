<br>
<p class="first">In the evening we returned to our tamarind tree,
and the next morning regained the trunk road, following it to the
dawk bungalow of Doomree. On the way I found the <i>
C&aelig;salpinia paniculuta,</i> a magnificent climber, festooning
the trues with its dark glossy foliage and gorgeous racemes of
orange blossoms. Receding from the mountain, the country again
became barren: at Doomree the hills were of crystalline rocks,
chiefly quartz and gneiss; no palms or large trees of any kind
appeared. The spear-grass abounded, and a detestable nuisance it
was, its long awns and husked seed working through trowsers and
stockings.</p>

<p><i>Balanites</i> was not uncommon, forming a low thorny bush,
with <i>&AElig;gle marmelos</i> and <i>Feronia elephantum.</i>
Having rested the tired elephant, we pushed on in the evening to
the next stage, Baghoda, arriving there at 3 a.m., and after a few
hours&rsquo; rest, I walked to the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 26">[ 26 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">bungalow of Lieutenant Beadle, the surveyor of
roads, sixteen miles further.</p>

<p>The country around Baghoda is still very barren, but improves
considerably in going westward, the ground becoming hilly, and the
road winding through prettily wooded vallies, and rising gradually
to 1,446 feet. <i>Nauclea cordifolia,</i> a tree resembling a young
sycamore, is very common; with the Semul (<i>Bombax</i>), a very
striking tree from its buttressed trunk and gaudy scarlet flowers,
swarming with birds, which feed from its honeyed blossoms.</p>

<p>At 10 a.m. the sun became uncomfortably hot, the thermometer
being 77&deg;, and the black-bulb thermometer 137&deg;. I had lost
my hat, and possessed no substitute but a silken nightcap; so I had
to tie a handkerchief over my head, to the astonishment of the
passers-by. Holding my head down, I had little source of amusement
but reading the foot-marks on the road; and these were strangely
diversified to an English eye. Those of the elephant, camel,
buffalo and bullock, horse, ass, pony, dog, goat, sheep and kid,
lizard, wild-cat and pigeon, with men, women, and children&rsquo;s
feet, naked and shod, were all recognisable.</p>

<p>It was noon ere I arrived at Lieutenant Beadle&rsquo;s, at
Belcuppee (alt. 1,219 feet), glad enough of the hearty welcome I
received, being very hot, dusty, and hungry. The country about his
bungalow is very pretty, from the number of wooded hills and large
trees, especially of banyan and peepul, noble oak-like Mahowa
(<i>Bassia</i>), <i>Nauclea,</i> Mango, and <i>Ficus
infectoria.</i> These are all scattered, however, and do not form
forest, such as in a stunted form clothes the hills, consisting of
<i>Diospyros, Terminalia, Gmelina, Nauclea parvifolia,
Buchanania,</i> etc. The rocks are still hornblende-schist and
granite, with a</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 27">[ 27 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">covering of alluvium, full of quartz pebbles.
Insects and birds are numerous, the latter consisting of jays,
crows, doves, sparrows, and maina (<i>Pastor</i>); also the <i>
Ph&oelig;nicophaus tristis</i> (&ldquo;Mahoka&rdquo; of the
natives), with a note like that of the English cuckoo, as heard
late in the season. I remained two days with Lieutenant Beadle,
enjoying in his society several excursions to the hot springs, etc.
These springs (called Soorujkoond) are situated close to the road,
near the mouth of a valley, in a remarkably pretty spot. They are,
of course, objects of worship; and a ruined temple stands close
behind them, with three very conspicuous trees&mdash;a peepul, a
banyan, and a white, thick-stemmed, leafless <i>Sterculia,</i>
whose branches bore dense clusters of greenish f&oelig;tid flowers.
The hot springs are four in number, and rise in as many ruined
brick tanks about two yards across. Another tank, fed by a cold
spring, about twice that size, flows between two of the hot, only
two or three paces distant from one of the latter on either hand.
All burst through the gneiss rocks, meet in one stream after a few
yards, and are conducted by bricked canals to a pool of cold water,
about eighty yards off.</p>

<p>The temperatures of the hot springs were respectively 169&deg;,
170&deg;, 173&deg;, and 190&deg;; of the cold, 84&deg; at 4 p.m.,
and 75&deg; at 7 a.m. the following morning. The hottest is the
middle of the five. The water of the cold spring is sweet but not
good, and emits gaseous bubbles; it was covered with a green
floating <i>Conferva.</i> Of the four hot springs, the most copious
is about three feet deep, bubbles constantly, boils eggs, and
though brilliantly clear, has an exceedingly nauseous taste. This
and the other warm ones cover the bricks and surrounding rocks with
a thick incrustation of salts.</p>

<p><i>Conferv&aelig;</i> abound in the warm stream from the
springs,</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 28">[ 28 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and two species, one ochreous brown, and the other
green, occur on the margins of the tanks themselves, and in the
hottest water; the brown is the best Salamander, and forms a belt
in deeper water than the green; both appear in broad luxuriant
strata, wherever the temp. is cooled down to 168&deg;, and as low
as 90&deg;. Of flowering plants, three showed in an eminent degree
a constitution capable of resisting the heat, if not a predilection
for it; these were all <i>Cyperace&aelig;,</i> a <i>Cyperus</i> and
an <i>Eleocharis,</i> having their roots in water of 100&deg;, and
where they are probably exposed to greater heat, and a <i>
Fimbristylis</i> at 98&deg;; all were very luxuriant. From the
edges of the four hot springs I gathered sixteen species of
flowering plants, and from the cold tank five, which did not grow
in the hot. A water-beetle, <i>Colymbetes</i>(?) and <i>
Notonecta,</i> abounded in water at 112&deg;, with quantities of
dead shells; frogs were very lively, with live shells, at 90&deg;,
and with various other water beetles. Having no means of detecting
the salts of this water, I bottled some for future analysis.*</p>

<p>On the following day I botanized in the neighbourhood, with but
poor success. An oblique-leaved fig climbs the other trees, and
generally strangles them: two epiphytal <i>Orchide&aelig;</i> also
occur on the latter, <i>Vanda Roxburghii</i> and an <i>
Oberonia.</i> Dodders (<i>Cuscuta</i>) of two species, and <i>
Cassytha,</i> swarm over and conceal the bushes with their yellow
thread-like stems.</p>

<p>I left Belcuppee on the 8th of February, following Mr.
Williams&rsquo; camp. The morning was clear and cold, the
temperature only 56&deg;. We crossed the nearly dry broad bed of
the Burkutta river, a noble stream during the rains, carrying along
huge boulders of granite and gneiss. Near this I passed the
Cholera-tree, a famous peepul by</p>

<p class="fnote">* For an account of the <i>Conferv&aelig;,</i> and
of the mineral constituents of the waters, etc. see Appendix B.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 29">[ 29 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the road side, so called from a detachment of
infantry having been attacked and decimated at the spot by that
fell disease; it is covered with inscriptions and votive tokens in
the shape of rags, etc. We continued to ascend to 1,360 feet, where
I came upon a small forest of the Indian Olibanum (<i>Boswellia
thurifera</i>), conspicuous from its pale bark, and spreading
curved branches, leafy at their tips; its general appearance is a
good deal like that of the mountain ash. The gum, celebrated
throughout the East, was flowing abundantly from the trunk, very
fragrant and transparent. The ground was dry, sterile, and rocky;
kunker, the curious formation mentioned at <a href=
"chap1.html#page 12">p. 12</a>, appears in the alluvium, which I
had not elsewhere seen at this elevation.</p>

<p>Descending to the village of Burshoot, we lost sight of the <i>
Boswellia,</i> and came upon a magnificent tope of mango, banyan,
and peepul, so far superior to anything hitherto met with, that we
were glad to choose such a pleasant halting-place for breakfast.
There are a few lofty fan-palms here too, great rarities in this
soil and elevation: one, about eighty feet high, towered above some
wretched hovels, displaying the curious proportions of this tribe
of palms: first, a short cone, tapering to one-third the height of
the stem, the trunk then swelling to two-thirds, and again tapering
to the crown. Beyond this, the country again ascends to Burree
(alt. 1,169 feet), another dawk bungalow, a barren place, which we
left on the following morning.</p>

<p>So little was there to observe, that I again amused myself by
watching footsteps, the precision of which in the sandy soil was
curious. Looking down from the elephant, I was interested by seeing
them all in <i>relief,</i> instead of <i>depressed,</i> the
slanting rays of the sun in front producing</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 30">[ 30 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">this kind of mirage. Before us rose no more of
those wooded hills that had been our companions for the last 120
miles, the absence of which was a sign of the nearly approaching
termination of the great hilly plateau we had been traversing for
that distance.</p>

<p>Chorparun, at the top of the Dunwah pass, is situated on an
extended barren flat, 1,320 feet above the sea, and from it the
descent from the table-land to the level of the Soane valley, a
little above that of the Ganges at Patna, is very sudden. The road
is carried zizgag down a rugged hill of gneiss, with a descent of
nearly 1000 feet in six miles, of which 600 are exceedingly steep.
The pass is well wooded, with abundance of bamboo, <i>Bombax,
Cassia, Acacia,</i> and <i>Butea,</i> with <i>Calotropis,</i> the
purple Mudar, a very handsome road-side plant, which I had not seen
before, but which, with the <i>Argemone Mexicana,</i> was to be a
companion for hundreds of miles farther. All the views in the pass
are very picturesque, though wanting in good foliage, such as <i>
Ficus</i> would afford, of which I did not see one tree. Indeed the
rarity of the genus (except <i>F. infectoria</i>) in the native
woods of these hills, is very remarkable. The banyan and peepul
always appear to be planted, as do the tamarind and mango.</p>

<p>Dunwah, at the foot of the pass, is 620 feet above the sea, and
nearly 1000 below the mean level of the highland I had been
traversing. Every thing bears here a better aspect; the woods at
the foot of the hills afforded many plants; the bamboo (<i>B.
stricta</i>) is green instead of yellow and white; a little
castor-oil is cultivated, and the Indian date (low and stunted)
appears about the cottages.</p>

<p>In the woods I heard and saw the wild peacock for the first
time. Its voice is not to be distinguished from that of the tame
bird in England, a curious instance of the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 31">[ 31 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">perpetuation of character under widely different
circumstances, for the crow of the wild jungle-fowl does not rival
that of the farm-yard cock.</p>

<p>In the evening we left Dunwah for Barah (alt. 480 feet), passing
over very barren soil, covered with low jungle, the original woods
having apparently been cut for fuel. Our elephant, a timid animal,
came on a drove of camels in the dark by the road-side, and in his
alarm insisted on doing battle, tearing through the thorny jungle,
regardless of the mahout, and still more of me: the uproar raised
by the camel-drivers was ridiculous, and the danger to my barometer
imminent.</p>

<p>We proceeded on the 11th of February to Sheergotty, where Mr.
Williams and his camp were awaiting our arrival. Wherever
cultivation appeared the crops were tolerably luxuriant, but a
great deal of the country yielded scarcely half-a-dozen kinds of
plants to any ten square yards of ground. The most prevalent were
<i>Carissa carandas, Olax scandens,</i> two <i>Zizyphi,</i> and the
ever-present <i>Acacia Catechu.</i> The climate is, however, warmer
and much moister, for I here observed dew to be formed, which I
afterwards found to be usual on the low grounds. That its presence
is due to the increased amount of vapour in the atmosphere I shall
prove: the amount of radiation, as shown by the cooling of the
earth and vegetation, being the same in the elevated plain and
lower levels.*</p>

<p>The good soil was very richly cultivated with poppy (which I had
not seen before), sugar-cane, wheat, barley, mustard, rape, and
flax. At a distance a field of poppies looks like a green lake,
studded with white water-lilies. The houses, too, are better, and
have tiled roofs; while, in such situations, the road is lined with
trees.</p>

<p class="fnote">* See Appendix A.</p>

<p class="page"><a name="page 32">[ 32 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A retrospect of the ground passed over is
unsatisfactory, as far as botany is concerned, except as showing
how potent are the effects of a dry soil and climate during one
season of the year upon a vegetation which has no desert types.
During the rains probably many more species would be obtained, for
of annuals I scarcely found twenty. At that season, however, the
jungles of Behar and Birbhoom, though far from tropically
luxuriant, are singularly unhealthy.</p>

<p>In a geographical point of view the range of hills between
Burdwan and the Soave is interesting, as being the north-east
continuation of a chain which crosses the broadest part of the
peninsula of India, from the Gulf of Cambay to the junction of the
Ganges and Hoogly at Rajmahal. This range runs south of the Soane
and Kymore, which it meets I believe at Omerkuntuk;* the granite of
this and the sandstone of the other, being there both overlaid with
trap. Further west again, the ranges separate, the southern still
betraying a nucleus of granite, forming the Satpur range, which
divides the valley of the Taptee from that of the Nerbudda. The
Paras-nath range is, though the most difficult of definition, the
longer of the two parallel ranges; the Vindhya continued as the
Kymore, terminating abruptly at the Fort of Chunar on the Ganges.
The general and geological features of the two, especially along
their eastern course, are very different. This consists of
metamorphic gneiss, in various highly inclined beds, through which
granite hills protrude, the loftiest of which is Paras-nath. The
north-east Vindhya (called Kymore), on the other hand, consists of
nearly horizontal beds of sandstone, overlying inclined beds of
non-fossiliferous limestone. Between the latter and the
Paras-nath</p>

<p class="fnote">* A lofty mountain said to be 7000-8000 feet
high.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 33">[ 33 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">gneiss, come (in order of superposition) shivered
and undulating strata of metamorphic quartz, hornstone,
hornstone-porphyry, jaspers, etc. These are thrown up, by
greenstone I believe, along the north and north-west boundary of
the gneiss range, and are to be recognised as forming the rocks of
Colgong, of Sultangunj, and of Monghyr, on the Ganges, as also
various detached hills near Gyah, and along the upper course of the
Soane. From these are derived the beautiful agates and cornelians,
so famous under the name of Soane pebbles, and they are equally
common on the Curruckpore range, as on the south bank of the Soane,
so much so in the former position as to have been used in the
decoration of the walls of the now ruined palaces near
Bhagulpore.</p>

<p>In the route I had taken, I had crossed the eastern extremity
alone of the range, commencing with a very gradual ascent, over the
alluvial plains of the west bank of the Hoogly, then over laterite,
succeeded by sandstone of the Indian coal era, which is succeeded
by the granite table-land, properly so called. A little beyond the
coal fields, the table-land reaches an average height of 1,130
feet, which is continued for upwards of 100 miles, to the Dunwah
pass. Here the descent is sudden to plains, which, continuous with
those of the Ganges, run up the Soane till beyond Rotasghur. Except
for the occasional ridges of metamorphic rocks mentioned above, and
some hills of intruded greenstone, the lower plain is stoneless,
its subjacent rocks being covered with a thicker stratum of the
same alluvium which is thinly spread over the higher table-land
above. This range is of great interest from its being the source of
many important rivers,* and of all</p>

<p class="fnote">* The chief rivers from this, the great watershed
of western Bengal, flow north-west and south-east; a few
comparatively insignificant streams running north to the Ganges.
Amongst the former are the Rheru, the Kunner, and the Coyle, which
contribute to the Soane; amongst the latter, the Dammooda, Adji,
and Barakah, flow into the Hoogly, and the Subunrika, Braminee, and
Mahanuddee into the Bay of Bengal.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 34">[ 34 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">those which water the country between the Soane,
Hoogly, and Ganges, as well as from its deflecting the course of
the latter river, which washes its base at Rajmahal, and forcing it
to take a sinuous course to the sea. In its climate and botany it
differs equally from the Gangetic plains to the north, and from the
hot, damp, and exuberant forests of Orissa to the south. Nor are
its geological features less different, or its concomitant and in
part resultant characters of agriculture and native population.
Still further west, the great rivers of the peninsula have their
origin, the Nerbudda and Taptee flowing west to the gulf of Cambay,
the Cane to the Jumna, the Soane to the Ganges, and the northern
feeders of the Godavery to the Bay of Bengal.</p>

<p>On the 12th of February, we left Sheergotty (alt. 463 feet),
crossing some small streams, which, like all else seen since
leaving the Dunwah Pass, flow N. to the Ganges. Between Sheergotty
and the Soane, occur many of the isolated hills of greenstone,
mentioned above, better known to the traveller from having been
telegraphic stations. Some are much impregnated with iron, and
whether for their colour, the curious outlines of many, or their
position, form quaint, and in some cases picturesque features in
the otherwise tame landscape.</p>

<p>The road being highly cultivated, and the Date-palm becoming
more abundant, we encamped in a grove of these trees. All were
curiously distorted; the trunks growing zigzag, from the practice
of yearly tapping the alternate sides for toddy. The incision is
just below the</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 35">[ 35 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">crown, and slopes upwards and inwards: a vessel is
hung below the wound, and the juice conducted into it by a little
piece of bamboo. This operation spoils the fruit, which, though
eaten, is small, and much inferior to the African date.</p>

<p>At Mudunpore (alt. 440 feet) a thermometer, sunk 3 feet 4 inches
in the soil, maintained a constant temperature of 71&middot;5&deg;,
that of the air varying from 77&middot;5&deg;, at 3 p.m., to 62 at
daylight the following morning; when we moved on to Nourunga (alt.
340 feet), where I bored to 3 feet 8 inches with a heavy iron
jumper through an alluvium of such excessive tenacity, that eight
natives were employed for four hours in the operation. In both this
and another hole, 4 feet 8 inches, the temperature was 72&deg; at
10 p.m.; and on the following morning 71&middot;5&deg; in the
deepest hole, and 70&deg; in the shallower: that of the external
air varied from 71&deg; at 3 p.m., to 57&deg; at daylight on the
following morning. At the latter time I took the temperature of the
earth near the surface, which showed,</p>

<p>The following day we marched to Baroon (alt. 345 feet) on the
alluvial banks of the Soane, crossing a deep stream by a pretty
suspension bridge, of which the piers were visible two miles off,
so level is the road. The Soane is here three miles wide, its
nearly dry bed being a desert of sand, resembling a vast arm of the
sea when the tide is out: the banks are very barren, with no trees
near, and but very few in the distance. The houses were scarcely
visible on the opposite side, behind which the Kymore mountains
rise. The Soane is a classical river,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">being now satisfactorily identified with the
Eranoboas of the ancients.*</p>

<p>The alluvium is here cut into a cliff, ten or twelve feet above
the bed of the river, and against it the sand is blown in naked <i>
dunes.</i> At 2 p.m., the surface-sand was heated to 110&deg; where
sheltered from the wind, and 104&deg; in the open bed of the river.
To compare the rapidity and depth to which the heat is communicated
by pure sand, and by the tough alluvium, I took the temperature at
some inches depth in both. That the alluvium absorbs the heat
better, and retains it longer, would appear from the following, the
only observations I could make, owing to the tenacity of the
soil.</p>

<p>The power this plant exercises of maintaining a low temperature
of 72&deg;, though the main portion which is subterraneous is
surrounded by a soil heated to between 90&deg; and 104&deg;, is
very remarkable, and no doubt proximately due to the rapidity of
evaporation from the foliage,</p>

<p class="fnote">* The etymology of Eranoboas is undoubtedly <i>
Hierrinia Vahu</i> (Sanskrit), the golden-armed. Sons is also the
Sanskrit for <i>gold.</i> The stream is celebrated for its agates
(Soane pebbles), which are common, but gold is not now obtained
from it.</p>

<p class="first">and consequent activity in the circulation. Its
exposed leaves maintained a temperature of 80&deg;, nearly 25&deg;
cooler than the similarly exposed sand and alluvium. On the same
night the leaves were cooled down to 54&deg;, when the sand had
cooled to 51&deg;. Before daylight the following morning the sand
had cooled to 43&deg;, and the leaves of the <i>Calotropis</i> to
45&middot;5&deg;. I omitted to observe the temperature of the sap
at the latter time; but the sand at the same depth (15 inches) as
that at which its temperature and that of the plant agreed at
mid-day, was 68&deg;. And assuming this to be the heat of the
plant, we find that the leaves are heated by solar radiation during
the day 8&deg;, and cooled by nocturnal radiation,
22&middot;5&deg;.</p>

<p>Mr. Theobald (my companion in this and many other rambles)
pulled a lizard from a hole in the bank. Its throat was mottled
with scales of brown and yellow. Three ticks had fastened on it,
each of a size covering three or four scales: the first was yellow,
corresponding with the yellow colour of the animal&rsquo;s belly,
where it lodged, the second brown, from the lizard&rsquo;s head;
but the third, which was clinging to the parti-coloured scales of
the neck, had its body parti-coloured, the hues corresponding with
the individual scales which they covered. The adaptation of the two
first specimens in colour to the parts to which they adhered, is
sufficiently remarkable; but the third case was most
extraordinary.</p>

<p>During the night of the 14th of February, I observed a beautiful
display, apparently of the Aurora borealis, an account of which
will be found in the Appendix.</p>

<p><i>February 15.</i>&mdash;Our passage through the Soane sands
was very tedious, though accomplished in excellent style, the
elephants pushing forward the heavy waggons of mining tools with
their foreheads. The wheels were sometimes</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 38">[ 38 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">buried to the axles in sand, and the draught
bullocks were rather in the way than otherwise. The body of water
over which we ferried, was not above 80 yards wide. In the rains,
when the whole space of three miles is one rapid flood, 10 or 12
feet deep, charged with yellow sand, this river must present an
imposing spectacle. I walked across the dry portion, observing the
sand-waves, all ranged in one direction, perpendicular to that of
the prevailing wind, accurately representing the undulations of the
ocean, as seen from a mast-head or high cliff. As the sand was
finer or coarser, so did the surface resemble a gentle ripple, or
an ocean-swell. The progressive motion of the waves was curious,
and caused by the lighter particles being blown over the ridges,
and filling up the hollows to leeward. There were a few islets in
the sand, a kind of oases of mud and clay, in lamin&aelig; no
thicker than paper, and these were at once denizened by various
weeds. Some large spots were green with wheat and barley-crops,
both suffering from smut. We encamped close to the western shore,
at the village of Dearee (alt. 330 feet); it marks the termination
of the Kymore Hills, along whose S.E. bases our course now lay, as
we here quitted the grand trunk road for a rarely visited country.
On the 16th we marched south up the river to Tilotho (alt. 395
feet), through a rich and highly cultivated country, covered with
indigo, cotton, sugar-cane, safflower, castor-oil, poppy, and
various grains. Dodders (<i>Cuscuta</i>) covered even tall trees
with a golden web, and the <i>Capparis acuminata</i> was in full
flower along the road side. Tilotho, a beautiful village, is
situated in a superb grove of Mango, Banyan, Peepul, Tamarind, and
<i>Bassia.</i> The Date or toddy-palm and fan-palm are very
abundant and tall: each had a pot hung under the crown. The</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 39">[ 39 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">natives climb these trunks with a hoop or cord
round the body and both ancles, and a bottle-gourd or other vessel
hanging round the neck to receive the juice from the stock-bottle,
in this aerial wine-cellar. These palms were so lofty that the
climbers, as they paused in their ascent to gaze with wonder at our
large retinue, resembled monkeys rather than men. Both trees yield
a toddy, but in this district they stated that that from the <i>
Ph&oelig;nix</i> (Date) alone ferments, and is distilled; while in
other parts of India, the <i>Borassus</i> (fan-palm) is chiefly
employed. I walked to the hills, over a level cultivated country
interspersed with occasional belts of low wood; in which the
pensile nests of the weaver-bird were abundant, but generally
hanging out of reach, in prickly <i>Acacias.</i></p>

<p>The hills here present a straight precipitous wall of
horizontally stratified sandstone, very like the rocks at the Cape
of Good Hope, with occasionally a shallow valley, and a slope of
d&eacute;bris at the base, densely clothed with dry jungle. The
cliffs are about 1000 feet high, and the plants similar to those at
the foot of Paras-nath, but stunted: I climbed to the top, the
latter part by steps or ledges of sandstone. The summit was clothed
with long grass, trees of <i>Diospyros</i> and <i>Terminalia,</i>
and here and there the <i>Boswellia.</i> On the precipitous rocks
the curious white-barked <i>Sterculia f&oelig;tida</i> &ldquo;flung
its arms abroad,&rdquo; leafless, and looking as if blasted by
lightning.</p>

<p>A hole was sunk here again for the thermometers, and, as usual,
with great labour; the temperatures obtained were&mdash;</p>

<p class="first">previously obtained, and certainly indicates a
much higher mean temperature of the locality. I can only suppose it
due to the radiation of heat from the long range of sandstone
cliff, exposed to the south, which overlooks the flat whereon we
were encamped, and which, though four or five miles off, forms a
very important feature. The differences of temperature in the shade
taken on this and the other side of the river are 2&middot;75&deg;
higher on this side.</p>

<p>On the 17th we marched to Akbarpore (alt. 400 feet), a village
overhung by the rocky precipice of Rotasghur, a spur of the Kymore,
standing abruptly forward.</p>

<p>The range, in proceeding up the Soane valley, gradually
approaches the river, and beds of non-fossiliferous limestone are
seen protruding below the sandstone and occasionally rising into
rounded hills, the paths upon which appear as white as do those
through the chalk districts of England. The overlying beds of
sandstone are nearly horizontal, or with a dip to the N.W.; the
subjacent ones of limestone dip at a greater angle. Passing between
the river and a detached conical hill of limestone, capped with a
flat mass of sandstone, the spur of Rotas broke suddenly on the
view, and very grand it was, quite realising my anticipations of
the position of these eyrie-like hill-forts of India. To the left
of the spur winds the valley of the Soane, with low-wooded hills on
its opposite bank, and a higher range, connected with that of
Behar, in the distance. To the right, the hills sweep round,
forming an immense and beautifully wooded amphitheatre, about four
miles deep, bounded with a continuation of the escarpment. At the
foot of the crowned spur is the village of Akbarpore, where we
encamped in a Mango tope;* it occupies some</p>

<p class="fnote">* On the 24th of June, 1848, the Soane rose to an
unprecedented height, and laid this grove of Mangos three feet
under water.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 41">[ 41 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">pretty undulating limestone hills, amongst which
several streams flow from the amphitheatre to the Soane. During our
two days&rsquo; stay here, I had the advantage of the society of
Mr. C. E. Davis, who was our guide during some rambles in the
neighbourhood, and to whose experience, founded on the best habits
of observation, I am indebted for much information. At noon we
started to ascend to the palace, on the top of the spur. On the way
we passed a beautiful well, sixty feet deep, and with a fine flight
of steps to the bottom. Now neglected and overgrown with flowering
weeds and creepers, it afforded me many of the plants I had only
previously obtained in a withered state; it was curious to observe
there some of the species of the hill-tops, whose seeds doubtless
are scattered abundantly over the surrounding plains, and only
vegetate where they find a coolness and moisture resembling that of
the altitude they elsewhere affect. A fine fig-tree growing out of
the stone-work spread its leafy green branches over the well mouth,
which was about twelve feet square; its roots assumed a singular
form, enveloping two sides of the walls with a beautiful net-work,
which at <i>high-water mark</i> (rainy season), abruptly divides
into thousands of little brushes, dipping into the water which they
fringe. It was a pretty cool place to descend to, from a
temperature of 80&deg; above, to 74&deg; at the bottom, where the
water was 60&deg;; and most refreshing to look, either up the shaft
to the green fig shadowing the deep profound, or along the sloping
steps through a vista of flowering herbs and climbing plants, to
the blue heaven of a burning sky.</p>

<p>The ascent to Rotas is over the dry hills of limestone, covered
with a scrubby brushwood, to a crest where are the first rude and
ruined defences. The limestone is</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 42">[ 42 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">succeeded by the sandstone cliff cut into steps,
which led from ledge to ledge and gap to gap, well guarded with
walls and an archway of solid masonry. Through this we passed on to
the flat summit of the Kymore hills, covered with grass and forest,
intersected by paths in all directions. The ascent is about 1,200
feet&mdash;a long pull in the blazing sun of February. The turf
consists chiefly of spear-grass and <i>Andropogon muricatus,</i>
the kus-kus, which yields a favourite fragrant oil, used as a
medicine in India. The trees are of the kinds mentioned before. A
pretty octagonal summer-house, with its roof supported by pillars,
occupies one of the highest points of the plateau, and commands a
superb view of the scenery before described. From this a walk of
three miles leads through the woods to the palace. The buildings
are very extensive, and though now ruinous, bear evidence of great
beauty in the architecture: light galleries, supported by slender
columns, long cool arcades, screened squares and terraced walks,
are the principal features. The rooms open out upon flat roofs,
commanding views of the long endless table-land to the west, and a
sheer precipice of 1000 feet on the other side, with the Soane, the
amphitheatre of hills, and the village of Akbarpore below.</p>

<p>This and Beejaghur, higher up the Soane, were amongst the most
recently reduced forts, and this was further the last of those
wrested from Baber in 1542. Some of the rooms are still habitable,
but the greater part are ruinous, and covered with climbers, both
of wild flowers and of the naturalised garden plants of the
adjoining shrubbery; the <i>Arbor-tristis,</i> with <i>Hibiscus,
Abutilon,</i> etc., and above all, the little yellow-flowered <i>
Linaria ramosissima,</i> crawling over every ruined wall, as we see
the walls of our old English castles clothed with its congener <i>
L. Cymbalaria.</i></p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 43">[ 43 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the old dark stables I observed the soil to be
covered with a copious evanescent efflorescence of nitrate of lime,
like soap-suds scattered about.</p>

<p>I made Rotas Palace 1,490 feet above the sea, so that this
table-land is here only fifty feet higher than that I had crossed
on the grand trunk road, before descending at the Dunwah pass. Its
mean temperature is of course considerably (4&deg;) below that of
the valley, but though so cool, agues prevail after the rains. The
extremes of temperature are less marked than in the valley, which
becomes excessively heated, and where hot winds sometimes last for
a week, blowing in furious gusts.</p>

<p>The climate of the whole neighbourhood has of late changed
materially; and the fall of rain has much diminished, consequent on
felling the forests; even within six years the hail-storms have
been far less frequent and violent. The air on the hills is highly
electrical, owing, no doubt, to the dryness of the atmosphere, and
to this the frequent recurrence of hail-storms may be due.</p>

<p>The zoology of these regions is tolerably copious, but little is
known of the natural history of a great part of the plateau; a
native tribe, prone to human sacrifices, is talked of. Tigers are
common, and bears are numerous; they have, besides, the leopard,
panther, viverine cat, and civet; and of the dog tribe the pariah,
jackal, fox, and wild dog, called Koa. Deer are very numerous, of
six or seven kinds. A small alligator inhabits the hill streams,
said to be a very different animal from either of the Soane
species.</p>

<p>During our descent we examined several instances of ripple-mark
(fossil waves&rsquo; footsteps) in the sandstone; they resembled
the fluting of the <i>Sigillaria</i> stems, in the coal-measures,
and occurring as they did here, in sandstone, a</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 44">[ 44 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">little above great beds of limestone, had been
taken for such, and as indications of coal.</p>

<p>On the following day we visited Rajghat, a steep ghat or pass
leading up the cliff to Rotas Palace, a little higher up the river.
We took the elephants to the mouth of the glen, where we
dismounted, and whence we followed a stream abounding in small fish
and aquatic insects (<i>Dytisci</i> and <i>Gyrini</i>), through a
close jungle, to the foot of the cliffs, where there are
indications of coal. The woods were full of monkeys, and amongst
other plants I observed <i>Murraya exotica,</i> but it was scarce.
Though the jungle was so dense, the woods were very dry, containing
no Palm, <i>Adroide&aelig;,</i> Peppers, <i>Orchide&aelig;</i> or
Ferns. Here, at the foot of the red cliffs, which towered
imposingly above, as seen through the tree tops, are several small
seams of coaly matter in the sandstone, with abundance of pyrites,
sulphur, and copious efflorescences of salts of iron; but no coal.
The springs from the cliffs above are charged with lime, of which
enormous tuff beds are deposited on the sandstone, full of
impressions of the leaves and stems of the surrounding trees,
which, however, I found it very difficult to recognize, and could
not help contrasting this circumstance with the fact that
geologists, unskilled in botany, see no difficulty in referring
equally imperfect remains of extinct vegetables to existing genera.
In some parts of their course the streams take up quantities of the
efflorescence, which they scatter over the sandstones in a singular
manner.</p>

<p>At Akbarpore I had sunk two thermometers, one 4 feet 6 inches,
the other 5 feet 6 inches; both invariably indicated 76&deg;, the
air varying from 56&deg; to 79&middot;5&deg;. Dew had formed every
night since leaving Dunwah, the grass being here cooled 12&deg;
below the air.</p>

<p>On the 19th of February we marched up the Soane to</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 45">[ 45 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Tura, passing some low hills of limestone, between
the cliffs of the Kymore and the river. On the shaded riverbanks
grew abundance of English genera&mdash;<i>Cynoglossum, Veronica,
Potentilla, Ranunculus sceleratus, Rumex,</i> several herbaceous
<i>Composit&aelig;</i> and <i>Labiat&aelig;</i>; <i>Tamarix</i>
formed a small bush in rocky hillocks in the bed of the river, and
in pools were several aquatic plants, <i>Zannichellia, Chara,</i> a
pretty little <i>Vallisneria,</i> and <i>Potamogeton.</i> The
Brahminee goose was common here, and we usually saw in the morning
immense flocks of wild geese overhead, migrating northward.</p>

<p>Here I tried again the effect of solar and nocturnal radiation
on the sand, at different depths, not being able to do so on the
alluvium.</p>

<p>From Tura our little army again crossed the Soane, the scarped
cliffs of the Kymore approaching close to the river on the west
side. The bed is very sandy, and about one mile and a half
across.</p>

<p>The elephants were employed again, as at Baroon, to push the
cart: one of them had a bump in consequence, as large as a
child&rsquo;s head, just above the trunk, and bleeding much; but
the brave beast disregarded this, when the word of command was
given by his driver.</p>

<p>The stream was very narrow, but deep and rapid, obstructed with
beds of coarse agate, jasper, cornelian and chalcedony pebbles. A
clumsy boat took us across to the village of Soanepore, a wretched
collection of hovels. The crops were thin and poor, and I saw no
palms or good trees.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 46">[ 46 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">Squirrels however abounded, and were busy laying
up their stores; descending from the trees they scoured across a
road to a field of tares, mounted the hedge, took an observation,
foraged and returned up the tree with their booty, quickly
descended, and repeated the operation of reconnoitering and
plundering.</p>

<p>The bed of the river is here considerably above that at Dearee,
where the mean of the observations with those of Baroon, made it
about 300 feet. The mean of those taken here and on the opposite
side, at Tura, gives about 400 feet, indicating a fall of 100 feet
in only 40 miles.</p>

<p>Near this the sandy banks of the Soane were full of
martins&rsquo; nests, each one containing a pair of eggs. The
deserted ones were literally crammed full of long-legged spiders
(<i>Opilio</i>), which could be raked out with a stick, when they
came pouring down the cliff like corn from a sack; the quantities
are quite inconceivable. I did not observe the martin feed on
them.</p>

<p>The entomology here resembled that of Europe, more than I had
expected in a tropical country, where predaceous beetles, at least
<i>Carabide&aelig;</i> and <i>Staphylinide&aelig;,</i> are
generally considered rare. The latter tribes swarmed under the
clods, of many species but all small, and so singularly active that
I could not give the time to collect many. In the banks again, the
round egg-like earthy chrysalis of the <i>Sphynx Atropos</i> (?)
and the many-celled nidus of the leaf-cutter bee, were very
common.</p>

<p>A large columnar <i>Euphorbia</i> (<i>E. ligulata</i>) is common
all along the Soane, and I observed it to be used everywhere for
fencing. I had not remarked the <i>E. neriifolia</i>; and the <i>E.
tereticaulis</i> had been very rarely seen since leaving Calcutta.
The <i>Cactus</i> is nowhere found; it is abundant in many parts of
Bengal, but certainly not indigenous.</p>

<p>From this place onwards up the Soane, there was no
road of any kind, and we were compelled to be our own road
engineers. The sameness of the vegetation and lateness of the
season made me regret this the less, for I was disappointed in my
anticipations of finding luxuriance and novelty in these wilds.
Before us the valley narrowed considerably, the forest became
denser, the country on the south side was broken with rounded
hills, and on the north the noble cliffs of the Kymore dipped down
to the river. The villages were smaller, more scattered and
poverty-stricken, with the Mahowa and Mango as the usual trees; the
banyan, peepul, and tamarind being rare. The native, are of an
aboriginal jungle race; and are tall, athletic, erect, much less
indolent and more spirited than the listless natives of the
plains.</p>

<p><i>February 21.</i>&mdash;Started at daylight: but so slow and
difficult was our progress through fields and woods, and across
deep gorges from the hills, that we only advanced five miles in the
day; the elephant&rsquo;s head too was aching too badly to let him
push, and the cattle would not proceed when the draught was not
equal. What was worse, it was impossible to get them to pull
together up the inclined planes we cut, except by placing a man at
the head of each of the six, eight, or ten in a team, and
simultaneously screwing round their tails; when one tortured animal
sometimes capsizes the vehicle. The small carts got on better,
though it was most nervous to see them rushing down the steeps,
especially those with our fragile instruments, etc.</p>

<p>Kosdera, where we halted, is a pretty place, elevated 440 feet,
with a broad stream front the hills flowing past it. These hills
are of limestone, and rounded, resting upon others of hornstone and
jasper. Following up the stream</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 50">[ 50 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">I came to some rapids, where the stream is crossed
by large beds of hornstone and porphyry rocks, excessively hard,
and pitched up at right angles, or with a bold dip to the north.
The number of strata was very great, and only a few inches or even
lines thick: they presented all varieties of jasper, hornstone, and
quartz of numerous colours, with occasional seams of porphyry or
breccia. The racks were elegantly fringed with a fern I had not
hitherto seen, <i>Polypodium proliferum,</i> which is the only
species the Soane valley presents at this season.</p>

<p>Returning over the hills, I found <i>Hardwickia binata,</i> a
most elegant leguminous tree, tall, erect, with an elongated coma,
and the branches pendulous. These trees grew in a shallow bed of
alluvium, enclosing abundance of agate pebbles and kunker, the
former derived from the quartzy strata above noticed.</p>

<p>On the 23rd and 24th we continued to follow up the Soane, first
to Panchadurma (alt. 490 feet), and thence to Pepura (alt. 587
feet), the country becoming densely wooded, very wild, and
picturesque, the woods being full of monkeys, parrots, peacocks,
hornbills, and wild animals. <i>Strychnos potatorum,</i> whose
berries are used to purify water, forms a dense foliaged tree, 30
to 60 feet high, some individuals pale yellow, others deep green,
both in apparent health. <i>Feronia Elephantum</i> and <i>
&AElig;gle marmelos</i>* were very abundant, with <i>Sterculia,</i>
and the dwarf date-palm.</p>

<p>One of my carts was here hopelessly broken down; advancing on
the spokes instead of the tire of the wheels. By the banks of a
deep gully here the rocks are well exposed: they consist of soft
clay shales resting on the</p>

medical practice, as an astringent of great effect, in cases of

<p class="first">limestone, which is nearly horizontal; and this
again, unconformably on the quartz and hornstone rocks, which are
confused, and tilted up at all angles.</p>

<p>A spur of the Kymore, like that of Rotas, here projects to the
bed of the river, and was blazing at night with the beacon-like
fires of the natives, lighted to scare the tigers and bears from
the spots where they cut wood and bamboo; they afforded a splendid
spectacle, the flames in some places leaping zig-zag from hill to
hill in front of us, and looking as if a gigantic letter W were
written in fire.</p>

<p>The night was bright and clear, with much lightning, the latter
attracted to the spur, and darting down as it were to mingle its
fire with that of the forest; so many flashes appeared to strike on
the flames, that it is probable the heated air in their
neighbourhood attracted them. We were awakened between 3 and 4
a.m., by a violent dust-storm, which threatened to carry away the
tents. Our position at the mouth of the gulley formed by the
opposite hills, no doubt accounted for it. The gusts were so
furious that it was impossible to observe the barometer, which I
returned to its case on ascertaining that any indications of a rise
or fall in the column must have been quite trifling. The night had
been oppressively hot, with many insects flying about; amongst
which I noticed earwigs, a genus erroneously supposed rarely to
take to the wing in Britain.</p>

<p>At 8.30 a.m. it suddenly fell calm, and we proceeded to Chanchee
(alt. 500 feet), the native carts breaking down in their passage
over the projecting beds of flinty rocks, or as they burned down
the inclined planes we cut through the precipitous clay banks of
the streams. Near Chanchee we passed an alligator, just killed by
two men, a foul beast, about nine feet long, of the mugger kind.

<p class="first">absorbing than its natural history was the
circumstance of its having swallowed a child, that was playing in
the water as its mother was washing her utensils in the river. The
brute was hardly dead, much distended by the prey, and the mother
was standing beside it. A very touching group was this: the parent
with her hands clasped in agony, unable to withdraw her eyes from
the cursed reptile, which still clung to life with that tenacity
for which its tribe are so conspicuous; beside these the two
athletes leaned on the bloody bamboo staffs, with which they had
all but despatched the animal.</p>

<p>This poor woman earned a scanty maintenance by making catechu:
inhabiting a little cottage, and having no property but two cattle
to bring wood from the hills, and a very few household chattels;
and how few of these they only know who have seen the meagre
furniture of Danga hovels. Her husband cut the trees in the forest
and dragged them to the hut, but at this time he was sick, and her
only boy, her future stay, it was, whom the beast had devoured.</p>

<p>This province is famous for the quantity of catechu its dry
forests yield. The plant (<i>Acacia</i>) is a little thorny tree,
erect, and bearing a rounded head of well remembered prickly
branches. Its wood is yellow, with a dark brick-red heart, most
profitable in January and useless in June (for yielding the
extract).</p>

<p>The <i>Butea frondosa</i> was abundantly in flower here, and a
gorgeous sight. In mass the inflorescence resembles sheets of
flame, and individually the flowers are eminently beautiful, the
bright orange-red petals contrasting brilliantly against the
jet-black velvety calyx. The nest of the <i>Megachile</i>
(leaf-cutter bee) was in thousands in the cliffs, with Mayflies,
Caddis-worms, spiders, and many predaceous</p>

<p class="first">beetles. Lamellicorn beetles were very rare, even
<i>Aphodius,</i> and of <i>Cetoni&aelig;</i> I did not see one.</p>

<p>We marched on the 28th to Kota, at the junction of the river of
that name with the Soane, over hills of flinty rock, which
projected everywhere, to the utter ruin of the elephants&rsquo;
feet, and then over undulating hills of limestone; on the latter I
found trees of <i>Cochlospermum,</i> whose curious thick branches
spread out somewhat awkwardly, each tipped with a cluster of golden
yellow flowers, as large as the palm of the hand, and very
beautiful: it is a tropical Gum-Cistus in the appearance and
texture of the petals, and their frail nature. The bark abounds in
a transparent gum, of which the white ants seem fond, for they had
killed many trees. Of the leaves the curious rude leaf-bellows are
made, with which the natives of these hills smelt iron. Scorpions
appeared very common here, of a small kind, 1.5 inch long; several
were captured, and one of our party was stung on the finger; the
smart was burning for an hour or two, and then ceased.</p>

<p>At Kota we were nearly opposite the cliffs at Beejaghur, where
coal is reported to exist; and here we again crossed the Soane, and
for the last time. The ford is three miles up the river, and we
marched to it through deep sand. The bed of the river is here 500
feet above the sea, and about three-quarters of a mile broad, the
rapid stream being 50 or 60 yards wide, and breast deep. The sand
is firm and siliceous, with no mica; nodules of coal are said to be
washed down thus far from the coal-beds of Burdee, a good deal
higher up, but we saw none.</p>

<p>The cliffs come close to the river on the opposite side, their
bases clothed with woods which teemed with birds. The soil is
richer, and individual trees, especially of <i>Bombax,
Terminalia</i> and <i>Mahowa,</i> very fine; one tree of</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 54">[ 54 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">the <i>Hardwickia,</i> about 120 feet high, was as
handsome a monarch of the forest as I ever saw, and it is not often
that one sees trees in the tropics, which for a combination of
beauty in outline, harmony of colour, and arrangement of branches
and foliage, would form so striking an addition to an English
park.</p>

<p>There is a large break in the Kymore hills here, beyond the
village of Kunch, through which our route lay to Beejaghur, and the
Ganges at Mirzapore; the cliff&rsquo;s leaving the river and
trending to the north in a continuous escarpment flanked with low
ranges of rounded hills, and terminating in an abrupt spur
(Mungeesa Peak) whose summit was covered with a ragged forest. At
Kunch we saw four alligators sleeping in the river, looking at a
distance like logs of wood, all of the short-nosed or mugger kind,
dreaded by man and beast; I saw none of the sharp-shouted (or
garial), so common on the Ganges, where their long bills, with a
garniture of teeth and prominent eyes peeping out of the water,
remind one of geological lectures and visions of <i>
Ichthyosauri.</i> Tortoises were frequent in the river, basking on
the rocks, and popping into the water when approached.</p>

<p>On the 1st of March we left the Soane, and struck inland over a
rough hilly country, covered with forest, fully 1000 feet below the
top of the Kymore table-land, which here recedes from the river and
surrounds an undulating plain, some ten miles either way, facing
the south. The roads, or rather pathways, were very bad, and quite
impassable for the carts without much engineering, cutting through
forest, smoothing down the banks of the watercourses to be crossed,
and clearing away the rocks as we best might. We traversed the
empty bed of a mountain torrent, with perpendicular banks of
alluvium 30 feet high, and thence plunged into a dense forest. Our
course was</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 55">[ 55 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="app1">
directed towards Mungeesa Peak, the remarkable
projecting spur, between which and a conical hill the path led.
Whether on the elephants or on foot, the thorny jujubes, <i>
Acacias,</i> etc. were most troublesome, and all our previous
scratchings were nothing to this. Peacocks and jungle-fowl were
very frequent, the squabbling of the former and the hooting of the
monkeys constantly grating on the ear. There were innumerable
pigeons and a few Floricans (a kind of bustard&mdash;considered the
best eating game-bird in India). From the defile we emerged on an
open flat, halting at Sulkun, a scattered village (alt. 684 feet),
peopled by a bold-looking race (Coles)* who habitually carry the
spear and shield. We had here the pleasure of meeting Mr. Felle, an
English gentleman employed in the Revenue department; this being
one of the roads along which the natives transport their salt,
sugar, etc., from one province to another.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I examined the conical hill, which, like that
near Rotas, is of stratified beds of limestone, capped with
sandstone. A stream runs round its base, cutting through the
alluvium to the subjacent rock, which is exposed, and contains
flattened spheres of limestone. These spheres are from the size of
a fist to a child&rsquo;s head, or even much larger; they are
excessively hard, and neither laminated nor formed of concentric
layers. At the top of the hill the sandstone cap was perpendicular
on all sides, and its dry top covered with small trees, especially
of <i>Cochlospermum.</i> A few larger trees of <i>Fici</i> clung to
the edge of the rocks, and by forcing their roots into the
interstices detached enormous masses, affording good dens</p>

<p class="fnote">* The Coles, like the Danghas of the Rajmahal and
Behar hills, and the natives of the mountains of the peninsula,
form one of the aboriginal tribes of British India, and are widely
different people from either the Hindoos or Mussulmen.</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 56">[ 56 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">for bears and other wild animals. From the top,
the view of rock, river, forest, and plain, was very fine, the eye
ranging over a broad flat, girt by precipitous hills;&mdash;West,
the Kymore or Vindhya range rose again in rugged elevations; South,
flowed the Soane, backed by ranges of wooded hills, smoking like
volcanos with the fires of the natives;&mdash;below, lay the bed of
the stream we had left at the foot of the hills, cutting its way
through the alluvium, and following a deep gorge to the Soane,
which was there hidden by the rugged heights we had crossed, on
which the greater part of our camp might be seen still straggling
onwards;&mdash;east, and close above us, the bold spur of Mungeesa
shot up, terminating a continuous stretch of red precipices,
clothed with forest along their bases, and over their horizontal
tops.</p>

<p>From Sulkun the view of the famed fort and palace of Beejaghur
is very singular, planted on the summit of an isolated hill of
sandstone, about ten miles off. A large tree by the palace marks
its site; for, at this distance, the buildings are themselves
undistinguishable.</p>

<p>There are many tigers on these hills; and as one was close by,
and had killed several cattle, Mr. Felle kindly offered us a chance
of slaying him. Bullocks are tethered out, over-night, in the
places likely to be visited by the brute; he kills one of them, and
is from the spot tracked to his haunt by natives, who visit the
stations early in the morning, and report the whereabouts of his
lair. The sportsman then goes to the attack mounted on an elephant,
or having a <i>roost</i> fixed in a tree, on the trail of the
tiger, and he employs some hundred natives to drive the animal past
the lurking-place.</p>

<p>On the present occasion, the locale of the tiger was doubtful;
but it was thought that by beating over several</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 57">[ 57 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">miles of country he (or at any rate, some other
game) might be driven past a certain spot. Thither, accordingly,
the natives were sent, who built machans (stages) in the trees,
high out of danger&rsquo;s reach; Mr. Theobald and myself occupied
one of these perches in a <i>Hardwickia</i> tree, and Mr. Felle
another, close by, both on the slope of a steep hill, surrounded by
jungly valleys. We were also well thatched in with leafy boughs, to
prevent the wary beast from espying the ambush, and had a whole
stand of shall arms ready for his reception.</p>

<p>When roosted aloft, and duly charged to keep profound silence
(which I obeyed to the letter, by falling sound asleep), the word
was passed to the beaters, who surrounded our post on the
plain-side, extending some miles in line, and full two or three
distant from us. They entered the jungle, beating tom-toms, singing
and shouting as they advanced, and converging towards our position.
In the noonday solitude of these vast forests, our situation was
romantic enough: there was not a breath of wind, an insect or bird
stirring; and the wild cries of the men, and the hollow sound of
the drums broke upon the ear from a great distance, gradually
swelling and falling, as the natives ascended the heights or
crossed the valleys. After about an hour and a half, the beaters
emerged from the jungle under our retreat; one by one, two by two,
but preceded by no single living thing, either mouse, bird, deer,
or bear, and much less tiger. The beaters received about a penny
a-piece for the day&rsquo;s work; a rich guerdon for these poor
wretches, whom necessity sometimes drives to feed on rats and
offal.</p>

<p>We were detained three days at Sulkun, from inability to get on
with the carts; and as the pass over the Kymore to the north (on
the way to Mirzapore) was to be still worse, I took advantage of
Mr. Felle&rsquo;s kind offer of camels</p>

<br>
<hr>
<p class="page"><a name="page 58">[ 58 ]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="first">and elephants to make the best of my way forward,
accompanying that gentleman, <i>en route,</i> to his residence at
Shahgunj, on the table-land.</p>

<p>Both the climate and natural history of this flat on which
Sulkun stands, are similar to those of the banks of the Soane; the
crops are wretched. At this season the dryness of the atmosphere is
excessive: our nails cracked, and skins peeled, whilst all articles
of wood, tortoiseshell, etc., broke on the slightest blow. The air,
too, was always highly electrical, and the dew-point was frequently
40&deg; below the temperature of the air.</p>

<p>The natives are far from honest: they robbed one of the tents
placed between two others, wherein a light was burning. One
gentleman in it was awake, and on turning saw five men at his
bedside, who escaped with a bag of booty, in the shape of clothes,
and a tempting strong brass-bound box, containing private letters.
The clothes they dropped outside, but the box of letters was
carried off. There were about a hundred people asleep outside the
tents, between whose many fires the rogues must have passed,
eluding also the guard, who were, or ought to have been, awake.</p>
