INVENTOR OF THE WIRELESS TELEGRAPH</p>

<h2><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p>Before delving into the mysteries of receiving and sending messages
without wires, a word as to the history of the art and its present day
applications may be of service. While popular interest in the subject
has gone forward by leaps and bounds within the last two or three
years, it has been a matter of scientific experiment for more than a
quarter of a century.</p>

<p>The wireless telegraph was invented by William Marconi, at Bologna,
Italy, in 1896, and in his first experiments he sent dot and dash
signals to a distance of 200 or 300 feet. The wireless telephone was
invented by the author of this book at Narberth, Penn., in 1899, and
in his first experiments the human voice was transmitted to a distance
of three blocks.</p>

<p>The first vital experiments that led up to the invention of the
wireless telegraph were made by Heinrich Hertz, of Germany, in 1888
when he showed that the spark of an induction coil set up electric
oscillations in an open circuit, and that the energy of these waves
was, in turn, sent out in the form of electric waves. He also showed
how they could be received at a distance by means of a ring detector,
which he called a <i>resonator</i>.</p>

<p>In 1890, Edward Branly, of France, showed that metal filings in a
tube cohered when electric waves acted on them, and this device he
termed a <i>radio conductor</i>; this was improved upon by Sir Oliver
Lodge, who called it a coherer. In 1895, Alexander Popoff, of Russia,
constructed a receiving set for the study of atmospheric electricity,
and this arrangement was the earliest on record of the use of a
detector connected with an aerial and the earth.</p>

<p>Marconi was the first to connect an aerial to one side of a spark
gap and a ground to the other side of it. He used an induction coil to
energize the spark gap, and a telegraph key in the primary circuit to
break up the current into signals. Adding a Morse register, which
printed the dot and dash messages on a tape, to the Popoff receptor he
produced the first system for sending and receiving wireless telegraph
messages.</p>

<p>After Marconi had shown the world how to telegraph without
connecting wires it would seem, on first thought, to be an easy matter
to telephone without wires, but not so, for the electric spark sets up
damped and periodic oscillations and these cannot be used for
transmitting speech. Instead, the oscillations must be of constant
amplitude and continuous. That a direct current arc light transforms a
part of its energy into electric oscillations was shown by Firth and
Rogers, of England, in 1893.</p>

<p>The author was the first to connect an arc lamp with an aerial and
a ground, and to use a microphone transmitter to modulate the
sustained oscillations so set up. The receiving apparatus consisted of
a variable contact, known as a <i>pill-box</i> detector, which Sir
Oliver Lodge had devised, and to this was connected an Ericsson
telephone receiver, then the most sensitive made. A later improvement
for setting up sustained oscillations was the author's <i>rotating
oscillation arc.</i></p>

<p>Since those memorable days of more than two decades ago, wonderful
advances have been made in both of these methods of transmitting
intelligence, and the end is as yet nowhere in sight. Twelve or
fifteen years ago the boys began to get fun out of listening-in to
what the ship and shore stations were sending and, further, they began
to do a little sending on their own account. These youngsters, who
caused the professional operators many a pang, were the first wireless
amateurs, and among them experts were developed who are foremost in
the practice of the art today.</p>

<p>Away back there, the spark coil and the arc lamp were the only
known means for setting up oscillations at the sending end, while the
electrolytic and crystal detectors were the only available means for
the amateur to receive them. As it was next to impossible for a boy to
get a current having a high enough voltage for operating an
oscillation arc lamp, wireless telephony was out of the question for
him, so he had to stick to the spark coil transmitter which needed
only a battery current to energize it, and this, of course, limited
him to sending Morse signals. As the electrolytic detector was
cumbersome and required a liquid, the crystal detector which came into
being shortly after was just as sensitive and soon displaced the
former, even as this had displaced the coherer.</p>

<p>A few years ahead of these amateurs, that is to say in 1905, J. A.
Fleming, of England, invented the vacuum tube detector, but ten more
years elapsed before it was perfected to a point where it could
compete with the crystal detector. Then its use became general and
workers everywhere sought to, and did improve it. Further, they found
that the vacuum tube would not only act as a detector, but that if
energized by a direct current of high voltage it would set up
sustained oscillations like the arc lamp, and the value of sustained
oscillations for wireless telegraphy as well as wireless telephony had
already been discovered.</p>

<p>The fact that the vacuum tube oscillator requires no adjustment of
its elements, that its initial cost is much less than the oscillation
arc, besides other considerations, is the reason that it popularized
wireless telephony; and because continuous waves have many advantages
over periodic oscillations is the reason the vacuum tube oscillator is
replacing the spark coil as a wireless telegraph transmitter.
Moreover, by using a number of large tubes in parallel, powerful
oscillations can be set up and, hence, the waves sent out are radiated
to enormous distances.</p>

<p>While oscillator tubes were being experimented with in the research
laboratories of the General Electric, the Westinghouse, the Radio
Corporation of America, and other big companies, all the youthful
amateurs in the country had learned that by using a vacuum tube as a
detector they could easily get messages 500 miles away. The use of
these tubes as amplifiers also made it possible to employ a loud
speaker, so that a room, a hall, or an out-of-door audience could hear
clearly and distinctly everything that was being sent out.</p>

<p>The boy amateur had only to let father or mother listen-in, and
they were duly impressed when he told them they were getting it from
KDKA (the Pittsburgh station of the Westinghouse Co.), for was not
Pittsburgh 500 miles away! And so they, too, became enthusiastic
wireless amateurs. This new interest of the grown-ups was at once met
not only by the manufacturers of apparatus with complete receiving and
sending sets, but also by the big companies which began broadcasting
regular programs consisting of music and talks on all sorts of
interesting subjects.</p>

<p>This is the wireless, or radio, as the average amateur knows it
today. But it is by no means the limit of its possibilities. On the
contrary, we are just beginning to realize what it may mean to the
human race. The Government is now utilizing it to send out weather,
crop and market reports. Foreign trade conditions are being reported.
The Naval Observatory at Arlington is wirelessing time signals.</p>

<p>Department stores are beginning to issue programs and advertise by
radio! Cities are also taking up such programs, and they will
doubtless be included soon among the regular privileges of the
tax-payers. Politicians address their constituents. Preachers reach
the stay-at-homes. Great singers thrill thousands instead of hundreds.
Soon it will be possible to hear the finest musical programs,
entertainers, and orators, without budging from one's easy chair.</p>

<p>In the World War wireless proved of inestimable value. Airplanes,
instead of flying aimlessly, kept in constant touch with headquarters.
Bodies of troops moved alertly and intelligently. Ships at sea talked
freely, over hundreds of miles. Scouts reported. Everywhere its
invisible aid was invoked.</p>

<p>In time of peace, however, it has proved and will prove the
greatest servant of mankind. Wireless messages now go daily from
continent to continent, and soon will go around the world with the
same facility. Ships in distress at sea can summon aid. Vessels
everywhere get the day's news, even to baseball scores. Daily new
tasks are being assigned this tireless, wireless messenger.</p>

<p>Messages have been sent and received by moving trains, the
Lackawanna and the Rock Island railroads being pioneers in this field.
Messages have also been received by automobiles, and one inventor has
successfully demonstrated a motor car controlled entirely by wireless.
This method of communication is being employed more and more by
newspapers. It is also of great service in reporting forest fires.</p>

<p>Colleges are beginning to take up the subject, some of the first
being Tufts College, Hunter College, Princeton, Yale, Harvard, and
Columbia, which have regularly organized departments for students in
wireless.</p>

<p>Instead of the unwieldy and formidable looking apparatus of a short
time ago, experimenters are now vying with each other in making small
or novel equipment. Portable sets of all sorts are being fashioned,
from one which will go into an ordinary suitcase, to one so small it
will easily slip into a Brownie camera. One receiver depicted in a
newspaper was one inch square! Another was a ring for the finger, with
a setting one inch by five-eighths of an inch, and an umbrella as a
"ground." Walking sets with receivers fastened to one's belt are also
common. Daily new novelties and marvels are announced.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the radio amateur to whom this book is addressed may
have his share in the joys of wireless. To get all of these good
things out of the ether one does not need a rod or a gun--only a
copper wire made fast at either end and a receiving set of some kind.
If you are a sheer beginner, then you must be very careful in buying
your apparatus, for since the great wave of popularity has washed
wireless into the hearts of the people, numerous companies have sprung
up and some of these are selling the veriest kinds of junk.</p>

<p>And how, you may ask, are you going to be able to know the good
from the indifferent and bad sets? By buying a make of a firm with an
established reputation. I have given a few offhand at the end of this
book. Obviously there are many others of merit--so many, indeed, that
it would be quite impossible to get them all in such a list, but these
will serve as a guide until you can choose intelligently for
yourself.</p>

<h3>HOW TO BEGIN WIRELESS</h3>

<p>In writing this book it is taken for granted that you are:
<i>first</i>, one of the several hundred thousand persons in the
United States who are interested in wireless telegraphy and telephony;
<i>second</i>, that you would like to install an apparatus in your
home, and <i>third</i>, that it is all new to you.</p>

<p>Now if you live in a city or town large enough to support an
electrical supply store, there you will find the necessary apparatus
on sale, and someone who can tell you what you want to know about it
and how it works. If you live away from the marts and hives of
industry you can send to various makers of wireless apparatus
[Footnote: A list of makers of wireless apparatus will be found in the
<a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>.] for their catalogues and
price-lists and these will give you much useful information. But in
either case it is the better plan for you to know before you start in
to buy an outfit exactly what apparatus you need to produce the result
you have in mind, and this you can gain in easy steps by reading this
book.</p>

<p><i>Kinds of Wireless Systems</i>.--There are two distinct kinds of
wireless systems and these are: the <i>wireless telegraph</i> system,
and the <i>wireless telephone</i> system. The difference between the
wireless telegraph and the wireless telephone is that the former
transmits messages by means of a <i>telegraph key</i>, and the latter
transmits conversation and music by means of a <i>microphone
transmitter</i>. In other words, the same difference exists between
them in this respect as between the Morse telegraph and the Bell
telephone.</p>

<p><i>Parts of a Wireless System</i>.--Every complete wireless
station, whether telegraph or telephone, consists of three chief
separate and distinct parts and these are: (<i>a</i>) the <i>aerial
wire system</i>, or <i>antenna</i> as it is often called, (<i>b</i>)
the <i>transmitter</i>, or <i>sender</i>, and (<i>c</i>) the
<i>receiver</i>, or, more properly, the <i>receptor</i>. The aerial
wire is precisely the same for either wireless telegraphy or wireless
telephony. The transmitter of a wireless telegraph set generally uses
a <i>spark gap</i> for setting up the electric oscillations, while
usually for wireless telephony a <i>vacuum tube</i> is employed for
this purpose. The receptor for wireless telegraphy and telephony is
the same and may include either a <i>crystal detector</i> or a
<i>vacuum tube detector</i>, as will be explained presently.</p>

<p><i>The Easiest Way to Start.</i>--First of all you must obtain a
government license to operate a sending set, but you do not need a
license to put up and use a receiving set, though you are required by
law to keep secret any messages which you may overhear. Since no
license is needed for a receiving set the easiest way to break into
the wireless game is to put up an aerial and hook up a receiving set
to it; you can then listen-in and hear what is going on in the
all-pervading ether around you, and you will soon find enough to make
things highly entertaining.</p>

<p>Nearly all the big wireless companies have great stations fitted
with powerful telephone transmitters and at given hours of the day and
night they send out songs by popular singers, dance music by jazz
orchestras, fashion talks by and for the ladies, agricultural reports,
government weather forecasts and other interesting features. Then by
simply shifting the slide on your tuning coil you can often tune-in
someone who is sending <i>Morse</i>, that is, messages in the dot and
dash code, or, perhaps a friend who has a wireless telephone
transmitter and is talking. Of course, if you want to <i>talk back</i>
you must have a wireless transmitter, either telegraphic or
telephonic, and this is a much more expensive part of the apparatus
than the receptor, both in its initial cost and in its operation. A
wireless telegraph transmitter is less costly than a wireless
telephone transmitter and it is a very good scheme for you to learn to
send and receive telegraphic messages.</p>

<p>At the present time, however, there are fifteen amateur receiving
stations in the United States to every sending station, so you can see
that the majority of wireless folks care more for listening in to the
broadcasting of news and music than to sending out messages on their
own account. The easiest way to begin wireless, then, is to put up an
aerial and hook up a receiving set to it.</p>

<p><i>About Aerial Wire Systems.</i>--To the beginner who wants to
install a wireless station the aerial wire system usually looms up as
the biggest obstacle of all, and especially is this true if his house
is without a flag pole, or other elevation from which the aerial wire
can be conveniently suspended.</p>

<p>If you live in the congested part of a big city where there are no
yards and, particularly, if you live in a flat building or an
apartment house, you will have to string your aerial wire on the roof,
and to do this you should get the owner's, or agent's, permission.
This is usually an easy thing to do where you only intend to receive
messages, for one or two thin wires supported at either end of the
building are all that are needed. If for any reason you cannot put
your aerial on the roof then run a wire along the building outside of
your apartment, and, finally, if this is not feasible, connect your
receiver to a wire strung up in your room, or even to an iron or a
brass bed, and you can still get the near-by stations.</p>

<p>An important part of the aerial wire system is the <i>ground</i>,
that is, your receiving set must not only be connected with the aerial
wire, but with a wire that leads to and makes good contact with the
moist earth of the ground. Where a house or a building is piped for
gas, water or steam, it is easy to make a ground connection, for all
you have to do is to fasten the wire to one of the pipes with a clamp.
[Footnote: Pipes are often insulated from the ground, which makes them
useless for this purpose.] Where the house is isolated then a lot of
wires or a sheet of copper or of zinc must be buried in the ground at
a sufficient depth to insure their being kept moist.</p>

<p><i>About the Receiving Apparatus</i>.--You can either buy the parts
of the receiving apparatus separate and hook them up yourself, or you
can buy the apparatus already assembled in a set which is, in the
beginning, perhaps, the better way.</p>

<p>The simplest receiving set consists of (1) a <i>detector</i>, (2) a
<i>tuning coil</i>, and (3) a <i>telephone receiver</i> and these
three pieces of apparatus are, of course, connected together and are
also connected to the aerial and ground as the diagram in <i>Fig.
1</i> clearly shows. There are two chief kinds of detectors used at
the present time and these are: (<i>a</i>) the <i>crystal
detector</i>, and (<i>b</i>) the <i>vacuum tube detector</i>. The
crystal detector is the cheapest and simplest, but it is not as
sensitive as the vacuum tube detector and it requires frequent
adjustment. A crystal detector can be used with or without a battery
while the vacuum tube detector requires two small batteries.</p>

<a name="fig001"><img width="600" height="337" src="fig001-002.png"
alt=
"Fig. 1.--Simple Receiving Set. Fig. 2.--Simple Transmitting Set."></a>


<p>A tuning coil of the simplest kind consists of a single layer of
copper wire wound on a cylinder with an adjustable, or sliding,
contact, but for sharp tuning you need a <i>loose coupled tuning
coil</i>. Where a single coil tuner is used a <i>fixed</i> condenser
should be connected around the telephone receivers. Where a loose
coupled tuner is employed you should have a variable condenser
connected across the <i>closed oscillation circuit</i> and a <i>fixed
condenser</i> across the telephone receivers.</p>

<p>When listening-in to distant stations the energy of the received
wireless waves is often so very feeble that in order to hear
distinctly an <i>amplifier</i> must be used. To amplify the incoming
sounds a vacuum tube made like a detector is used and sometimes as
many as half-a-dozen of these tubes are connected in the receiving
circuit, or in <i>cascade</i>, as it is called, when the sounds are
<i>amplified</i>, that is magnified, many hundreds of times.</p>

<p>The telephone receiver of a receiving set is equally as important
as the detector. A single receiver can be used but a pair of receivers
connected with a head-band gives far better results. Then again the
higher the resistance of the receivers the more sensitive they often
are and those wound to as high a resistance as 3,200 ohms are made for
use with the best sets. To make the incoming signals, conversation or
music, audible to a room full of people instead of to just yourself
you must use what is called a <i>loud speaker</i>. In its simplest
form this consists of a metal cone like a megaphone to which is fitted
a telephone receiver.</p>

<p><i>About Transmitting Stations--Getting Your License.</i>--If you
are going to install a wireless sending apparatus, either telegraphic
or telephonic, you will have to secure a government license for which
no fee or charge of any kind is made. There are three classes of
licenses issued to amateurs who want to operate transmitting stations
and these are: (1) the <i>restricted amateur license</i>, (2) the
<i>general amateur license</i>, and (3) the <i>special amateur
license</i>.</p>

<p>If you are going to set up a transmitter within five nautical miles
of any naval wireless station then you will have to get a
<i>restricted amateur license</i> which limits the current you use to
half a <i>kilowatt</i> [Footnote: A <i>Kilowatt</i> is 1,000
<i>watts</i>. There are 746 watts in a horsepower.] and the wave
length you send out to 200 <i>meters</i>. Should you live outside of
the five-mile range of a navy station then you can get a general
amateur license and this permits you to use a current of 1 kilowatt,
but you are likewise limited to a wave length of 200 meters. But if
you can show that you are doing some special kind of wireless work and
not using your sending station for the mere pleasure you are getting
out of it you may be able to get a <i>special amateur license</i>
which gives you the right to send out wave lengths up to 375
meters.</p>

<p>When you are ready to apply for your license write to the <i>Radio
Inspector</i> of whichever one of the following districts you live
in:</p>

<pre>
  First District..............Boston, Mass.
  Second   "    ..............New York City
  Third    "    ..............Baltimore, Md.
  Fourth   "    ..............Norfolk, Va.
  Fifth    "    ..............New Orleans, La.
  Sixth    "    ............. San Francisco, Cal.
  Seventh  "    ............. Seattle, Wash.
  Eighth   "    ............. Detroit, Mich.
  Ninth    "    ..............Chicago, Ill.
</pre>

<p><i>Kinds of Transmitters</i>.--There are two general types of
transmitters used for sending out wireless messages and these are: (1)
<i>wireless telegraph</i> transmitters, and (2) <i>wireless
telephone</i> transmitters. Telegraph transmitters may use either:
(<i>a</i>) a <i>jump-spark</i>, (<i>b</i>) an <i>electric arc</i>, or
(<i>c</i>) a <i>vacuum tube</i> apparatus for sending out dot and dash
messages, while telephone transmitters may use either, (<i>a</i>) an
<i>electric arc</i>, or (<i>b</i>) a <i>vacuum tube</i> for sending
out vocal and musical sounds. Amateurs generally use a
<i>jump-spark</i> for sending wireless telegraph messages and the
<i>vacuum tube</i> for sending wireless telephone messages.</p>

<p><i>The Spark Gap Wireless Telegraph Transmitter</i>.--The simplest
kind of a wireless telegraph transmitter consists of: (1) a <i>source
of direct or alternating current</i>, (2) a <i>telegraph key</i>, (3)
a <i>spark-coil</i> or a <i>transformer</i>, (4) a <i>spark gap</i>,
(5) an <i>adjustable condenser</i> and (6) an <i>oscillation
transformer</i>. Where <i>dry cells</i> or a <i>storage battery</i>
must be used to supply the current for energizing the transmitter a
spark-coil can be employed and these may be had in various sizes from
a little fellow which gives 1/4-inch spark up to a larger one which
gives a 6-inch spark. Where more energy is needed it is better
practice to use a transformer and this can be worked on an alternating
current of 110 volts, or if only a 110 volt direct current is
available then an <i>electrolytic interrupter</i> must be used to make
and break the current. A simple transmitting set with an induction
coil is shown in <i>Fig. 2</i>.</p>

<p>A wireless key is made like an ordinary telegraph key except that
where large currents are to be used it is somewhat heavier and is
provided with large silver contact points. Spark gaps for amateur work
are usually of: (1) the <i>plain</i> or <i>stationary type</i>, (2)
the <i>rotating type</i>, and (3) the <i>quenched gap</i> type. The
plain spark-gap is more suitable for small spark-coil sets, and it is
not so apt to break down the transformer and condenser of the larger
sets as the rotary gap. The rotary gap on the other hand tends to
prevent <i>arcing</i> and so the break is quicker and there is less
dragging of the spark. The quenched gap is more efficient than either
the plain or rotary gap and moreover it is noiseless.</p>

<p>Condensers for spark telegraph transmitters can be ordinary Leyden
jars or glass plates coated with tin or copper foil and set into a
frame, or they can be built up of mica and sheet metal embedded in an
insulating composition. The glass plate condensers are the cheapest
and will serve your purpose well, especially if they are immersed in
oil. Tuning coils, sometimes called <i>transmitting inductances</i>
and <i>oscillation transformers</i>, are of various types. The
simplest kind is a transmitting inductance which consists of 25 or 30
turns of copper wire wound on an insulating tube or frame. An
oscillation transformer is a loose coupled tuning coil and it consists
of a primary coil formed of a number of turns of copper wire wound on
a fixed insulating support, and a secondary coil of about twice the
number of turns of copper wire which is likewise fixed in an
insulating support, but the coils are relatively movable. An
<i>oscillation transformer</i> (instead of a <i>tuning coil</i>), is
required by government regulations unless <i>inductively
coupled</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Vacuum Tube Telegraph Transmitter</i>.--This consists of:
(1) a <i>source of direct or alternating current</i>, (2) a
<i>telegraph key</i>, (3) a <i>vacuum tube oscillator</i>, (4) a
<i>tuning coil</i>, and (5) a <i>condenser</i>. This kind of a
transmitter sets up <i>sustained</i> oscillations instead of
<i>periodic</i> oscillations which are produced by a spark gap set.
The advantages of this kind of a system will be found explained in <a
href="#chap16">Chapter XVI</a>.</p>

<p><i>The Wireless Telephone Transmitter</i>.--Because a jump-spark
sets up <i>periodic oscillations</i>, that is, the oscillations are
discontinuous, it cannot be used for wireless telephony. An electric
arc or a vacuum tube sets up <i>sustained</i> oscillations, that is,
oscillations which are continuous. As it is far easier to keep the
oscillations going with a vacuum tube than it is with an arc the
former means has all but supplanted the latter for wireless telephone
transmitters. The apparatus required and the connections used for
wireless telephone sets will be described in later chapters.</p>

<p><i>Useful Information</i>.--It would be wise for the reader to turn
to the <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a>, beginning with page 301 of
this book, and familiarize himself with the information there set down
in tabular and graphic form. For example, the first table gives
abbreviations of electrical terms which are in general use in all
works dealing with the subject. You will also find there brief
definitions of electric and magnetic units, which it would be well to
commit to memory; or, at least, to make so thoroughly your own that
when any of these terms is mentioned, you will know instantly what is
being talked about.</p>

<h2><a name="chap02">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<h3>PUTTING UP YOUR AERIAL</h3>

<p>As inferred in the first chapter, an aerial for receiving does not
have to be nearly as well made or put up as one for sending. But this
does not mean that you can slipshod the construction and installation
of it, for however simple it is, the job must be done right and in
this case it is as easy to do it right as wrong.</p>

<p>To send wireless telegraph and telephone messages to the greatest
distances and to receive them as distinctly as possible from the
greatest distances you must use for your aerial (1) copper or aluminum
wire, (2) two or more wires, (3) have them the proper length, (4) have
them as high in the air as you can, (5) have them well apart from each
other, and (6) have them well insulated from their supports. If you
live in a flat building or an apartment house you can string your
aerial wires from one edge of the roof to the other and support them
by wooden stays as high above it as may be convenient.</p>

<p>Should you live in a detached house in the city you can usually get
your next-door neighbor to let you fasten one end of the aerial to his
house and this will give you a good stretch and a fairly high aerial.
In the country you can stretch your wires between the house and barn
or the windmill. From this you will see that no matter where you live
you can nearly always find ways and means of putting up an aerial that
will serve your needs without going to the expense of erecting a
mast.</p>

<p><i>Kinds of Aerial Wire Systems</i>.--An amateur wireless aerial
can be anywhere from 25 feet to 100 feet long and if you can get a
stretch of the latter length and a height of from 30 to 75 feet you
will have one with which you can receive a thousand miles or more and
send out as much energy as the government will allow you to send.</p>

<p>The kind of an aerial that gives the best results is one whose
wire, or wires, are <i>horizontal</i>, that is, parallel with the
earth under it as shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 3.</i> If only one end
can be fixed to some elevated support then you can secure the other
end to a post in the ground, but the slope of the aerial should not be
more than 30 or 35 degrees from the horizontal at most as shown at
<i>B</i>.</p>

<a name="fig003"><img width="600" height="262" src="fig003.png" alt=
"(A) Fig. 3.--Flat top, or Horizontal Aerial. (B) Fig. 3.--Inclined Aerial.">
</a> 

<p>The <i>leading-in wire</i>, that is, the wire that leads from and
joins the aerial wire with your sending and receiving set, can be
connected to the aerial anywhere it is most convenient to do so, but
the best results are had when it is connected to one end as shown at
<i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 4</i>, in which case it is called an <i>inverted L
aerial</i>, or when it is connected to it at the middle as shown at
<i>B</i>, when it is called a <i>T aerial</i>. The leading-in wire
must be carefully insulated from the outside of the building and also
where it passes through it to the inside. This is done by means of an
insulating tube known as a <i>leading-in insulator,</i> or <i>bulkhead
insulator</i> as it is sometimes called.</p>

<p>As a protection against lightning burning out your instruments you
can use either: (1) an <i>air-gap lightning arrester,</i> (2) a
<i>vacuum tube protector,</i> or (3) a <i>lightning switch,</i> which
is better. Whichever of these devices is used it is connected in
between the aerial and an outside ground wire so that a direct circuit
to the earth will be provided at all times except when you are sending
or receiving. So your aerial instead of being a menace really acts
during an electrical storm like a lightning rod and it is therefore a
real protection. The air-gap and vacuum tube lightning arresters are
little devices that can be used only where you are going to receive,
while the lightning switch must be used where you are going to send;
indeed, in some localities the <i>Fire Underwriters</i> require a
large lightning switch to be used for receiving sets as well as
sending sets.</p>

<p><i>How to Put Up a Cheap Receiving Aerial.</i>--The kind of an
aerial wire system you put up will depend, chiefly, on two things, and
these are: (1) your pocketbook, and (2) the place where you live.</p>

<p><i>A Single Wire Aerial.</i>--This is the simplest and cheapest
kind of a receiving aerial that can be put up. The first thing to do
is to find out the length of wire you need by measuring the span
between the two points of support; then add a sufficient length for
the leading-in wire and enough more to connect your receiving set with
the radiator or water pipe.</p>

<p>You can use any size of copper or aluminum wire that is not smaller
than <i>No. 16 Brown and Sharpe gauge.</i> When you buy the wire get
also the following material: (1) two <i>porcelain insulators</i> as
shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 5</i>; (2) three or four <i>porcelain
knob insulators</i>, see <i>B</i>; (3) either (<i>a</i>) an <i>air gap
lightning arrester,</i> see <i>C</i>, or (<i>b</i>) a <i>lightning
switch</i> see <i>D</i>; (4) a <i>leading-in porcelain tube
insulator,</i> see <i>E</i>, and (5) a <i>ground clamp</i>, see
<i>F</i>.</p>

<a name="fig005"><img width="600" height="251" src="fig005.png" alt=
"Fig. 5.--Material for a Simple Aerial Wire System."></a> 

<p>To make the aerial slip each end of the wire through a hole in each
insulator and twist it fast; next cut off and slip two more pieces of
wire through the other holes in the insulators and twist them fast and
then secure these to the supports at the ends of the building. Take
the piece you are going to use for the leading-in wire, twist it
around the aerial wire and solder it there when it will look like
<i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 6</i>. Now if you intend to use the <i>air gap
lightning arrester</i> fasten it to the wall of the building outside
of your window, and bring the leading-in wire from the aerial to the
top binding post of your arrester and keep it clear of everything as
shown at <i>B</i>. If your aerial is on the roof and you have to bring
the leading-in wire over the cornice or around a corner fix a
porcelain knob insulator to the one or the other and fasten the wire
to it.</p>

<a name="fig006a"><img width="600" height="233" src="fig006a.png" alt=
"(A) Fig. 6.--Single Wire Aerial for Receiving."></a> <a name=

<a name="fig006c"><img width="600" height="323" src="fig006c.png" alt=
"(C) Fig. 6.--Aerial with Lightning Switch."></a> 

<p>Next bore a hole through the frame of the window at a point nearest
your receiving set and push a porcelain tube 5/8 inch in diameter and
5 or 6 inches long, through it. Connect a length of wire to the top
post of the arrester or just above it to the wire, run this through
the leading-in insulator and connect it to the slider of your tuning
coil. Screw the end of a piece of heavy copper wire to the lower post
of the arrester and run it to the ground, on porcelain knobs if
necessary, and solder it to an iron rod or pipe which you have driven
into the earth. Finally connect the fixed terminal of your tuning coil
with the water pipe or radiator inside of the house by means of the
ground clamp as shown in the diagrammatic sketch at <i>B</i> in
<i>Fig. 6</i> and you are ready to tune in.</p>

<p>If you want to use a lightning switch instead of the air-gap
arrester then fasten it to the outside wall instead of the latter and
screw the free end of the leading-in wire from the aerial to the
middle post of it as shown at <i>C</i> in <i>Fig. 6</i>. Run a wire
from the top post through the leading-in insulator and connect it with
the slider of your tuning coil. Next screw one end of a length of
heavy copper wire to the lower post of the aerial switch and run it to
an iron pipe in the ground as described above in connection with the
spark-gap lightning arrester; then connect the fixed terminal of your
tuning coil with the radiator or water pipe and your aerial wire
system will be complete as shown at <i>C</i> in <i>Fig. 6</i>.</p>

<p><i>A Two-wire Aerial.</i>--An aerial with two wires will give
better results than a single wire and three wires are better than two,
but you must keep them well apart. To put up a two-wire aerial get (1)
enough <i>No. 16</i>, or preferably <i>No. 14</i>, solid or stranded
copper or aluminum wire, (2) four porcelain insulators, see <i>B</i>
in <i>Fig. 5</i>, and (3) two sticks about 1 inch thick, 3 inches wide
and 3 or 4 feet long, for the <i>spreaders</i>, and bore 1/8-inch hole
through each end of each one. Now twist the ends of the wires to the
insulators and then cut off four pieces of wire about 6 feet long and
run them through the holes in the wood spreaders. Finally twist the
ends of each pair of short wires to the free ends of the insulators
and then twist the free ends of the wires together.</p>

<p>For the leading-in wire that goes to the lightning switch take two
lengths of wire and twist one end of each one around the aerial wires
and solder them there. Twist the short wire around the long wire and
solder this joint also when the aerial will look like <i>Fig. 7</i>.
Bring the free end of the leading-in wire down to the middle post of
the lightning switch and fasten it there and connect up the receiver
to it and the ground as described under the caption of <i>A Single
Wire Aerial</i>.</p>

<a name="fig007"><img width="600" height="277" src="fig007.png" alt=
"Fig. 7.--Two Wire Aerial."></a> 

<p><i>Connecting in the Ground.</i>--If there is a gas or water system
or a steam-heating plant in your house you can make your ground
connection by clamping a ground clamp to the nearest pipe as has been
previously described. Connect a length of bare or insulated copper
wire with it and bring this up to the table on which you have your
receiving set. If there are no grounded pipes available then you will
have to make a good ground which we shall describe presently and lead
the ground wire from your receiving set out of the window and down to
it.</p>

<p><i>How to Put Up a Good Aerial.</i>--While you can use the cheap
aerial already described for a small spark-coil sending set you should
have a better insulated one for a 1/2 or a 1 <i>kilowatt</i>
transformer set. The cost for the materials for a good aerial is small
and when properly made and well insulated it will give results that
are all out of proportion to the cost of it.</p>

<p><i>An Inexpensive Good Aerial</i>.--A far better aerial, because it
is more highly insulated, can be made by using <i>midget
insulators</i> instead of the porcelain insulators described under the
caption of <i>A Single Wire Aerial</i> and using a small <i>electrose
leading-in insulator</i> instead of the porcelain bushing. This makes
a good sending aerial for small sets as well as a good receiving
aerial.</p>

<p><i>The Best Aerial that Can Be Made.</i>--To make this aerial get
the following material together: (1) enough <i>stranded or braided
wire</i> for three or four lengths of parallel wires, according to the
number you want to use (2) six or eight <i>electrose ball
insulators</i>, see <i>B</i>, <i>Fig. 8</i>; (3) two 5-inch or 10-inch
<i>electrose strain insulators</i>, see <i>C</i>; (4) six or eight
<i>S-hooks</i>, <i>see D</i>; one large <i>withe</i> with one eye for
middle of end spreader, see <i>E</i>; (6) two smaller <i>withes</i>
with one eye each for end spreader, see <i>E</i>; (7) two still
smaller <i>withes</i>, with two eyes each for the ends of the end
spreaders, see <i>E</i> (8) two <i>thimbles</i>, see <i>F</i>, for
1/4-inch wire cable; (9) six or eight <i>hard rubber tubes</i> or
<i>bushings</i> as shown at <i>G</i>; and (10) two <i>end
spreaders</i>, see <i>H</i>; one <i>middle spreader, see I</i>; and
one <i>leading-in spreader</i>, see <i>J</i>.</p>

<a name="fig008a"><img width="595" height="480" src="fig008a.png" alt=
"(A) Fig. 8--Part of a Good Aerial."></a> <a name="fig008b"><img
width="578" height="240" src="fig008b.png" alt=
"(B) Fig. 8.--The Spreaders."></a> 

<p>For this aerial any one of a number of kinds of wire can be used
and among these are (<i>a</i>) <i>stranded copper wire;</i> (<i>b</i>)
<i>braided copper wire;</i> (<i>c</i>) <i>stranded silicon bronze
wire,</i> and (<i>d</i>) <i>stranded phosphor bronze wire</i>.
Stranded and braided copper wire is very flexible as it is formed of
seven strands of fine wire twisted or braided together and it is very
good for short and light aerials. Silicon bronze wire is stronger than
copper wire and should be used where aerials are more than 100 feet
long, while phosphor bronze wire is the strongest aerial wire made and
is used for high grade aerials by the commercial companies and the
Government for their high-power stations.</p>

<p>The spreaders should be made of spruce, and should be 4 feet 10
inches long for a three-wire aerial and 7 feet 1 inch long for a
four-wire aerial as the distance between the wires should be about 27
inches. The end spreaders can be turned cylindrically but it makes a
better looking job if they taper from the middle to the ends. They
should be 2-1/4 inches in diameter at the middle and 1-3/4 inches at
the ends. The middle spreader can be cylindrical and 2 inches in
diameter. It must have holes bored through it at equidistant points
for the hard rubber tubes; each of these should be 5/8 inch in
diameter and have a hole 5/32 inch in diameter through it for the
aerial wire. The leading-in spreader is also made of spruce and is
1-1/2 inches square and 26 inches long. Bore three or four 5/8-inch
holes at equidistant points through this spreader and insert hard
rubber tubes in them as with the middle spreader.</p>

<p><i>Assembling the Aerial.</i>--Begin by measuring off the length of
each wire to be used and see to it that all of them are of exactly the
same length. Now push the hard rubber insulators through the holes in
the middle spreader and thread the wires through the holes in the
insulators as shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig 9</i>.</p>

<p>Next twist the ends of each wire to the rings of the ball
insulators and then put the large withes on the middle of each of the
end spreaders; fix the other withes on the spreaders so that they will
be 27 inches apart and fasten the ball insulators to the eyes in the
withes with the S-hooks. Now slip a thimble through the eye of one of
the long strain insulators, thread a length of stranded steel wire 1/4
inch in diameter through it and fasten the ends of it to the eyes in
the withes on the ends of the spreaders.</p>

<a name="fig009ab"><img width="600" height="441" src="fig009ab.png"
alt=
"(A) Fig. 9.--Middle Spreader. (B) Fig. 9.--One End of Aerial Complete.">
</a> <a name="fig009c"><img width="600" height="422" src="fig009c.png"
alt="(C) Fig. 9.--Leading in Spreader."></a> 

<p>Finally fasten a 40-inch length of steel stranded wire to each of
the eyes of the withes on the middle of each of the spreaders, loop
the other end over the thimble and then wrap the end around the wires
that are fixed to the ends of the spreaders. One end of the aerial is
shown complete at <i>B</i> in <i>Fig. 9</i>, and from this you can see
exactly how it is assembled. Now cut off three or four pieces of wire
15 or 20 feet long and twist and solder each one to one of the aerial
wires; then slip them through the hard rubber tubes in the leading-in
spreader, bring their free ends together as at <i>C</i> and twist and
solder them to a length of wire long enough to reach to your lightning
switch or instruments.</p>

<p><i>Making a Good Ground</i>.--Where you have to make a
<i>ground</i> you can do so either by (1) burying sheets of zinc or
copper in the moist earth; (2) burying a number of wires in the moist
earth, or (3) using a <i>counterpoise</i>. To make a ground of the
first kind take half a dozen large sheets of copper or zinc, cut them
into strips a foot wide, solder them all together with other strips
and bury them deeply in the ground.</p>

<p>It is easier to make a wire ground, say of as many or more wires as
you have in your aerial and connect them together with cross wires. To
put such a ground in the earth you will have to use a plow to make the
furrows deep enough to insure them always being moist. In the
counterpoise ground you make up a system of wires exactly like your
aerial, that is, you insulate them just as carefully; then you support
them so that they will be as close to the ground as possible and yet
not touch it or anything else. This and the other two grounds just
described should be placed directly under the aerial wire if the best
results are to be had. In using a counterpoise you must bring the wire
from it up to and through another leading-in insulator to your
instruments.</p>

<h3>SIMPLE TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE RECEIVING SETS</h3>

<p>With a crystal detector receiving set you can receive either
telegraphic dots and dashes or telephonic speech and music. You can
buy a receiving set already assembled or you can buy the different
parts and assemble them yourself. An assembled set is less bother in
the beginning but if you like to experiment you can <i>hook up</i>,
that is, connect the separate parts together yourself and it is
perhaps a little cheaper to do it this way. Then again, by so doing
you get a lot of valuable experience in wireless work and an
understanding of the workings of wireless that you cannot get in any
other way.</p>

<p><i>Assembled Wireless Receiving Sets</i>.--The cheapest assembled
receiving set [Footnote: The Marvel, made by the Radio Mfg. Co., New
York City.] advertised is one in which the detector and tuning coil is
mounted in a box. It costs $15.00, and can be bought of dealers in
electric supplies generally.</p>

<p>This price also includes a crystal detector, an adjustable tuning
coil, a single telephone receiver with head-band and the wire,
porcelain insulators, lightning switch and ground clamp for the aerial
wire system. It will receive wireless telegraph and telephone messages
over a range of from 10 to 25 miles.</p>

<p>Another cheap unit receptor, that is, a complete wireless receiving
set already mounted which can be used with a single aerial is sold for
$25.00. [Footnote: The Aeriola Jr., made by the Westinghouse Company,
Pittsburgh, Pa.] This set includes a crystal detector, a variable
tuning coil, a fixed condenser and a pair of head telephone receivers.
It can also be used to receive either telegraph or telephone messages
from distances up to 25 miles. The aerial equipment is not included in
this price, but it can be bought for about $2.50 extra.</p>

<p><i>Assembling Your Own Receiving Set</i>.--In this chapter we shall
go only into the apparatus used for two simple receiving sets, both of
which have a <i>crystal detector</i>. The first set includes a
<i>double-slide tuning coil</i> and the second set employs a
<i>loose-coupled tuning coil</i>, or <i>loose coupler</i>, as it is
called for short. For either set you can use a pair of 2,000- or
3,000-ohm head phones.</p>

<p><i>The Crystal Detector</i>.--A crystal detector consists of: (1)
<i>the frame</i>, (2) <i>the crystal</i>, and (3) <i>the wire
point</i>. There are any number of different designs for frames, the
idea being to provide a device that will (<i>a</i>) hold the sensitive
crystal firmly in place, and yet permit of its removal, (<i>b</i>) to
permit the <i>wire point</i>, or <i>electrode</i>, to be moved in any
direction so that the free point of it can make contact with the most
sensitive spot on the crystal and (<i>c</i>) to vary the pressure of
the wire on the crystal.</p>

<p>A simple detector frame is shown in the cross-section at <i>A</i>
in <i>Fig. 10</i>; the crystal, which may be <i>galena</i>,
<i>silicon</i> or <i>iron pyrites</i>, is held securely in a holder
while the <i>phosphor-bronze wire point</i> which makes contact with
it, is fixed to one end of a threaded rod on the other end of which is
a knob. This rod screws into and through a sleeve fixed to a ball that
sets between two brass standards and this permits an up and down or a
side to side adjustment of the metal point while the pressure of it on
the crystal is regulated by the screw.</p>

<a name="fig010ab"><img width="600" height="316" src="fig010ab.png"
alt=
"(A) Fig. 10.--Cross Section of Crystal Detector. (B) Fig. 10.--The Crystal Detector Complete.">
</a> 

<p>A crystal of this kind is often enclosed in a glass cylinder and
this makes it retain its sensitiveness for a much longer time than if
it were exposed to dust and moisture. An upright type of this detector
can be bought for $2.25, while a horizontal type, as shown at
<i>B</i>, can be bought for $2.75. Galena is the crystal that is
generally used, for, while it is not quite as sensitive as silicon and
iron pyrites, it is easier to obtain a sensitive piece.</p>

<p><i>The Tuning Coil</i>.--It is with the tuning coil that you
<i>tune in</i> and <i>tune out</i> different stations and this you do
by sliding the contacts to and fro over the turns of wire; in this way
you vary the <i>inductance</i> and <i>capacitance</i>, that is, the
<i>constants</i> of the receiving circuits and so make them receive
<i>electric waves</i>, that is, wireless waves, of different
lengths.</p>

<p><i>The Double Slide Tuning Coil</i>.--With this tuning coil you can
receive waves from any station up to 1,000 meters in length. One of
the ends of the coil of wire connects with the binding post marked
<i>a</i> in <i>Fig. 11</i>, and the other end connects with the other
binding post marked <i>b</i>, while one of the sliding contacts is
connected to the binding post <i>c</i>, and the <i>other sliding
contact</i> is connected with the binding post <i>d</i>.</p>

<a name="fig011ab"><img width="600" height="234" src="fig011ab.png"
alt=
"(A) Fig. 11.--Schematic Diagram of Double Slide Tuning Coil. (B) Fig. 11.--Double Slide Tuning Coil Complete.">
</a> 

<p>When connecting in the tuning coil, only the post <i>a</i> or the
post <i>b</i> is used as may be most convenient, but the other end of
the wire which is connected to a post is left free; just bear this
point in mind when you come to connect the tuning coil up with the
other parts of your receiving set. The tuning coil is shown complete
at <i>B</i> and it costs $3.00 or $4.00. A <i>triple slide</i> tuning
coil constructed like the double slide tuner just described, only with
more turns of wire on it, makes it possible to receive wave lengths up
to 1,500 meters. It costs about $6.00.</p>

<p><i>The Loose Coupled Tuning Coil</i>.--With a <i>loose coupler</i>,
as this kind of a tuning coil is called for short, very <i>selective
tuning</i> is possible, which means that you can tune in a station
very sharply, and it will receive any wave lengths according to size
of coils. The primary coil is wound on a fixed cylinder and its
inductance is varied by means of a sliding contact like the double
slide tuning coil described above. The secondary coil is wound on a
cylinder that slides in and out of the primary coil. The inductance of
this coil is varied by means of a switch that makes contact with the
fixed points, each of which is connected with every twentieth turn of
wire as shown in the diagram <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 12</i>. The loose
coupler, which is shown complete at <i>B</i>, costs in the
neighborhood of $8.00 or $10.00.</p>

<a name="fig012ab"><img width="600" height="326" src="fig012ab.png"
alt=
"(A) Fig. 12.--Schematic Diagram of Loose Coupler. (B) Fig. 12.--Loose Coupler Complete.">
</a> 

<p><i>Fixed and Variable Condensers</i>.--You do not require a
condenser for a simple receiving set, but if you will connect a
<i>fixed condenser</i> across your headphones you will get better
results, while a <i>variable condenser</i> connected in the <i>closed
circuit of a direct coupled receiving set</i>, that is, one where a
double slide tuning coil is used, makes it easy to tune very much more
sharply; a variable condenser is absolutely necessary where the
circuits are <i>inductively coupled</i>, that is, where a loose
coupled tuner is used.</p>

<p>A fixed condenser consists of a number of sheets of paper with
leaves of tin-foil in between them and so built up that one end of
every other leaf of tin-foil projects from the opposite end of the
paper as shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 13</i>. The paper and tin-foil
are then pressed together and impregnated with an insulating compound.
A fixed condenser of the exact capacitance required for connecting
across the head phones is mounted in a base fitted with binding posts,
as shown at <i>B</i>, and costs 75 cents. (Paper ones 25 cents.)</p>

<a name="fig013ab"><img width="593" height="240" src="fig013ab.png"

"fig013cd.png" alt=
"(C) and (D) Fig. 13.--The Variable Rotary Condenser."></a> 

<p>A variable condenser, see <i>C</i>, of the rotating type is formed
of a set of fixed semi-circular metal plates which are slightly
separated from each other and between these a similar set of movable
semi-circular metal plates is made to interleave; the latter are
secured to a shaft on the top end of which is a knob and by turning it
the capacitance of the condenser, and, hence, of the circuit in which
it is connected, is varied. This condenser, which is shown at
<i>D</i>, is made in two sizes, the smaller one being large enough for
all ordinary wave lengths while the larger one is for proportionately
longer wave lengths. These condensers cost $4.00 and $5.00
respectively.</p>

<p><i>About Telephone Receivers.</i>--There are a number of makes of
head telephone receivers on the market that are designed especially
for wireless work. These phones are wound to <i>resistances</i> of
from 75 <i>ohms</i> to 8,000 <i>ohms</i>, and cost from $1.25 for a
receiver without a cord or headband to $15.00 for a pair of phones
with a cord and head band. You can get a receiver wound to any
resistance in between the above values but for either of the simple
receiving sets such as described in this chapter you ought to have a
pair wound to at least 2,000 ohms and these will cost you about $5.00.
A pair of head phones of this type is shown in <i>Fig. 14.</i></p>

<a name="fig014"><img width="389" height="400" src="fig014.png" alt=
"Fig. 14.--Pair of Wireless Head Phones."></a> 

<p><i>Connecting Up the Parts</i>--<i>Receiving Set No. 1.</i>--For
this set get (1) a <i>crystal detector</i>, (2) a <i>two-slide tuning
coil</i>, (3) a <i>fixed condenser</i>, and (4) a pair of 2,000 ohm
head phones. Mount the detector on the right-hand side of a board and
the tuning coil on the left-hand side. Screw in two binding posts for
the cord ends of the telephone receivers at <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> as
shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 15</i>. This done connect one of the end
binding posts of the tuning coil with the ground wire and a post of
one of the contact slides with the lightning arrester or switch which
leads to the aerial wire.</p>

<a name="fig015a"><img width="600" height="526" src="fig015a.png" alt=

<a name="fig015b"><img width="516" height="520" src="fig015b.png" alt=
"(B) Fig. 15.--Wiring Diagram for Receiving Set No. 1."></a> 

<p>Now connect the post of the other contact slide to one of the posts
of the detector and the other post of the latter with the binding post
<i>a</i>, then connect the binding post <i>b</i> to the ground wire
and solder the joint. Next connect the ends of the telephone receiver
cord to the posts <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> and connect a fixed condenser
also with these posts, all of which are shown in the wiring diagram at
<i>B</i>, and you are ready to adjust the set for receiving.</p>

<p><i>Receiving Set No. 2.</i>--Use the same kind of a detector and
pair of head phones as for <i>Set No. 1</i>, but get (1) a <i>loose
coupled tuning coil</i>, and (2) a <i>variable condenser</i>. Mount
the loose coupler at the back of a board on the left-hand side and the
variable condenser on the right-hand side. Then mount the detector in
front of the variable condenser and screw two binding posts, <i>a</i>
and <i>b</i>, in front of the tuning coil as shown at <i>A</i> in
<i>Fig. 16</i>.</p>

<a name="fig016a"><img width="600" height="598" src="fig016a.png" alt=

"(B) Fig. 16.--Wiring Diagram for Receiving Set No. 2."></a> 

<p>Now connect the post of the sliding contact of the loose coupler
with the wire that runs to the lightning switch and thence to the
aerial; connect the post of the primary coil, which is the outside
coil, with the ground wire; then connect the binding post leading to
the switch of the secondary coil, which is the inside coil, with one
of the posts of the variable condenser, and finally, connect the post
that is joined to one end of the secondary coil with the other post of
the variable condenser.</p>

<p>This done, connect one of the posts of the condenser with one of
the posts of the detector, the other post of the detector with the
binding post <i>a</i>, and the post <i>b</i> to the other post of the
variable condenser. Next connect a fixed condenser to the binding
posts <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> and then connect the telephone receivers
to these same posts, all of which is shown in the wiring diagram at
<i>B</i>. You are now ready to adjust the instruments. In making the
connections use No. 16 or 18 insulated copper wire and scrape the ends
clean where they go into the binding posts. See, also, that all of the
connections are tight and where you have to cross the wires keep them
apart by an inch or so and always cross them at right angles.</p>

<p><i>Adjusting the No. 1 Set</i>--<i>The Detector.</i>--The first
thing to do is to test the detector in order to find out if the point
of the contact wire is on a sensitive spot of the crystal. To do this
you need a <i>buzzer</i>, a <i>switch</i> and a <i>dry cell</i>. An
electric bell from which the gong has been removed will do for the
buzzer, but you can get one that is made specially for the purpose,
for 75 cents, which gives out a clear, high-pitched note that sounds
like a high-power station.</p>

<p>Connect one of the binding posts of the buzzer with one post of the
switch, the other post of the latter with the zinc post of the dry
cell and the carbon post of this to the other post of the buzzer. Then
connect the post of the buzzer that is joined to the vibrator, to the
ground wire as shown in the wiring diagram, <i>Fig. 17.</i> Now close
the switch of the buzzer circuit, put on your head phones, and move
the wire point of the detector to various spots on the crystal until
you hear the sparks made by the buzzer in your phones.</p>

<a name="fig017"><img width="434" height="640" src="fig017.png" alt=
"Fig. 17.--Adjusting the Receiving Set."></a> 

<p>Then vary the pressure of the point on the crystal until you hear
the sparks as loud as possible. After you have made the adjustment
open the switch and disconnect the buzzer wire from the ground wire of
your set. This done, be very careful not to jar the detector or you
will throw it out of adjustment and then you will have to do it all
over again. You are now ready to tune the set with the tuning coil and
listen in.</p>

<p><i>The Tuning Coil.</i>--To tune this set move the slide <i>A</i>
of the double-slide tuner, see <i>B</i> in <i>Fig. 15</i>, over to the
end of the coil that is connected with the ground wire and the slide
<i>B</i> near the opposite end of the coil, that is, the one that has
the free end. Now move the slide <i>A</i> toward the <i>B</i> slide
and when you hear the dots and dashes, or speech or music, that is
coming in as loud as you can move the <i>B</i> slide toward the
<i>A</i> slide until you hear still more loudly. A very few trials on
your part and you will be able to tune in or tune out any station you
can hear, if not too close or powerful.</p>

<p><i>Adjusting the No. 2 Set.</i>--First adjust the crystal detector
with the buzzer set as described above with <i>Set No. 1,</i> then
turn the knob of your variable condenser so that the movable plates
are just half-way in, pull the secondary coil of your loose-coupled
tuner half way out; turn the switch lever on it until it makes a
contact with the middle contact point and set the slider of the
primary coil half way between the ends.</p>

<p>Now listen in for telegraphic signals or telephonic speech or
music; when you hear one or the other slide the secondary coil in and
out of the primary coil until the sounds are loudest; now move the
contact switch over the points forth and back until the sounds are
still louder, then move the slider to and fro until the sounds are yet
louder and, finally, turn the knob of the condenser until the sounds
are clear and crisp. When you have done all of these things you have,
in the parlance of the wireless operator, <i>tuned in</i> and you are
ready to receive whatever is being sent.</p>

<h3>SIMPLE TELEGRAPH SENDING SETS</h3>

<p>A wireless telegraph transmitting set can be installed for a very
small amount of money provided you are content with one that has a
limited range. Larger and better instruments can, of course, be had
for more money, but however much you are willing to spend still you
are limited in your sending radius by the Government's rules and
regulations. The best way, and the cheapest in the end, to install a
telegraph set is to buy the separate parts and hook them up
yourself.</p>

<p>The usual type of wireless telegraph transmitter employs a
<i>disruptive discharge,</i> or <i>spark,</i> as it is called, for
setting up the oscillating currents in the aerial wire system and this
is the type of apparatus described in this chapter. There are two ways
to set up the sparks and these are: (1) with an <i>induction coil,</i>
or <i>spark-coil,</i> as it is commonly called, and (2) with an
<i>alternating current transformer</i>, or <i>power transformer</i>,
as it is sometimes called. Where you have to generate the current with
a battery you must use a spark coil, but if you have a 110-volt direct
or alternating lighting current in your home you can use a transformer
which will give you more power.</p>

<p><i>A Cheap Transmitting Set (No. 1)</i>.--For this set you will
need: (1) a <i>spark-coil</i>, (2) a <i>battery</i> of dry cells, (3)
a <i>telegraph key</i>, (4) a <i>spark gap</i>, (5) a <i>high-tension
condenser</i>, and (6) an <i>oscillation transformer</i>. There are
many different makes and styles of these parts but in the last
analysis all of them are built on the same underlying bases and work
on the same fundamental principles.</p>

<p><i>The Spark-Coil</i>.--Spark coils for wireless work are made to
give sparks from 1/4 inch in length up to 6 inches in length, but as a
spark coil that gives less than a 1-inch spark has a very limited
output it is best to get a coil that gives at least a 1-inch spark, as
this only costs about $8.00, and if you can get a 2- or a 4-inch spark
coil so much the better. There are two general styles of spark coils
used for wireless and these are shown at <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> in
<i>Fig. 18</i>.</p>

<a name="fig018ab"><img width="600" height="276" src="fig018ab.png"
alt="(A) and (B) Fig. 18.--Types of Spark Coils for Set. No. 1."></a>
<a name="fig018c"><img width="600" height="435" src="fig018c.png" alt=
"(C) Fig. 18.--Wiring Diagram of Spark Coil"></a> 

<p>A spark coil of either style consists of (<i>a</i>) a soft <i>iron
core</i> on which is wound (<i>b</i>) a couple of layers of heavy
insulated wire and this is called the <i>primary coil</i>, (<i>c</i>)
while over this, but insulated from it, is wound a large number of
turns of very fine insulated copper wire called the <i>secondary
coil</i>; (<i>d</i>) an <i>interrupter</i>, or <i>vibrator</i>, as it
is commonly called, and, finally, (<i>e</i>) a <i>condenser</i>. The
core, primary and secondary coils form a unit and these are set in a
box or mounted on top of a hollow wooden base. The condenser is placed
in the bottom of the box, or on the base, while the vibrator is
mounted on one end of the box or on top of the base, and it is the
only part of the coil that needs adjusting.</p>

<p>The vibrator consists of a stiff, flat spring fixed at one end to
the box or base while it carries a piece of soft iron called an
<i>armature</i> on its free end and this sets close to one end of the
soft iron core. Insulated from this spring is a standard that carries
an adjusting screw on the small end of which is a platinum point and
this makes contact with a small platinum disk fixed to the spring. The
condenser is formed of alternate sheets of paper and tinfoil built up
in the same fashion as the receiving condenser described under the
caption of <i>Fixed and Variable Condensers</i>, in <a href=
"#chap03">Chapter III</a>.</p>

<p>The wiring diagram <i>C</i> shows how the spark coil is wired up.
One of the battery binding posts is connected with one end of the
primary coil while the other end of the latter which is wound on the
soft iron core connects with the spring of the vibrator. The other
battery binding post connects with the standard that supports the
adjusting screw. The condenser is shunted across the vibrator, that
is, one end of the condenser is connected with the spring and the
other end of the condenser is connected with the adjusting screw
standard. The ends of the secondary coil lead to two binding posts,
which are usually placed on top of the spark coil and it is to these
that the spark gap is connected.</p>

<p><i>The Battery.</i>--This can be formed of dry cells or you can use
a storage battery to energize your coil. For all coils that give less
than a 1-inch spark you should use 5 dry cells; for 1-and 2-inch spark
coils use 6 or 8 dry cells, and for 3 to 4-inch spark coils use 8 to
10 dry cells. The way the dry cells are connected together to form a
battery will be shown presently. A dry cell is shown at <i>A</i> in
<i>Fig, 19</i>.</p>

<a name="fig019"><img width="600" height="389" src="fig019.png" alt=
"Fig. 19.--Other parts for Transmitting Set No. 1"></a> 

<p><i>The Telegraph Key.</i>--You can use an ordinary Morse telegraph
key for the sending set and you can get one with a japanned iron base
for $1.50 (or better, one made of brass and which has 1/8-inch silver
contact points for $3.00. A key of the latter kind is shown at
<i>B</i>).</p>

<p><i>The Spark gap.</i>--It is in the <i>spark gap</i> that the high
tension spark takes place. The apparatus in which the spark takes
place is also called the <i>spark gap</i>. It consists of a pair of
zinc plugs, called <i>electrodes</i>, fixed to the ends of a pair of
threaded rods, with knobs on the other ends, and these screw into and
through a pair of standards as shown at <i>c</i>. This is called a
<i>fixed</i>, or <i>stationary spark gap</i> and costs about
$1.00.</p>

<p><i>The Tuning Coil.</i>--The <i>transmitting inductance</i>, or
<i>sending tuning coil</i>, consists of 20 to 30 turns of <i>No. 8 or
9</i> hard drawn copper wire wound on a slotted insulated form and
mounted on a wooden base. It is provided with <i>clips</i> so that you
can cut in and cut out as many turns of wire as you wish and so tune
the sending circuits to send out whatever wave length you desire. It
is shown at <i>d</i>, and costs about $5.00. See also <i>Oscillation
Transformer</i>, page 63 [Chapter IV].</p>

<p><i>The High Tension Condenser.</i>--High tension condensers, that
is, condensers which will stand up under <i>high potentials</i>, or
electric pressures, can be bought in units or sections. These
condensers are made up of thin brass plates insulated with a special
compound and pressed into a compact form. The <i>capacitance</i>
[Footnote: This is the capacity of the condenser.] of one section is
enough for a transmitting set using a spark coil that gives a 2 inch
spark or less and two sections connected together should be used for
coils giving from 2 to 4 inch sparks. It is shown at <i>e</i>.</p>

<p><i>Connecting Up the Apparatus</i>.--Your sending set should be
mounted on a table, or a bench, where it need not be moved. Place the
key in about the middle of the table and down in front, and the spark
coil to the left and well to the back but so that the vibrator end
will be to the right, as this will enable you to adjust it easily.
Place the battery back of the spark coil and the tuning coil
(oscillation transformer) to the right of the spark coil and back of
the key, all of which is shown in the layout at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig.
20</i>.</p>

<a name="fig020a"><img width="600" height="549" src="fig020a.png" alt=
"(A) Fig. 20.--Top View of Apparatus Layout for Sending Set No. 1."></a>
<a name="fig020b"><img width="600" height="437" src="fig020b.png" alt=
"(B) Fig. 20.--Wiring of Diagram for Sending Set No. 1."></a> 

<p>For the <i>low voltage circuit</i>, that is the battery circuit,
use <i>No. 12</i> or <i>14</i> insulated copper wire. Connect all of
the dry cells together in <i>series</i>, that is, connect the zinc of
one cell with the carbon of the next and so on until all of them are
connected up. Then connect the carbon of the end cell with one of the
posts of the key, the zinc of the other end cell with one of the
primary posts of the spark coil and the other primary post of the
spark coil with the other post of the key, when the primary circuit
will be complete.</p>

<p>For the <i>high tension circuits</i>, that is, the <i>oscillation
circuits</i>, you may use either bare or insulated copper wire but you
must be careful that they do not touch the table, each other, or any
part of the apparatus, except, of course, the posts they are connected
with. Connect one of the posts of the secondary coil of the spark coil
with one of the posts of the spark gap, and the other post with one of
the posts of the condenser; then connect the other post of the
condenser with the lower spring clip of the tuning coil and also
connect this clip with the ground. This done, connect the middle
spring clip with one of the posts of the spark gap, and, finally,
connect the top clip with the aerial wire and your transmitting set is
ready to be tuned. A wiring diagram of the connections is shown at
<i>B</i>. As this set is tuned in the same way as <i>Set No. 2</i>
which follows, you are referred to the end of this chapter.</p>

<p><i>A Better Transmitting Set (No. 2).</i>--The apparatus for this
set includes: (1) an <i>alternating current transformer</i>, (2) a
<i>wireless telegraph key</i>, (3) a <i>fixed</i>, a <i>rotary</i>, or
a <i>quenched spark gap</i>, (4) a <i>condenser</i>, and (5) an
<i>oscillation transformer</i>. If you have a 110 volt direct lighting
current in your home instead of 110 volt alternating current, then you
will also need (6) an <i>electrolytic interrupter</i>, for in this
case the primary circuit of the transformer must be made and broken
rapidly in order to set up alternating currents in the secondary
coil.</p>

<p><i>The Alternating Current Transformer.</i>--An alternating
current, or power, transformer is made on the same principle as a
spark coil, that is, it has a soft iron core, a primary coil formed of
a couple of layers of heavy wire, and a secondary coil wound up of a
large number of turns of very fine wire. Unlike the spark coil,
however, which has an <i>open magnetic core</i> and whose secondary
coil is wound on the primary coil, the transformer has a <i>closed
magnetic core</i>, with the primary coil wound on one of the legs of
the core and the secondary wound on the other leg. It has neither a
vibrator nor a condenser. A plain transformer is shown at <i>A</i> in
<i>Fig. 21</i>.</p>

<a name="fig021"><img width="600" height="584" src="fig021.png" alt=
"Fig. 21.--Parts for Transmitting Set No. 2."></a> 

<p>A transformer of this kind can be bought either (a)
<i>unmounted</i>, that is, just the bare transformer, or (b) <i>fully
mounted</i>, that is, fitted with an iron stand, mounted on an
insulating base on which are a pair of primary binding posts, while
the secondary is provided with a <i>safety spark gap</i>. There are
three sizes of transformers of this kind made and they are rated at
1/4, 1/2 and 1 kilowatt, respectively, they deliver a secondary
current of 9,000, 11,000 and 25,000 volts, according to size, and cost
$16.00, $22.00 and $33.00 when fully mounted; a reduction of $3.00,
$4.00 and $5.00 is made when they are unmounted. All of these
transformers operate on 110 volt, 60 cycle current and can be
connected directly to the source of alternating current.</p>

<p><i>The Wireless Key</i>.--For this transmitting set a standard
wireless key should be used as shown at <i>B</i>. It is made about the
same as a regular telegraph key but it is much heavier, the contact
points are larger and instead of the current being led through the
bearings as in an ordinary key, it is carried by heavy conductors
directly to the contact points. This key is made in three sizes and
the first will carry a current of 5 <i>amperes</i> [Footnote: See <a
href="#appendix">Appendix</a> for definition.] and costs $4.00, the
second will carry a current of 10 amperes and costs $6.50, while the
third will carry a current of 20 amperes and costs $7.50.</p>

<p><i>The Spark Gap.</i>--Either a fixed, a rotary, or a quenched
spark gap can be used with this set, but the former is seldom used
except with spark-coil sets, as it is very hard to keep the sparks
from arcing when large currents are used. A rotary spark gap comprises
a wheel, driven by a small electric motor, with projecting plugs, or
electrodes, on it and a pair of stationary plugs on each side of the
wheel as shown at <i>C</i>. The number of sparks per second can be
varied by changing the speed of the wheel and when it is rotated
rapidly it sends out signals of a high pitch which are easy to read at
the receiving end. A rotary gap with a 110-volt motor costs about
$25.00.</p>

<p>A quenched spark gap not only eliminates the noise of the ordinary
gap but, when properly designed, it increases the range of an
induction coil set some 200 per cent. A 1/4 kilowatt quenched gap
costs $10.00. [Footnote: See <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a> for
definition.]</p>

<p><i>The High Tension Condenser</i>.--Since, if you are an amateur,
you can only send out waves that are 200 meters in length, you can
only use a condenser that has a capacitance of .007 <i>microfarad</i>.
[Footnote: See <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a> for definition.] A
sectional high tension condenser like the one described in connection
with <i>Set No. 1</i> can be used with this set but it must have a
capacitance of not more than .007 microfarad. A condenser of this
value for a 1/4-kilowatt transformer costs $7.00; for a 1/2-kilowatt
transformer $14.00, and for a 1-kilowatt transformer $21.00. See <i>E,
Fig. 19</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Oscillation Transformer</i>.--With an oscillation
transformer you can tune much more sharply than with a single
inductance coil tuner. The primary coil is formed of 6 turns of copper
strip, or No. 9 copper wire, and the secondary is formed of 9 turns of
strip, or wire. The primary coil, which is the outside coil, is hinged
to the base and can be raised or lowered like the lid of a box. When
it is lowered the primary and secondary coils are in the same plane
and when it is raised the coils set at an angle to each other. It is
shown at <i>D</i> and costs $5.00.</p>

<p><i>Connecting Up the Apparatus. For Alternating Current.</i>--Screw
the key to the table about the middle of it and near the front edge;
place the high tension condenser back of it and the oscillation
transformer back of the latter; set the alternating current
transformer to the left of the oscillation transformer and place the
rotary or quenched spark gap in front of it.</p>

<p>Now bring a pair of <i>No. 12</i> or <i>14</i> insulated wires from
the 110 volt lighting leads and connect them with a single-throw,
double-pole switch; connect one pole of the switch with one of the
posts of the primary coil of the alternating power transformer and
connect the other post of the latter with one of the posts of your
key, and the other post of this with the other pole of the switch. Now
connect the motor of the rotary spark gap to the power circuit and put
a single-pole, single-throw switch in the motor circuit, all of which
is shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 22</i>.</p>

<a name="fig022a"><img width="600" height="614" src="fig022a.png" alt=
"(A) Fig. 22.--Top View of Apparatus Layout for Sending Set No. 2."></a>
<a name="fig022b"><img width="600" height="453" src="fig022b.png" alt=
"(B) Fig. 22.--Wiring Diagram for Sending Set No. 2."></a> 

<p>Next connect the posts of the secondary coil to the posts of the
rotary or quenched spark gap and connect one post of the latter to one
post of the condenser, the other post of this to the post of the
primary coil of the oscillation transformer, which is the inside coil,
and the clip of the primary coil to the other spark gap post. This
completes the closed oscillation circuit. Finally connect the post of
the secondary coil of the oscillation transformer to the ground and
the clip of it to the wire leading to the aerial when you are ready to
tune the set. A wiring diagram of the connections is shown at
<i>B</i>.</p>

<p><i>For Direct Current.</i>--Where you have 110 volt direct current
you must connect in an electrolytic interrupter. This interrupter,
which is shown at <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> in <i>Fig. 23</i>, consists of
(1) a jar filled with a solution of 1 part of sulphuric acid and 9
parts of water, (2) a lead electrode having a large surface fastened
to the cover of surface that sets in a porcelain sleeve and whose end
rests on the bottom of the jar.</p>

<a name="fig023"><img width="600" height="412" src="fig023.png" alt=
"Fig. 23.--Using 110 Volt Direct Current with an Alternating Current Transformer.">
</a> 

<p>When these electrodes are connected in series with the primary of a
large spark coil or an alternating current transformer, see <i>C</i>,
and a direct current of from 40 to 110 volts is made to pass through
it, the current is made and broken from 1,000 to 10,000 times a
minute. By raising or lowering the sleeve, thus exposing more or less
of the platinum, or alloy point, the number of interruptions per
minute can be varied at will. As the electrolytic interrupter will
only operate in one direction, you must connect it with its platinum,
or alloy anode, to the + or <i>positive</i> power lead and the lead
cathode to the - or <i>negative</i> power lead. You can find out which
is which by connecting in the interrupter and trying it, or you can
use a polarity indicator. An electrolytic interrupter can be bought
for as little as $3.00.</p>

<p><i>How to Adjust Your Transmitter. Tuning With a Hot Wire
Ammeter</i>.--A transmitter can be tuned in two different ways and
these are: (1) by adjusting the length of the spark gap and the tuning
coil so that the greatest amount of energy is set up in the
oscillating circuits, and (2) by adjusting the apparatus so that it
will send out waves of a given length.</p>

<p>To adjust the transmitter so that the circuits will be in tune you
should have a <i>hot wire ammeter</i>, or radiation ammeter, as it is
called, which is shown in <i>Fig. 24</i>. It consists of a thin
platinum wire through which the high-frequency currents surge and
these heat it; the expansion and contraction of the wire moves a
needle over a scale marked off into fractions of an ampere. When the
spark gap and tuning coil of your set are properly adjusted, the
needle will swing farthest to the right over the scale and you will
then know that the aerial wire system, or open oscillation circuit,
and the closed oscillation circuit are in tune and radiating the
greatest amount of energy.</p>

<a name="fig024"><img width="400" height="427" src="fig024.png" alt=
"Fig. 24.--Principle of the Hot Wire Ammeter."></a> 

<p><i>To Send Out a 200 Meter Wave Length.</i>--If you are using a
condenser having a capacitance of .007 microfarad, which is the
largest capacity value that the Government will allow an amateur to
use, then if you have a hot wire ammeter in your aerial and tune the
inductance coil or coils until the ammeter shows the largest amount of
energy flowing through it you will know that your transmitter is tuned
and that the aerial is sending out waves whose length is 200 meters.
To tune to different wave lengths you must have a
<i>wave-meter</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Use of the Aerial Switch.</i>--Where you intend to install
both a transmitter and a receptor you will need a throwover switch, or
<i>aerial switch</i>, as it is called. An ordinary double-pole,
double-throw switch, as shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 25</i>, can be
used, or a switch made especially for the purpose as at <i>B</i> is
handier because the arc of the throw is much less.</p>

<a name="fig025"><img width="600" height="279" src="fig025.png" alt=
"Fig. 25.--Kinds of Aerial Switches."></a> 

<p><i>Aerial Switch for a Complete Sending and Receiving Set</i>.--You
can buy a double-pole, double-throw switch mounted on a porcelain base
for about 75 cents and this will serve for <i>Set No. 1</i>. Screw
this switch on your table between the sending and receiving sets and
then connect one of the middle posts of it with the ground wire and
the other middle post with the lightning switch which connects with
the aerial. Connect the post of the tuning coil with one of the end
posts of the switch and the clip of the tuning coil with the other and
complementary post of the switch. This done, connect one of the
opposite end posts of the switch to the post of the receiving tuning
coil and connect the sliding contact of the latter with the other and
complementary post of the switch as shown in <i>Fig. 26</i>.</p>

<a name="fig026"><img width="600" height="451" src="fig026.png" alt=
"Fig. 26.--Wiring Diagram for Complete Sending and Receiving Set No. 1.">
</a> 

<p><i>Connecting in the Lightning Switch.</i>--The aerial wire
connects with the middle post of the lightning switch, while one of
the end posts lead to one of the middle posts of the aerial switch.
The other end post of the lightning switch leads to a separate ground
outside the building, as the wiring diagrams <i>Figs. 26</i> and
<i>27</i> show.</p>

<h2><a name="chap05">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<h3>ELECTRICITY SIMPLY EXPLAINED</h3>

<p>It is easy to understand how electricity behaves and what it does
if you get the right idea of it at the start. In the first place, if
you will think of electricity as being a fluid like water its
fundamental actions will be greatly simplified. Both water and
electricity may be at rest or in motion. When at rest, under certain
conditions, either one will develop pressure, and this pressure when
released will cause them to flow through their respective conductors
and thus produce a current.</p>

<p><i>Electricity at Rest and in Motion</i>.--Any wire or a conductor
of any kind can be charged with electricity, but a Leyden jar, or
other condenser, is generally used to hold an electric charge because
it has a much larger <i>capacitance</i>, as its capacity is called,
than a wire. As a simple analogue of a condenser, suppose you have a
tank of water raised above a second tank and that these are connected
together by means of a pipe with a valve in it, as shown at <i>A</i>
in <i>Fig. 28</i>.</p>

<a name="fig028"><img width="594" height="320" src="fig028.png" alt=
"Fig. 28.--Water Analogue for Electric Pressure."></a>

</tr>
</table>

<p>Now if you fill the upper tank with water and the valve is turned
off, no water can flow into the lower tank but there is a difference
of pressure between them, and the moment you turn the valve on a
current of water will flow through the pipe. In very much the same way
when you have a condenser charged with electricity the latter will be
under <i>pressure,</i> that is, a <i>difference of potential</i> will
be set up, for one of the sheets of metal will be charged positively
and the other one, which is insulated from it, will be charged
negatively, as shown at <i>B</i>. On closing the switch the opposite
charges rush together and form a current which flows to and fro
between the metal plates. [Footnote: Strictly speaking it is the
difference of potential that sets up the electromotive force.]</p>

<p><i>The Electric Current and Its Circuit</i>.--Just as water flowing
through a pipe has <i>quantity</i> and <i>pressure</i> back of it and
the pipe offers friction to it which tends to hold back the water, so,
likewise, does electricity flowing in a circuit have: (1)
<i>quantity</i>, or <i>current strength</i>, or just <i>current</i>,
as it is called for short, or <i>amperage</i>, and (2)
<i>pressure</i>, or <i>potential difference</i>, or <i>electromotive
force</i>, or <i>voltage</i>, as it is variously called, and the wire,
or circuit, in which the current is flowing has (3) <i>resistance</i>
which tends to hold back the current.</p>

<p>A definite relation exists between the current and its
electromotive force and also between the current, electromotive force
and the resistance of the circuit; and if you will get this
relationship clearly in your mind you will have a very good insight
into how direct and alternating currents act. To keep a quantity of
water flowing in a loop of pipe, which we will call the circuit,
pressure must be applied to it and this may be done by a rotary pump
as shown at <i>A in Fig. 29;</i> in the same way, to keep a quantity
of electricity flowing in a loop of wire, or circuit, a battery, or
other means for generating electric pressure must be used, as shown at
<i>B</i>.</p>

"Fig. 29.--Water Analogues for Direct and Alternating Currents."></a> 

<p>If you have a closed pipe connected with a piston pump, as at
<i>C</i>, as the piston moves to and fro the water in the pipe will
move first one way and then the other. So also when an alternating
current generator is connected to a wire circuit, as at <i>D</i>, the
current will flow first in one direction and then in the other, and
this is what is called an <i>alternating current</i>.</p>

<p><i>Current and the Ampere</i>.--The amount of water flowing in a
closed pipe is the same at all parts of it and this is also true of an
electric current, in that there is exactly the same quantity of
electricity at one point of the circuit as there is at any other.</p>

<p>The amount of electricity, or current, flowing in a circuit in a
second is measured by a unit called the <i>ampere</i>, [Footnote: For
definition of <i>ampere</i> see <a href="#appendix">Appendix.</a>] and
it is expressed by the symbol I. [Footnote: This is because the letter
<i>C</i> is used for the symbol of <i>capacitance</i>] Just to give
you an idea of the quantity of current an <i>ampere</i> is we will say
that a dry cell when fresh gives a current of about 20 amperes. To
measure the current in amperes an instrument called an <i>ammeter</i>
is used, as shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 30</i>, and this is always
connected in <i>series</i> with the line, as shown at <i>B</i>.</p>

<a name="fig030"><img width="600" height="547" src="fig030.png" alt=
"Fig. 30.--How the Ammeter and Voltmeter are Used."></a> 

<p><i>Electromotive Force and the Volt</i>.--When you have a pipe
filled with water or a circuit charged with electricity and you want
to make them flow you must use a pump in the first case and a battery
or a dynamo in the second case. It is the battery or dynamo that sets
up the electric pressure as the circuit itself is always charged with
electricity.</p>

<p>The more cells you connect together in <i>series</i> the greater
will be the electric pressure developed and the more current it will
move along just as the amount of water flowing in a pipe can be
increased by increasing the pressure of the pump. The unit of
electromotive force is the <i>volt</i>, and this is the electric
pressure which will force a current of <i>1 ampere</i> through a
resistance of <i>1 ohm</i>; it is expressed by the symbol <i>E</i>. A
fresh dry cell will deliver a current of about 1.5 volts. To measure
the pressure of a current in volts an instrument called a
<i>voltmeter</i> is used, as shown at <i>C</i> in <i>Fig. 30</i>, and
this is always connected across the circuit, as shown at <i>D</i>.</p>

<p><i>Resistance and the Ohm.</i>--Just as a water pipe offers a
certain amount of resistance to the flow of water through it, so a
circuit opposes the flow of electricity in it and this is called
<i>resistance</i>. Further, in the same way that a small pipe will not
allow a large amount of water to flow through it, so, too, a thin wire
limits the flow of the current in it.</p>

<p>If you connect a <i>resistance coil</i> in a circuit it acts in the
same way as partly closing the valve in a pipe, as shown at <i>A</i>
and <i>B</i> in <i>Fig. 31</i>. The resistance of a circuit is
measured by a unit called the <i>ohm</i>, and it is expressed by the
symbol <i>R</i>. A No. 10, Brown and Sharpe gauge soft copper wire,
1,000 feet long, has a resistance of about 1 ohm. To measure the
resistance of a circuit an apparatus called a <i>resistance bridge is
used</i>. The resistance of a circuit can, however, be easily
calculated, as the following shows.</p>

<a name="fig031"><img width="600" height="370" src="fig031.png" alt=
"Fig. 31.--Water Valve Analogue of Electric Resistance. A- a valve limits the flow of water. B- a resistance limits the flow of current.">
</a> 

<p><i>What Ohm's Law Is</i>.--If, now, (1) you know what the current
flowing in a circuit is in <i>amperes</i>, and the electromotive
force, or pressure, is in <i>volts</i>, you can then easily find what
the resistance is in <i>ohms</i> of the circuit in which the current
is flowing by this formula:</p>

<pre>
     Volts                   E
    --------- = Ohms,  or   --- = R
     Amperes                 I
</pre>

<p>That is, if you divide the current in amperes by the electromotive
force in volts the quotient will give you the resistance in ohms.</p>

<p>Or (2) if you know what the electromotive force of the current is
in <i>volts</i> and the resistance of the circuit is in <i>ohms</i>
then you can find what the current flowing in the circuit is in
<i>amperes</i>, thus:</p>

<pre>
    Volts                   E
    ----- = Amperes,  or   --- = I
    Ohms                    R
</pre>

<p>That is, by dividing the resistance of the circuit in ohms, by the
electromotive force of the current you will get the amperes flowing in
the circuit.</p>

<p>Finally (3) if you know what the resistance of the circuit is in
<i>ohms</i> and the current is in <i>amperes</i> then you can find
what the electromotive force is in <i>volts</i> since:</p>

<pre>
    Ohms x Amperes = Volts,  or   R x I = E
</pre>

<p>That is, if you multiply the resistance of the circuit in ohms by
the current in amperes the result will give you the electromotive
force in volts.</p>

<p>From this you will see that if you know the value of any two of the
constants you can find the value of the unknown constant by a simple
arithmetical process. This relation between these three constants is
known as <i>Ohm's Law</i> and as they are very important you should
memorize them.</p>

<p><i>What the Watt and Kilowatt Are.</i>--Just as <i>horsepower</i>
or <i>H.P.</i>, is the unit of work that steam has done or can do, so
the <i>watt</i> is the unit of work that an electric current has done
or can do. To find the <i>watts</i> a current develops you need only
to multiply the <i>amperes</i> by the <i>volts</i>. There are <i>746
watts</i> to <i>1 horsepower, and 1,000 watts are equal to 1
kilowatt</i>.</p>

<p><i>Electromagnetic Induction.</i>--To show that a current of
electricity sets up a magnetic field around it you have only to hold a
compass over a wire whose ends are connected with a battery when the
needle will swing at right angles to the length of the wire. By
winding an insulated wire into a coil and connecting the ends of the
latter with a battery you will find, if you test it with a compass,
that the coil is magnetic.</p>

<p>This is due to the fact that the energy of an electric current
flowing in the wire is partly changed into magnetic lines of force
which rotate at right angles about it as shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig.
32</i>. The magnetic field produced by the current flowing in the coil
is precisely the same as that set up by a permanent steel magnet.
Conversely, when a magnetic line of force is set up a part of its
energy goes to make up electric currents which whirl about in a like
manner, as shown at <i>B</i>.</p>

<a name="fig032ab"><img width="600" height="429" src="fig032ab.png"
alt=
"(A) and (B) Fig. 32.--How an Electric Current is Changed into Magnetic Lines of Force and These into an Electric Current.">

"fig032cd.png" alt=
"(C) and (D) Fig. 32.--How an Electric Current Sets up a Magnetic Field.">
</a> 

<p><i>Self-induction or Inductance</i>.--When a current is made to
flow in a coil of wire the magnetic lines of force produced are
concentrated, as at C, just as a lens concentrates rays of light, and
this forms an intense <i>magnetic field</i>, as it is called. Now if a
bar of soft iron is brought close to one end of the coil of wire, or,
better still, if it is pushed into the coil, it will be magnetized by
<i>electromagnetic induction,</i> see <i>D,</i> and it will remain a
magnet until the current is cut off.</p>

<p><i>Mutual Induction</i>.--When two loops of wire, or better, two
coils of wire, are placed close together the electromagnetic induction
between them is reactive, that is, when a current is made to flow
through one of the coils closed magnetic lines of force are set up and
when these cut the other loop or turns of wire of the other coil, they
in turn produce electric currents in it.</p>

<p>It is the mutual induction that takes place between two coils of
wire which makes it possible to transform <i>low voltage currents</i>
from a battery or a 110 volt source of current into high pressure
currents, or <i>high potential currents</i>, as they are called, by
means of a spark coil or a transformer, as well as to <i>step up</i>
and <i>step down</i> the potential of the high frequency currents that
are set up in sending and receiving oscillation transformers. Soft
iron cores are not used in oscillation inductance coils and
oscillation transformers for the reason that the frequency of the
current is so high the iron would not have time to magnetize and
demagnetize and so would not help along the mutual induction to any
appreciable extent.</p>

<p><i>High-Frequency Currents</i>.--High frequency currents, or
electric oscillations as they are called, are currents of electricity
that surge to and fro in a circuit a million times, more or less, per
second. Currents of such high frequencies will <i>oscillate</i>, that
is, surge to and fro, in an <i>open circuit</i>, such as an aerial
wire system, as well as in a <i>closed circuit</i>.</p>

<p>Now there is only one method by which currents of high frequency,
or <i>radio-frequency</i>, as they are termed, can be set up by spark
transmitters, and this is by discharging a charged condenser through a
circuit having a small resistance. To charge a condenser a spark coil
or a transformer is used and the ends of the secondary coil, which
delivers the high potential alternating current, are connected with
the condenser. To discharge the condenser automatically a
<i>spark,</i> or an <i>arc,</i> or the <i>flow of electrons</i> in a
vacuum tube, is employed.</p>

<p><i>Constants of an Oscillation Circuit.</i>--An oscillation
circuit, as pointed out before, is one in which high frequency
currents surge or oscillate. Now the number of times a high frequency
current will surge forth and back in a circuit depends upon three
factors of the latter and these are called the constants of the
circuit, namely: (1) its <i>capacitance,</i> (2) its <i>inductance</i>
and (3) its <i>resistance.</i></p>

<p><i>What Capacitance Is</i>.--The word <i>capacitance</i> means the
<i>electrostatic capacity</i> of a condenser or a circuit. The
capacitance of a condenser or a circuit is the quantity of electricity
which will raise its pressure, or potential, to a given amount. The
capacitance of a condenser or a circuit depends on its size and form
and the voltage of the current that is charging it.</p>

<p>The capacitance of a condenser or a circuit is directly
proportional to the quantity of electricity that will keep the charge
at a given potential. The <i>farad,</i> whose symbol is<i>M,</i> is
the unit of capacitance and a condenser or a circuit to have a
capacitance of one farad must be of such size that one <i>coulomb,</i>
which is the unit of electrical quantity, will raise its charge to a
potential of one volt. Since the farad is far too large for practical
purposes a millionth of a farad, or <i>microfarad</i>, whose symbol is
<i>mfd.</i>, is used.</p>

<p><i>What Inductance Is.</i>--Under the sub-caption of
<i>Self-induction</i> and <i>Inductance</i> in the beginning of this
chapter it was shown that it was the inductance of a coil that makes a
current flowing through it produce a strong magnetic field, and here,
as one of the constants of an oscillation circuit, it makes a
high-frequency current act as though it possessed <i>inertia</i>.</p>

<p>Inertia is that property of a material body that requires time and
energy to set in motion, or stop. Inductance is that property of an
oscillation circuit that makes an electric current take time to start
and time to stop. Because of the inductance, when a current flows
through a circuit it causes the electric energy to be absorbed and
changes a large part of it into magnetic lines of force. Where high
frequency currents surge in a circuit the inductance of it becomes a
powerful factor. The practical unit of inductance is the <i>henry</i>
and it is represented by the symbol <i>L</i>.</p>

<p><i>What Resistance Is.</i>--The resistance of a circuit to
high-frequency currents is different from that for low voltage direct
or alternating currents, as the former do not sink into the conductor
to nearly so great an extent; in fact, they stick practically to the
surface of it, and hence their flow is opposed to a very much greater
extent. The resistance of a circuit to high frequency currents is
generally found in the spark gap, arc gap, or the space between the
electrodes of a vacuum tube. The unit of resistance is, as stated, the
<i>ohm</i>, and its symbol is <i>R</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Effect of Capacitance, Inductance and Resistance on Electric
Oscillations</i>.--If an oscillation circuit in which high frequency
currents surge has a large resistance, it will so oppose the flow of
the currents that they will be damped out and reach zero gradually, as
shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 33</i>. But if the resistance of the
circuit is small, and in wireless circuits it is usually so small as
to be negligible, the currents will oscillate, until their energy is
damped out by radiation and other losses, as shown at <i>B</i>.</p>

<a name="fig033"><img width="600" height="370" src="fig033.png" alt=
"Fig. 33.--The Effect of Resistance on the Discharge of an Electric Current.">
</a> 

<p>As the capacitance and the inductance of the circuit, which may be
made of any value, that is amount, you wish, determines the <i>time
period</i>, that is, the length of time for a current to make one
complete oscillation, it must be clear that by varying the values of
the condenser and the inductance coil you can make the high frequency
current oscillate as fast or as slow as you wish within certain
limits. Where the electric oscillations that are set up are very fast,
the waves sent out by the aerial will be short, and, conversely, where
the oscillations are slow the waves emitted will be long.</p>

<h2><a name="chap06">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<h3>HOW THE TRANSMITTING AND RECEIVING SETS WORK</h3>

<p>The easiest way to get a clear conception of how a wireless
transmitter sends out electric waves and how a wireless receptor
receives them is to take each one separately and follow: (1) in the
case of the transmitter, the transformation of the low voltage direct,
or alternating current into high potential alternating currents; then
find out how these charge the condenser, how this is discharged by the
spark gap and sets up high-frequency currents in the oscillation
circuits; then (2) in the case of the receptor, to follow the high
frequency currents that are set up in the aerial wire and learn how
they are transformed into oscillations of lower potential when they
have a larger current strength, how these are converted into
intermittent direct currents by the detector and which then flow into
and operate the telephone receiver.</p>

<p><i>How Transmitting Set No. 1 Works. The Battery and Spark Coil
Circuit</i>.--When you press down on the knob of the key the silver
points of it make contact and this closes the circuit; the low voltage
direct current from the battery now flows through the primary coil of
the spark coil and this magnetizes the soft iron core. The instant it
becomes magnetic it pulls the spring of the vibrator over to it and
this breaks the circuit; when this takes place the current stops
flowing through the primary coil; this causes the core to lose its
magnetism when the vibrator spring flies back and again makes contact
with the adjusting screw; then the cycle of operations is
repeated.</p>

<p>A condenser is connected across the contact points of the vibrator
since this gives a much higher voltage at the ends of the secondary
coil than where the coil is used without it; this is because: (1) the
self-induction of the primary coil makes the pressure of the current
rise and when the contact points close the circuit again it discharges
through the primary coil, and (2) when the break takes place the
current flows into the condenser instead of arcing across the contact
points.</p>

<p><i>Changing the Primary Spark Coil Current Into Secondary
Currents</i>.--Now every time the vibrator contact points close the
primary circuit the electric current in the primary coil is changed
into closed magnetic lines of force and as these cut through the
secondary coil they set up in it a <i>momentary current</i> in one
direction. Then the instant the vibrator points break apart the
primary circuit is opened and the closed magnetic lines of force
contract and as they do so they cut the turns of wire in the secondary
coil in the opposite direction and this sets up another momentary
current in the secondary coil in the other direction. The result is
that the low voltage direct current of the battery is changed into
alternating currents whose frequency is precisely that of the spring
vibrator, but while the frequency of the currents is low their
potential, or voltage, is enormously increased.</p>

<p><i>What Ratio of Transformation Means.</i>--To make a spark coil
step up the low voltage direct current into high potential alternating
current the primary coil is wound with a couple of layers of thick
insulated copper wire and the secondary is wound with a thousand, more
or less, number of turns with very fine insulated copper wire. If the
primary and secondary coils were wound with the same number of turns
of wire then the pressure, or voltage, of the secondary coil at its
terminals would be the same as that of the current which flowed
through the primary coil. Under these conditions the <i>ratio of
transformation</i>, as it is called, would be unity.</p>

<p>The ratio of transformation is directly proportional to the number
of turns of wire on the primary and secondary coils and, since this is
the case, if you wind 10 turns of wire on the primary coil and 1,000
turns of wire on the secondary coil then you will get 100 times as
high a pressure, or voltage, at the terminals of the secondary as that
which you caused to flow through the primary coil, but, naturally, the
current strength, or amperage, will be proportionately decreased.</p>

<p><i>The Secondary Spark Coil Circuit.</i>--This includes the
secondary coil and the spark gap which are connected together. When
the alternating, but high potential, currents which are developed by
the secondary coil, reach the balls, or <i>electrodes</i>, of the
spark gap the latter are alternately charged positively and
negatively.</p>

<p>Now take a given instant when one electrode is charged positively
and the other one is charged negatively, then when they are charged to
a high enough potential the electric strain breaks down the air gap
between them and the two charges rush together as described in the
chapter before this one in connection with the discharge of a
condenser. When the charges rush together they form a current which
burns out the air in the gap and this gives rise to the spark, and as
the heated gap between the two electrodes is a very good conductor the
electric current surges forth and back with high frequency, perhaps a
dozen times, before the air replaces that which has burned out. It is
the inrushing air to fill the vacuum of the gap that makes the
crackling noise which accompanies the discharge of the electric
spark.</p>

<p>In this way then electric oscillations of the order of a million,
more or less, are produced and if an aerial and a ground wire are
connected to the spark balls, or electrodes, the oscillations will
surge up and down it and the energy of these in turn, are changed into
electric waves which travel out into space. An open circuit
transmitter of this kind will send out waves that are four times as
long as the aerial itself, but as the waves it sends out are strongly
damped the Government will not permit it to be used.</p>

<p><i>The Closed Oscillation Circuit.</i>--By using a closed
oscillation circuit the transmitter can be tuned to send out waves of
a given length and while the waves are not so strongly damped more
current can be sent into the aerial wire system. The closed
oscillation circuit consists of: (1) a <i>spark gap</i>, (2) a
<i>condenser</i> and (3) an <i>oscillation transformer</i>. The high
potential alternating current delivered by the secondary coil not only
charges the spark gap electrodes which necessarily have a very small
capacitance, but it charges the condenser which has a large
capacitance and the value of which can be changed at will.</p>

<p>Now when the condenser is fully charged it discharges through the
spark gap and then the electric oscillations set up surge to and fro
through the closed circuit. As a closed circuit is a very poor
radiator of energy, that is, the electric oscillations are not freely
converted into electric waves by it, they surge up to, and through the
aerial wire; now as the aerial wire is a good radiator nearly all of
the energy of the electric oscillations which surge through it are
converted into electric waves.</p>

<p><i>How Transmitting Set No. 2 Works. With Alternating Current.</i>
The operation of a transmitting set that uses an alternating current
transformer, or <i>power transformer,</i> as it is sometimes called,
is even more simple than one using a spark coil. The transformer needs
no vibrator when used with alternating current. The current from a
generator flows through the primary coil of the transformer and the
alternations of the usual lighting current is 60 cycles per second.
This current sets up an alternating magnetic field in the core of the
transformer and as these magnetic lines of force expand and contract
they set up alternating currents of the same frequency but of much
higher voltage at the terminals of the secondary coil according to the
ratio of the primary and secondary turns of wire as explained under
the sub-caption of <i>Ratio of Transformation</i>.</p>

<p><i>With Direct Current</i>.--When a 110 volt direct current is used
to energize the power transformer an <i>electrolytic</i> interruptor
is needed to make and break the primary circuit, just as a vibrator is
needed for the same purpose with a spark coil. When the electrodes are
connected in series with the primary coil of a transformer and a
source of direct current having a potential of 40 to 110 volts,
bubbles of gas are formed on the end of the platinum, or alloy anode,
which prevent the current from flowing until the bubbles break and
then the current flows again, in this way the current is rapidly made
and broken and the break is very sharp.</p>

<p>Where this type of interrupter is employed the condenser that is
usually shunted around the break is not necessary as the interrupter
itself has a certain inherent capacitance, due to electrolytic action,
and which is called its <i>electrolytic capacitance</i>, and this is
large enough to balance the self-induction of the circuit since the
greater the number of breaks per minute the smaller the capacitance
required.</p>

<p><i>The Rotary Spark Gap</i>.--In this type of spark gap the two
fixed electrodes are connected with the terminals of the secondary
coil of the power transformer and also with the condenser and primary
of the oscillation transformer. Now whenever any pair of electrodes on
the rotating disk are in a line with the pair of fixed electrodes a
spark will take place, hence the pitch of the note depends on the
speed of the motor driving the disk. This kind of a rotary spark-gap
is called <i>non-synchronous</i> and it is generally used where a 60
cycle alternating current is available but it will work with other
higher frequencies.</p>

<p><i>The Quenched Spark Gap</i>.--If you strike a piano string a
single quick blow it will continue to vibrate according to its natural
period. This is very much the way in which a quenched spark gap sets
up oscillations in a coupled closed and open circuit. The oscillations
set up in the primary circuit by a quenched spark make only three or
four sharp swings and in so doing transfer all of their energy over to
the secondary circuit, where it will oscillate some fifty times or
more before it is damped out, because the high frequency currents are
not forced, but simply oscillate to the natural frequency of the
circuit. For this reason the radiated waves approach somewhat the
condition of continuous waves, and so sharper tuning is possible.</p>

<p><i>The Oscillation Transformer.</i>--In this set the condenser in
the closed circuit is charged and discharged and sets up oscillations
that surge through the closed circuit as in <i>Set No. 1</i>. In this
set, however, an oscillation transformer is used and as the primary
coil of it is included in the closed circuit the oscillations set up
in it produce strong oscillating magnetic lines of force. The magnetic
field thus produced sets up in turn electric oscillations in the
secondary coil of the oscillation transformer and these surge through
the aerial wire system where their energy is radiated in the form of
electric waves.</p>

<p>The great advantage of using an oscillation transformer instead of
a simple inductance coil is that the capacitance of the closed circuit
can be very much larger than that of the aerial wire system. This
permits more energy to be stored up by the condenser and this is
impressed on the aerial when it is radiated as electric waves.</p>

<p><i>How Receiving Set No. I Works.</i>--When the electric waves from
a distant sending station impinge on the wire of a receiving aerial
their energy is changed into electric oscillations that are of exactly
the same frequency (assuming the receptor is tuned to the transmitter)
but whose current strength (amperage) and potential (voltage) are very
small. These electric waves surge through the closed circuit but when
they reach the crystal detector the contact of the metal point on the
crystal permits more current to flow through it in one direction than
it will allow to pass in the other direction. For this reason a
crystal detector is sometimes called a <i>rectifier</i>, which it
really is.</p>

<p>Thus the high frequency currents which the steel magnet cores of
the telephone receiver would choke off are changed by the detector
into intermittent direct currents which can flow through the magnet
coils of the telephone receiver. Since the telephone receiver chokes
off the oscillations, a small condenser can be shunted around it so
that a complete closed oscillation circuit is formed and this gives
better results.</p>

<p>When the intermittent rectified current flows through the coils of
the telephone receiver it energizes the magnet as long as it lasts,
when it is de-energized; this causes the soft iron disk, or
<i>diaphragm</i> as it is called, which sets close to the ends of the
poles of the magnet, to vibrate; and this in turn gives forth sounds
such as dots and dashes, speech or music, according to the nature of
the electric waves that sent them out at the distant station.</p>

<p><i>How Receiving Set No. 2 Works.</i>--When the electric
oscillations that are set up by the incoming electric waves on the
aerial wire surge through the primary coil of the oscillation
transformer they produce a magnetic field and as the lines of force of
the latter cut the secondary coil, oscillations of the same frequency
are set up in it. The potential (voltage) of these oscillations are,
however, <i>stepped down</i> in the secondary coil and, hence, their
current strength (amperes) is increased.</p>

<p>The oscillations then flow through the closed circuit where they
are rectified by the crystal detector and transformed into sound waves
by the telephone receiver as described in connection with <i>Set No.
1</i>. The variable condenser shunted across the closed circuit
permits finer secondary tuning to be done than is possible without it.
Where you are receiving continuous waves from a wireless telephone
transmitter (speech or music) you have to tune sharper than is
possible with the tuning coil alone and to do this a variable
condenser connected in parallel with the secondary coil is
necessary.</p>

<h2><a name="chap07">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<h3>MECHANICAL AND ELECTRICAL TUNING</h3>

<p>There is a strikingly close resemblance between <i>sound waves</i>
and the way they are set up in <i>the air</i> by a mechanically
vibrating body, such as a steel spring or a tuning fork, and
<i>electric waves</i> and the way they are set up in <i>the ether</i>
by a current oscillating in a circuit. As it is easy to grasp the way
that sound waves are produced and behave something will be told about
them in this chapter and also an explanation of how electric waves are
produced and behave and thus you will be able to get a clear
understanding of them and of tuning in general.</p>

<p><i>Damped and Sustained Mechanical Vibrations</i>.--If you will
place one end of a flat steel spring in a vice and screw it up tight
as shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 34</i>, and then pull the free end
over and let it go it will vibrate to and fro with decreasing
amplitude until it comes to rest as shown at <i>B</i>. When you pull
the spring over you store up energy in it and when you let it go the
stored up energy is changed into energy of motion and the spring moves
forth and back, or <i>vibrates</i> as we call it, until all of its
stored up energy is spent.</p>

<a name="fig034"><img width="600" height="474" src="fig034.png" alt=
"Fig. 34.--Damped and Sustained Mechanical Vibrations."></a> 

<p>If it were not for the air surrounding it and other frictional
losses, the spring would vibrate for a very long time as the stored up
energy and the energy of motion would practically offset each other
and so the energy would not be used up. But as the spring beats the
air the latter is sent out in impulses and the conversion of the
vibrations of the spring into waves in the air soon uses up the energy
you have imparted to it and it comes to rest.</p>

<p>In order to send out <i>continuous waves</i> in the air instead of
<i>damped waves</i> as with a flat steel spring you can use an
<i>electric driven tuning fork</i>, see <i>C</i>, in which an
electromagnet is fixed on the inside of the prongs and when this is
energized by a battery current the vibrations of the prongs of the
fork are kept going, or are <i>sustained</i>, as shown in the diagram
at <i>D</i>.</p>

<p><i>Damped and Sustained Electric Oscillations</i>.--The vibrating
steel spring described above is a very good analogue of the way that
damped electric oscillations which surge in a circuit set up and send
out periodic electric waves in the ether while the electric driven
tuning fork just described is likewise a good analogue of how
sustained oscillations surge in a circuit and set up and send out
continuous electric waves in the ether as the following shows.</p>

<p>Now the inductance and resistance of a circuit such as is shown at
<i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 35</i>, slows down, and finally damps out
entirely, the electric oscillations of the high frequency currents,
see <i>B</i>, where these are set up by the periodic discharge of a
condenser, precisely as the vibrations of the spring are damped out by
the friction of the air and other resistances that act upon it. As the
electric oscillations surge to and fro in the circuit it is opposed by
the action of the ether which surrounds it and electric waves are set
up in and sent out through it and this transformation soon uses up the
energy of the current that flows in the circuit.</p>

<a name="fig035"><img width="600" height="435" src="fig035.png" alt=
"Fig. 35.--Damped and Sustained Electric Oscillations."></a> 

<p>To send out <i>continuous waves</i> in the ether such as are needed
for wireless telephony instead of <i>damped waves</i> which are, at
the present writing, generally used for wireless telegraphy, an
<i>electric oscillation arc</i> or a <i>vacuum tube oscillator</i>
must be used, see <i>C</i>, instead of a spark gap. Where a spark gap
is used the condenser in the circuit is charged periodically and with
considerable lapses of time between each of the charging processes,
when, of course, the condenser discharges periodically and with the
same time element between them. Where an oscillation arc or a vacuum
tube is used the condenser is charged as rapidly as it is discharged
and the result is the oscillations are sustained as shown at
<i>D</i>.</p>

<p><i>About Mechanical Tuning</i>.--A tuning fork is better than a
spring or a straight steel bar for setting up mechanical vibrations.
As a matter of fact a tuning fork is simply a steel bar bent in the
middle so that the two ends are parallel. A handle is attached to
middle point of the fork so that it can be held easily and which also
allows it to vibrate freely, when the ends of the prongs alternately
approach and recede from one another. When the prongs vibrate the
handle vibrates up and down in unison with it, and imparts its motion
to the <i>sounding box</i>, or <i>resonance case</i> as it is
sometimes called, where one is used.</p>

<p>If, now, you will mount the fork on a sounding box which is tuned
so that it will be in resonance with the vibrations of the fork there
will be a direct reinforcement of the vibrations when the note emitted
by it will be augmented in strength and quality. This is called
<i>simple resonance</i>. Further, if you mount a pair of forks, each
on a separate sounding box, and have the forks of the same size, tone
and pitch, and the boxes synchronized, that is, tuned to the same
frequency of vibration, then set the two boxes a foot or so apart, as
shown at A in <i>Fig. 36</i>, when you strike one of the forks with a
rubber hammer it will vibrate with a definite frequency and, hence,
send out sound waves of a given length. When the latter strike the
second fork the impact of the molecules of air of which the sound
waves are formed will set its prongs to vibrating and it will, in
turn, emit sound waves of the same length and this is called
<i>sympathetic resonance</i>, or as we would say in wireless the forks
are <i>in tune</i>.</p>

<a name="fig036"><img width="600" height="351" src="fig036.png" alt=
"Fig. 36.--Sound Wave and Electric Wave Tuned Senders and Receptors. A - variable tuning forks for showing sound wave tuning. B - variable oscillation circuits for showing electric wave tuning.">
</a> 

<p>Tuning forks are made with adjustable weights on their prongs and
by fixing these to different parts of them the frequency with which
the forks vibrate can be changed since the frequency varies inversely
with the square of the length and directly with the thickness
[Footnote: This law is for forks having a rectangular cross-section.
Those having a round cross-section vary as the radius.] of the prongs.
Now by adjusting one of the forks so that it vibrates at a frequency
of, say, 16 per second and adjusting the other fork so that it
vibrates at a frequency of, say, 18 or 20 per second, then the forks
will not be in tune with each other and, hence, if you strike one of
them the other will not respond. But if you make the forks vibrate at
the same frequency, say 16, 20 or 24 per second, when you strike one
of them the other will vibrate in unison with it.</p>

<p><i>About Electric Tuning</i>.--Electric resonance and electric
tuning are very like those of acoustic resonance and acoustic tuning
which I have just described. Just as acoustic resonance may be simple
or sympathetic so electric resonance may be simple or sympathetic.
Simple acoustic resonance is the direct reinforcement of a simple
vibration and this condition is had when a tuning fork is mounted on a
sounding box. In simple electric resonance an oscillating current of a
given frequency flowing in a circuit having the proper inductance and
capacitance may increase the voltage until it is several times greater
than its normal value. Tuning the receptor circuits to the transmitter
circuits are examples of sympathetic electric resonance. As a
demonstration if you have two Leyden jars (capacitance) connected in
circuit with two loops of wire (inductance) whose inductance can be
varied as shown at <i>B</i> in <i>Fig. 36,</i> when you make a spark
pass between the knobs of one of them by means of a spark coil then a
spark will pass in the gap of the other one provided the inductance of
the two loops of wire is the same. But if you vary the inductance of
the one loop so that it is larger or smaller than that of the other
loop no spark will take place in the second circuit.</p>

<p>When a tuning fork is made to vibrate it sends out waves in the
air, or sound waves, in all directions and just so when high frequency
currents surge in an oscillation circuit they send out waves in the
ether, or electric waves, that travel in all directions. For this
reason electric waves from a transmitting station cannot be sent to
one particular station, though they do go further in one direction
than in another, according to the way your aerial wire points.</p>

<p>Since the electric waves travel out in all directions any receiving
set properly tuned to the wave length of the sending station will
receive the waves and the only limit on your ability to receive from
high-power stations throughout the world depends entirely on the wave
length and sensitivity of your receiving set. As for tuning, just as
changing the length and the thickness of the prongs of a tuning fork
varies the frequency with which it vibrates and, hence, the length of
the waves it sends out, so, too, by varying the capacitance of the
condenser and the inductance of the tuning coil of the transmitter the
frequency of the electric oscillations set up in the circuit may be
changed and, consequently, the length of the electric waves they send
out. Likewise, by varying the capacitance and the inductance of the
receptor the circuits can be tuned to receive incoming electric waves
of whatever length within the limitation of the apparatus.</p>

<h3>A SIMPLE VACUUM TUBE DETECTOR RECEIVING SET</h3>

<p>While you can receive dots and dashes from spark wireless telegraph
stations and hear spoken words and music from wireless telephone
stations with a crystal detector receiving set such as described in <a
href="#chap03">Chapter III</a>, you can get stations that are much
farther away and hear them better with a <i>vacuum tube detector</i>
receiving set.</p>

<p>Though the vacuum tube detector requires two batteries to operate
it and the receiving circuits are somewhat more complicated than where
a crystal detector is used still the former does not have to be
constantly adjusted as does the latter and this is another very great
advantage. Taken all in all the vacuum tube detector is the most
sensitive and the most satisfactory of the detectors that are in use
at the present time.</p>

<p>Not only is the vacuum tube a detector of electric wave signals and
speech and music but it can also be used to <i>amplify</i> them, that
is, to make them stronger and, hence, louder in the telephone receiver
and further its powers of amplification are so great that it will
reproduce them by means of a <i>loud speaker</i>, just as a horn
amplifies the sounds of a phonograph reproducer, until they can be
heard by a room or an auditorium full of people. There are two general
types of loud speakers, though both use the principle of the telephone
receiver. The construction of these loud speakers will be fully
described in a later chapter.</p>

<p><i>Assembled Vacuum Tube Receiving Sets</i>.--You can buy a
receiving set with a vacuum tube detector from the very simplest type,
which is described in this chapter, to those that are provided with
<i>regenerative circuits</i> and <i>amplifying</i> tubes or both,
which we shall describe in later chapters, from dealers in electrical
apparatus generally. While one of these sets costs more than you can
assemble a set for yourself, still, especially in the beginning, it is
a good plan to buy an assembled one for it is fitted with a
<i>panel</i> on which the adjusting knobs of the rheostat, tuning coil
and condenser are mounted and this makes it possible to operate it as
soon as you get it home and without the slightest trouble on your
part.</p>

<p>You can, however, buy all the various parts separately and mount
them yourself. If you want the receptor simply for receiving then it
is a good scheme to have all of the parts mounted in a box or enclosed
case, but if you want it for experimental purposes then the parts
should be mounted on a base or a panel so that all of the connections
are in sight and accessible.</p>

<p><i>A Simple Vacuum Tube Receiving Set.</i>--For this set you should
use: (1) a <i>loose coupled tuning coil,</i> (2) a <i>variable
condenser,</i> (3) a <i>vacuum tube detector,</i> (4) an <i>A</i> or
<i>storage battery</i> giving 6 volts, (5) a <i>B</i> or <i>dry cell
battery</i> giving 22-1/2 volts, (6) a <i>rheostat</i> for varying the
storage battery current, and (7) a pair of 2,000-ohm <i>head telephone
receivers</i>. The loose coupled tuning coil, the variable condenser
and the telephone receivers are the same as those described in <a
href="#chap03">Chapter III</a>.</p>

<p><i>The Vacuum Tube Detector. With Two Electrodes.</i>--A vacuum
tube in its simplest form consists of a glass bulb like an
incandescent lamp in which a <i>wire filament</i> and a <i>metal
plate</i> are sealed as shown in <i>Fig. 37</i>, The air is then
pumped out of the tube and a vacuum left or after it is exhausted it
is filled with nitrogen, which cannot burn.</p>

<a name="fig037"><img width="493" height="480" src="fig037.png" alt=
"Fig. 37.--Two Electrode Vacuum Tube Detectors."></a> 

<p>When the vacuum tube is used as a detector, the wire filament is
heated red-hot and the metal plate is charged with positive
electricity though it remains cold. The wire filament is formed into a
loop like that of an incandescent lamp and its outside ends are
connected with a 6-volt storage battery, which is called the <i>A</i>
battery; then the + or <i>positive</i> terminal of a 22-1/2 volt dry
cell battery, called the <i>B</i> battery, is connected to the metal
plate while the - or <i>negative</i> terminal of the battery is
connected to one of the terminals of the wire filament. The diagram,
<i>Fig. 37</i>, simply shows how the two electrode vacuum tube, the
<i>A</i> or dry battery, and the <i>B</i> or storage battery are
connected up.</p>

<p><i>Three Electrode Vacuum Tube Detector.</i>--The three electrode
vacuum tube detector shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 38</i>, is much more
sensitive than the two electrode tube and has, in consequence, all but
supplanted it. In this more recent type of vacuum tube the third
electrode, or <i>grid</i>, as it is called, is placed between the wire
filament and the metal plate and this allows the current to be
increased or decreased at will to a very considerable extent.</p>

<a name="fig038"><img width="600" height="531" src="fig038.png" alt=
"Fig. 38.--Three Electrode Vacuum Tube Detector and Battery Connections.">
</a> 

<p>The way the three electrode vacuum tube detector is connected with
the batteries is shown at <i>B</i>. The plate, the <i>A</i> or dry
cell battery and one terminal of the filament are connected in
<i>series</i>--that is, one after the other, and the ends of the
filament are connected to the <i>B</i> or storage battery. In
assembling a receiving set you must, of course, have a socket for the
vacuum tube. A vacuum tube detector costs from $5.00 to $6.00.</p>

<p><i>The Dry Cell and Storage Batteries</i>.--The reason that a
storage battery is used for heating the filament of the vacuum tube
detector is because the current delivered is constant, whereas when a
dry cell battery is used the current soon falls off and, hence, the
heat of the filament gradually grows less. The smallest <i>A</i> or 6
volt storage battery on the market has a capacity of 20 to 40 ampere
hours, weighs 13 pounds and costs about $10.00. It is shown at
<i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 39</i>. The <i>B</i> or dry cell battery for the
vacuum tube plate circuit that gives 22-1/2 volts can be bought
already assembled in sealed boxes. The small size is fitted with a
pair of terminals while the larger size is provided with <i>taps</i>
so that the voltage required by the plate can be adjusted as the
proper operation of the tube requires careful regulation of the plate
voltage. A dry cell battery for a plate circuit is shown at
<i>B</i>.</p>

<a name="fig039"><img width="600" height="336" src="fig039.png" alt=
"Fig. 39.--&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; Batteries for Vacuum Tube Detectors.">
</a> 

<p><i>The Filament Rheostat</i>.--An adjustable resistance, called a
<i>rheostat</i>, must be used in the filament and storage battery
circuit so that the current flowing through the filament can be
controlled to a nicety. The rheostat consists of an insulating and a
heat resisting form on which is wound a number of turns of resistance
wire. A movable contact arm that slides over and presses on the turns
of wire is fixed to the knob on top of the rheostat. A rheostat that
has a resistance of 6 ohms and a current carrying capacity of 1.5
amperes which can be mounted on a panel board is the right kind to
use. It is shown at <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> in <i>Fig. 40</i> and costs
$1.25.</p>

<a name="fig040"><img width="600" height="411" src="fig040.png" alt=
"Fig. 40.--Rheostat for the &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; or Storage Battery Current.">
</a> 

<p><i>Assembling the Parts</i>.--Begin by placing all of the separate
parts of the receiving set on a board or a base of other material and
set the tuning coil on the left hand side with the adjustable switch
end toward the right hand side so that you can reach it easily. Then
set the variable condenser in front of it, set the vacuum tube
detector at the right hand end of the tuning coil and the rheostat in
front of the detector. Place the two sets of batteries back of the
instruments and screw a couple of binding posts <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
to the right hand lower edge of the base for connecting in the head
phones all of which is shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 41</i>.</p>

<a name="fig041a"><img width="600" height="473" src="fig041a.png" alt=

alt=
"(B) Fig. 41.--Wiring Diagram of a Simple Vacuum Tube Receiving Set.">
</a> 

<p><i>Connecting Up the Parts.</i>--To wire up the different parts
begin by connecting the sliding contact of the primary coil of the
loose coupled tuning coil (this you will remember is the outside one
that is wound with fine wire) to the upper post of the lightning
switch and connect one terminal of this coil with the water pipe. Now
connect the free end of the secondary coil of the tuning coil (this is
the inside coil that is wound with heavy wire) to one of the binding
posts of the variable condenser and connect the movable contact arm of
the adjustable switch of the primary of the tuning coil with the other
post of the variable condenser.</p>

<p>Next connect the grid of the vacuum tube to one of the posts of the
condenser and then connect the plate of the tube to the <i>carbon
terminal</i> of the <i>B</i> or dry cell battery which is the + or
<i>positive pole</i> and connect the <i>zinc terminal</i> of the - or
<i>negative</i> pole to the binding post <i>a</i>, connect the post
<i>b</i> to the other side of the variable condenser and then connect
the terminals of the head phones to the binding posts <i>a</i> and
<i>b</i>. Whatever you do be careful not to get the plate connections
of the battery reversed.</p>

<p>Now connect one of the posts of the rheostat to one terminal of the
filament and the other terminal of the filament to the - or
<i>negative</i> terminal of the <i>A</i> or storage battery and the +
or <i>positive</i> terminal of the <i>A</i> or storage battery to the
other post of the rheostat. Finally connect the + or positive terminal
of the <i>A</i> or storage battery with the wire that runs from the
head phones to the variable condenser, all of which is shown in the
wiring diagram at <i>B</i> in <i>Fig. 41</i>.</p>

<p><i>Adjusting the Vacuum Tube Detector Receiving Set</i>.--A vacuum
tube detector is tuned exactly in the same way as the <i>Crystal
Detector Set No. 2</i> described in <a href="#chap03">Chapter III</a>,
in-so-far as the tuning coil and variable condenser are concerned. The
sensitivity of the vacuum tube detector receiving set and, hence, the
distance over which signals and other sounds can be heard depends very
largely on the sensitivity of the vacuum tube itself and this in turn
depends on: (1) the right amount of heat developed by the filament, or
<i>filament brilliancy</i> as it is called, (2) the right amount of
voltage applied to the plate, and (3) the extent to which the tube is
exhausted where this kind of a tube is used.</p>

<p>To vary the current flowing from the <i>A</i> or storage battery
through the filament so that it will be heated to the right degree you
adjust the rheostat while you are listening in to the signals or other
sounds. By carefully adjusting the rheostat you can easily find the
point at which it makes the tube the most sensitive. A rheostat is
also useful in that it keeps the filament from burning out when the
current from the battery first flows through it. You can very often
increase the sensitiveness of a vacuum tube after you have used it for
a while by recharging the <i>A</i> or storage battery.</p>

<p>The degree to which a vacuum tube has been exhausted has a very
pronounced effect on its sensitivity. The longer the tube is used the
lower its vacuum gets and generally the less sensitive it becomes.
When this takes place (and you can only guess at it) you can very
often make it more sensitive by warming it over the flame of a candle.
Vacuum tubes having a gas content (in which case they are, of course,
no longer vacuum tubes in the strict sense) make better detectors than
tubes from which the air has been exhausted and which are sealed off
in this evacuated condition because their sensitiveness is not
dependent on the degree of vacuum as in the latter tubes. Moreover, a
tube that is completely exhausted costs more than one that is filled
with gas.</p>

<h2><a name="chap09">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<h3>VACUUM TUBE AMPLIFIER RECEIVING SETS</h3>

<p>The reason a vacuum tube detector is more sensitive than a crystal
detector is because while the latter merely <i>rectifies</i> the
oscillating current that surges in the receiving circuits, the former
acts as an <i>amplifier</i> at the same time. The vacuum tube can be
used as a separate amplifier in connection with either: (1) a
<i>crystal detector</i> or (2) a <i>vacuum tube detector</i>, and
(<i>a</i>) it will amplify either the <i>radio frequency currents</i>,
that is the high frequency oscillating currents which are set up in
the oscillation circuits or (<i>b</i>) it will amplify the <i>audio
frequency currents</i>, that is, the <i>low frequency alternating</i>
currents that flow through the head phone circuit.</p>

<p>To use the amplified radio frequency oscillating currents or
amplified audio frequency alternating currents that are set up by an
amplifier tube either a high resistance, called a <i>grid leak</i>, or
an <i>amplifying transformer</i>, with or without an iron core, must
be connected with the plate circuit of the first amplifier tube and
the grid circuit of the next amplifier tube or detector tube, or with
the wire point of a crystal detector. Where two or more amplifier
tubes are coupled together in this way the scheme is known as
<i>cascade amplification.</i></p>

<p>Where either a <i>radio frequency transformer</i>, that is one
without the iron core, or an <i>audio frequency transformer</i>, that
is one with the iron core, is used to couple the amplifier tube
circuits together better results are obtained than where a high
resistance grid leak is used, but the amplifying tubes have to be more
carefully shielded from each other or they will react and set up a
<i>howling</i> noise in the head phones. On the other hand grid leaks
cost less but they are more troublesome to use as you have to find out
for yourself the exact resistance value they must have and this you
can do only by testing them out.</p>

<p><i>A Grid Leak Amplifier Receiving Set. With Crystal
Detector.</i>--The apparatus you need for this set includes: (1) a
<i>loose coupled tuning coil</i>, (2) a <i>variable condenser</i>, (3)
<i>two fixed condensers</i>, (4) a <i>crystal detector</i>, or better
a <i>vacuum tube detector</i>, (5) an <i>A</i> or <i>6 volt storage
battery</i>, (6) a <i>rheostat</i>, (7) a <i>B</i> or 22-1/2 <i>volt
dry cell battery</i>, (8) a fixed resistance unit, or <i>leak grid</i>
as it is called, and (9) a pair of <i>head-phones</i>. The tuning
coil, variable condenser, fixed condensers, crystal detectors and
head-phones are exactly the same as those described in <i>Set No.
2</i> in <a href="#chap03">Chapter III</a>. The <i>A</i> and <i>B
batteries</i> are exactly the same as those described in <a href=
"#chap08">Chapter VIII</a>. The <i>vacuum tube amplifier</i> and the
<i>grid leak</i> are the only new pieces of apparatus you need and not
described before.</p>

<p><i>The Vacuum Tube Amplifier</i>.--This consists of a three
electrode vacuum tube exactly like the vacuum tube detector described
in <a href="#chap08">Chapter VIII</a> and pictured in <i>Fig. 38</i>,
except that instead of being filled with a non-combustible gas it is
evacuated, that is, the air has been completely pumped out of it. The
gas filled tube, however, can be used as an amplifier and either kind
of tube can be used for either radio frequency or audio frequency
amplification, though with the exhausted tube it is easier to obtain
the right plate and filament voltages for good working.</p>

<p><i>The Fixed Resistance Unit, or Grid Leak</i>.--Grid leaks are
made in different ways but all of them have an enormously high
resistance. One way of making them consists of depositing a thin film
of gold on a sheet of mica and placing another sheet of mica on top to
protect it the whole being enclosed in a glass tube as shown at
<i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 42</i>. These grid leaks are made in units of from
50,000 ohms (.05 megohm) to 5,000,000 ohms (5 megohms) and cost from
$1 to $2.</p>

<a name="fig042"><img width="600" height="531" src="fig042.png" alt=
"Fig. 42.--Grid Leaks and How to Connect Them up."></a> 

<p>As the <i>value</i> of the grid leak you will need depends very
largely upon the construction of the different parts of your receiving
set and on the kind of aerial wire system you use with it you will
have to try out various resistances until you hit the right one. The
resistance that will give the best results, however, lies somewhere
between 500,000 ohms (1/2 a megohm) and 3,000,000 ohms (3 megohms) and
the only way for you to find this out is to buy 1/2, 1 and 2 megohm
grid leak resistances and connect them up in different ways, as shown
at <i>B</i>, until you find the right value.</p>

<p><i>Assembling the Parts for a Crystal Detector Set</i>.--Begin by
laying the various parts out on a base or a panel with the loose
coupled tuning coil on the left hand side, but with the adjustable
switch of the secondary coil on the right hand end or in front
according to the way it is made. Then place the variable condenser,
the rheostat, the crystal detector and the binding posts for the head
phones in front of and in a line with each other. Set the vacuum tube
amplifier back of the rheostat and the <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> batteries
back of the parts or in any other place that may be convenient. The
fixed condensers and the grid leak can be placed anywhere so that it
will be easy to connect them in and you are ready to wire up the
set.</p>

<p><i>Connecting Up the Parts for a Crystal Detector</i>.--First
connect the sliding contact of the primary of the tuning coil to the
leading-in wire and one of the end wires of the primary to the water
pipe, as shown in <i>Fig. 43</i>. Now connect the adjustable arm that
makes contact with one end of the secondary of the tuning coil to one
of the posts of the variable condenser; then connect the other post of
the latter with a post of the fixed condenser and the other post of
this with the grid of the amplifying tube.</p>

<a name="fig043"><img width="600" height="404" src="fig043.png" alt=
"Fig. 43.--Crystal Detector Receiving Set with Vacuum Tube Amplifier (Resistance Coupled).">
</a> 

<p>Connect the first post of the variable condenser to the + or
<i>positive electrode</i> of the <i>A</i> battery and its - or
<i>negative electrode</i> with the rotating contact arm of the
rheostat. Next connect one end of the resistance coil of the rheostat
to one of the posts of the amplifier tube that leads to the filament
and the other filament post to the + or <i>positive electrode</i> of
the <i>A</i> battery. This done connect the <i>negative</i>, that is,
the <i>zinc pole</i> of the <i>B</i> battery to the positive electrode
of the <i>A</i> battery and connect the <i>positive</i>, or <i>carbon
pole</i> of the former with one end of the grid leak and connect the
other end of this to the plate of the amplifier tube.</p>

<p>To the end of the grid leak connected with the plate of the
amplifier tube connect the metal point of your crystal detector, the
crystal of the latter with one post of the head phones and the other
post of them with the other end of the grid leak and, finally, connect
a fixed condenser in <i>parallel</i> with--that is across the ends of
the grid leak, all of which is shown in the wiring diagram in <i>Fig.
43</i>.</p>

<p><i>A Grid Leak Amplifying Receiving Set With Vacuum Tube
Detector</i>.--A better amplifying receiving set can be made than the
one just described by using a vacuum tube detector instead of the
crystal detector. This set is built up exactly like the crystal
detector described above and shown in <i>Fig. 43</i> up to and
including the grid leak resistance, but shunted across the latter is a
vacuum tube detector, which is made and wired up precisely like the
one shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 41</i> in the chapter ahead of this
one. The way a grid leak and vacuum tube detector with a one-step
amplifier are connected up is shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 44</i>.
Where you have a vacuum tube detector and one or more amplifying tubes
connected up, or in <i>cascade</i> as it is called, you can use an
<i>A</i>, or storage battery of 6 volts for all of them as shown at
<i>B</i> in <i>Fig. 44</i>, but for every vacuum tube you use you must
have a <i>B</i> or 22-1/2 volt dry battery to charge the plate
with.</p>

alt=
"(B) Fig. 44.--Wiring Diagram for Using One A or Storage Battery with an Amplifier and a Detector Tube.">
</a> 

<p><i>A Radio Frequency Transformer Amplifying Receiving
Set</i>.--Instead of using a grid leak resistance to couple up the
amplifier and detector tube circuits you can use a <i>radio frequency
transformer</i>, that is, a transformer made like a loose coupled
tuning coil, and without an iron core, as shown in the wiring diagram
at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 45</i>. In this set, which gives better results
than where a grid leak is used, the amplifier tube is placed in the
first oscillation circuit and the detector tube in the second
circuit.</p>

<a name="fig045a"><img width="600" height="394" src="fig045a.png" alt=

</a> <a name="fig045b"><img width="412" height="320" src="fig045b.png"
alt="(B) Fig. 45.--Radio Frequency Transformer."></a> 

<p>Since the radio frequency transformer has no iron core the high
frequency, or <i>radio frequency</i> oscillating currents, as they are
called, surge through it and are not changed into low frequency, or
<i>audio frequency</i> pulsating currents, until they flow through the
detector. Since the diagram shows only one amplifier and one radio
frequency transformer, it is consequently a <i>one step amplifier</i>;
however, two, three or more, amplifying tubes can be connected up by
means of an equal number of radio frequency transformers when you will
get wonderful results. Where a six step amplifier, that is, where six
amplifying tubes are connected together, or in <i>cascade</i>, the
first three are usually coupled up with radio frequency transformers
and the last three with audio frequency transformers. A radio
frequency transformer is shown at <i>B</i> and costs $6 to $7.</p>

<p><i>An Audio Frequency Transformer Amplifying Receiving
Set</i>.--Where audio frequency transformers are used for stepping up
the voltage of the current of the detector and amplifier tubes, the
radio frequency current does not get into the plate circuit of the
detector at all for the reason that the iron core of the transformer
chokes them off, hence, the succeeding amplifiers operate at audio
frequencies. An audio frequency transformer is shown at <i>A</i> in
<i>Fig. 46</i> and a wiring diagram showing how the tubes are
connected in <i>cascade</i> with the transformers is shown at
<i>B</i>; it is therefore a two-step audio frequency receiving
set.</p>

<p><i>A Six Step Amplifier Receiving Set With a Loop Aerial.</i>--By
using a receiving set having a three step radio frequency and a three
step audio frequency, that is, a set in which there are coupled three
amplifying tubes with radio frequency transformers and three
amplifying tubes with audio frequency transformers as described under
the caption <i>A Radio Frequency Transformer Receiving Set</i>, you
can use a <i>loop aerial</i> in your room thus getting around the
difficulties--if such there be--in erecting an out-door aerial. You
can easily make a loop aerial by winding 10 turns of <i>No. 14</i> or
<i>16</i> copper wire about 1/16 inch apart on a wooden frame two feet
on the side as shown in <i>Fig. 47</i>. With this six step amplifier
set and loop aerial you can receive wave lengths of 150 to 600 meters
from various high power stations which are at considerable distances
away.</p>

<p><i>How to Prevent Howling</i>.--Where radio frequency or audio
frequency amplifiers are used to couple your amplifier tubes in
cascade you must take particular pains to shield them from one another
in order to prevent the <i>feed back</i> of the currents through them,
which makes the head phones or loud speaker <i>howl</i>. To shield
them from each other the tubes should be enclosed in metal boxes and
placed at least 6 inches apart while the transformers should be set so
that their cores are at right angles to each other and these also
should be not less than six inches apart.</p>

<h3>REGENERATIVE AMPLIFICATION RECEIVING SETS</h3>

<p>While a vacuum tube detector has an amplifying action of its own,
and this accounts for its great sensitiveness, its amplifying action
can be further increased to an enormous extent by making the radio
frequency currents that are set up in the oscillation circuits react
on the detector.</p>

<p>Such currents are called <i>feed-back</i> or <i>regenerative</i>
currents and when circuits are so arranged as to cause the currents to
flow back through the detector tube the amplification keeps on
increasing until the capacity of the tube itself is reached. It is
like using steam over and over again in a steam turbine until there is
no more energy left in it. A system of circuits which will cause this
regenerative action to take place is known as the <i>Armstrong
circuits</i> and is so called after the young man who discovered
it.</p>

<p>Since the regenerative action of the radio frequency currents is
produced by the detector tube itself and which sets up an amplifying
effect without the addition of an amplifying tube, this type of
receiving set has found great favor with amateurs, while in
combination with amplifying tubes it multiplies their power
proportionately and it is in consequence used in one form or another
in all the better sets.</p>

<p>There are many different kinds of circuits which can be used to
produce the regenerative amplification effect while the various kinds
of tuning coils will serve for coupling them; for instance a two or
three slide single tuning coil will answer the purpose but as it does
not give good results it is not advisable to spend either time or
money on it. A better scheme is to use a loose coupler formed of two
or three honeycomb or other compact coils, while a <i>variocoupler</i>
or a <i>variometer</i> or two will produce the maximum regenerative
action.</p>

<p><i>The Simplest Type of Regenerative Receiving Set. With Loose
Coupled Tuning Coil</i>.--While this regenerative set is the simplest
that will give anything like fair results it is here described not on
account of its desirability, but because it will serve to give you the
fundamental idea of how the <i>feed-back</i> circuit is formed.</p>

<p>For this set you need: (1) a <i>loose-coupled tuning coil</i> such
as described in <a href="#chap03">Chapter III</a>, (2) a <i>variable
condenser</i> of <i>.001 mfd.</i> (microfarad) capacitance; (3) one
<i>fixed condenser</i> of <i>.001 mfd.</i>; (4) one <i>fixed
condenser</i> for the grid leak circuit of <i>.00025 mfd.</i>; (5) a
<i>grid leak</i> of 1/2 to 2 megohms resistance; (6) a <i>vacuum tube
detector</i>; (7) an <i>A 6 volt battery</i>; (8) a <i>rheostat</i>;
(9) a <i>B 22 1/2 volt battery</i>; and (10) a pair of <i>2000 ohm
head phones</i>.</p>

<p><i>Connecting Up the Parts.</i>--Begin by connecting the leading-in
wire of the aerial with the binding post end of the primary coil of
the loose coupler as shown in the wiring diagram <i>Fig. 48</i> and
then connect the sliding contact with the water pipe or other ground.
Connect the binding post end of the primary coil with one post of the
variable condenser, connect the other post of this with one of the
posts of the <i>.00025 mfd.</i> condenser and the other end of this
with the grid of the detector tube; then around this condenser shunt
the grid leak resistance.</p>

<a name="fig048"><img width="600" height="510" src="fig048.png" alt=
"Fig. 48.--Simple Regenerative Receiving Set. (With Loose Coupler Tuner.)">
</a> 

<p>Next connect the sliding contact of the primary coil with the other
post of the variable condenser and from this lead a wire on over to
one of the terminals of the filament of the vacuum tube; to the other
terminal of the filament connect one of the posts of the rheostat and
connect the other post to the - or negative electrode of the <i>A</i>
battery and then connect the + or positive electrode of it to the
other terminal of the filament.</p>

<p>Connect the + or positive electrode of the <i>A</i> battery with
one post of the .001 mfd. fixed condenser and connect the other post
of this to one of the ends of the secondary coil of the tuning coil
and which is now known as the <i>tickler coil</i>; then connect the
other end of the secondary, or tickler coil to the plate of the vacuum
tube. In the wiring diagram the secondary, or tickler coil is shown
above and in a line with the primary coil but this is only for the
sake of making the connections clear; in reality the secondary, or
tickler coil slides to and fro in the primary coil as shown and
described in <a href="#chap03">Chapter III</a>. Finally connect the
<i>negative</i>, or zinc pole of the <i>B battery</i> to one side of
the fixed condenser, the <i>positive</i>, or carbon, pole to one of
the terminals of the head phones and the other terminal of this to the
other post of the fixed condenser when your regenerative set is
complete.</p>

<p><i>An Efficient Regenerative Receiving Set. With Three Coil Loose
Coupler.</i>--To construct a really good regenerative set you must use
a loose coupled tuner that has three coils, namely a <i>primary</i>, a
<i>secondary</i> and a <i>tickler coil</i>. A tuner of this kind is
made like an ordinary loose coupled tuning coil but it has a
<i>third</i> coil as shown at <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> in <i>Fig. 49</i>.
The middle coil, which is the <i>secondary</i>, is fixed to the base,
and the large outside coil, which is the <i>primary</i>, is movable,
that is it slides to and fro over the middle coil, while the small
inside coil, which is the <i>tickler</i>, is also movable and can
slide in or out of the middle <i>coil</i>. None of these coils is
variable; all are wound to receive waves up to 360 meters in length
when used with a variable condenser of <i>.001 mfd</i>. capacitance.
In other words you slide the coils in and out to get the right amount
of coupling and you tune by adjusting the variable condenser to get
the exact wave length you want.</p>

<a name="fig049a"><img width="600" height="355" src="fig049a.png" alt=
"(A) Fig. 49.--Diagram of a Three Coil Coupler."></a> <a name=
"fig049b"><img width="553" height="240" src="fig049b.png" alt=
"(B) Fig. 49.--Three Coil Loose Coupler Tuner."></a> 

<p><i>With Compact Coils</i>.--Compact coil tuners are formed of three
fixed inductances wound in flat coils, and these are pivoted in a
mounting so that the distance between them and, therefore, the
coupling, can be varied, as shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 50</i>. These
coils are wound up by the makers for various wave lengths ranging from
a small one that will receive waves of any length up to 360 meters to
a large one that has a maximum of 24,000 meters. For an amateur set
get three of the smallest coils when you can not only hear amateur
stations that send on a 200 meter wave but broadcasting stations that
send on a 360 meter wave.</p>

<a name="fig050"><img width="599" height="320" src="fig050.png" alt=
"Fig. 50.--Honeycomb Inductance Coil."></a> 

<p>These three coils are mounted with panel plugs which latter fit
into a stand, or mounting, so that the middle coil is fixed, that is,
stationary, while the two outside coils can be swung to and fro like a
door; this scheme permits small variations of coupling to be had
between the coils and this can be done either by handles or by means
of knobs on a panel board. While I have suggested the use of the
smallest size coils, you can get and use those wound for any wave
length you want to receive and when those are connected with
variometers and variable condensers, and with a proper aerial, you
will have a highly efficient receptor that will work over all ranges
of wave lengths. The smallest size coils cost about $1.50 apiece and
the mounting costs about $6 or $7 each.</p>

<p><i>The A Battery Potentiometer</i>.--This device is simply a
resistance like the rheostat described in connection with the
preceding vacuum tube receiving sets but it is wound to 200 or 300
ohms resistance as against 1-1/2 to 6 ohms of the rheostat. It is,
however, used as well as the rheostat. With a vacuum tube detector,
and especially with one having a gas-content, a potentiometer is very
necessary as it is only by means of it that the potential of the plate
of the detector can be accurately regulated. The result of proper
regulation is that when the critical potential value is reached there
is a marked increase in the loudness of the sounds that are emitted by
the head phones.</p>

<p>As you will see from <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 51</i> it has three taps.
The two taps which are connected with the ends of the resistance coil
are shunted around the <i>A</i> battery and the third tap, which is
attached to the movable contact arm, is connected with the <i>B</i>
battery tap, see <i>B</i>, at which this battery gives 18 volts. Since
the <i>A</i> battery gives 6 volts you can vary the potential of the
plate from 18 to 24 volts. The potentiometer must never be shunted
around the <i>B</i> battery or the latter will soon run down. A
potentiometer costs a couple of dollars.</p>

<a name="fig051a"><img width="600" height="392" src="fig051a.png" alt=
"(A) Fig. 51.--The Use of the Potentiometer."></a> 

<p><i>The Parts and How to Connect Them Up.</i>--For this regenerative
set you will need: (1) a <i>honeycomb</i> or other compact
<i>three-coil tuner</i>, (2) two <i>variable</i> (<i>.001</i> and
<i>.0005 mfd</i>.) <i>condensers</i>; (3) a <i>.00025 mfd. fixed
condenser</i>; (4) a <i>1/2 to 2 megohm grid leak</i>; (5) a <i>tube
detector</i>; (6) a <i>6 volt A battery</i>; (7) <i>a rheostat</i>;
(8) a <i>potentiometer</i>; (9) an <i>18</i> or <i>20 volt B
battery</i>; (10) a <i>fixed condenser</i> of <i>.001 mfd. fixed
condenser</i>; and (11) a <i>pair of 2000 ohm head phones</i>.</p>

<p>To wire up the parts connect the leading-in wire of the aerial with
the primary coil, which is the middle one of the tuner, and connect
the other terminal with the ground. Connect the ends of the secondary
coil, which is the middle one, with the posts of the variable
condenser and connect one of the posts of the latter with one post of
the fixed .00025 mfd. condenser and the other post of this with the
grid; then shunt the grid leak around it. Next connect the other post
of the variable condenser to the - or <i>negative</i> electrode of the
<i>A battery</i>; the + or <i>positive</i> electrode of this to one
terminal of the detector filament and the other end of the latter to
the electrode of the <i>A</i> battery.</p>

<p>Now connect one end of the tickler coil with the detector plate and
the other post to the fixed .001 mfd. condenser, then the other end of
this to the positive or carbon pole of the <i>B</i> battery.</p>

<p>This done shunt the potentiometer around the <i>A</i> battery and
run a wire from the movable contact of it (the potentiometer) over to
the 18 volt tap, (see <i>B</i>, <i>Fig. 51</i>), of the <i>B</i>
battery. Finally, shunt the head phones and the .001 mfd. fixed
condenser and you are ready to try out conclusions.</p>

<p><i>A Regenerative Audio Frequency Amplifier Receiving Set.</i>--The
use of amateur regenerative cascade audio frequency receiving sets is
getting to be quite common. To get the greatest amplification possible
with amplifying tubes you have to keep a negative potential on the
grids. You can, however, get very good results without any special
charging arrangement by simply connecting one post of the rheostat
with the negative terminal of the filament and connecting the <i>low
potential</i> end of the secondary of the tuning coil with the - or
negative electrode of the <i>A</i> battery. This scheme will give the
grids a negative bias of about 1 volt. You do not need to bother about
these added factors that make for high efficiency until after you have
got your receiving set in working order and understand all about
it.</p>

<p><i>The Parts and How to Connect Them Up.</i>--Exactly the same
parts are needed for this set as the one described above, but in
addition you will want: (1) two more <i>rheostats</i>; (2) <i>two</i>
more sets of <i>B</i> 22-1/2 <i>volt batteries</i>; (3) <i>two
amplifier tubes</i>, and (4) <i>two audio frequency transformers</i>
as described in <a href="#chap09">Chapter IX</a> and pictured at
<i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 46</i>.</p>

<p>To wire up the parts begin by connecting the leading-in wire to one
end of the primary of the tuning coil and then connect the other end
of the coil with the ground. A variable condenser of .001 mfd.
capacitance can be connected in the ground wire, as shown in <i>Fig.
52</i>, to good advantage although it is not absolutely needed. Now
connect one end of the secondary coil to one post of a <i>.001
mfd.</i> variable condenser and the other end of the secondary to the
other post of the condenser.</p>

<a name="fig052"><img width="600" height="348" src="fig052.png" alt=
"Fig. 52.--Regenerative Audio Frequency Amplifier Receiving Set."></a>


<p>Next bring a lead (wire) from the first post of the variable
condenser over to the post of the first fixed condenser and connect
the other post of the latter with the grid of the detector tube. Shunt
1/2 to 2 megohm grid leak resistance around the fixed condenser and
then connect the second post of the variable condenser to one terminal
of the detector tube filament. Run this wire on over and connect it
with the first post of the second rheostat, the second post of which
is connected with one terminal of the filament of the first amplifying
tube; then connect the first post of the rheostat with one end of the
secondary coil of the first audio frequency transformer, and the other
end of this coil with the grid of the first amplifier tube.</p>

<p>Connect the lead that runs from the second post of variable
condenser to the first post of the third rheostat, the second post of
which is connected with one terminal of the second amplifying tube;
then connect the first post of the rheostat with one end of the
secondary coil of the second audio frequency transformer and the other
end of this coil with the grid of the second amplifier tube.</p>

<p>This done connect the - or negative electrode of the <i>A</i>
battery with the second post of the variable condenser and connect the
+ or positive electrode with the free post of the first rheostat, the
other post of which connects with the free terminal of the filament of
the detector. From this lead tap off a wire and connect it to the free
terminal of the filament of the first amplifier tube, and finally
connect the end of the lead with the free terminal of the filament of
the second amplifier tube.</p>

<p>Next shunt a potentiometer around the <i>A</i> battery and connect
the third post, which connects with the sliding contact, to the
negative or zinc pole of a <i>B</i> battery, then connect the positive
or carbon pole of it to the negative or zinc pole of a second <i>B</i>
battery and the positive or carbon pole of the latter with one end of
the primary coil of the second audio frequency transformer and the
other end of it to the plate of the first amplifying tube. Run the
lead on over and connect it to one of the terminals of the second
fixed condenser and the other terminal of this with the plate of the
second amplifying tube. Then shunt the headphones around the
condenser.</p>

<p>Finally connect one end of the tickler coil of the tuner with the
plate of the detector tube and connect the other end of the tickler to
one end of the primary coil of the first audio frequency transformer
and the other end of it to the wire that connects the two <i>B</i>
batteries together.</p>

<h3>SHORT WAVE REGENERATIVE RECEIVING SETS</h3>

<p>A <i>short wave receiving set</i> is one that will receive a range
of wave lengths of from 150 to 600 meters while the distance over
which the waves can be received as well as the intensity of the sounds
reproduced by the headphones depends on: (1) whether it is a
regenerative set and (2) whether it is provided with amplifying
tubes.</p>

<p>High-grade regenerative sets designed especially for receiving
amateur sending stations that must use a short wave length are built
on the regenerative principle just like those described in the last
chapter and further amplification can be had by the use of amplifier
tubes as explained in <a href="#chap09">Chapter IX</a>, but the new
feature of these sets is the use of the <i>variocoupler</i> and one or
more <i>variometers</i>. These tuning devices can be connected up in
different ways and are very popular with amateurs at the present
time.</p>

<p>Differing from the ordinary loose coupler the variometer has no
movable contacts while the variometer is provided with taps so that
you can connect it up for the wave length you want to receive. All you
have to do is to tune the oscillation circuits to each other is to
turn the <i>rotor</i>, which is the secondary coil, around in the
<i>stator</i>, as the primary coil is called in order to get a very
fine variation of the wave length. It is this construction that makes
<i>sharp tuning</i> with these sets possible, by which is meant that
all wave lengths are tuned out except the one which the receiving set
is tuned for.</p>

<p><i>A Short Wave Regenerative Receiver--With One Variometer and
Three Variable Condensers.</i>--This set also includes a variocoupler
and a <i>grid coil</i>. The way that the parts are connected together
makes it a simple and at the same time a very efficient regenerative
receiver for short waves. While this set can be used without shielding
the parts from each other the best results are had when shields are
used.</p>

<p>The parts you need for this set include: (1) one
<i>variocoupler</i>; (2) one <i>.001 microfarad variable
condenser</i>; (3) one <i>.0005 microfarad variable condenser</i>; (4)
one <i>.0007 microfarad variable condenser</i>; (5) <i>one 2 megohm
grid leak</i>; (6) one <i>vacuum tube detector</i>; (7) one <i>6 volt
A battery</i>; (8) one <i>6 ohm</i>, 1-1/2 <i>ampere rheostat</i>; (9)
one <i>200 ohm potentiometer</i>; (10) one 22-1/2 <i>volt B
battery</i>; (11) one <i>.001 microfarad fixed condenser</i>, (12) one
pair of <i>2,000 ohm headphones</i>, and (13) a <i>variometer</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Variocoupler</i>.--A variocoupler consists of a primary coil
wound on the outside of a tube of insulating material and to certain
turns of this taps are connected so that you can fix the wave length
which your aerial system is to receive from the shortest wave;
<i>i.e.</i>, 150 meters on up by steps to the longest wave,
<i>i.e.</i>, 600 meters, which is the range of most amateur
variocouplers that are sold in the open market. This is the part of
the variocoupler that is called the <i>stator</i>.</p>

<p>The secondary coil is wound on the section of a ball mounted on a
shaft and this is swung in bearings on the stator so that it can turn
in it. This part of the variocoupler is called the <i>rotor</i> and is
arranged so that it can be mounted on a panel and adjusted by means of
a knob or a dial. A diagram of a variocoupler is shown at <i>A</i> in
<i>Fig. 53</i>, and the coupler itself at <i>B</i>. There are various
makes and modifications of variocouplers on the market but all of them
are about the same price which is $6.00 or $8.00.</p>

<a name="fig053"><img width="600" height="461" src="fig053.png" alt=
"Fig. 53.--How the Variocoupler is Made and Works."></a> 

<p><i>The Variometer.</i>--This device is quite like the variocoupler,
but with these differences: (1) the rotor turns in the stator, which
is also the section of a ball, and (2) one end of the primary is
connected with one end of the secondary coil. To be really efficient a
variometer must have a small resistance and a large inductance as well
as a small dielectric loss. To secure the first two of these factors
the wire should be formed of a number of fine, pure copper wires each
of which is insulated and the whole strand then covered with silk.
This kind of wire is the best that has yet been devised for the
purpose and is sold under the trade name of <i>litzendraht</i>.</p>

<p>A new type of variometer has what is known as a <i>basket
weave</i>, or <i>wavy wound</i> stator and rotor. There is no wood,
insulating compound or other dielectric materials in large enough
quantities to absorb the weak currents that flow between them, hence
weaker sounds can be heard when this kind of a variometer is used.
With it you can tune sharply to waves under 200 meters in length and
up to and including wave lengths of 360 meters. When amateur stations
of small power are sending on these short waves this style of
variometer keeps the electric oscillations at their greatest strength
and, hence, the reproduced sounds will be of maximum intensity. A
wiring diagram of a variometer is shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 54</i>
and a <i>basketball</i> variometer is shown complete at <i>B</i>.</p>

<a name="fig054"><img width="600" height="329" src="fig054.png" alt=
"Fig. 54.--How the Variometer is Made and Works."></a> 

<p><i>Connecting Up the Parts</i>.--To hook-up the set connect the
leading-in wire to one end of the primary coil, or stator, of the
variocoupler and solder a wire to one of the taps that gives the
longest wave length you want to receive. Connect the other end of this
wire with one post of a .001 microfarad variable condenser and connect
the other post with the ground as shown in <i>Fig. 55</i>. Now connect
one end of the secondary coil, or rotor, to one post of a .0007 mfd.
variable condenser, the other post of this to one end of the grid coil
and the other end of this with the remaining end of the rotor of the
variocoupler.</p>

<a name="fig055"><img width="600" height="386" src="fig055.png" alt=
"Fig. 55.--Short Wave Regenerative Receiving Set (one Variometer and three Variable Condensers.)">
</a> 

<p>Next connect one post of the .0007 mfd. condenser with one of the
terminals of the detector filament; then connect the other post of
this condenser with one post of the .0005 mfd. variable condenser and
the other post of this with the grid of the detector, then shunt the
megohm grid leak around the latter condenser. This done connect the
other terminal of the filament to one post of the rheostat, the other
post of this to the - or negative electrode of the 6 volt <i>A</i>
battery and the + or positive electrode of the latter to the other
terminal of the filament.</p>

<p>Shunt the potentiometer around the <i>A</i> battery and connect the
sliding contact with the - or zinc pole of the <i>B</i> battery and
the + or carbon pole with one terminal of the headphone; connect the
other terminal to one of the posts of the variometer and the other
post of the variometer to the plate of the detector. Finally shunt a
.001 mfd. fixed condenser around the headphones. If you want to
amplify the current with a vacuum tube amplifier connect in the
terminals of the amplifier circuit shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Figs.
44</i> or <i>45</i> at the point where they are connected with the
secondary coil of the loose coupled tuning coil, in those diagrams
with the binding posts of <i>Fig. 55</i> where the phones are usually
connected in.</p>

<p><i>Short Wave Regenerative Receiver. With Two Variometers and Two
Variable Condensers.</i>--This type of regenerative receptor is very
popular with amateurs who are using high-grade short-wave sets. When
you connect up this receptor you must keep the various parts well
separated. Screw the variocoupler to the middle of the base board or
panel, and secure the variometers on either side of it so that the
distance between them will be 9 or 10 inches. By so placing them the
coupling will be the same on both sides and besides you can shield
them from each other easier.</p>

<p>For the shield use a sheet of copper on the back of the panel and
place a sheet of copper between the parts, or better, enclose the
variometers and detector and amplifying tubes if you use the latter in
sheet copper boxes. When you set up the variometers place them so that
their stators are at right angles to each other for otherwise the
magnetic lines of force set up by the coils of each one will be
mutually inductive and this will make the headphones or loud speaker
<i>howl</i>. Whatever tendency the receptor has to howl with this
arrangement can be overcome by putting in a grid leak of the right
resistance and adjusting the condenser.</p>

<p><i>The Parts and How to Connect Them Up.</i>--For this set you
require: (1) one <i>variocoupler</i>; (2) two <i>variometers</i>; (3)
one <i>.001 microfarad variable condenser</i>; (4) one <i>.0005
microfarad variable condenser</i>; (5) one <i>2 megohm grid leak
resistance</i>; (6) one <i>vacuum tube detector</i>; (7) one <i>6 volt
A battery</i>; (8) one <i>200 ohm potentiometer</i>; (9) one <i>22-1/2
volt B battery</i>; (10) one <i>.001 microfarad fixed condenser</i>,
and (11) one pair of <i>2,000 ohm headphones</i>.</p>

<p>To wire up the set begin by connecting the leading-in wire to the
fixed end of the primary coil, or <i>stator</i>, of the variocoupler,
as shown in <i>Fig. 56</i>, and connect one post of the .001 mfd.
variable condenser to the stator by soldering a short length of wire
to the tap of the latter that gives the longest wave you want to
receive. Now connect one end of the secondary coil, or <i>rotor</i>,
of the variocoupler with one post of the .0005 mfd. variable condenser
and the other part to the grid of the detector tube. Connect the other
end of the rotor of the variocoupler to one of the posts of the first

<h3>INTERMEDIATE AND LONG WAVE REGENERATIVE RECEIVING SETS</h3>

<p>All receiving sets that receive over a range of wave lengths of
from 150 meters to 3,000 meters are called <i>intermediate wave
sets</i> and all sets that receive wave lengths over a range of
anything more than 3,000 meters are called <i>long wave sets</i>. The
range of intermediate wave receptors is such that they will receive
amateur, broadcasting, ship and shore Navy, commercial, Arlington's
time and all other stations using <i>spark telegraph damped waves</i>
or <i>arc</i> or <i>vacuum tube telephone continuous waves</i> but not
<i>continuous wave telegraph signals</i>, unless these have been
broken up into groups at the transmitting station. To receive
continuous wave telegraph signals requires receiving sets of special
kind and these will be described in the next chapter.</p>

<p><i>Intermediate Wave Receiving Sets</i>.--There are two chief
schemes employed to increase the range of wave lengths that a set can
receive and these are by using: (1) <i>loading coils</i> and <i>shunt
condensers</i>, and (2) <i>bank-wound coils</i> and <i>variable
condensers</i>. If you have a short-wave set and plan to receive
intermediate waves with it then loading coils and fixed condensers
shunted around them affords you the way to do it, but if you prefer to
buy a new receptor then the better way is to get one with bank-wound
coils and variable condensers; this latter way preserves the
electrical balance of the oscillation circuits better, the electrical
losses are less and the tuning easier and sharper.</p>

<p><i>Intermediate Wave Set With Loading Coils.</i>--For this
intermediate wave set you can use either of the short-wave sets
described in the foregoing chapter. For the loading coils use
<i>honeycomb coils</i>, or other good compact inductance coils, as
shown in <a href="#chap10">Chapter X</a> and having a range of
whatever wave length you wish to receive. The following table shows
the range of wave length of the various sized coils when used with a
variable condenser having a .001 microfarad <i>capacitance</i>, the
approximate <i>inductance</i> of each coil in <i>millihenries</i> and
prices at the present writing:</p>

<p>These and other kinds of compact coils can be bought at electrical
supply houses that sell wireless goods. If your aerial is not very
high or long you can use loading coils, but to get anything like
efficient results with them you must have an aerial of large
capacitance and the only way to get this is to put up a high and long
one with two or more parallel wires spaced a goodly distance
apart.</p>

<p><i>The Parts and How to Connect Them Up</i>.--Get (1) <i>two
honeycomb or other coils</i> of the greatest wave length you want to
receive, for in order to properly balance the aerial, or primary
oscillation circuit, and the closed, or secondary oscillation circuit,
you have to tune them to the same wave length; (2) two <i>.001 mfd.
variable condensers</i>, though fixed condensers will do, and (3) two
small <i>single-throw double-pole knife switches</i> mounted on
porcelain bases.</p>

<p>To use the loading coils all you have to do is to connect one of
them in the aerial above the primary coil of the loose coupler, or
variocoupler as shown in the wiring diagram in <i>Fig. 57</i>, then
shunt one of the condensers around it and connect one of the switches
around this; this switch enables you to cut in or out the loading coil
at will. Likewise connect the other loading coil in one side of the
closed, or secondary circuit between the variable .0007 mfd. condenser
and the secondary coil of the loose coupler or variocoupler as shown
in <i>Fig. 53</i>. The other connections are exactly the same as shown
in <i>Figs. 44 and 45</i>.</p>

<a name="fig057"><img width="600" height="638" src="fig057.png" alt=
"Fig. 57.--Wiring Diagram Showing Fixed Loading Coils for Intermediate Wave Set.">
</a> 

<p><i>An Intermediate Wave Set With Variocoupler Inductance
Coils</i>.--By using the coil wound on the rotor of the variocoupler
as the tickler the coupling between the detector tube circuits and the
aerial wire system increases as the set is tuned for greater wave
lengths. This scheme makes the control of the regenerative circuit far
more stable than it is where an ordinary loose coupled tuning coil is
used.</p>

<p>When the variocoupler is adjusted for receiving very long waves the
rotor sets at right angles to the stator and, since when it is in this
position there is no mutual induction between them, the tickler coil
serves as a loading coil for the detector plate oscillation circuit.
Inductance coils for short wave lengths are usually wound in single
layers but <i>bank-wound coils</i>, as they are called are necessary
to get compactness where long wave lengths are to be received. By
winding inductance coils with two or more layers the highest
inductance values can be obtained with the least resistance. A wiring
diagram of a multipoint inductance coil is shown in <i>Fig. 58</i>.
You can buy this intermediate wave set assembled and ready to use or
get the parts and connect them up yourself.</p>

<a name="fig058"><img width="600" height="469" src="fig058.png" alt=
"Fig. 58.--Wiring Diagram for Intermediate Wave Receptor with one Variocoupler and 12 section Bank-wound Inductance Coil.">
</a> 

<p><i>The Parts and How to Connect Them Up.</i>--For this regenerative
intermediate wave set get: (1) one <i>12 section triple bank-wound
inductance coil</i>, (2) one <i>variometer</i>, and (3) all the other
parts shown in the diagram <i>Fig. 58</i> except the variocoupler.
First connect the free end of the condenser in the aerial to one of
the terminals of the stator of the variocoupler; then connect the
other terminal of the stator with one of the ends of the bank-wound
inductance coil and connect the movable contact of this with the
ground.</p>

<p>Next connect a wire to the aerial between the variable condenser
and the stator and connect this to one post of a .0005 microfarad
fixed condenser, then connect the other post of this with the grid of
the detector and shunt a 2 megohm grid leak around it. Connect a wire
to the ground wire between the bank-wound inductance coil and the
ground proper, <i>i.e.</i>, the radiator or water pipe, connect the
other end of this to the + electrode of the <i>A</i> battery and
connect this end also to one of the terminals of the filament. This
done connect the other terminal of the filament to one post of the
rheostat and the other post of this to the - or negative side of the
<i>A</i> battery.</p>

<p>To the + electrode of the <i>A</i> battery connect the - or zinc
pole of the <i>B</i> battery and connect the + or carbon pole of the
latter with one post of the fixed .001 microfarad condenser. This done
connect one terminal of the tickler coil which is on the rotor of the
variometer to the plate of the detector and the other terminal of the
tickler to the other post of the .001 condenser and around this shunt
your headphones. Or if you want to use one or more amplifying tubes
connect the circuit of the first one, see <i>Fig. 45</i>, to the posts
on either side of the fixed condenser instead of the headphones.</p>

<p><i>A Long Wave Receiving Set.</i>--The vivid imagination of Jules
Verne never conceived anything so fascinating as the reception of
messages without wires sent out by stations half way round the world;
and in these days of high power cableless stations on the five
continents you can listen-in to the messages and hear what is being
sent out by the Lyons, Paris and other French stations, by Great
Britain, Italy, Germany and even far off Russia and Japan.</p>

<p>A long wave set for receiving these stations must be able to tune
to wave lengths up to 20,000 meters. Differing from the way in which
the regenerative action of the short wave sets described in the
preceding chapter is secured and which depends on a tickler coil and
the coupling action of the detector in this long wave set, [Footnote:
All of the short wave and intermediate wave receivers described, are
connected up according to the wiring diagram used by the A. H. Grebe
Company, Richmond Hill, Long Island, N. Y.] this action is obtained by
the use of a tickler coil in the plate circuit which is inductively
coupled to the grid circuit and this feeds back the necessary amount
of current. This is a very good way to connect up the circuits for the
reason that: (1) the wiring is simplified, and (2) it gives a single
variable adjustment for the entire range of wave lengths the receptor
is intended to cover.</p>

<p><i>The Parts and How to Connect Them Up.</i>--The two chief
features as far as the parts are concerned of this long wave length
receiving set are (1) the <i>variable condensers</i>, and (2) the
<i>tuning inductance coils</i>. The variable condenser used in series
with the aerial wire system has 26 plates and is equal to a
capacitance of <i>.0008 mfd.</i> which is the normal aerial
capacitance. The condenser used in the secondary coil circuit has 14
plates and this is equal to a capacitance of <i>.0004 mfd</i>.</p>

<p>There are a number of inductance coils and these are arranged so
that they can be connected in or cut out and combinations are thus
formed which give a high efficiency and yet allow them to be compactly
mounted. The inductance coils of the aerial wire system and those of
the secondary coil circuit are practically alike. For wave lengths up
to 2,200 meters <i>bank litz-wound coils</i> are used and these are
wound up in 2, 4 and 6 banks in order to give the proper degree of
coupling and inductance values.</p>

<p>Where wave lengths of more than 2,200 meters are to be received
<i>coto-coils</i> are used as these are the "last word" in inductance
coil design, and are especially adapted for medium as well as long
wave lengths. [Footnote: Can be had of the Coto Coil Co., Providence,
R. I.] These various coils are cut in and out by means of two
five-point switches which are provided with auxiliary levers and
contactors for <i>dead-ending</i> the right amount of the coils. In
cutting in coils for increased wave lengths, that is from 10,000 to
20,000 meters, all of the coils of the aerial are connected in series
as well as all of the coils of the secondary circuit. The connections
for a long wave receptor are shown in the wiring diagram in <i>Fig.
59</i>.</p>

<h3>HETERODYNE OR BEAT LONG WAVE TELEGRAPH RECEIVING SET</h3>

<p>Any of the receiving sets described in the foregoing chapters will
respond to either: (1) a wireless telegraph transmitter that uses a
spark gap and which sends out periodic electric waves, or to (2) a
wireless telephone transmitter that uses an arc or a vacuum tube
oscillator and which sends out continuous electric waves. To receive
wireless <i>telegraph</i> signals, however, from a transmitter that
uses an arc or a vacuum tube oscillator and which sends out continuous
waves, either the transmitter or the receptor must be so constructed
that the continuous waves will be broken up into groups of audio
frequency and this is done in several different ways.</p>

<p>There are four different ways employed at the present time to break
up the continuous waves of a wireless telegraph transmitter into
groups and these are: (<i>a</i>) the <i>heterodyne</i>, or
<i>beat</i>, method, in which waves of different lengths are impressed
on the received waves and so produces beats; (<i>b</i>) the
<i>tikker</i>, or <i>chopper</i> method, in which the high frequency
currents are rapidly broken up; (<i>c</i>) the variable condenser
method, in which the movable plates are made to rapidly rotate;
(<i>d</i>) the <i>tone wheel</i>, or <i>frequency transformer</i>, as
it is often called, and which is really a modified form of and an
improvement on the tikker. The heterodyne method will be described in
this chapter.</p>

<p><i>What the Heterodyne or Beat Method Is.</i>--The word
<i>heterodyne</i> was coined from the Greek words <i>heteros</i> which
means <i>other</i>, or <i>different</i>, and <i>dyne</i> which means
<i>power</i>; in other words it means when used in connection with a
wireless receptor that another and different high frequency current is
used besides the one that is received from the sending station. In
music a <i>beat</i> means a regularly recurrent swelling caused by the
reinforcement of a sound and this is set up by the interference of
sound waves which have slightly different periods of vibration as, for
instance, when two tones take place that are not quite in tune with
each other. This, then, is the principle of the heterodyne, or beat,
receptor.</p>

<p>In the heterodyne, or beat method, separate sustained oscillations,
that are just about as strong as those of the incoming waves, are set
up in the receiving circuits and their frequency is just a little
higher or a little lower than those that are set up by the waves
received from the distant transmitter. The result is that these
oscillations of different frequencies interfere and reinforce each
other when <i>beats</i> are produced, the period of which is slow
enough to be heard in the headphones, hence the incoming signals can
be heard only when waves from the sending station are being received.
A fuller explanation of how this is done will be found in <a href=
"#chap15">Chapter XV</a>.</p>

<p><i>The Autodyne or Self-Heterodyne Long-Wave Receiving
Set.</i>--This is the simplest type of heterodyne receptor and it will
receive periodic waves from spark telegraph transmitters or continuous
waves from an arc or vacuum tube telegraph transmitter. In this type
of receptor the detector tube itself is made to set up the
<i>heterodyne oscillations</i> which interfere with those that are
produced by the incoming waves that are a little out of tune with
it.</p>

<p>With a long wave <i>autodyne</i>, or <i>self-heterodyne</i>
receptor, as this type is called, and a two-step audio-frequency
amplifier you can clearly hear many of the cableless stations of
Europe and others that send out long waves. For receiving long wave
stations, however, you must have a long aerial--a single wire 200 or
more feet in length will do--and the higher it is the louder will be
the signals. Where it is not possible to put the aerial up a hundred
feet or more above the ground, you can use a lower one and still get
messages in <i>International Morse</i> fairly strong.</p>

<p><i>The Parts and Connections of an Autodyne, or Self-Heterodyne,
Receiving Set.</i>--For this long wave receiving set you will need:
(1) one <i>variocoupler</i> with the primary coil wound on the stator
and the secondary coil and tickler coil wound on the rotor, or you can
use three honeycomb or other good compact coils of the longest wave
you want to receive, a table of which is given in <a href=
"#chap07">Chapter XII</a>; (2) two <i>.001 mfd. variable
condensers</i>; (3) one <i>.0005 mfd. variable condenser</i>; (4) one
<i>.5 to 2 megohm grid leak resistance</i>; (5) one <i>vacuum tube
detector</i>; (6) one <i>A battery</i>; (7) one <i>rheostat</i>; (8)
one <i>B battery</i>; (9) one <i>potentiometer</i>; (10) one <i>.001
mfd. fixed condenser</i> and (11) one pair of <i>headphones</i>. For
the two-step amplifier you must, of course, have besides the above
parts the amplifier tubes, variable condensers, batteries rheostats,
potentiometers and fixed condensers as explained in <a href=
"#chap09">Chapter IX</a>. The connections for the autodyne, or
self-heterodyne, receiving set are shown in <i>Fig. 60</i>.</p>

"Fig. 60.--Wiring Diagram of Long Wave Antodyne, or Self-Heterodyne Receptor.">
</a> 

<p><i>The Separate Heterodyne Long Wave Receiving Set.</i>--This is a
better long wave receptor than the self heterodyne set described above
for receiving wireless telegraph signals sent out by a continuous long
wave transmitter. The great advantage of using a separate vacuum tube
to generate the heterodyne oscillations is that you can make the
frequency of the oscillations just what you want it to be and hence
you can make it a little higher or a little lower than the
oscillations set up by the received waves.</p>

<p><i>The Parts and Connections of a Separate Heterodyne Long Wave
Receiving Set.</i>--The parts required for this long wave receiving
set are: (1) four honeycomb or other good <i>compact inductance</i>
coils of the longest wave length that you want to receive; (2) three
<i>.001 mfd. variable condensers</i>; (3) one <i>.0005 mfd. variable
condenser</i>; (4) one <i>1 megohm grid leak resistance</i>; (5) one
<i>vacuum tube detector</i>; (6) one <i>A battery</i>; (7) two
rheostats; (8) two <i>B batteries</i>, one of which is supplied with
taps; (9) one <i>potentiometer</i>; (10) one <i>vacuum tube
amplifier</i>, for setting up the heterodyne oscillations; (11) a pair
of <i>headphones</i> and (12) all of the parts for a <i>two-step
amplifier</i> as detailed in <a href="#chap09">Chapter IX</a>, that is
if you are going to use amplifiers. The connections are shown in
<i>Fig. 61</i>.</p>

</a> 

<p>In using either of these heterodyne receivers be sure to carefully
adjust the <i>B</i> battery by means of the potentiometer.</p>

of oscillations.]</p>

<h3>HEADPHONES AND LOUD SPEAKERS</h3>

<p><i>Wireless Headphones.</i>--A telephone receiver for a wireless
receiving set is made exactly on the same principle as an ordinary
Bell telephone receiver. The only difference between them is that the
former is made flat and compact so that a pair of them can be fastened
together with a band and worn on the head (when it is called a
<i>headset</i>), while the latter is long and cylindrical so that it
can be held to the ear. A further difference between them is that the
wireless headphone is made as sensitive as possible so that it will
respond to very feeble currents, while the ordinary telephone receiver
is far from being sensitive and will respond only to comparatively
large currents.</p>

<p><i>How a Bell Telephone Receiver Is Made.</i>--An ordinary
telephone receiver consists of three chief parts and these are: (1) a
hard-rubber, or composition, shell and cap, (2) a permanent steel bar
magnet on one end of which is wound a coil of fine insulated copper
wire, and (3) a soft iron disk, or <i>diaphragm</i>, all of which are
shown in the cross-section in <i>Fig. 62</i>. The bar magnet is
securely fixed inside of the handle so that the outside end comes to
within about 1/32 of an inch of the diaphragm when this is laid on top
of the shell and the cap is screwed on.</p>

<a name="fig062"><img width="586" height="400" src="fig062.png" alt=
"Fig. 62.--Cross-section of Bell telephone Receiver."></a>

<tr>
<td align="center">original &copy; Underwood and Underwood.<br>
 Alexander Graham Bell, Inventor of the Telephone, now an ardent Radio
Enthusiast.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The ends of the coil of wire are connected with two binding posts
which are in the end of the shell, but are shown in the picture at the
sides for the sake of clearness. This coil usually has a resistance of
about 75 ohms and the meaning of the <i>ohmic resistance</i> of a
receiver and its bearing on the sensitiveness of it will be explained
a little farther along. After the disk, or diaphragm, which is
generally made of thin, soft sheet iron that has been tinned or
japanned, [Footnote: A disk of photographic tin-type plate is
generally used.] is placed over the end of the magnet, the cap, which
has a small opening in it, is screwed on and the receiver is ready to
use.</p>

<p><i>How a Wireless Headphone Is Made.</i>--For wireless work a
receiver of the watch-case type is used and nearly always two such
receivers are connected with a headband. It consists of a permanent
bar magnet bent so that it will fit into the shell of the receiver as
shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 63</i>.</p>

<a name="fig063"><img width="320" height="397" src="fig063.png" alt=
"Fig. 63.--Wireless Headphone."></a> 

<p>The ends of this magnet, which are called <i>poles</i>, are bent
up, and hence this type is called a <i>bipolar</i> receiver. The
magnets are wound with fine insulated wire as before and the diaphragm
is held securely in place over them by screwing on the cap.</p>

<p><i>About Resistance, Turns of Wire and Sensitivity of
Headphones.</i>--If you are a beginner in wireless you will hear those
who are experienced speak of a telephone receiver as having a
resistance of 75 ohms, 1,000 ohms, 2,000 or 3,000 ohms, as the case
may be; from this you will gather that the higher the resistance of
the wire on the magnets the more sensitive the receiver is. In a sense
this is true, but it is not the resistance of the magnet coils that
makes it sensitive, in fact, it cuts down the current, but it is the
<i>number of turns</i> of wire on them that determines its
sensitiveness; it is easy to see that this is so, for the larger the
number of turns the more often will the same current flow round the
cores of the magnet and so magnetize them to a greater extent.</p>

<p>But to wind a large number of turns of wire close enough to the
cores to be effective the wire must be very small and so, of course,
the higher the resistance will be. Now the wire used for winding good
receivers is usually No. 40, and this has a diameter of .0031 inch;
consequently, when you know the ohmic resistance you get an idea of
the number of turns of wire and from this you gather in a general way
what the sensitivity of the receiver is.</p>

<p>A receiver that is sensitive enough for wireless work should be
wound to not less than 1,000 ohms (this means each ear phone), while
those of a better grade are wound to as high as 3,000 ohms for each
one. A high-grade headset is shown in <i>Fig. 64</i>. Each phone of a
headset should be wound to the same resistance, and these are
connected in series as shown. Where two or more headsets are used with
one wireless receiving set they must all be of the same resistance and
connected in series, that is, the coils of one head set are connected
with the coils of the next head set and so on to form a continuous
circuit.</p>

<a name="fig064"><img width="549" height="360" src="fig064.png" alt=
"Fig. 64.--Wireless Headphone."></a> 

<p><i>The Impedance of Headphones.</i>--When a current is flowing
through a circuit the material of which the wire is made not only
opposes its passage--this is called its <i>ohmic resistance</i>--but a
<i>counter-electromotive force</i> to the current is set up due to the
inductive effects of the current on itself and this is called
<i>impedance</i>. Where a wire is wound in a coil the impedance of the
circuit is increased and where an alternating current is used the
impedance grows greater as the frequency gets higher. The impedance of
the magnet coils of a receiver is so great for high frequency
oscillations that the latter cannot pass through them; in other words,
they are choked off.</p>

<p><i>How the Headphones Work.</i>--As you will see from the
cross-sections in <i>Figs. 62</i> and <i>63</i> there is no
connection, electrical or mechanical, between the diaphragm and the
other parts of the receiver. Now when either feeble oscillations,
which have been rectified by a detector, or small currents from a
<i>B</i> battery, flow through the magnet coils the permanent steel
magnet is energized to a greater extent than when no current is
flowing through it. This added magnetic energy makes the magnet
attract the diaphragm more than it would do by its own force. If, on
the other hand, the current is cut off the pull of the magnet is
lessened and as its attraction for the diaphragm is decreased the
latter springs back to its original position. When varying currents
flow through the coils the diaphragm vibrates accordingly and sends
out sound waves.</p>

<p><i>About Loud Speakers.</i>--The simplest acoustic instrument ever
invented is the <i>megaphone</i>, which latter is a Greek word meaning
<i>great sound</i>. It is a very primitive device and our Indians made
it out of birch-bark before Columbus discovered America. In its
simplest form it consists of a cone-shaped horn and as the speaker
talks into the small end the concentrated sound waves pass out of the
large end in whatever direction it is held.</p>

<p>Now a loud speaker of whatever kind consists of two chief parts and
these are: (1) a <i>telephone receiver</i>, and (2) a
<i>megaphone</i>, or <i>horn</i> as it is called. A loud speaker when
connected with a wireless receiving set makes it possible for a room,
or an auditorium, full of people, or an outdoor crowd, to hear what is
being sent out by a distant station instead of being limited to a few
persons listening-in with headphones. To use a loud speaker you should
have a vacuum tube detector receiving set and this must be provided
with a one-step amplifier at least.</p>

<p>To get really good results you need a two-step amplifier and then
energize the plate of the second vacuum tube amplifier with a 100 volt
<i>B</i> battery; or if you have a three-step amplifier then use the
high voltage on the plate of the third amplifier tube. Amplifying
tubes are made to stand a plate potential of 100 volts and this is the
kind you must use. Now it may seem curious, but when the current flows
through the coils of the telephone receiver in one direction it gives
better results than when it flows through in the other direction; to
find out the way the current gives the best results try it out both
ways and this you can do by simply reversing the connections.</p>

<p><i>The Simplest Type of Loud Speaker.</i>--This loud speaker, which
is called, the Arkay, [Footnote: Made by the Riley-Klotz Mfg. Co.,
Newark, N. J.] will work on a one- or two-step amplifier. It consists
of a brass horn with a curve in it and in the bottom there is an
adapter, or frame, with a set screw in it so that you can fit in one
of your headphones and this is all there is to it. The construction is
rigid enough to prevent overtones, or distortion of speech or music.
It is shown in <i>Fig. 65</i>.</p>

<p><i>Another Simple Kind of Loud Speaker.</i>--Another loud speaker,
see <i>Fig. 66</i>, is known as the <i>Amplitone</i> [Footnote: Made
by the American Pattern, Foundry and Machine Co., 82 Church Street, N.
Y. C.] and it likewise makes use of the headphones as the sound
producer. This device has a cast metal horn which improves the quality
of the sound, and all you have to do is to slip the headphones on the
inlet tubes of the horn and it is ready for use. The two headphones
not only give a longer volume of sound than where a single one is used
but there is a certain blended quality which results from one phone
smoothing out the imperfections of the other.</p>

<p><i>A Third Kind of Simple Loud Speaker.</i>--The operation of the
<i>Amplitron</i>, [Footnote: Made by the Radio Service Co., 110 W.
40th Street, N. Y.] as this loud speaker is called, is slightly
different from others used for the same purpose. The sounds set up by
the headphone are conveyed to the apex of an inverted copper cone
which is 7 inches long and 10 inches in diameter. Here it is reflected
by a parabolic mirror which greatly amplifies the sounds. The
amplification takes place without distortion, the sounds remaining as
clear and crisp as when projected by the transmitting station. By
removing the cap from the receiver the shell is screwed into a
receptacle on the end of the loud speaker and the instrument is ready
for use. It is pictured in <i>Fig. 67</i>.</p>

<p><i>A Super Loud Speaker.</i>--This loud speaker, which is known as
the <i>Magnavox Telemegafone</i>, was the instrument used by Lt.
Herbert E. Metcalf, 3,000 feet in the air, and which startled the City
of Washington on April 2, 1919, by repeating President Wilson's
<i>Victory Loan Message</i> from an airplane in flight so that it was
distinctly heard by 20,000 people below.</p>

<p>This wonderful achievement was accomplished through the
installation of the <i>Magnavox</i> and amplifiers in front of the
Treasury Building. Every word Lt. Metcalf spoke into his wireless
telephone transmitter was caught and swelled in volume by the
<i>Telemegafones</i> below and persons blocks away could hear the
message plainly. Two kinds of these loud speakers are made and these
are: (1) a small loud speaker for the use of operators so that
headphones need not be worn, and (2) a large loud speaker for
auditorium and out-door audiences.</p>

</table>

<p>Either kind may be used with a one- or two-step amplifier or with a
cascade of half a dozen amplifiers, according to the degree of
loudness desired. The <i>Telemegafone</i> itself is not an amplifier
in the true sense inasmuch as it contains no elements which will
locally increase the incoming current. It does, however, transform the
variable electric currents of the wireless receiving set into sound
vibrations in a most wonderful manner.</p>

<p>A <i>telemegafone</i> of either kind is formed of: (1) a telephone
receiver of large proportions, (2) a step-down induction coil, and (3)
a 6 volt storage battery that energizes a powerful electromagnet which
works the diaphragm. An electromagnet is used instead of a permanent
magnet and this is energized by a 6-volt storage battery as shown in
the wiring diagram at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 68</i>. One end of the core
of this magnet is fixed to the iron case of the speaker and together
these form the equivalent of a horseshoe magnet. A movable coil of
wire is supported from the center of the diaphragm the edge of which
is rigidly held between the case and the small end of the horn. This
coil is placed over the upper end of the magnet and its terminals are
connected to the secondary of the induction coil. Now when the coil is
energized by the current from the amplifiers it and the core act like
a solenoid in that the coil tends to suck the core into it; but since
the core is fixed and the coil is movable the core draws the coil down
instead. The result is that with every variation of the current that
flows through the coil it moves up and down and pulls and pushes the
diaphragm down and up with it. The large amplitude of the vibrations
of the latter set up powerful sound waves which can be heard several
blocks away from the horn. In this way then are the faint incoming
signals, speech and music which are received by the amplifying
receiving set reproduced and magnified enormously. The
<i>Telemegafone</i> is shown complete at <i>B</i>.</p>

<h3>OPERATION OF VACUUM TUBE RECEPTORS</h3>

<p>From the foregoing chapters you have seen that the vacuum tube can
be used either as a <i>detector</i> or an <i>amplifier</i> or as a
<i>generator</i> of electric oscillations, as in the case of the
heterodyne receiving set. To understand how a vacuum tube acts as a
detector and as an amplifier you must first know what <i>electrons</i>
are. The way in which the vacuum tube sets up sustained oscillations
will be explained in <a href="#chap18">Chapter XVIII</a> in connection
with the <i>Operation of Vacuum Tube Transmitters</i>.</p>

<p><i>What Electrons Are.</i>--Science teaches us that masses of
matter are made up of <i>molecules</i>, that each of these is made up
of <i>atoms</i>, and each of these, in turn, is made up of a central
core of positive particles of electricity surrounded by negative
particles of electricity as shown in the schematic diagram, <i>Fig.
69</i>. The little black circles inside the large circle represent
<i>positive particles of electricity</i> and the little white circles
outside of the large circle represent <i>negative particles of
electricity</i>, or <i>electrons</i> as they are called.</p>

<a name="fig069"><img width="600" height="410" src="fig069.png" alt=
"Fig. 69.--Schematic Diagram of an Atom."></a> 

<p>It is the number of positive particles of electricity an atom has
that determines the kind of an element that is formed when enough
atoms of the same kind are joined together to build it up. Thus
hydrogen, which is the lightest known element, has one positive
particle for its nucleus, while uranium, the heaviest element now
known, has 92 positive particles. Now before leaving the atom please
note that it is as much smaller than the diagram as the latter is
smaller than our solar system.</p>

<p><i>What Is Meant by Ionization.</i>--A hydrogen atom is not only
lighter but it is smaller than the atom of any other element while an
electron is more than a thousand times smaller than the atom of which
it is a part. Now as long as all of the electrons remain attached to
the surface of an atom its positive and negative charges are equalized
and it will, therefore, be neither positive nor negative, that is, it
will be perfectly neutral. When, however, one or more of its electrons
are separated from it, and there are several ways by which this can be
done, the atom will show a positive charge and it is then called a
<i>positive ion</i>.</p>

<p>In other words a <i>positive ion</i> is an atom that has lost some
of its negative electrons while a <i>negative ion</i> is one that has
acquired some additional negative <i>electrons</i>. When a number of
electrons are being constantly given by the atoms of an element, which
let us suppose is a metal, and are being attracted to atoms of another
element, which we will say is also a metal, a flow of electrons takes
place between the two oppositely charged elements and form a current
of negative electricity as represented by the arrows at <i>A</i> in
<i>Fig. 70</i>.</p>

<a name="fig070"><img width="600" height="277" src="fig070.png" alt=
"Fig. 70.--Action of Two-electrode Vacuum Tube."></a> 

<p>When a stream of electrons is flowing between two metal elements,
as a filament and a plate in a vacuum tube detector, or an amplifier,
they act as <i>carriers</i> for more negative electrons and these are
supplied by a battery as we shall presently explain. It has always
been customary for us to think of a current of electricity as flowing
from the positive pole of a battery to the negative pole of it and
hence we have called this the <i>direction of the current</i>. Since
the electronic theory has been evolved it has been shown that the
electrons, or negative charges of electricity, flow from the negative
to the positive pole and that the ionized atoms, which are more
positive than negative, flow in the opposite direction as shown at
<i>B</i>.</p>

<p><i>How Electrons are Separated from Atoms</i>.--The next question
that arises is how to make a metal throw off some of the electrons of
the atoms of which it is formed. There are several ways that this can
be done but in any event each atom must be given a good, hard blow. A
simple way to do this is to heat a metal to incandescence when the
atoms will bombard each other with terrific force and many of the
electrons will be knocked off and thrown out into the surrounding
space.</p>

<p>But all, or nearly all, of them will return to the atoms from
whence they came unless a means of some kind is employed to attract
them to the atoms of some other element. This can be done by giving
the latter piece of metal a positive charge. If now these two pieces
of metal are placed in a bulb from which the air has been exhausted
and the first piece of metal is heated to brilliancy while the second
piece of metal is kept positively electrified then a stream of
electrons will flow between them.</p>

<p><i>Action of the Two Electrode Vacuum Tube.</i>--Now in a vacuum
tube detector a wire filament, like that of an incandescent lamp, is
connected with a battery and this forms the hot element from which the
electrons are thrown off, and a metal plate with a terminal wire
secured to it is connected to the positive or carbon tap of a dry
battery; now connect the negative or zinc tap of this with one end of
a telephone receiver and the other end of this with the terminals of
the filament as shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 71</i>. If now you heat
the filament and hold the phone to your ear you can hear the current
from the <i>B</i> battery flowing through the circuit.</p>

<a name="fig071ab"><img width="600" height="321" src="fig071ab.png"

alt=
"(C) Fig. 71.--Only the Positive Part of Oscillations Goes through the Tube.">
</a> 

<p>Since the electrons are negative charges of electricity they are
not only thrown off by the hot wire but they are attracted by the
positive charged metal plate and when enough electrons pass, or flow,
from the hot wire to the plate they form a conducting path and so
complete the circuit which includes the filament, the plate and the
<i>B</i> or plate battery, when the current can then flow through it.
As the number of electrons that are thrown off by the filament is not
great and the voltage of the plate is not high the current that flows
between the filament and the plate is always quite small.</p>

<p><i>How the Two Electrode Tube Acts as a Detector.</i>--As the
action of a two electrode tube as a detector [Footnote: The three
electrode vacuum tube has entirely taken the place of the two
electrode type.] is simpler than that of the three electrode vacuum
tube we shall describe it first. The two electrode vacuum tube was
first made by Mr. Edison when he was working on the incandescent lamp
but that it would serve as a detector of electric waves was discovered
by Prof. Fleming, of Oxford University, London. As a matter of fact,
it is not really a detector of electric waves, but it acts as: (1) a
<i>rectifier</i> of the oscillations that are set up in the receiving
circuits, that is, it changes them into pulsating direct currents so
that they will flow through and affect a telephone receiver, and (2)
it acts as a <i>relay</i> and the feeble received oscillating current
controls the larger direct current from the <i>B</i> battery in very
much the same way that a telegraph relay does. This latter relay
action will be explained when we come to its operation as an
amplifier.</p>

<p>We have just learned that when the stream of electrons flow from
the hot wire to the cold positive plate in the tube they form a
conducting path through which the battery current can flow. Now when
the electric oscillations surge through the closed oscillation
circuit, which includes the secondary of the tuning coil, the variable
condenser, the filament and the plate as shown at <i>B</i> in <i>Fig.
71</i> the positive part of them passes through the tube easily while
the negative part cannot get through, that is, the top, or positive,
part of the wave-form remains intact while the lower, or negative,
part is cut off as shown in the diagram at <i>C</i>. As the received
oscillations are either broken up into wave trains of audio frequency
by the telegraph transmitter or are modulated by a telephone
transmitter they carry the larger impulses of the direct current from
the <i>B</i> battery along with them and these flow through the
headphones. This is the reason the vacuum tube amplifies as well as
detects.</p>

<p><i>How the Three Electrode Tube Acts as a Detector.</i>--The vacuum
tube as a detector has been made very much more sensitive by the use
of a third electrode shown in <i>Fig. 72</i>. In this type of vacuum
tube the third electrode, or <i>grid</i>, is placed between the
filament and the plate and this controls the number of electrons
flowing from the filament to the plate; in passing between these two
electrodes they have to go through the holes formed by the grid
wires.</p>

<a name="fig072ab"><img width="600" height="359" src="fig072ab.png"
alt=

alt=
"(D) Fig. 72.--How the Oscillations Control the Flow of the Battery Current through the Tube.">
</a> 

<p>If now the grid is charged to a higher <i>negative</i> voltage than
the filament the electrons will be stopped by the latter, see
<i>A</i>, though some of them will go through to the plate because
they travel at a high rate of speed. The higher the negative charge on
the grid the smaller will be the number of electrons that will reach
the plate and, of course, the smaller will be the amount of current
that will flow through the tube and the headphones from the <i>B</i>
battery.</p>

<p>On the other hand if the grid is charged <i>positively</i>, see
<i>B</i>, then more electrons will strike the plate than when the grid
is not used or when it is negatively charged. But when the three
electrode tube is used as a detector the oscillations set up in the
circuits change the grid alternately from negative to positive as
shown at <i>C</i> and hence the voltage of the <i>B</i> battery
current that is allowed to flow through the detector from the plate to
the filament rises and falls in unison with the voltage of the
oscillating currents. The way the positive and negative voltages of
the oscillations which are set up by the incoming waves, energize the
grid; how the oscillator tube clips off the negative parts of them,
and, finally, how these carry the battery current through the tube are
shown graphically by the curves at <i>D</i>.</p>

<p><i>How the Vacuum Tube Acts as an Amplifier</i>.--If you connect up
the filament and the plate of a three electrode tube with the
batteries and do not connect in the grid, you will find that the
electrons which are thrown off by the filament will not get farther
than the grid regardless of how high the voltage is that you apply to
the plate. This is due to the fact that a large number of electrons
which are thrown off by the filament strike the grid and give it a
negative charge, and consequently, they cannot get any farther. Since
the electrons do not reach the plate the current from the <i>B</i>
battery cannot flow between it and the filament.</p>

<p>Now with a properly designed amplifier tube a very small negative
voltage on the grid will keep a very large positive voltage on the
plate from sending a current through the tube, and oppositely, a very
small positive voltage on the grid will let a very large plate current
flow through the tube; this being true it follows that any small
variation of the voltage from positive to negative on the grid and the
other way about will vary a large current flowing from the plate to
the filament.</p>

<p>In the Morse telegraph the relay permits the small current that is
received from the distant sending station to energize a pair of
magnets, and these draw an armature toward them and close a second
circuit when a large current from a local battery is available for
working the sounder. The amplifier tube is a variable relay in that
the feeble currents set up by the incoming waves constantly and
proportionately vary a large current that flows through the
headphones. This then is the principle on which the amplifying tube
works.</p>

<p><i>The Operation of a Simple Vacuum Tube Receiving Set</i>.--The
way a simple vacuum tube detector receiving set works is like this:
when the filament is heated to brilliancy it gives off electrons as
previously described. Now when the electric waves impinge on the
aerial wire they set up oscillations in it and these surge through the
primary coil of the loose coupled tuning coil, a diagram of which is
shown at <i>B</i> in <i>Fig. 41</i>.</p>

<p>The energy of these oscillations sets up oscillations of the same
frequency in the secondary coil and these high frequency currents
whose voltage is first positive and then negative, surge in the closed
circuit which includes the secondary coil and the variable condenser.
At the same time the alternating positive and negative voltage of the
oscillating currents is impressed on the grid; at each change from +
to - and back again it allows the electrons to strike the plate and
then shuts them off; as the electrons form the conducting path between
the filament and the plate the larger direct current from the <i>B</i>
battery is permitted to flow through the detector tube and the
headphones.</p>

<p><i>Operation of a Regenerative Vacuum Tube Receiving Set</i>.--By
feeding back the pulsating direct current from the <i>B</i> battery
through the tickler coil it sets up other and stronger oscillations in
the secondary of the tuning coil when these act on the detector tube
and increase its sensitiveness to a remarkable extent. The
regenerative, or <i>feed back</i>, action of the receiving circuits
used will be easily understood by referring back to <i>B</i> in
<i>Fig. 47</i>.</p>

<p>When the waves set up oscillations in the primary of the tuning
coil the energy of them produces like oscillations in the closed
circuit which includes the secondary coil and the condenser; the
alternating positive and negative voltages of these are impressed on
the grid and these, as we have seen before, cause similar variations
of the direct current from the <i>B</i> battery which acts on the
plate and which flows between the latter and the filament.</p>

<p>This varying direct current, however, is made to flow back through
the third, or tickler coil of the tuning coil and sets up in the
secondary coil and circuits other and larger oscillating currents and
these augment the action of the oscillations produced by the incoming
waves. These extra and larger currents which are the result of the
feedback then act on the grid and cause still larger variations of the
current in the plate voltage and hence of the current of the <i>B</i>
battery that flows through the detector and the headphones. At the
same time the tube keeps on responding to the feeble electric
oscillations set up in the circuits by the incoming waves. This
regenerative action of the battery current augments the original
oscillations many times and hence produce sounds in the headphones
that are many times greater than where the vacuum tube detector alone
is used.</p>

<p><i>Operation of Autodyne and Heterodyne Receiving Sets</i>.--On
page <i>109</i> [Chapter VII] we discussed and at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig.
36</i> is shown a picture of two tuning forks mounted on sounding
boxes to illustrate the principle of electrical tuning. When a pair of
these forks are made to vibrate exactly the same number of times per
second there will be a condensation of the air between them and the
sound waves that are sent out will be augmented. But if you adjust one
of the forks so that it will vibrate 256 times a second and the other
fork so that it will vibrate 260 times a second then there will be a
phase difference between the two sets of waves and the latter will
augment each other 4 times every second and you will hear these rising
and falling sounds as <i>beats</i>.</p>

<p>Now electric oscillations set up in two circuits that are coupled
together act in exactly the same way as sound waves produced by two
tuning forks that are close to each other. Since this is true if you
tune one of the closed circuits so that the oscillations in it will
have a frequency of a 1,000,000 and tune the other circuit so that the
oscillations in it have a frequency of 1,001,000 a second then the
oscillations will augment each other 1,000 times every second.</p>

<p>As these rising and falling currents act on the pulsating currents
from the B battery which flow through the detector tube and the
headphones you will hear them as beats. A graphic representation of
the oscillating currents set up by the incoming waves, those produced
by the heterodyne oscillator and the beats they form is shown in
<i>Fig. 73</i>. To produce these beats a receptor can use: (1) a
single vacuum tube for setting up oscillations of both frequencies
when it is called an <i>autodyne</i>, or <i>self-heterodyne</i>
receptor, or (2) a separate vacuum tube for setting up the
oscillations for the second circuit when it is called a
<i>heterodyne</i> receptor.</p>

<a name="fig073"><img width="600" height="680" src="fig073.png" alt=
"Fig. 73.--How the Heterodyne Receptor Works."></a> 

<p><i>The Autodyne, or Self-Heterodyne Receiving Set</i>.--Where only
one vacuum tube is used for producing both frequencies you need only a
regenerative, or feed-back receptor; then you can tune the aerial wire
system to the incoming waves and tune the closed circuit of the
secondary coil so that it will be out of step with the former by 1,000
oscillations per second, more or less, the exact number does not
matter in the least. From this you will see that any regenerative set
can be used for autodyne, or self-heterodyne, reception.</p>

<p><i>The Separate Heterodyne Receiving Set.</i>--The better way,
however, is to use a separate vacuum tube for setting up the
heterodyne oscillations. The latter then act on the oscillations that
are produced by the incoming waves and which energize the grid of the
detector tube. Note that the vacuum tube used for producing the
heterodyne oscillations is a <i>generator</i> of electric
oscillations; the latter are impressed on the detector circuits
through the variable coupling, the secondary of which is in series
with the aerial wire as shown in <i>Fig. 74</i>. The way in which the
tube acts as a generator of oscillations will be told in <a href=
"#chap18">Chapter XVIII</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="chap16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<h3>CONTINUOUS WAVE TELEGRAPH TRANSMITTING SETS WITH DIRECT
CURRENT</h3>

<p>In the first part of this book we learned about spark-gap telegraph
sets and how the oscillations they set up are <i>damped</i> and the
waves they send out are <i>periodic</i>. In this and the next chapter
we shall find out how vacuum tube telegraph transmitters are made and
how they set up oscillations that are <i>sustained</i> and radiate
waves that are <i>continuous</i>.</p>

<p>Sending wireless telegraph messages by continuous waves has many
features to recommend it as against sending them by periodic waves and
among the most important of these are that the transmitter can be: (1)
more sharply tuned, (2) it will send signals farther with the same
amount of power, and (3) it is noiseless in operation. The
disadvantageous features are that: (1) a battery current is not
satisfactory, (2) its circuits are somewhat more complicated, and (3)
the oscillator tubes burn out occasionally. There is, however, a
growing tendency among amateurs to use continuous wave transmitters
and they are certainly more up-to-date and interesting than spark gap
sets.</p>

<p>Now there are two practical ways by which continuous waves can be
set up for sending either telegraphic signals or telephonic speech and
music and these are with: (a) an <i>oscillation arc lamp</i>, and (b)
a <i>vacuum tube oscillator</i>. The oscillation arc was the earliest
known way of setting up sustained oscillations, and it is now largely
used for commercial high power, long distance work. But since the
vacuum tube has been developed to a high degree of efficiency and is
the scheme that is now in vogue for amateur stations we shall confine
our efforts here to explaining the apparatus necessary and how to wire
the various parts together to produce several sizes of vacuum tube
telegraph transmitters.</p>

<p><i>Sources of Current for Telegraph Transmitting
Sets</i>.--Differing from a spark-gap transmitter you cannot get any
appreciable results with a low voltage battery current to start with.
For a purely experimental vacuum tube telegraph transmitter you can
use enough <i>B</i> batteries to operate it but the current strength
of these drops so fact when they are in use, that they are not at all
satisfactory for the work.</p>

<p>You can, however, use 110 volt direct current from a lighting
circuit as your initial source of power to energize the plate of the
vacuum tube oscillator of your experimental transmitter. Where you
have a 110 volt <i>direct current</i> lighting service in your home
and you want a higher voltage for your plate, you will then have to
use a motor-generator set and this costs money. If you have 110 volt
<i>alternating current</i> lighting service at hand your troubles are
over so far as cost is concerned for you can step it up to any voltage
you want with a power transformer. In this chapter will be shown how
to use a direct current for your source of initial power and in the
next chapter how to use an alternating current for the initial
power.</p>

<p><i>An Experimental Continuous Wave Telegraph Transmitter.</i>--You
will remember that in <a href="#chap15">Chapter XV</a> we learned how
the heterodyne receiver works and that in the separate heterodyne
receiving set the second vacuum tube is used solely to set up
oscillations. Now while this extra tube is used as a generator of
oscillations these are, of course, very weak and hence a detector tube
cannot be used to generate oscillations that are useful for other
purposes than heterodyne receptors and measurements.</p>

<p>There is a vacuum tube amplifier [Footnote: This is the
<i>radiation</i> UV-<i>201</i>, made by the Radio Corporation of
America, Woolworth Bldg., New York City.] made that will stand a plate
potential of 100 volts, and this can be used as a generator of
oscillations by energizing it with a 110 volt direct current from your
lighting service. Or in a pinch you can use five standard <i>B</i>
batteries to develop the plate voltage, but these will soon run down.
But whatever you do, never use a current from a lighting circuit on a
tube of any kind that has a rated plate potential of less than 100
volts.</p>

<p><i>The Apparatus You Need</i>.--For this experimental continuous
wave telegraph transmitter get the following pieces of apparatus: (1)
one <i>single coil tuner with three clips</i>; (2) one <i>.002 mfd.
fixed condenser</i>; (3) three <i>.001 mfd. condensers</i>; (4) one
<i>adjustable grid leak</i>; (5) one <i>hot-wire ammeter</i>; (6) one
<i>buzzer</i>; (7) one <i>dry cell</i>; (8) one <i>telegraph key</i>;
(9) one <i>100 volt plate vacuum tube amplifier</i>; (10) one <i>6
volt storage battery</i>; (11) one <i>rheostat</i>; (12) one
<i>oscillation choke coil</i>; (13) one <i>panel cut-out</i> with a
<i>single-throw, double-pole switch</i>, and a pair of <i>fuse
sockets</i> on it.</p>

<p><i>The Tuning Coil</i>.--You can either make this tuning coil or
buy one. To make it get two disks of wood 3/4-inch thick and 5 inches
in diameter and four strips of hard wood, or better, hard rubber or
composition strips, such as <i>bakelite</i>, 1/2-inch thick, 1 inch
wide and 5-3/4 inches long, and screw them to the disks as shown at
<i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 75</i>. Now wrap on this form about 25 turns of
No. 8 or 10, Brown and Sharpe gauge, bare copper wire with a space of
1/8-inch between each turn. Get three of the smallest size terminal
clips, see <i>B</i>, and clip them on to the different turns, when
your tuning coil is ready for use. You can buy a coil of this kind for
$4.00 or $5.00.</p>

<p><i>The Condensers</i>.--For the aerial series condenser get one
that has a capacitance of .002 mfd. and that will stand a potential of
3,000 volts. [Footnote: The U C-1014 <i>Faradon</i> condenser made by
the Radio Corporation of America will serve the purpose.] It is shown
at <i>C</i>. The other three condensers, see <i>D</i>, are also of the
fixed type and may have a capacitance of .001 mfd.; [Footnote: List
No. 266; fixed receiving condenser, sold by the Manhattan Electrical
Supply Co.] the blocking condenser should preferably have a
capacitance of 1/2 a mfd. In these condensers the leaves of the sheet
metal are embedded in composition. The aerial condenser will cost you
$2.00 and the others 75 cents each.</p>

<p><i>The Aerial Ammeter.</i>--This instrument is also called a
<i>hot-wire</i> ammeter because the oscillating currents flowing
through a piece of wire heat it according to their current strength
and as the wire contracts and expands it moves a needle over a scale.
The ammeter is connected in the aerial wire system, either in the
aerial side or the ground side--the latter place is usually the most
convenient. When you tune the transmitter so that the ammeter shows
the largest amount of current surging in the aerial wire system you
can consider that the oscillation circuits are in tune. A hot-wire
ammeter reading to 2.5 amperes will serve your needs, it costs $6.00
and is shown at <i>E</i> in <i>Fig. 75</i>.</p>

</table>

<p><i>The Buzzer and Dry Cell</i>.--While a heterodyne, or beat,
receptor can receive continuous wave telegraph signals an ordinary
crystal or vacuum tube detector receiving set cannot receive them
unless they are broken up into trains either at the sending station or
at the receiving station, and it is considered the better practice to
do this at the former rather than at the latter station. For this
small transmitter you can use an ordinary buzzer as shown at <i>F</i>.
A dry cell or two must be used to energize the buzzer. You can get one
for about 75 cents.</p>

<p><i>The Telegraph Key</i>.--Any kind of a telegraph key will serve
to break up the trains of sustained oscillations into dots and dashes.
The key shown at <i>G</i> is mounted on a composition base and is the
cheapest key made, costing $1.50.</p>

<p><i>The Vacuum Tube Oscillator</i>.--As explained before you can use
any amplifying tube that is made for a plate potential of 100 volts.
The current required for heating the filament is about 1 ampere at 6
volts. A porcelain socket should be used for this tube as it is the
best insulating material for the purpose. An amplifier tube of this
type is shown at <i>H</i> and costs $6.50.</p>

<p><i>The Storage Battery</i>.--A storage battery is used to heat the
filament of the tube, just as it is with a detector tube, and it can
be of any make or capacity as long as it will develop 6 volts. The
cheapest 6 volt storage battery on the market has a 20 to 40
ampere-hour capacity and sells for $13.00.</p>

<p><i>The Battery Rheostat</i>.--As with the receptors a rheostat is
needed to regulate the current that heats the filament. A rheostat of
this kind is shown at <i>I</i> and is listed at $1.25.</p>

<p><i>The Oscillation Choke Coil</i>.--This coil is connected in
between the oscillation circuits and the source of current which feeds
the oscillator tube to keep the oscillations set up by the latter from
surging back into the service wires where they would break down the
insulation. You can make an oscillation choke coil by winding say 100
turns of No. 28 Brown and Sharpe gauge double cotton covered magnet
wire on a cardboard cylinder 2 inches in diameter and 2-1/2 inches
long.</p>

<p><i>Transmitter Connectors</i>.--For connecting up the different
pieces of apparatus of the transmitter it is a good scheme to use
<i>copper braid</i>; this is made of braided copper wire in three
sizes and sells for 7,15 and 20 cents a foot respectively. A piece of
it is pictured at <i>J</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Panel Cut-Out</i>.--This is used to connect the cord of the
110-volt lamp socket with the transmitter. It consists of a pair of
<i>plug cutouts and a single-throw, double-pole</i> switch mounted on
a porcelain base as shown at <i>K</i>. In some localities it is
necessary to place these in an iron box to conform to the requirements
of the fire underwriters.</p>

<p><i>Connecting Up the Transmitting Apparatus</i>.--The way the
various pieces of apparatus are connected together is shown in the
wiring diagram. <i>Fig. 76</i>. Begin by connecting one post of the
ammeter with the wire that leads to the aerial and the other post of
it to one end of the tuning coil; connect clip <i>1</i> to one
terminal of the .002 mfd. 3,000 volt aerial condenser and the other
post of this with the ground.</p>

<a name="fig076"><img width="600" height="538" src="fig076.png" alt=
"Fig. 76--Experimental C.W. Telegraph Transmitter"></a> 

<p>Now connect the end of the tuning coil that leads to the ammeter
with one end of the .001 mfd. grid condenser and the other end of this
with the grid of the vacuum tube. Connect the telegraph key, the
buzzer and the dry cell in series and then shunt them around the grid
condenser. Next connect the plate of the tube with one end of the .001
mfd. blocking condenser and the other end of this with the clip
<i>2</i> on the tuning coil.</p>

<p>Connect one end of the filament with the + or positive electrode of
the storage battery, the - or negative electrode of this with one post
of the rheostat and the other post of the latter with the other end of
the filament; then connect clip <i>3</i> with the + or positive side
of the storage battery. This done connect one end of the choke coil to
the conductor that leads to the plate and connect the other end of the
choke coil to one of the taps of the switch on the panel cut-out.
Connect the + or positive electrode of the storage battery to the
other switch tap and between the switch and the choke coil connect the
protective condenser across the 110 volt feed wires. Finally connect
the lamp cord from the socket to the plug fuse taps when your
experimental continuous wave telegraph transmitter is ready to
use.</p>

<p><i>A 100 Mile C. W. Telegraph Transmitter</i>.--Here is a
continuous wave telegraph transmitter that will cover distances up to
100 miles that you can rely on. It is built on exactly the same lines
as the experimental transmitter just described, but instead of using a
100 volt plate amplifier as a makeshift generator of oscillations it
employs a vacuum tube made especially for setting up oscillations and
instead of having a low plate voltage it is energized with 350
volts.</p>

<p><i>The Apparatus You Need</i>.--For this transmitter you require:
(1) one <i>oscillation transformer</i>; (2) one <i>hot-wire
ammeter</i>; (3) one <i>aerial series condenser</i>; (4) one <i>grid
leak resistance</i>; (5) one <i>chopper</i>; (6) one <i>key circuit
choke coil</i>; (7) one <i>5 watt vacuum tube oscillator</i>; (8) one
<i>6 volt storage battery</i>; (9) one <i>battery rheostat</i>; (10)
one <i>battery voltmeter</i>; (11) one <i>blocking condenser</i>; (12)
one <i>power circuit choke coil</i>, and (13) one
<i>motor-generator</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Oscillation Transformer</i>.--The tuning coil, or
<i>oscillation transformer</i> as this one is called, is a
conductively coupled tuner--that is, the primary and secondary coils
form one continuous coil instead of two separate coils. This tuner is
made up of 25 turns of thin copper strip, 3/8 inch wide and with its
edges rounded, and this is secured to a wood base as shown at <i>A</i>
in <i>Fig. 77</i>. It is fitted with one fixed tap and three clips to
each of which a length of copper braid is attached. It has a diameter
of 6-1/4 inches, a height of 7-7/8 inches and a length of 9-3/8
inches, and it costs $11.00.</p>

<a name="fig077"><img width="548" height="800" src="fig077.png" alt=
"Fig. 77.--Apparatus of 100 Mile C. W. Telegraph Transmitter."></a> 

<p><i>The Aerial Condenser</i>.--This condenser is made up of three
fixed condensers of different capacitances, namely .0003, .0004 and
.0005 mfd., and these are made to stand a potential of 7500 volts. The
condenser is therefore adjustable and, as you will see from the
picture <i>B</i>, it has one terminal wire at one end and three
terminal wires at the other end so that one, two or three condensers
can be used in series with the aerial. A condenser of this kind costs
$5.40.</p>

<p><i>The Aerial Ammeter</i>.--This is the same kind of a hot-wire
ammeter already described in connection with the experimental set, but
it reads to 5 amperes.</p>

<p><i>The Grid and Blocking Condensers</i>.--Each of these is a fixed
condenser of .002 mfd. capacitance and is rated to stand 3,000 volts.
It is made like the aerial condenser but has only two terminals. It
costs $2.00.</p>

<p><i>The Key Circuit Apparatus</i>.--This consists of: (1) the
<i>grid leak</i>; (2) the <i>chopper</i>; (3) the <i>choke coil</i>,
and (4) the <i>key</i>. The grid leak is connected in the lead from
the grid to the aerial to keep the voltage on the grid at the right
potential. It has a resistance of 5000 ohms with a mid-tap at 2500
ohms as shown at <i>C</i>. It costs $2.00.</p>

<p>The chopper is simply a rotary interrupter driven by a small motor.
It comprises a wheel of insulating material in which 30 or more metal
segments are set in an insulating disk as shown at <i>D</i>. A metal
contact called a brush is fixed on either side of the wheel. It costs
about $7.00 and the motor to drive it is extra. The choke coil is
wound up of about 250 turns of No. 30 Brown and Sharpe gauge cotton
covered magnet wire on a spool which has a diameter of 2 inches and a
length of 3-1/4 inches.</p>

<p><i>The 5 Watt Oscillator Vacuum Tube</i>.--This tube is made like
the amplifier tube described for use with the preceding experimental
transmitter, but it is larger, has a more perfect vacuum, and will
stand a plate potential of 350 volts while the plate current is .045
ampere. The filament takes a current of a little more than 2 amperes
at 7.5 volts. A standard 4-tap base is used with it. The tube costs
$8.00 and the porcelain base is $1.00 extra. It is shown at
<i>E</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Storage Battery and Rheostat</i>.--This must be a 5-cell
battery so that it will develop 10 volts. A storage battery of any
capacity can be used but the lowest priced one costs about $22.00. The
rheostat for regulating the battery current is the same as that used
in the preceding experimental transmitter.</p>

<p><i>The Filament Voltmeter</i>.--To get the best results it is
necessary that the voltage of the current which heats the filament be
kept at the same value all of the time. For this transmitter a direct
current voltmeter reading from 0 to 15 volts is used. It is shown at
<i>F</i> and costs $7.50.</p>

<p><i>The Oscillation Choke Coil</i>.--This is made exactly like the
one described in connection with the experimental transmitter.</p>

<p><i>The Motor-Generator Set</i>.--Where you have only a 110 or a 220
volt direct current available as a source of power you need a
<i>motor-generator</i> to change it to 350 volts, and this is an
expensive piece of apparatus. It consists of a single armature core
with a motor winding and a generator winding on it and each of these
has its own commutator. Where the low voltage current flows into one
of the windings it drives its as a motor and this in turn generates
the higher voltage current in the other winding. Get a 100 watt 350
volt motor-generator; it is shown at <i>F</i> and costs about
$75.00.</p>

<p><i>The Panel Cut-Out</i>.--This switch and fuse block is the same
as that used in the experimental set.</p>

<p><i>The Protective Condenser</i>.--This is a fixed condenser having
a capacitance of 1 mfd. and will stand 750 volts. It costs $2.00.</p>

<p><i>Connecting Up the Transmitting Apparatus</i>.--From all that has
gone before you have seen that each piece of apparatus is fitted with
terminal, wires, taps or binding posts. To connect up the parts of
this transmitter it is only necessary to make the connections as shown
in the wiring diagram <i>Fig. 78</i>.</p>

<a name="fig078"><img width="600" height="458" src="fig078.png" alt=
"Fig. 78.--5 to 50 Watt C. W. Telegraph Transmitter. (With Single Oscillation Tube.)">
</a> 

<p><i>A 200 Mile C. W. Telegraph Transmitter</i>.--To make a
continuous wave telegraph transmitter that will cover distances up to
200 miles all you have to do is to use two 5 watt vacuum tubes in
<i>parallel</i>, all of the rest of the apparatus being exactly the
same. Connecting the oscillator tubes up in parallel means that the
two filaments are connected across the leads of the storage battery,
the two grids on the same lead that goes to the aerial and the two
plates on the same lead that goes to the positive pole of the
generator. Where two or more oscillator tubes are used only one
storage battery is needed, but each filament must have its own
rheostat. The wiring diagram <i>Fig. 79</i> shows how the two tubes
are connected up in parallel.</p>

<a name="fig079"><img width="600" height="367" src="fig079.png" alt=
"Fig. 79.--200 Mile C.W. Telegraph Transmitter (With Two Tubes in Parallel.)">
</a> 

<p><i>A 500 Mile C. W. Telegraph Transmitter</i>.--For sending to
distances of over 200 miles and up to 500 miles you can use either:
(1) three or four 5 watt oscillator tubes in parallel as described
above, or (2) one 50 watt oscillator tube. Much of the apparatus for a
50 watt tube set is exactly the same as that used for the 5 watt sets.
Some of the parts, however, must be proportionately larger though the
design all the way through remains the same.</p>

<p><i>The Apparatus and Connections</i>.--The aerial series condenser,
the blocking condenser, the grid condenser, the telegraph key, the
chopper, the choke coil in the key circuit, the filament voltmeter and
the protective condenser in the power circuit are identical with those
described for the 5 watt transmitting set.</p>

<p><i>The 50 Watt Vacuum Tube Oscillator</i>.--This is the size of
tube generally used by amateurs for long distance continuous wave
telegraphy. A single tube will develop 2 to 3 amperes in your aerial.
The filament takes a 10 volt current and a plate potential of 1,000
volts is needed. One of these tubes is shown in <i>Fig. 80</i> and the
cost is $30.00. A tube socket to fit it costs $2.50 extra.</p>

<a name="fig080"><img width="560" height="235" src="fig080.png" alt=
"Fig. 80.--50 Watt Oscillator Vacuum Tube."></a> 

<p><i>The Aerial Ammeter</i>.--This should read to 5 amperes and the
cost is $6.25.</p>

<p><i>The Grid Leak Resistance</i>.--It has the same resistance,
namely 5,000 ohms as the one used with the 5 watt tube transmitter,
but it is a little larger. It is listed at $1.65.</p>

<p><i>The Oscillation Choke Coil</i>.--The choke coil in the power
circuit is made of about 260 turns of No. 30 B. &amp; S. cotton
covered magnet wire wound on a spool 2-1/4 inches in diameter and
3-1/4 inches long.</p>

<p><i>The Filament Rheostat</i>.--This is made to take care of a 10
volt current and it costs $10.00.</p>

<p><i>The Filament Storage Battery</i>.--This must develop 12 volts
and one having an output of 40 ampere-hours costs about $25.00.</p>

<p><i>The Protective Condenser</i>.--This condenser has a capacitance
of 1 mfd. and costs $2.00.</p>

<p><i>The Motor-Generator</i>.--Where you use one 50 watt oscillator
tube you will need a motor-generator that develops a plate potential
of 1000 volts and has an output of 200 watts. This machine will stand
you about $100.00.</p>

<p>The different pieces of apparatus for this set are connected up
exactly the same as shown in the wiring diagram in <i>Fig. 78</i>.</p>

<p><i>A 1000 Mile C. W. Telegraph Transmitter</i>.--All of the parts
of this transmitting set are the same as for the 500 mile transmitter
just described except the motor generator and while this develops the
same plate potential, <i>i.e.</i>, 1,000 volts, it must have an output
of 500 watts; it will cost you in the neighborhood of $175.00. For
this long distance transmitter you use two 50 watt oscillator tubes in
parallel and all of the parts are connected together exactly the same
as for the 200 mile transmitter shown in the wiring diagram in <i>Fig.
79</i>.</p>

<h3>CONTINUOUS WAVE TELEGRAPH TRANSMITTING SETS WITH ALTERNATING
CURRENT</h3>

<p>Within the last few years alternating current has largely taken the
place of direct current for light, heat and power purposes in and
around towns and cities and if you have alternating current service in
your home you can install a long distance continuous wave telegraph
transmitter with very little trouble and at a comparatively small
expense.</p>

<p><i>A 100 Mile C. W. Telegraph Transmitting Set</i>.--The principal
pieces of apparatus for this transmitter are the same as those used
for the <i>100 Mile Continuous Wave Telegraph Transmitting Set</i>
described and pictured in the preceding chapter which used direct
current, except that an <i>alternating current power transformer</i>
is employed instead of the more costly <i>motor-generator</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Apparatus Required</i>.--The various pieces of apparatus you
will need for this transmitting set are: (1) one <i>hot-wire
ammeter</i> for the aerial as shown at <i>E</i> in <i>Fig. 75</i>, but
which reads to 5 amperes instead of to 2.5 amperes; (2) one <i>tuning
coil</i> as shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 77</i>; (3) one aerial
condenser as shown at <i>B</i> in <i>Fig. 77</i>; (4) one <i>grid
leak</i> as shown at <i>C</i> in <i>Fig. 77</i>; (5) one <i>telegraph
key</i> as shown at <i>G</i> in <i>Fig. 75</i>; (6) one <i>grid
condenser</i>, made like the aerial condenser but having only two
terminals; (7) one <i>5 watt oscillator tube</i> as shown at <i>E</i>
in <i>Fig. 77</i>; (8) one <i>.002 mfd. 3,000 volt by-pass
condenser</i>, made like the aerial and grid condensers; (9) one pair
of <i>choke coils</i> for the high voltage secondary circuit; (10) one
<i>milli-ammeter</i>; (11) one A. C. <i>power transformer</i>; (12)
one <i>rheostat</i> as shown at <i>I</i> in <i>Fig. 75</i>, and (13)
one <i>panel cut-out</i> as shown at <i>K</i> in <i>Fig. 75</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Choke Coils</i>.--Each of these is made by winding about 100
turns of No. 28, Brown and Sharpe gauge, cotton covered magnet wire on
a spool 2 inches in diameter and 2-1/2 inches long, when it will have
an inductance of about 0.5 <i>millihenry</i> [Footnote: A millihenry
is 1/1000th part of a henry.] at 1,000 cycles.</p>

<p><i>The Milli-ammeter</i>.--This is an alternating current ammeter
and reads from 0 to 250 <i>milli</i>amperes; [Footnote: A
<i>milliampere</i> is the 1/1000th part of an ampere.] and is used for
measuring the secondary current that energizes the plate of the
oscillator tube. It looks like the aerial ammeter and costs about
$7.50.</p>

<p><i>The A. C. Power Transformer</i>.--Differing from the motor
generator set the power transformer has no moving parts. For this
transmitting set you need a transformer that has an input of 325
volts. It is made to work on a 50 to 60 cycle current at 102.5 to 115
volts, which is the range of voltage of the ordinary alternating
lighting current. This adjustment for voltage is made by means of taps
brought out from the primary coil to a rotary switch.</p>

<p>The high voltage secondary coil which energizes the plate has an
output of 175 watts and develops a potential of from 350 to 1,100
volts. The low voltage secondary coil which heats the filament has an
output of 175 watts and develops 7.5 volts. This transformer, which is
shown in <i>Fig. 81</i>, is large enough to take care of from one to
four 5 watt oscillator tubes. It weighs about 15 pounds and sells for
$25.00.</p>

</table>

<p><i>Connecting Up the Apparatus</i>.--The wiring diagram <i>Fig.
82</i> shows clearly how all of the connections are made. It will be
observed that a storage battery is not needed as the secondary coil of
the transformer supplies the current to heat the filament of the
oscillator. The filament voltmeter is connected across the filament
secondary coil terminals, while the plate milli-ammeter is connected
to the mid-taps of the plate secondary coil and the filament secondary
coil.</p>

<p><i>A 200 to 500 Mile C. W. Telegraph Transmitting
Set</i>.--Distances of from 200 to 500 miles can be successfully
covered with a telegraph transmitter using two, three or four 5 watt
oscillator tubes in parallel. The apparatus needed is identical with
that used for the 100 mile transmitter just described. The tubes are
connected in parallel as shown in the wiring diagram in <i>Fig.
83</i>.</p>

<a name="fig083"><img width="600" height="306" src="fig083.png" alt=

</a> 

<p><i>A 500 to 1,000 Mile C. W. Telegraph Transmitting Set</i>.--With
the apparatus described for the above set and a single 50 watt
oscillator tube a distance of upwards of 500 miles can be covered,
while with two 50 watt oscillator tubes in parallel you can cover a
distance of 1,000 miles without difficulty, and nearly 2,000 miles
have been covered with this set.</p>

<p><i>The Apparatus Required</i>.--All of the apparatus for this C. W.
telegraph transmitting set is the same as that described for the 100
and 200 mile sets but you will need: (1) one or two <i>50 watt
oscillator tubes with sockets;</i> (2) one <i>key</i> <i>condenser</i>
that has a capacitance of 1 mfd., and a rated potential of 1,750
volts; (3) one <i>0 to 500 milli-ammeter</i>; (4) one <i>aerial
ammeter</i> reading to 5 amperes, and (5) an <i>A. C. power
transformer</i> for one or two 50 watt tubes.</p>

</table>

<p><i>The Alternating Current Power Transformer</i>.--This power
transformer is made exactly like the one described in connection with
the preceding 100 mile transmitter and pictured in <i>Fig. 81</i>, but
it is considerably larger. Like the smaller one, however, it is made
to work with a 50 to 60 cycle current at 102.5 to 115 volts and,
hence, can be used with any A. C. lighting current.</p>

<p>It has an input of 750 volts and the high voltage secondary coil
which energizes the plate has an output of 450 watts and develops
1,500 to 3,000 volts. The low voltage secondary coil which heats the
filament develops 10.5 volts. This transformer will supply current for
one or two 50-watt oscillator tubes and it costs about $40.00.</p>

<p><i>Connecting Up the Apparatus</i>.--Where a single oscillator tube
is used the parts are connected as shown in <i>Fig. 82</i>, and where
two tubes are connected in parallel the various pieces of apparatus
are wired together as shown in <i>Fig. 83</i>. The only difference
between the 5 watt tube transmitter and the 50 watt tube transmitter
is in the size of the apparatus with one exception; where one or two
50 watt tubes are used a second condenser of large capacitance (1
mfd.) is placed in the grid circuit and the telegraph key is shunted
around it as shown in the diagram <i>Fig. 83</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="chap18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<h3>WIRELESS TELEPHONE TRANSMITTING SETS WITH DIRECT AND ALTERNATING
CURRENTS</h3>

<p>In time past the most difficult of all electrical apparatus for the
amateur to make, install and work was the wireless telephone. This was
because it required a <i>direct current</i> of not less than 500 volts
to set up the sustained oscillations and all ordinary direct current
for lighting purposes is usually generated at a potential of 110
volts.</p>

<p>Now as you know it is easy to <i>step-up</i> a 110 volt alternating
current to any voltage you wish with a power transformer but until
within comparatively recent years an alternating current could not be
used for the production of sustained oscillations for the very good
reason that the state of the art had not advanced that far. In the new
order of things these difficulties have all but vanished and while a
wireless telephone transmitter still requires a high voltage direct
current to operate it this is easily obtained from 110 volt source of
alternating current by means of <i>vacuum tube rectifiers</i>.</p>

<p>The pulsating direct currents are then passed through a filtering
reactance coil, called a <i>reactor</i>, and one or more condensers,
and these smooth them out until they approximate a continuous direct
current. The latter is then made to flow through a vacuum tube
oscillator when it is converted into high frequency oscillations and
these are <i>varied</i>, or <i>modulated</i>, as it is called, by a
<i>microphone transmitter</i> such as is used for ordinary wire
telephony. The energy of these sustained modulated oscillations is
then radiated into space from the aerial in the form of electric
waves.</p>

<p>The distance that can be covered with a wireless telephone
transmitter is about one-fourth as great as that of a wireless
telegraph transmitter having the same input of initial current, but it
is long enough to satisfy the most enthusiastic amateur. For instance
with a wireless telephone transmitter where an amplifier tube is used
to set up the oscillations and which is made for a plate potential of
100 volts, distances up to 10 or 15 miles can be covered.</p>

<p>With a single 5 watt oscillator tube energized by a direct current
of 350 volts from either a motor-generator or from a power transformer
(after it has been rectified and smoothed out) speech and music can be
transmitted to upwards of 25 miles. Where two 5 watt tubes connected
in parallel are used wireless telephone messages can be transmitted to
distances of 40 or 50 miles. Further, a single 50 watt oscillator tube
will send to distances of 50 to 100 miles while two of these tubes in
parallel will send from 100 to 200 miles. Finally, where four or five
oscillator tubes are connected in parallel proportionately greater
distances can be covered.</p>

Volt Direct Lighting Current</i>.--For this very simple, short
distance wireless telephone transmitting set you need the same
apparatus as that described and pictured in the beginning of <a href=
"#chap16">Chapter XVI</a> for a <i>Short Distance C. W. Telegraph
Transmitter</i>, except that you use a <i>microphone transmitter</i>
instead of a <i>telegraph key</i>. If you have a 110 volt direct
lighting current in your home you can put up this short distance set
for very little money and it will be well worth your while to do
so.</p>

<p><i>The Apparatus You Need</i>.--For this set you require: (1) one
<i>tuning coil</i> as shown at <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> in <i>Fig.
75</i>; (2) one <i>aerial ammeter</i> as shown at <i>C</i> in <i>Fig.
75</i>; (3) one <i>aerial condenser</i> as shown at <i>C</i> in
<i>Fig. 75</i>; (4) one <i>grid, blocking and protective condenser</i>
as shown at <i>D</i> in <i>Fig. 75</i>; (5) one <i>grid leak</i> as
shown at <i>C</i> in <i>Fig. 77</i>; (6) one <i>vacuum tube
amplifier</i> which is used as an <i>oscillator</i>; (7) one <i>6 volt
storage battery</i>; (8) one <i>rheostat</i> as shown at <i>I</i> in
<i>Fig. 75</i>; (9) one <i>oscillation choke coil</i>; (10) one
<i>panel cut-out</i> as shown at <i>K</i> in <i>Fig. 75</i> and an
ordinary <i>microphone transmitter</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Microphone Transmitter</i>.--The best kind of a microphone
to use with this and other telephone transmitting sets is a <i>Western
Electric No. 284-W</i>. [Footnote: Made by the Western Electric
Company, Chicago, Ill.] This is known as a solid back transmitter and
is the standard commercial type used on all long distance Bell
telephone lines. It articulates sharply and distinctly and there are
no current variations to distort the wave form of the voice and it
will not buzz or sizzle. It is shown in <i>Fig. 84</i> and costs
$2.00. Any other good microphone transmitter can be used if
desired.</p>

<a name="fig084"><img width="600" height="365" src="fig084.png" alt=
"Fig. 84.--Standard Microphone Transmitter."></a> 

<p><i>Connecting Up the Apparatus</i>.--Begin by connecting the
leading-in wire with one of the terminals of the microphone
transmitter, as shown in the wiring diagram <i>Fig. 85</i>, and the
other terminal of this to one end of the tuning coil. Now connect
<i>clip 1</i> of the tuning coil to one of the posts of the hot-wire
ammeter, the other post of this to one end of aerial condenser and,
finally, the other end of the latter with the water pipe or other
ground. The microphone can be connected in the ground wire and the
ammeter in the aerial wire and the results will be practically the
same.</p>

<a name="fig085"><img width="600" height="526" src="fig085.png" alt=
"Fig. 85.--Wiring Diagram of Short Distance Wireless Telephone Set. (Microphone in Aerial Wire.)">
</a> 

<p>Next connect one end of the grid condenser to the post of the
tuning coil that makes connection with the microphone and the other
end to the grid of the tube, and then shunt the grid leak around the
condenser. Connect the + or <i>positive</i> electrode of the storage
battery with one terminal of the filament of the vacuum tube, the
other terminal of the filament with one post of the rheostat and the
other post of this with the - or <i>negative</i> electrode of the
battery. This done, connect <i>clip 2</i> of the tuning coil to the +
or <i>positive</i> electrode of the battery and bring a lead from it
to one of the switch taps of the panel cut-out.</p>

<p>Now connect <i>clip 3</i> of the tuning coil with one end of the
blocking condenser, the other end of this with one terminal of the
choke coil and the other terminal of the latter with the other switch
tap of the cut-out. Connect the protective condenser across the direct
current feed wires between the panel cut-out and the choke coil.
Finally connect the ends of a lamp cord to the fuse socket taps of the
cut-out, and connect the other ends to a lamp plug and screw it into
the lamp socket of the feed wires. Screw in a pair of 5 ampere <i>fuse
plugs</i>, close the switch and you are ready to tune the transmitter
and talk to your friends.</p>

<p><i>A 25 to 50 Mile Wireless Telephone Transmitter--With Direct
Current Motor Generator</i>.--Where you have to start with 110 or 220
volt direct current and you want to transmit to a distance of 25 miles
or more you will have to install a <i>motor-generator</i>. To make
this transmitter you will need exactly the same apparatus as that
described and pictured for the <i>100 Mile C. W. Telegraph
Transmitting Set</i> in <a href="#chap16">Chapter XVI</a>, except that
you must substitute a <i>microphone transmitter</i> and a <i>telephone
induction coil</i>, or a <i>microphone transformer</i>, or still
better, a <i>magnetic modulator</i>, for the telegraph key and
chopper.</p>

<p><i>The Apparatus You Need</i>.--To reiterate; the pieces of
apparatus you need are: (1) one <i>aerial ammeter</i> as shown at
<i>E</i> in <i>Fig. 75</i>; (2) one <i>tuning coil</i> as shown at
<i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 77</i>; (3) one <i>aerial condenser</i> as shown
at <i>B</i> in <i>Fig. 77</i>; (4) one <i>grid leak</i> as shown at
<i>C</i> in <i>Fig. 77</i>; (5) one <i>grid, blocking</i> and
<i>protective condenser</i>; (6) one <i>5 watt oscillator tube</i> as
shown at <i>E</i> in <i>Fig. 77</i>; (7) one <i>rheostat</i> as shown
at <i>I</i> in <i>Fig. 75</i>; (8) one <i>10 volt (5 cell) storage
battery</i>; (9) one <i>choke coil</i>; (10) one <i>panel cut-out</i>
as shown at <i>K</i> in <i>Fig. 75</i>, and (11) a
<i>motor-generator</i> having an input of 110 or 220 volts and an
output of 350 volts.</p>

<p>In addition to the above apparatus you will need: (12) a
<i>microphone transmitter</i> as shown in <i>Fig. 84</i>; (13) a
battery of four dry cells or a 6 volt storage battery, and either (14)
a <i>telephone induction coil</i> as shown in <i>Fig. 86</i>; (15) a
<i>microphone transformer</i> as shown in <i>Fig. 87</i>; or a
<i>magnetic modulator</i> as shown in <i>Fig. 88</i>. All of these
parts have been described, as said above, in <a href="#chap16">Chapter
XVI</a>, except the microphone modulators.</p>

</a> 

<p><i>The Telephone Induction Coil</i>.--This is a little induction
coil that transforms the 6-volt battery current after it has flowed
through and been modulated by the microphone transmitter into
alternating currents that have a potential of 1,000 volts of more. It
consists of a primary coil of <i>No. 20 B. and S.</i> gauge cotton
covered magnet wire wound on a core of soft iron wires while around
the primary coil is wound a secondary coil of <i>No. 30</i> magnet
wire. Get a <i>standard telephone induction coil</i> that has a
resistance of 500 or 750 ohms and this will cost you a couple of
dollars.</p>

<p><i>The Microphone Transformer</i>.--This device is built on exactly
the same principle as the telephone induction coil just described but
it is more effective because it is designed especially for modulating
the oscillations set up by vacuum tube transmitters. As with the
telephone induction coil, the microphone transmitter is connected in
series with the primary coil and a 6 volt dry or storage battery.</p>

<p>In the better makes of microphone transformer, there is a third
winding, called a <i>side tone</i> coil, to which a headphone can be
connected so that the operator who is speaking into the microphone can
listen-in and so learn if his transmitter is working up to
standard.</p>

<p><i>The Magnetic Modulator</i>.--This is a small closed iron core
transformer of peculiar design and having a primary and a secondary
coil wound on it. This device is used to control the variations of the
oscillating currents that are set up by the oscillator tube. It is
made in three sizes and for the transmitter here described you want
the smallest size, which has an output of 1/2 to 1-1/2 amperes. It
costs about $10.00.</p>

<p><i>How the Apparatus Is Connected Up</i>.--The different pieces of
apparatus are connected together in exactly the same way as the <i>100
Mile C. W. Telegraph Set</i> in <a href="#chap16">Chapter XVI</a>
except that the microphone transmitter and microphone modulator
(whichever kind you use) is substituted for the telegraph key and
chopper.</p>

<p>Now there are three different ways that the microphone and its
modulator can be connected in circuit. Two of the best ways are shown
at <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> in <i>Fig. 89</i>. In the first way the
secondary terminals of the modulator are shunted around the grid leak
in the grid circuit as at <i>A</i>, and in the second the secondary
terminals are connected in the aerial as at <i>B</i>. Where an
induction coil or a microphone transformer is used they are shunted
around a condenser, but this is not necessary with the magnetic
modulator. Where a second tube is used as in <i>Fig. 90</i> then the
microphone and its modulator are connected with the grid circuit and
<i>clip 3</i> of the tuning coil.</p>

</a> 

<p><i>A 50 to 100 Mile Wireless Telephone Transmitter--With Direct
Current Motor Generator</i>.--As the initial source of current
available is taken to be a 110 or 220 volt direct current a
motor-generator having an output of 350 volts must be used as before.
The only difference between this transmitter and the preceding one is
that: (1) two 5 watt tubes are used, the first serving as an
<i>oscillator</i> and the second as a <i>modulator</i>; (2) an
<i>oscillation choke coil</i> is used in the plate circuit; (3) a
<i>reactance coil</i> or <i>reactor</i>, is used in the plate circuit;
and (4) a <i>reactor</i> is used in the grid circuit.</p>

<p><i>The Oscillation Choke Coil</i>.--You can make this choke coil by
winding about 275 turns of <i>No. 28 B. and S. gauge</i> cotton
covered magnet wire on a spool 2 inches in diameter and 4 inches long.
Give it a good coat of shellac varnish and let it dry thoroughly.</p>

<p><i>The Plate and Grid Circuit Reactance Coils</i>.--Where a single
tube is used as an oscillator and a second tube is employed as a
modulator, a <i>reactor</i>, which is a coil of wire wound on an iron
core, is used in the plate circuit to keep the high voltage direct
current of the motor-generator the same at all times. Likewise the
grid circuit reactor is used to keep the voltage of the grid at a
constant value. These reactors are made alike and a picture of one of
them is shown in <i>Fig. 91</i> and each one will cost you $5.75.</p>

<a name="fig091"><img width="511" height="680" src="fig091.png" alt=
"Fig. 91.--Plate and Grid Circuit Reactor."></a> 

<p><i>Connecting up the Apparatus</i>.--All of the different pieces of
apparatus are connected up as shown in <i>Fig. 89</i>. One of the ends
of the secondary of the induction coil, or the microphone transformer,
or the magnetic modulator is connected to the grid circuit and the
other end to <i>clip 3</i> of the tuning coil.</p>

<p><i>A 100 to 200 Mile Wireless Telephone Transmitter--With Direct
Current Motor Generator</i>.--By using the same connections shown in
the wiring diagrams in <i>Fig. 89</i> and a single 50 watt oscillator
tube your transmitter will then have a range of 100 miles or so, while
if you connect up the apparatus as shown in <i>Fig. 90</i> and use two
50 watt tubes you can work up to 200 miles. Much of the apparatus for
a 50 watt oscillator set where either one or two tubes are used is of
the same size and design as that just described for the 5 watt
oscillator sets, but, as in the C. W. telegraph sets, some of the
parts must be proportionately larger. The required parts are (1) the
<i>50 watt tube</i>; (2) the <i>grid leak resistance</i>; (3) the
<i>filament rheostat</i>; (4) the <i>filament storage battery</i>; and
(5) the <i>magnetic modulator</i>. All of these parts, except the
latter, are described in detail under the heading of a <i>500 Mile C.
W. Telegraph Transmitting Set</i> in <a href="#chap16">Chapter
XVI</a>, and are also pictured in that chapter.</p>

<p>It is not advisable to use an induction coil for the modulator for
this set, but use, instead, either a telephone transformer, or better,
a magnetic modulator of the second size which has an output of from
1-1/2 to 3-1/2 amperes. The magnetic modulator is described and
pictured in this chapter.</p>

<p><i>A 50 to 100 Mile Wireless Telephone Transmitting Set--With 110
Volt Alternating Current</i>.--If you have a 110 volt [Footnote:
Alternating current for lighting purposes ranges from 102.5 volts to
115 volts, so we take the median and call it 110 volts.] alternating
current available you can use it for the initial source of energy for
your wireless telephone transmitter. The chief difference between a
wireless telephone transmitting set that uses an alternating current
and one that uses a direct current is that: (1) a <i>power
transformer</i> is used for stepping up the voltage instead of a
motor-generator, and (2) a <i>vacuum tube rectifier</i> must be used
to convert the alternating current into direct current.</p>

<p><i>The Apparatus You Need</i>.--For this telephone transmitting set
you need: (1) one <i>aerial ammeter</i>; (2) one <i>tuning coil</i>;
(3) one <i>telephone modulator</i>; (4) one <i>aerial series
condenser</i>; (5) one <i>4 cell dry battery</i> or a 6 volt storage
battery; (6) one <i>microphone transmitter</i>; (7) one <i>battery
switch</i>; (8) one <i>grid condenser</i>; (9) one <i>grid leak</i>;
(10) two <i>5 watt oscillator tubes with sockets</i>; (11) one
<i>blocking condenser</i>; (12) one <i>oscillation choke coil</i>;
(13) two <i>filter condensers</i>; (14) one <i>filter reactance
coil</i>; (15) an <i>alternating current power transformer</i>, and
(16) two <i>20 watt rectifier vacuum tubes</i>.</p>

<p>All of the above pieces of apparatus are the same as those
described for the <i>100 Mile C. W. Telegraph Transmitter in Chapter
XVII</i>, except: (a) the <i>microphone modulator</i>; (b) the
<i>microphone transmitter</i> and (c) the <i>dry</i> or <i>storage
battery</i>, all of which are described in this chapter; and the new
parts which are: (d) the <i>rectifier vacuum tubes</i>; (e) the
<i>filter condensers</i>; and (f) the <i>filter reactance coil</i>;
further and finally, the power transformer has a <i>third</i>
secondary coil on it and it is this that feeds the alternating current
to the rectifier tubes, which in turn converts it into a pulsating
direct current.</p>

<p><i>The Vacuum Tube Rectifier</i>.--This rectifier has two
electrodes, that is, it has a filament and a plate like the original
vacuum tube detector, The smallest size rectifier tube requires a
plate potential of 550 volts which is developed by one of the
secondary coils of the power transformer. The filament terminal takes
a current of 7.5 volts and this is supplied by another secondary coil
of the transformer. This rectifier tube delivers a direct current of
20 watts at 350 volts. It looks exactly like the 5 watt oscillator
tube which is pictured at <i>E</i> in <i>Fig. 77</i>. The price is
$7.50.</p>

<p><i>The Filter Condensers</i>.--These condensers are used in
connection with the reactance coil to smooth out the pulsating direct
current after it has passed through the rectifier tube. They have a
capacitance of 1 mfd. and will stand 750 volts. These condensers cost
about $2.00 each.</p>

<p><i>The Filter Reactance Coil</i>.--This reactor which is shown in
<i>Fig. 92</i>, has about the same appearance as the power transformer
but it is somewhat smaller. It consists of a coil of wire wound on a
soft iron core and has a large inductance, hence the capacitance of
the filter condensers are proportionately smaller than where a small
inductance is used which has been the general practice. The size you
require for this set has an output of 160 milliamperes and it will
supply current for one to four 5 watt oscillator tubes. This size of
reactor costs $11.50.</p>

<a name="fig092"><img width="560" height="714" src="fig092.png" alt=
"Fig. 92.--Filter Reactor for Smoothing out Rectified Currents."></a> 

<p><i>Connecting Up the Apparatus</i>.--The wiring diagram in <i>Fig.
93</i> shows how the various pieces of apparatus for this telephone
transmitter are connected up. You will observe: (1) that the terminals
of the power transformer secondary coil which develops 10 volts are
connected to the filaments of the oscillator tubes; (2) that the
terminals of the other secondary coil which develops 10 volts are
connected with the filaments of the rectifier tubes; (3) that the
terminals of the third secondary coil which develops 550 volts are
connected with the plates of the rectifier tubes; (4) that the pair of
filter condensers are connected in parallel and these are connected to
the mid-taps of the two filament secondary coils; (5) that the
reactance coil and the third filter condenser are connected together
in series and these are shunted across the filter condensers, which
are in parallel; and, finally, (6) a lead connects the mid-tap of the
550-volt secondary coil of the power transformer with the connection
between the reactor and the third filter condenser.</p>

<p><i>A 100 to 200 Mile Wireless Telephone Transmitting Set--With 110
Volt Alternating Current</i>.--This telephone transmitter is built up
of exactly the same pieces of apparatus and connected up in precisely
the same way as the one just described and shown in <i>Fig.
93</i>.</p>

<p><i>Apparatus Required</i>.--The only differences between this and
the preceding transmitter are: (1) the <i>magnetic modulator</i>, if
you use one, should have an output of 3-1/2 to 5 amperes; (2) you will
need two <i>50 watt oscillator tubes with sockets</i>; (3) two <i>150
watt rectifier tubes with sockets</i>; (4) an <i>aerial ammeter</i>
that reads to <i>5 amperes</i>; (5) three <i>1 mfd. filter
condensers</i> in parallel; (6) <i>two filter condensers of 1 mfd.
capacitance</i> that will stand <i>1750 volts</i>; and (6) a <i>300
milliampere filter reactor</i>.</p>

<p>The apparatus is wired up as shown in <i>Fig. 93</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="chap19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

<h3>THE OPERATION OF VACUUM TUBE TRANSMITTERS</h3>

<p>The three foregoing chapters explained in detail the design and
construction of (1) two kinds of C. W. telegraph transmitters, and (2)
two kinds of wireless telephone transmitters, the difference between
them being whether they used (<i>A</i>) a direct current, or
(<i>B</i>) an alternating current as the initial source of energy. Of
course there are other differences between those of like types as, for
instance, the apparatus and connections used (<i>a</i>) in the key
circuits, and (<i>b</i>) in the microphone circuits. But in all of the
transmitters described of whatever type or kind the same fundamental
device is used for setting up sustained oscillations and this is the
<i>vacuum tube</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Operation of the Vacuum Tube Oscillator</i>.--The operation
of the vacuum tube in producing sustained oscillations depends on (1)
the action of the tube as a valve in setting up the oscillations in
the first place and (2) the action of the grid in amplifying the
oscillations thus set up, both of which we explained in <a href=
"#chap14">Chapter XIV</a>. In that chapter it was also pointed out
that a very small change in the grid potential causes a corresponding
and larger change in the amount of current flowing from the plate to
the filament; and that if a vacuum tube is used for the production of
oscillations the initial source of current must have a high voltage,
in fact the higher the plate voltage the more powerful will be the
oscillations.</p>

<p>To understand how oscillations are set up by a vacuum tube when a
direct current is applied to it, take a look at the simple circuits
shown in <i>Fig. 94</i>. Now when you close the switch the voltage
from the battery charges the condenser and keeps it charged until you
open it again; the instant you do this the condenser discharges
through the circuit which includes it and the inductance coil, and the
discharge of a condenser is always oscillatory.</p>

<a name="fig094ab"><img width="600" height="392" src="fig094ab.png"
alt="(A) and (B) Fig. 94. Operation of Vacuum Tube Oscillators."></a> 

<p>Where an oscillator tube is included in the circuits as shown at
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> in <i>Fig. 94</i>, the grid takes the place of
the switch and any slight change in the voltage of either the grid or
the plate is sufficient to start a train of oscillations going. As
these oscillations surge through the tube the positive parts of them
flow from the plate to the filament and these carry more of the direct
current with them.</p>

<p>To make a tube set up powerful oscillations then, it is only
necessary that an oscillation circuit shall be provided which will
feed part of the oscillations set up by the tube back to the grid
circuit and when this is done the oscillations will keep on being
amplified until the tube reaches the limit of its output.</p>

<a name="fig094c"><img width="484" height="240" src="fig094c.png" alt=
"(C) Fig. 94.--How a Direct Current Sets up Oscillations."></a> 

<p><i>The Operation of C. W. Telegraph Transmitters With Direct
Current--Short Distance C. W. Transmitter</i>.--In the transmitter
shown in the wiring diagram in <i>Fig. 76</i> the positive part of the
110 volt direct current is carried down from the lamp socket through
one side of the panel cut-out, thence through the choke coil and to
the plate of the oscillator tube, when the latter is charged to the
positive sign. The negative part of the 110 volt direct current then
flows down the other wire to the filament so that there is a
difference of potential between the plate and the filament of 110
volts. Now when the 6-volt battery current is switched on the filament
is heated to brilliancy, and the electrons thrown off by it form a
conducting path between it and the plate; the 110 volt current then
flows from the latter to the former.</p>

<p>Now follow the wiring from the plate over to the blocking
condenser, thence to <i>clip 3</i> of the tuning coil, through the
turns of the latter to <i>clip 2</i> and over to the filament and,
when the latter is heated, you have a <i>closed oscillation
circuit</i>. The oscillations surging in the latter set up other and
like oscillations in the tuning coil between the end of which is
connected with the grid, the aerial and the <i>clip 2</i>, and these
surge through the circuit formed by this portion of the coil, the grid
condenser and the filament; this is the amplifying circuit and it
corresponds to the regenerative circuit of a receiving set.</p>

<p>When oscillations are set up in it the grid is alternately charged
to the positive and negative signs. These reversals of voltage set up
stronger and ever stronger oscillations in the plate circuit as before
explained. Not only do the oscillations surge in the closed circuits
but they run to and fro on the aerial wire when their energy is
radiated in the form of electric waves. The oscillations are varied by
means of the telegraph key which is placed in the grid circuit as
shown in <i>Fig. 76</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Operation of the Key Circuit</i>.--The effect in a C. W.
transmitter when a telegraph key is connected in series with a buzzer
and a battery and these are shunted around the condenser in the grid
circuit, is to rapidly change the wave form of the sustained
oscillations, and hence, the length of the waves that are sent out.
While no sound can be heard in the headphones at the receiving station
so long as the points of the key are not in contact, when they are in
contact the oscillations are modulated and sounds are heard in the
headphones that correspond to the frequency of the buzzer in the key
circuit.</p>

<p><i>The Operation of C. W. Telegraph Transmitters with Direct
Current</i>.--The chief differences between the long distance sets
which use a direct current, i.e., those described in <a href=
"#chap16">Chapter XVI</a>, and the short distance transmitting sets
are that the former use: (1) a motor-generator set for changing the
low voltage direct current into high voltage direct current, and (2) a
chopper in the key circuit. The way the motor-generator changes the
low- into high-voltage current has been explained in <a href=
"#chap16">Chapter XVI</a>.</p>

<p>The chopper interrupts the oscillations surging through the grid
circuit at a frequency that the ear can hear, that is to say, about
800 to 1,000 times per second. When the key is open, of course, the
sustained oscillations set up in the circuits will send out continuous
waves but when the key is closed these oscillations are broken up and
then they send out discontinuous waves. If a heterodyne receiving set,
see <a href="#chap15">Chapter XV</a>, is being used at the other end
you can dispense with the chopper and the key circuit needed is very
much simplified. The operation of key circuits of the latter kind will
be described presently.</p>

<p><i>The Operation of C. W. Telegraph Transmitters with Alternating
Current--With a Single Oscillator Tube</i>.--Where an oscillator tube
telegraph transmitter is operated by a 110 volt alternating current as
the initial source of energy, a buzzer, chopper or other interruptor
is not needed in the key circuit. This is because oscillations are set
up only when the plate is energized with the positive part of the
alternating current and this produces an intermittent musical tone in
the headphones. Hence this kind of a sending set is called a <i>tone
transmitter</i>.</p>

<p>Since oscillations are set up only by the positive part or voltage
of an alternating current it is clear that, as a matter of fact, this
kind of a transmitter does not send out continuous waves and therefore
it is not a C. W. transmitter. This is graphically shown by the curve
of the wave form of the alternating current and the oscillations that
are set up by the positive part of it in <i>Fig. 95</i>. Whenever the
positive half of the alternating current energizes the plate then
oscillations are set up by the tube and, conversely, when the negative
half of the current charges the plate no oscillations are
produced.</p>

<a name="fig095"><img width="592" height="240" src="fig095.png" alt=
"Fig. 95.--Positive Voltage only sets up Oscillations."></a> 

<p>You will also observe that the oscillations set up by the positive
part of the current are not of constant amplitude but start at zero
the instant the positive part begins to energize the plate and they
keep on increasing in amplitude as the current rises in voltage until
the latter reaches its maximum; then as it gradually drops again to
zero the oscillations decrease proportionately in amplitude with
it.</p>

<p><i>Heating the Filament with Alternating Current</i>.--Where an
alternating current power transformer is used to develop the necessary
plate voltage a second secondary coil is generally provided for
heating the filament of the oscillation tube. This is better than a
direct current for it adds to the life of the filament. When you use
an alternating current to heat the filament keep it at the same
voltage rather than at the same amperage (current strength). To do
this you need only to use a voltmeter across the filament terminals
instead of an ammeter in series with it; then regulate the voltage of
the filament with a rheostat.</p>

<p><i>The Operation of C. W. Telegraph Transmitters with Alternating
Current--With Two Oscillator Tubes</i>.--By using two oscillator tubes
and connecting them up with the power transformer and oscillating
circuits as shown in the wiring diagram in <i>Fig. 83</i> the plates
are positively energized alternately with every reversal of the
current and, consequently, there is no time period between the ending
of the oscillations set up by one tube and the beginning of the
oscillations set up by the other tube. In other words these
oscillations are sustained but as in the case of those of a single
tube, their amplitude rises and falls. This kind of a set is called a
<i>full wave rectification transmitter</i>.</p>

<p>The waves radiated by this transmitter can be received by either a
crystal detector or a plain vacuum-tube detector but the heterodyne
receptor will give you better results than either of the foregoing
types.</p>

<p><i>The Operation of Wireless Telephone Transmitters with Direct
Current--Short Distance Transmitter</i>.--The operation of this short
distance wireless telephone transmitter, a wiring diagram of which is
shown in <i>Fig. 85</i> is exactly the same as that of the <i>Direct
Current Short Distance C. W. Telegraph Transmitter</i> already
explained in this chapter. The only difference in the operation of
these sets is the substitution of the <i>microphone transmitter</i>
for the telegraph key.</p>

<p><i>The Microphone Transmitter</i>.--The microphone transmitter that
is used to vary, or modulate, the sustained oscillations set up by the
oscillator tube and circuits is shown in <i>Fig. 84</i>. By referring
to the diagram at <i>A</i> in this figure you will readily understand
how it operates. When you speak into the mouthpiece the <i>sound
waves</i>, which are waves in the air, impinge upon the diaphragm and
these set it into vibration--that is, they make it move to and
fro.</p>

<p>When the diaphragm moves toward the back of the transmitter it
forces the carbon granules that are in the cup closer together; this
lowers their resistance and allows more current from the battery to
flow through them; when the pressure of the air waves is removed from
the diaphragm it springs back toward the mouth-piece and the carbon
granules loosen up when the resistance offered by them is increased
and less current can flow through them. Where the oscillation current
in the aerial wire is small the transmitter can be connected directly
in series with the latter when the former will surge through it. As
you speak into the microphone transmitter its resistance is varied and
the current strength of the oscillations is varied accordingly.</p>

<p><i>The Operation of Wireless Telephone Transmitters with Direct
Current--Long Distance Transmitters</i>.--In the wireless telephone
transmitters for long distance work which were shown and described in
the preceding chapter a battery is used to energize the microphone
transmitter, and these two elements are connected in series with a
<i>microphone modulator</i>. This latter device may be either (1) a
<i>telephone induction coil</i>, (2) a <i>microphone transformer</i>,
or (3) a <i>magnetic modulator</i>; the first two of these devices
step-up the voltage of the battery current and the amplified voltage
thus developed is impressed on the oscillations that surge through the
closed oscillation circuit or the aerial wire system according to the
place where you connect it. The third device works on a different
principle and this will be described a little farther along.</p>

<p><i>The Operation of Microphone Modulators--The Induction
Coil</i>.--This device is really a miniature transformer, see <i>A</i>
in <i>Fig. 86</i>, and its purpose is to change the 6 volt direct
current that flows through the microphone into 100 volts alternating
current; in turn, this is impressed on the oscillations that are
surging in either (1) the grid circuit as shown at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig.
89</i>, and in <i>Fig. 90</i>, (2) the aerial wire system, as shown at
<i>B</i> in <i>Fig. 89</i> and <i>Fig. 93</i>. When the current from
the battery flows through the primary coil it magnetizes the soft iron
core and as the microphone varies the strength of the current the high
voltage alternating currents set up in the secondary coil of the
induction coil are likewise varied, when they are impressed upon and
modulate the oscillating currents.</p>

<p><i>The Microphone Transformer</i>.--This is an induction coil that
is designed especially for wireless telephone modulation. The iron
core of this transformer is also of the open magnetic circuit type,
see <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 87</i>, and the <i>ratio</i> of the turns
[Footnote: See Chapter VI] of the primary and the secondary coil is
such that when the secondary current is impressed upon either the grid
circuit or the aerial wire system it controls the oscillations flowing
through it with the greatest efficiency.</p>

<p><i>The Magnetic Modulator</i>.--This piece of apparatus is also
called a <i>magnetic amplifier</i>. The iron core is formed of very
thin plates, or <i>laminations</i> as they are called, and this
permits high-frequency oscillations to surge in a coil wound on it. In
this transformer, see <i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 88</i>, the current flowing
through the microphone varies the magnetic permeability of the soft
iron core by the magnetic saturation of the latter. Since the
microphone current is absolutely distinct from the oscillating
currents surging through the coil of the transformer a very small
direct current flowing through a coil on the latter will vary or
modulate very large oscillating currents surging through the former.
It is shown connected in the aerial wire system at <i>A</i> in <i>Fig.
88</i>, and in <i>Fig. 93</i>.</p>

<p><i>Operation of the Vacuum Tube as a Modulator</i>.--Where a
microphone modulator of the induction coil or microphone transformer
type is connected in the grid circuit or aerial wire system the
modulation is not very effective, but by using a second tube as a
<i>modulator</i>, as shown in <i>Fig. 90</i>, an efficient degree of
modulation can be had. Now there are two methods by which a vacuum
tube can be used as a modulator and these are: (1) by the
<i>absorption</i> of the energy of the current set up by the
oscillator tube, and (2) by <i>varying</i> the direct current that
energizes the plate of the oscillator tube.</p>

<p>The first of these two methods is not used because it absorbs the
energy of the oscillating current produced by the tube and it is
therefore wasteful. The second method is an efficient one, as the
direct current is varied before it passes into the oscillator tube.
This is sufficient reason for describing only the second method. The
voltage of the grid of the modulator tube is varied by the secondary
coil of the induction coil or microphone transformer, above described.
In this way the modulator tube acts like a variable resistance but it
amplifies the variations impressed on the oscillations set up by the
oscillator tube. As the magnetic modulator does the same thing a
vacuum tube used as a modulator is not needed where the former is
employed. For this reason a magnetic modulator is the cheapest in the
long run.</p>

<p><i>The Operation of Wireless Telephone Transmitters with
Alternating Current</i>.--Where an initial alternating current is used
for wireless telephony, the current must be rectified first and then
smoothed out before passing into the oscillator tube to be converted
into oscillations. Further so that the oscillations will be sustained,
two oscillator tubes must be used, and, finally, in order that the
oscillations may not vary in amplitude the alternating current must be
first changed into direct current by a pair of rectifier vacuum tubes,
as shown in <i>Fig. 93.</i> When this is done the plates will be
positively charged alternately with every reversal of the current in
which case there will be no break in the continuity of the
oscillations set up and therefore in the waves that are sent out.</p>

<p><i>The Operation of Rectifier Vacuum Tubes</i>.--The vacuum tube
rectifier is simply a two electrode vacuum tube. The way in which it
changes a commercial alternating current into pulsating direct current
is the same as that in which a two electrode vacuum tube detector
changes an oscillating current into pulsating direct currents and this
has been explained in detail under the heading of <i>The Operation of
a Two Electrode Vacuum Tube Detector</i> in <a href="#chap12">Chapter
XII</a>. In the <i>C. W. Telegraph Transmitting Sets</i> described in
<a href="#chap17">Chapter XVII</a>, the oscillator tubes act as
rectifiers as well as oscillators but for wireless telephony the
alternating current must be rectified first so that a continuous
direct current will result.</p>

<p><i>The Operation of Reactors and Condensers</i>.--A reactor is a
single coil of wire wound on an iron core, see <i>Fig. 90</i> and
<i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 91</i>, and it should preferably have a large
inductance. The reactor for the plate and grid circuit of a wireless
telephone transmitter where one or more tubes are used as modulators
as shown in the wiring diagram in <i>Fig. 90</i>, and the filter
reactor shown in <i>Fig. 92</i>, operate in the same way.</p>

<p>When an alternating current flows through a coil of wire the
reversals of the current set up a <i>counter electromotive force</i>
in it which opposes, that is <i>reacts</i>, on the current, and the
<i>higher</i> the frequency of the current the <i>greater</i> will be
the <i>reactance</i>. When the positive half of an alternating current
is made to flow through a large resistance the current is smoothed out
but at the same time a large amount of its energy is used up in
producing heat.</p>

<p>But when the positive half of an alternating current is made to
flow through a large inductance it acts like a large resistance as
before and likewise smooths out the current, but none of its energy is
wasted in heat and so a coil having a large inductance, which is
called an <i>inductive reactance</i>, or just <i>reactor</i> for
short, is used to smooth out, or filter, the alternating current after
it has been changed into a pulsating direct current by the rectifier
tubes.</p>

<p>A condenser also has a reactance effect on an alternating current
but different from an induction coil the <i>lower</i> the frequency
the <i>greater</i> will be the reactance. For this reason both a
filter reactor and <i>filter condensers</i> are used to smooth out the
pulsating direct currents.</p>

<h3>HOW TO MAKE A RECEIVING SET FOR $5.00 OR LESS</h3>

<p>In the chapters on <i>Receptors</i> you have been told how to build
up high-grade sets. But there are thousands of boys, and, probably,
not a few men, who cannot afford to invest $25.00, more or less, in a
receiving set and would like to experiment in a small way.</p>

<p>The following set is inexpensive, and with this cheap, little
portable receptor you can get the Morse code from stations a hundred
miles distant and messages and music from broadcasting stations if you
do not live too far away from them. All you need for this set are: (1)
a <i>crystal detector</i>, (2) a <i>tuning coil</i> and (3) an
<i>earphone</i>. You can make a crystal detector out of a couple of
binding posts, a bit of galena and a piece of brass wire, or, better,
you can buy one all ready to use for 50 cents.</p>

</table>

<p><i>The Crystal Detector</i>.--This is known as the <i>Rasco
baby</i> detector and it is made and sold by the <i>Radio Specialty
Company</i>, 96 Park Place, New York City. It is shown in <i>Fig.
96</i>. The base is made of black composition and on it is mounted a
standard in which a rod slides and on one end of this there is fixed a
hard rubber adjusting knob while the other end carries a thin piece of
<i>phosphor-bronze wire</i>, called a <i>cat-whisker</i> To secure the
galena crystal in the cup you simply unscrew the knurled cap, place it
in the cavity of the post and screw the cap back on again. The free
end of the cat-whisker wire is then adjusted so that it will rest
lightly on the exposed part of the galena.</p>

<a name="fig096"><img width="600" height="347" src="fig096.png" alt=
"Fig. 96.--Rasco Baby Crystal Detector."></a> 

<p>The <i>Tuning Coil</i>.--You will have to make this tuning coil,
which you can do at a cost of less than $1.00, as the cheapest tuning
coil you can buy costs at least $3.00, and we need the rest of our
$5.00 to invest in the earphone. Get a cardboard tube, such as is used
for mailing purposes, 2 inches in diameter and 3 inches long, see
<i>A</i> in <i>Fig. 97</i>. Now wind on 250 turns of <i>No. 40 Brown
and Sharpe gauge plain enameled magnet wire</i>. You can use <i>No. 40
double cotton covered magnet wire</i>, in which case you will have to
shellac the tube and the wire after you get it on.</p>

<a name="fig097"><img width="600" height="359" src="fig097.png" alt=
"Fig. 97.--How the Tuning Coil is Made."></a> 

<p>As you wind on the wire take off a tap at every 15th turn, that is,
scrape the wire and solder on a piece about 7 inches long, as shown in
<i>Fig. 99</i>; and do this until you have 6 taps taken off. Instead
of leaving the wires outside of the tube bring them to the inside of
it and then out through one of the open ends. Now buy a <i>round
wood-base switch</i> with 7 contact points on it as shown at <i>B</i>
in <i>Fig. 97</i>. This will cost you <i>25</i> or <i>50</i>
cents.</p>

<p><i>The Headphone</i>.--An ordinary Bell telephone receiver is of
small use for wireless work as it is wound to too low a resistance and
the diaphragm is much too thick. If you happen to have a Bell phone
you can rewind it with <i>No. 40</i> single covered silk magnet wire,
or enameled wire of the same size, when its sensitivity will be very
greatly improved. Then you must get a thin diaphragm and this should
<i>not</i> be enameled, as this tends to dampen the vibrations of it.
You can get a diaphragm of the right kind for 5 cents.</p>

<p>The better way, though, is to buy an earphone made especially for
wireless work. You can get one wound to 1000 ohms resistance for $1.75
and this price includes a cord. [Footnote: This is Mesco, No. 470
wireless phone. Sold by the Manhattan Electrical Supply Co., Park
Place, N.Y.C.] For $1.00 extra you can get a head-band for it, and
then your phone will look like the one pictured in <i>Fig. 98</i>.</p>

<a name="fig098"><img width="345" height="360" src="fig098.png" alt=
"Fig. 98.--Mesco 1000 Ohm Head Set."></a> 

<p><i>How to Mount the Parts</i>.--Now mount the coil on a wood base,
1/2 or 1 inch thick, 3-1/2 inches wide and 5-1/2 inches long, and then
connect one end of the coil to one of the end points on the switch,
and connect each succeeding tap to one of the switch points, as shown
schematically in <i>Fig. 99</i> and diagrammatically in <i>Fig.
100</i>. This done, screw the switch down to the base. Finally screw
the detector to the base and screw two binding posts in front of the
coil. These are for the earphone.</p>

"Fig. 100.--Wiring Diagram for $5.00 Receiving Set."></a> 

<p><i>The Condenser</i>.--You do not have to connect a condenser
across the earphone but if you do you will improve the receiving
qualities of the receptor.</p>

<p><i>How to Connect Up the Receptor</i>.--Now connect up all the
parts as shown in <i>Figs. 99</i> and <i>100</i>, then connect the
leading-in wire of the aerial with the lever of the switch; and
connect the free end of the tuning coil with the <i>ground</i>. If you
have no aerial wire try hooking it up to a rain pipe that is <i>not
grounded</i> or the steel frame of an umbrella. For a <i>ground</i>
you can use a water pipe, an iron pipe driven into the ground, or a
hydrant. Put on your headphone, adjust the detector and move the lever
over the switch contacts until it is in adjustment and then, if all
your connections are properly made, you should be able to pick up
messages.</p>

<h3>DEFINITIONS OF ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC UNITS</h3>

<p>The <i>ohm</i> is the resistance of a thread of mercury at the
temperature of melting ice, 14.4521 grams in mass, of uniform
cross-section and a length of 106.300 centimeters.</p>

<p>The <i>ampere</i> is the current which when passed through a
solution of nitrate of silver in water according to certain
specifications, deposits silver at the rate of 0.00111800 of a gram
per second.</p>

<p>The <i>volt</i> is the electromotive force which produces a current
of 1 ampere when steadily applied to a conductor the resistance of
which is 1 ohm.</p>

<p>The <i>coulomb</i> is the quantity of electricity transferred by a
current of 1 ampere in 1 second.</p>

<p>The <i>ampere-hour</i> is the quantity of electricity transferred
by a current of 1 ampere in 1 hour and is, therefore, equal to 3600
coulombs.</p>

<p>The <i>farad</i> is the capacitance of a condenser in which a
potential difference of 1 volt causes it to have a charge of 1 coulomb
of electricity.</p>

<p>The <i>henry</i> is the inductance in a circuit in which the
electromotive force induced is 1 volt when the inducing current varies
at the rate of 1 ampere per second.</p>

<p>The <i>watt</i> is the power spent by a current of 1 ampere in a
resistance of 1 ohm.</p>

<p>The <i>joule</i> is the energy spent in I second by a flow of 1
ampere in 1 ohm.</p>

<p>The <i>horse-power</i> is used in rating steam machinery. It is
equal to 746 watts.</p>

<p>The <i>kilowatt</i> is 1,000 watts.</p>

<p>The units of capacitance actually used in wireless work are the
<i>microfarad</i>, which is the millionth part of a farad, because the
farad is too large a unit; and the <i>C. G. S. electrostatic unit of
capacitance</i>, which is often called the <i>centimeter of
capacitance</i>, which is about equal to 1.11 microfarads.</p>

<p>The units of inductance commonly used in radio work are the
<i>millihenry</i>, which is the thousandth part of a henry; and the
<i>centimeter of inductance</i>, which is one one-thousandth part of a
microhenry.</p>

<p><i>Note</i>.--For further information about electric and magnetic
units get the <i>Bureau of Standards Circular No. 60</i>, called
<i>Electric Units and Standards</i>, the price of which is 15 cents;
also get <i>Scientific Paper No. 292</i>, called <i>International
System of Electric and Magnetic Units</i>, price 10 cents. These and
other informative papers can be had from the <i>Superintendent of
Documents, Government Printing Office</i>, Washington, D. C.</p>

and receive over greater distances to and from one direction than to
and from another.</p>

<p>TUNING.--When the open and closed oscillation circuits of a
transmitter or a receptor are adjusted so that both of the former will
permit electric oscillations to surge through them with the same
frequency, they are said to be tuned. Likewise, when the sending and
receiving stations are adjusted to the same wave length they are said
to be <i>tuned.</i></p>

<ul>
<li><i>Coarse Tuning.--</i>The first adjustment in the tuning
oscillation circuits of a receptor is made with the inductance coil
and this tunes them coarse, or roughly.</li>

<li><i>Fine Tuning.--</i>After the oscillation circuits have been
roughly tuned with the inductance coil the exact adjustment is
obtained with the variable condenser and this is <i>fine
tuning.</i></li>

<li><i>Sharp.--</i>When a sending set will transmit or a receiving set
will receive a wave of given length only it is said to be sharply
tuned. The smaller the decrement the sharper the tuning.</li>

restricted or general amateur license.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> use spark gap electrodes that are too small or they
will get hot.</p>

electrode of a crystal detector.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> try to use a loud speaker with a crystal detector
receiving set.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> expect a loop aerial to give worthwhile results with a
crystal detector.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> handle crystals with your fingers as this destroys
their sensitivity. Use tweezers or a cloth.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> imbed the crystal in solder as the heat destroys its
sensitivity. Use <i>Wood's metal,</i> or some other alloy which melts
at or near the temperature of boiling water.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> forget that strong static and strong signals sometimes
destroy the sensitivity of crystals.</p>

and on the plate when trying it out for the first time.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> fail to use alternating current for heating the
filament where this is possible.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> fail to use a voltmeter to find the proper temperature

detector tube without using a potentiometer.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> connect a potentiometer across the <i>B</i> battery or
it will speedily run down.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> expect to get as good results with a single coil tuner
as you would with a loose coupler.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> expect to get as good results with a two-coil tuner as

static.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> expect to eliminate interference if the amateurs
around you are sending with spark sets.</p>

front of you.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> fail to shield radio frequency amplifiers.</p>

transformers in a line. Set them at right angles to each other.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> use wire smaller than <i>No. 14</i> for connecting up
the various parts.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> fail to adjust the <i>B</i> battery after putting in a
fresh vacuum tube, as its sensitivity depends largely on the
voltage.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> fail to properly space the parts where you use
variometers.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> fail to put a copper shield between the variometer and
the variocoupler.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> fail to keep the leads to the vacuum tube as short as
possible.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> throw your receiving set out of the window if it
<i>howls</i>. Try placing the audio-frequency transformers farther
apart and the cores of them at right angles to each other.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> use condensers with paper dielectrics for an amplifier
receiving set or it will be noisy.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> expect as good results with a loop aerial, or when?

100 volts for the last step where a loud speaker is to be used.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> try to assemble a set if you don't know the difference
between a binding post and a blue print. Buy a set ready to use.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> expect to get Arlington time signals and the big

receiver.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> forget that there are other operators using the ether
besides yourself.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> let your <i>B</i> battery get damp and don't let it
freeze.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> try to recharge your <i>B</i> battery unless it is
constructed for the purpose.</p>

<h3>STORAGE BATTERY DON'TS</h3>

<p><i>Don't</i> connect a source of alternating current direct to your
storage battery. You have to use a rectifier.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> connect the positive lead of the charging circuit with
the negative terminal of your storage battery.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> let the electrolyte get lower than the tops of the
plates of your storage battery.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> fail to look after the condition of your storage
battery once in a while.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> buy a storage battery that gives less than 6 volts for
heating the filament.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> fail to keep the specific gravity of the electrolyte
of your storage battery between 1.225 and 1.300 Baume. This you can do
with a hydrometer.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> fail to recharge your storage battery when the
hydrometer shows that the specific gravity of the electrolyte is close
to 1.225.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> keep charging the battery after the hydrometer shows
that the specific gravity is 1.285.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> let the storage battery freeze.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> let it stand for longer than a month without using
unless you charge it.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> monkey with the storage battery except to add a little
sulphuric acid to the electrolyte from time to time. If anything goes
wrong with it better take it to a service station and let the expert
do it.</p>

<h3>EXTRA DON'TS</h3>

<p><i>Don't</i> think you have an up-to-date transmitting station
unless you are using C.W.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> use a wire from your lightning switch down to the
outside ground that is smaller than No. <i>4</i>.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> try to operate your spark coil with 110-volt direct
lighting current without connecting in a rheostat.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> try to operate your spark coil with 110-volt
alternating lighting current without connecting in an electrolytic
interrupter.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> try to operate an alternating current power
transformer with 110-volt direct current without connecting in an
electrolytic interruptor.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i>--no never--connect one side of the spark gap to the
aerial wire and the other side of the spark gap to the ground. The
Government won't have it--that's all.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> try to tune your transmitter to send out waves of
given length by guesswork. Use a wavemeter.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> use <i>hard fiber</i> for panels. It is a very poor
insulator where high frequency currents are used.</p>

<p><i>Don't</i> think you are the only one who doesn't know all about
wireless. Wireless is a very complex art and there are many things
that those experienced have still to learn.</p>

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM EBOOKS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBook, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm eBooks,
is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart
through the Project Gutenberg Association (the "Project").
Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this eBook
under the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

Please do not use the "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark to market
any commercial products without permission.

To create these eBooks, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works. Despite these efforts, the Project's eBooks and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects". Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other eBook medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.
